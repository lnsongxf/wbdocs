EXAMPLES OF INNOVATIVE APPROACHES ADOPTED BY INCLUSIVE BUSINESSES IN SOUTH ASIA

 Leveraging technology to provide affordable end-to-end TB solutions to underserved patients
 IHS Pakistan is a healthcare focused technology firm that creates technologies for use among underserved
 communities. While its main area of expertise lies in developing and implementing eHealth and mHealth solutions,
 it also provides long-term technical assistance as well as training and institutional capacity building. It specializes
 in solutions that involve mobile-based interfaces for frontline healthcare workers and low-income patients. It has
 in-house domain expertise in building open-source products for TB screening, diagnosis, and compliance. Its TB-
 related solutions have been customized and adapted by clients and partners across 13+ countries in Asia, Africa and
 Latin America.
 Delivering high performance, durable and affordable clean technology solutions to the last mile
 Envirofit India manufactures and distributes clean technology solutions that improve health, livelihoods, and
 environment while enhancing energy efficiency across Asia. Its primary product is a range of cookstoves that have
 been designed using natural draft technology to decrease smoke, toxic emissions, fuel consumption, and the time
 taken to cook. It partners with MFIs and NGOs, as well as large donor programs for distribution and customer
 financing to reach the last-mile. It has positively impacted 2.5 million people across 3 countries in South Asia.
 Engaging local communities to serve farmers and low-income population with a multitude of solutions to improve
 livelihoods
 eKutir India takes a holistic approach to improving the income and quality of life of small farmers by providing them
 with farming advice, inputs, financing, and market linkages. These services are provided through kiosks managed
 by micro-entrepreneurs who leverage technology to provide high quality, locally contextualized services. It also
 manages a rural distribution network that helps corporates and inclusive businesses reach the last-mile with
 affordable services to improve quality of life. It has impacted more than 58,000 farmers and low-income consumers
 across 4 countries.

 22	     An interactive Microsoft Excel-based tool was also developed to make
         the framework more action-oriented. It allowed inclusive businesses
         to use the framework logic overlaid with data from focus countries
         and sectors to understand their internal readiness for replication,
         and also make more informed choices of destination formats and
         countries. Please refer to Corridors for Shared Prosperity: Spotlight on

Funders
As the concept of inclusive business is nascent, it is difficult
to distill the financial sources exclusively available to
these businesses. Although commercial banking activity
is very robust in Nepal with 80 commercial banks, 50 to
60 development banks, and 115 microfinance banks; the
inclusive business landscape is dominated by NGOs that
primarily raise funds from international donor agencies.
Foreign NGOs and charities are restricted from raising
funds from domestic sources.[34] While there are no specific
policies to support inclusive businesses in the country,
some lending policies for small and medium enterprises
(SMEs) can be considered relevant for inclusive businesses
active in impact sectors.

Some of the notable funders include:–

■■ Commercial banks: Nepal Bank Ltd., Rashtriya Banijya
    Bank Ltd., Nabil Bank Ltd., Standard Chartered Bank Nepal
    Ltd.
■■ Donors and DFIs: Department for International
    Development (DFID), World Bank Group, Asian
    Development Bank (ADB), GIZ, FMO, Triodos Bank
■■ Impact funders: Dolma Impact Fund, Tara Management
    Pvt. Ltd., One to Watch.


Enablers
DFIs and donors play a significant role in the development
of inclusive businesses in Nepal. For example, ADB has
developed a technical assistance facility to promote
private sector participation in sectors such as agriculture
and healthcare. The World Bank Group has initiated
several programs such as Project for Agriculture                   Photo credit: Curt Carnemark/World Bank

untenable, as they rely on higher population density
and road access to end-consumers. There is limited or
no last-mile distribution infrastructure, which makes
it more difficult for inclusive businesses. Finally, with a
microfinance penetration that only extends to 31 percent
of the potential market,[37] there are limited consumer
financing models to help low-income households to
purchase essential products and services.

Nepal has a robust commercial banking system and a
large presence of international donors that can distribute
and provide consumer finance. Inclusive businesses have
partnered with these institutions in the place of more
traditional last-mile outreach partners.

BEEJ SHEETAL

 Home country: India.
 Replication Format: Wholly-owned subsidiaries, trade partnerships.
 Replication markets: Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Nepal, Pakistan, Maldives, and Bhutan.

 Beej Sheetal is a JV between Bejo Zaden of the Netherlands and Sheetal Hybrid Seeds of India. It develops and distributes high quality hybrid
 vegetable seeds in India, South Asia, and Africa. It has developed several hybrid varieties of vegetables through in-house R&D facilities spread

                                                      Key challenges in replication
 Ecosystem: Inadequate market data in emerging and frontier economies could lead to wrong estimations of market potential.
 Sector: Competition from well-entrenched Japanese companies and informal players such as cross-seed purchasers has slowed
 down growth.
 Business: Distributors in Bangladesh prefer to deal with Beej Sheetal India rather than the Bangladeshi entity for higher quality
 assurance owing to rampant black market trade in seeds; this has resulted in a slower growth rate for Beej Sheetal.
                                                          Key replication insights
 ■■ Beej Sheetal now relies on a local country head with experience in the seed industry to estimate the demand potential more
    accurately.
 ■■ It relies on its R&D infrastructure to create hybrid vegetables that have untapped market potential.
 ■■ It has built a local team in Bangladesh and, over time, expects to develop customer trust to a degree where there is willingness to
    do more business with the local team rather than the India team.

                                                           Key challenges in replication

      Ecosystem: Poor internet access limits the ability of eKutir kiosks to synchronize the data with its central database.
      Sector: Poor awareness restricts eKutir’s reach, as its value proposition of easily-accessible farming advice and sale of certified
      inputs is more attractive to farmers who are aware of the benefits of better farming practices.
      Business: Difficulty in hiring and retaining micro-entrepreneurs makes last-mile access difficult. Low customer willingness to pay
      for services impact sustainability of the model.

                                                               Key replication insights

      ■■ eKutir selectively replicated in countries where partners were able to validate penetration of internet and
         technology in rural areas.
      ■■ It relied on roadshows and demonstrations organized in partnership with credible organizations and individuals.
      ■■ It also built relationships with local government agencies to win farmer trust.
      ■■ It developed a training curriculum for micro-entrepreneurs and preferred to work with partners with rural networks.
      ■■ It built customer awareness and avoided markets distorted by free farmer services.

 Ecosystem: Regulatory regime for mariculture and aquaculture in Sri Lanka is nascent but with high levels of interest in
 alternative livelihood opportunities. In future, both grants from government and donors, coupled with funding from
 financial institutions, could rapidly grow the cultivation activity.
 Sector: There is low level of customer awareness about the relative merits of using seaweed-based products as fertilizers and
 animal feed, and hence AquAgri has to invest in building market awareness for its product, pushing up costs of operation.
 Business: AquAgri has found it challenging to connect farmers to last-mile financing facilities; in the absence of these micro-
 loans, the pace of farmer onboarding can slow down.

                                                         Key replication insights

 ■■ AquAgri works closely with a local partner who tracks the evolving regulatory scenario and, if needed, can also help it
    engage with relevant government authorities. Currently, however, its contract farmers use the sea free of cost.
 ■■ It has existing corporate tie-ups to source one of its three products, carrageenan, which helped cross-subsidize the costs
    of building market awareness of the fertilizer and animal feed product.
 ■■ It overcame challenges of onboarding farmers by working in collaboration with a Sri Lankan partner who could tap into
    farmer networks. It also financed some of the initial set-up costs using funds raised in India with a matching contribution
    from the local partner.

                                                           Key challenges in replication
     Ecosystem: IHS solutions are primarily mobile-based and hence cannot function efficiently without reliable access to
     telecom networks and electricity (for mobile charging).
     Sector: Clients are often unable to articulate the problem, which in turn can impact quality of the solution developed.
     Also, clients face challenges in using the technology solution and routine troubleshooting, which impacts scalability.
     Business: In some cases, technology solutions have failed because of lack of sustainability. It is challenging to accept
     payments from clients and pay staff in foreign countries. Data cannot be hosted on cloud servers in some geographies.

                                                              Key replication insights
     ■■ IHS builds or adapts each technology solution to work at the lowest level of infrastructural availability in a certain country,
        and often removes real-time updates and shifts to manual uploads in countries with very poor ICT infrastructure.
     ■■ It has created a structured approach that includes double checking partner-submitted problem definitions against its past
        experience to identify gaps and training partner resources to maintain technology and train field staff.
     ■■ It is exploring the possibility of adding revenue models for future projects. It is planning to incorporate a parent entity in
        Dubai for easier international operations.

                                                      Key challenges in replication

 Ecosystem: Integrating MAMA’s offering with the existing healthcare ecosystem and working with multiple different
 governmental and non-governmental partners were key challenges faced.
 Sector: Philanthropic funding for healthcare interventions are largely focused in rural areas, whereas awareness around need for
 urban affordable healthcare is poor. In most rural low-income households, men own the mobile phones, creating challenges in
 reaching women.
 Business: MAMA had to invest in technology and content translation in replication countries, which drove up cost of set-up and
 increased time-to-market.

                                                         Key replication insights

 ■■ MAMA initially funded replication through international donors, and later raised funds from Indian healthcare corporates.
    MAMA focused on urban slums where more women are likely to own and use mobiles phones.
 ■■ It added a six-month gestation period into its replication plans to build the case for maternal and child care in urban slums, and
    then sold the concept to potential funding and implementation partners.
 ■■ It utilized its local partners and field staff to understand the local cultural context and language requirements so that
    investments were channeled wisely. It created customized training manuals/programs for continuous improvement in skillsets
    of its field and managerial staff.

     ■■ VisionSpring replicated in countries where partners had similar mission focus and good distribution channels. It also leverages
        BRAC’s extensive network and distributes glasses across Bangladesh.
     ■■ In addition to cross-subsidizing the cost of eyeglasses to make them affordable, the income generated from the higher margin
        products is used to fund operations in remote areas.
     ■■ It has set clear guidelines and HR processes for career progression and job satisfaction for employees.

                                                   Key challenges in replication

 Ecosystem: Solaric relies on imported solar PV panels in most target countries due to less developed domestic manufacturing
 sectors. This increases cost and requires more stringent quality control.
 Sector: Subsidies to local players, especially not-for-profits and solar substitutes (for example, kerosene), may make it difficult
 for Solaric to charge fair market prices for its products and services. Cheaper power from rapidly expanding public grids in more
 developed countries such as India can make Solaric expensive for the market.
 Business: The absence of relevant partners will impact the viability of Solaric’s replication model since it cannot take on
 distribution and financing in-house. It needs to invest in hiring and retaining staff, which increases cost of operations.

                                                       Key replication insights

 ■■ Solaric prefers to source PV panels from local manufacturers as far as possible and supports suppliers with capacity building
    and advance orders to encourage them to invest in in-country manufacturing.
 ■■ It undertakes policy advocacy to encourage greater customer awareness of solar products. In more developed countries
    such as India, Solaric positions itself as a back-up solution to grid power and competes with its efficient DC system against
    traditional inverters and diesel generators.
 ■■ It only works in countries where it can identify partners with relevant experience and networks for rural outreach. Solaric
    improves its HR systems and processes on a continuous basis to reflect local requirements.

                                                           Key challenges in replication

     Ecosystem: High import duties increase cost of operations for Envirofit as well as its partners; in turn increasing cost of product
     for consumers. Delay in procurement of licenses slows down operations and adds to the cost of doing business.
     Sector: Its target customer base is mostly rural, and it cannot reach them in the absence of distribution and financing partners.
     It was challenging to estimate market potential and partner with the right organizations due to paucity of credible market data.
     Business: Envirofit has to invest in customer-awareness programs. This is challenging because it seeks to run lean operations
     with low upfront investments for business viability. Poor brand recognition in new markets impacts sales as customers are more
     aware of local brands.

                                                               Key replication insights

     ■■ Envirofit selectively works with partners that can finance or subsidize the product for consumers to defray import costs. Envirofit
        relies on relationships with local partners to hasten compliance processes.
     ■■ It has only replicated to countries with significant penetration of MFIs, NBFCs ,or large donor programs that can distribute and
        provide consumer finance. It relies on partners and on field visits by its team to build in-house data on markets.
     ■■ It has shifted to a “train the trainer” model to build the capacities of local partners to implement customer-awareness programs.
        It leverages the brands of well-known local partners for credibility.

                                                          Key replication insights

 ■■ Atom Solar currently relies on funding from ICIMOD to cover its replication expenses, but plans to set up a wholly-owned
    subsidiary. Given Nepal’s fast-changing regulatory landscape for the off-grid sector, it may face some challenges in doing so.
 ■■ Small farmers in Nepal are either unable to afford the cost or are too accustomed to subsidies to be willing to pay market prices.
    Hence, Atom Solar cannot compete in Nepal without subsidizing its products.
 ■■ Lack of local talent has a negative impact on post-sales experience for customers and also hampers growth plans in Nepal.
    Farmers are unwilling to risk investing a significant amount in an unknown brand.

70         Corridors for shared prosperity
WORLD BANK GROUP

The World Bank Group plays a key role in the global effort to end extreme poverty and boost
shared prosperity. It consists of five institutions: the World Bank, including the International Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) and the International Development Association
(IDA); the International Finance Corporation (IFC); the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA); and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
Working together in more than 100 countries, these institutions provide financing, advice, and
other solutions that enable countries to address the most urgent challenges of development.


INTERNATIONAL FINANCE CORPORATION

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is the largest global development institution focused
exclusively on the private sector in developing countries. Established in 1956, IFC is owned
by 184 member countries, a group that collectively determines our policies. Our work allows
companies and financial institutions in emerging markets to create jobs, generate tax revenues,
improve corporate governance and environmental performance, and contribute to their local
communities. IFC’s vision is that people should have the opportunity to escape poverty and
improve their lives.
