Framework and Methodology


Defining Social Safety Net Interventions

The main objective of Social Safety Nets (SSNs) is to protect people from vulnerability
and deprivation (International Labour Organization 2003). SSNs evolved along with the
notion of social protection. In the late 1980s and early 1990s the World Bank and other
international financial institutions promoted SSNs in the context of market-based struc-
tural reform programs as a temporary measure to provide relief to the poor and vulnerable
during structural reforms. In 1993 the 47th Joint World Bank–International Monetary Fund
Development Committee meeting recognized the importance of SSNs for “mitigating
major transitory adverse effects of economic reform on vulnerable groups and to enhance
the political viability of reforms” (IEG 2011, 85). In that context, SSNs were mostly intended
as an emergency measure.
Progressively, the notion of social protection—encom-         basic floor (horizontal dimension) to a more compre-
passing SSNs as a basic element—has evolved from a            hensive social protection system and greater protection
needs-based to a rights-based approach.1 In 2004 the          (vertical dimension), depending on the fiscal space,

  Box 2.1       Models of Intrahousehold Allocation of Resources

   The unitary model (UM) of household decisions assumes that all household members maximize a unique
   utility function (Becker 1965) subject to a single budget constraint and a unique pool of income derived from
   all available sources (Fortin and Lacroix 1997). Intrahousehold dynamics or bargaining processes are therefore
   absent in the UM, and the household behaves as a unique entity.
   Given its theoretical assumptions, the UM implies: (i) Household members pool their income, and the size and

   resources (“income pooling property”) (Attanasio and Lechêne 2002); (ii) Either household members share the
   same preferences or all decisions are taken according to the individual preferences of one household member.
   Nonunitary models (NUMs) have two distinct features: they distinguish individual utility functions of different
   household members, and they include variables that determine the specific weight of each household
   member’s utility function such as personal characteristics, the source of available income, ownership of assets,
   and formal and informal rules and institutions. NUMs account for heterogeneous preferences, incomplete
   pooling of resources, and an intrahousehold bargaining process.
   Most analyses of intrahousehold processes and SSNs focus on the cooperative bargaining model, a subset
   of NUMs. The cooperative model assumes that the man and woman bargain about household outcomes.
   Consumption decisions and allocation of resources to desired outcomes are achieved through a Nash
   bargaining process in which each individual’s “threat point” (or “fallback position”) is his or her utility outside the
   union.
   The cooperative bargaining model is part of the broader category of collective models—models that allow
   different decision makers to have different preferences. Collective models assume only that the household
   allocation is Pareto efficient and do not assume a specific structure of the household allocation process.
   Proponents of these models use the data to derive the sharing rule. Note that the cooperative bargaining model
   is a special type of collective model because it adopts a specific bargaining framework and specifies which
   Pareto efficient solution will be chosen.
   Noncooperative models assume that individuals can have different preferences, do not pool their resources,
   and may not be able to enter into binding contracts—that is, information is not perfect and there is no
   guarantee that contracts will be enforced. In this framework, each partner maximizes his or her utility taking the
   other partner’s actions as given, which may not yield Pareto-optimal outcomes.

           Box 2.2    Defining empowerment

           Empowerment is a complex and elusive concept. There is no universally accepted indicator of empowerment,
           but two definitions are frequently cited in the literature. Kabeer (1999) defines empowerment as “the process
           by which those who have been denied the ability to make strategic life choices acquire such ability.” Alsop,
           Bertelsen, and Holland (2006, 10) describe empowerment as “a group’s or individual’s capacity to make effective
           choices, that is, to make choices and then to transform those choices into desired actions and outcomes.” These
           definitions imply that culture, social norms and, more generally, context can shape and impact empowerment.
           Most scholars agree that empowerment is both a process and an outcome. It is a multidimensional concept
           that cannot be captured by purely quantitative outcome indicators; different dimensions of empowerment
           might require different indicators. Alkire and Ibrahim (2007) provide a list of thirty-two of the many definitions
           of empowerment that have been proposed and of potential indicators. Typical measures of empowerment
           include indicators of access to resources, agency and decision making, fertility, domestic violence, and other
           indicators that can enhance or limit women’s choices. Because of its multidimensional nature, operationalizing
           empowerment is difficult; equating it directly to bargaining power, however, is reductive.

Note: Interventions labeled “SSN System” are part of an operation whose exclusive goal is to strengthen SSN systems. In this case, there is a 1:1 cor-
respondence between the intervention and the project/development policy lending. Interventions aiming to strengthen SSN systems that are part of
an operation including a PW, CCT, UCT, NCP, or food intervention are not accounted for in the category “SSN System,” given that almost all operations
have a component aimed to strengthen SSNs.

SSN Interventions: Results


This chapter presents the results of the systematic review of impact evaluations. To orga-
nize the large amount of evidence selected for this report and to differentiate outcomes
for adults and children, outcomes were grouped into two main categories: those for
women and men and those for girls and boys (table 3.1). These outcomes are the results
of decisions regarding consumption, production, and investments, and the manifestation
of agency and attitudes. Referring to figure 2.1, all outcomes under “Agency and Attitudes”
are for women and men—none are for children. “Consumption/Production/Investment
Decisions” includes mostly outcomes referring to adults (and the household more gener-
ally), but it also includes outcomes for girls and boys (those that involve decisions regard-
ing children).1 The limited evidence on efficiency is presented at the end of this chapter.

  Box 4.1     Gender in the World Bank Group Social Protection and Labor Strategy

   Social inclusion is a core principle of the World Bank Group Social Protection and Labor (SPL) Strategy, 2012–
   22. Gender equality is part of this broader goal: “SPL systems need to be more inclusive, reaching excluded
   groups to ensure their access to SPL, notably among the most vulnerable, the informal, and the disadvantaged
   (including women and disabled…)” (World Bank 2012a, 29). “Despite substantial gains in the coverage of SSNs,
   many poor and vulnerable groups remain uncovered, which often include children, women, ethnic minorities,
   and the disabled” (Ibid., 32).
   The SPL strategy highlights the importance of addressing gender in operations and states that “the World Bank
   will work with countries to ensure that programs adequately address the [social protection and labor] needs of
   both women and men (and girls and boys). In social assistance programs, as relevant to the country context, the
   World Bank will ensure that women have access to the transfers—building on the evidence that increases in the
   relative resources controlled by women commonly translate into a larger share of household resources going to
   family welfare, especially to expenditures on children. In workfare programs, program designs will incorporate
   social norms about gender-appropriate behavior, as well as gender-specific responsibilities with respect to
   household and market work…And World Bank advice on old-age income security schemes will reflect the
   reality that since women live longer than men, they have a greater need for old-age income security, particularly
   during widowhood. Since women in developing countries are more likely than men to work in the informal
   sector, they are also less likely to benefit from formal pension schemes” (Ibid., 35).

      These efforts were motivated by the need to provide                Integrating Gender Considerations into World
      rigorous evidence to World Bank Group operational                  Bank Social Safety Net Projects

      broadly, development outcomes.4 The importance of                  of interest were analyzed to assess gender integration,
      this goal, especially for social protection interventions,         the approaches adopted, and the type of indicators used
      was reflected in the World Bank’s Corporate Scorecard              to measure and monitor results. This section presents
      indicator requiring the Bank to monitor the number of              findings from 112 investment projects. The other 101 are
      women and girls benefiting from social protection and              development policy loans (DPLs) that are more succinct
      other targeted programs. The new strategic directions for          in describing the interventions supported to draw the

      across sectors, including SP.                                      DPLs are reported in box 4.2. A detailed questionnaire
                                                                         was used to assess the gender relevance and integration



           Box 4.2     Gender Considerations in Development Policy Loans

           A thorough analysis of gender considerations in development policy loans (DPLs) is challenging because of the
           lack of detailed information about the interventions supported in this type of operation. Direct beneficiaries
           are not often clearly identified, and consequently gender considerations in these projects are generally absent.
           When mentioned, gender is part of the background discussion in project documents, sometimes as a priority in
           client countries.
           A large number of DPLs identified for this review aim to strengthen SSN systems (45 out of 101) with a focus on
           improving the efficiency (8), effectiveness (6), sustainability (5), and governance (5) of the system. Improving
           the coverage (4) or delivery (4) of social services is sometimes stated as a specific objective of these projects, but
           increasing social inclusion and/or reducing inequality (3) or protecting the poor (2) are seldom stated.
           Only three of fifty-six DPLs supporting any of the interventions of interest refer to gender-expected impacts.
           One cash transfer project in Pakistan, for instance, specifically includes the explicit motivation of promoting
           gender equality and states “The cash transfers…are provided to the female head of eligible families, which
           is expected to increase women’s autonomy and their perception of self and social status within family, as
           suggested by the international evidence from other cash transfer programs or conditional cash transfer
           programs. The empowerment of women in turn may have some positive impacts on children’s human capital”
           (World Bank 2009a). A project in Malawi recognizes that “…in rural Malawi around a quarter of households
           are headed by females, and these households tend to be poorer than male-headed households. Interventions
           such as school conditional cash transfer program currently implemented by the Government of Malawi, with
           support from DPs, has resulted in closing gender gaps in primary education and improved gender parity for the
           higher standards. Therefore, female-headed households, the elderly, child-headed households and the destitute
           would be the main beneficiaries of the social protection interventions supported by this operation” (World Bank
           2012b).
           Seven DPLs supported changes and reforms in contributory pensions systems, especially in Europe and Central
           Asia and Latin America and the Caribbean Regions. But all cases aim at the financial sustainability of the system.
           Reviewing the equity of the pension system, including the gender dimension, is explicitly stated in only two
           cases, and only one had an explicit action associated with it. Note that almost all of the DPLs supporting
           changes in the contributory pension system proposed to increase women’s retirement age as one of the
           vehicles to achieve fiscal sustainability or actuarial balance but without discussing its implications for individual
           groups of beneficiaries.5 Projects also supported increasing the effective retirement age, resulting in changes in
           early retirement policies. This review does not systematically analyze whether these reforms impacted women
           more than men, since projects do not analyze this in Project Appraisal Documents. However, this type of
           reform generally affects certain public occupations in which women tend to be overrepresented (civil servants,
           teachers), so a gender analysis may have been useful to guide these decisions, or at least to understand the
           distributional implications for women.

Box 4.3    Gender in Public Works

 The Ethiopian Productive Safety Net Program (PSNP) and India’s National Rural Employment Guarantee
 Scheme (NREGS) are two large work programs. The PSNP reaches more than 7 million chronically food-
 insecure individuals in rural areas and focuses strongly on reducing poverty of female-headed households and
 encouraging women’s participation in public works (PW) activities, even if it does not include specific targets.
 Households that are not able to supply workers receive transfers of cash or food. NREGS guarantees up to 100
 days of work per year per household, but the household decides how to distribute the 100 days among its
 members. NREGS includes several gender-relevant features to increase female participation: one-third of the
 workers must be women; wages are equal for men and women; childcare facilities for children under age 6
 must be provided at the worksite; and work must be provided locally (within five kilometers of the worker’s
 residence).
 High-quality studies documented a variety of gender issues and impacts of the PSNP, NREGS, and other PW
 programs, but these studies cannot be defined as impact evaluations according to the criteria adopted by
 this report. They generally integrate multiple methods (structural models of labor supply and demand, use of
 administrative and household data, focus group discussions, and other qualitative methods). One study, Dutta
 et al. (2014), relies on a control group, though an atypical one (individual-specific counterfactual questions)—
 to produce a detailed assessment of the programs’ impacts and has the essential characteristics of an impact
 evaluation. Many gender findings on PWs are derived from these studies, which investigated some topics
 not addressed in the impact evaluations reviewed such as costs of participating in PW, rationing, and the
 importance of working conditions to facilitate female participation.
 Using qualitative and quantitative methods (analysis of secondary data and program documents, key
 informant interviews, a household questionnaire, focus group discussions, and life histories) Jones et al.
 (2010) found that PSNP has several benefits for women, especially female household heads. It smoothed food
 consumption patterns, facilitated school enrollment, improved access to credit, and prevented selling assets
 to meet immediate needs. Women reported receiving greater respect within the household. However, because
 involvement in PSNP is on a household basis and payments are given to the household regardless of who does
 the work, the program had little effect in changing decision-making power within male-headed households. In
 polygamous relationships, barriers to participation were found for second and third wives.
 However, the design of PSNP addressed some of the shortcomings of the previous Ethiopian food-for-work
 PW program that limited female participation, as documented by Quisumbing and Yohannes (2004). Main
 constraints to female participation were lack of childcare, type of work offered, and competing household
 responsibilities, but not discrimination against women. The PSNP recognizes that women should be allowed
 more flexibility in working times so they can combine domestic work and care responsibilities. The program
 provides direct support during the late stages of pregnancy and lactation if a household is labor constrained. It
 also provides community daycare to allow women with small children to work.
 Dutta et al. (2014) evaluate the impact of NREGS on poverty in Bihar (one of the poorest Indian states) and
 assess the performance of the program under several profiles. They analyze take-up, rationing, impact on wages,
 costs to take part in the program, knowledge of the program, and supply-side constraints using a variety of
 tools—administrative data, household panel data, qualitative observations from field work, and a randomized
 intervention—to assess the awareness of the potential beneficiaries. On gender, the authors found that the
 program offered employment opportunities to women, especially at the national level (48 percent of NREGS
 employment went to women, and women’s participation in other casual wage work was about 23 percent).
 However, there were large variations across states—women were less likely to take part in the program in
 poorer states because of higher rationing.
 In Bihar, Dutta et al. found that women were less likely than men to demand work, but they were also less likely
 to obtain work when they demanded it. Using an impact evaluation to measure the impact of an information
 campaign, the authors found an important explanation: women were less aware of their rights. They also

            that women were crowded out by men when work was scarce; by contrast, when labor market opportunities for
            men outside the program were good and male wages higher, women were more likely to get employment from
            NREGS. The authors’ qualitative work showed that the perceptions of how women were treated at the worksites
            were positive, equal wage was enforced, and working conditions were generally good for women. Sudarshan
            et al. (2006) argued that differences in female participation across Indian states are explained by differences in
            local economies, specifically differences in market wages and in how males’ wages compare to females’ wages.
            Females living close to worksites and with better access to childcare were more likely to participate, given some
            preexisting restrictions in mobility and available time to paid work.
            Datt and Ravallion (1994) estimated a model of intrahousehold time allocation using more than six years of
            household-level data to assess the net income gains of men and women participating in the Employment
            Guarantee Scheme (EGS) in the state of Maharashtra, India. The authors found that participation in the PW
            program displaced different activities for different genders: unemployment for men, leisure and domestic work
            for women. The authors also found evidence of significant gender cross-effects in time allocation such as men
            taking up more work on their own farm when women joined PWs employment. The authors claim that some of
            what is classified as domestic work by women is actually activity on their own farm.
            This body of evidence has important implications and can provide insights on the role of quotas. One lesson is
            that quotas for women may not work as planned (the one-third quota is not filled in Bihar and in other states) and
            may not be optimal for the household (that is, the household may decide that it is more convenient to send men
            to work under some circumstances). It also clarifies that elements such as poor knowledge of the program may
            be key constraints to female participation; others elements such as provision of childcare and women-friendly
            working conditions can be effective in supporting female participation—probably more than mandated quotas.

Discussion and Conclusions


This report documents the types of gender effects generated by SSNs and the channels
through which these effects are transmitted. A large body of impact evaluation evidence
and ten years of World Bank-supported operations were reviewed to analyze these issues.
