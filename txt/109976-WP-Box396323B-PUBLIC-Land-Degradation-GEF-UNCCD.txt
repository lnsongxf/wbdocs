                   For millennia, humans have enjoyed a close and intrinsic
                   relationship with land. As the biophysical foundation of
                   agriculture, land has been instrumental in helping humans
                   make the transition from hunter-gatherers to food-cultivating
                   societies. Indeed, the quality and fertility of land has frequently
                   been an indicator of economic advance (as in the Nile valley) or
                   regress (as was the case of early civilizations in Mesopotamia,
                   Central America, and elsewhere) .




     I    n 2005, the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)-a global effort involvllig some
1,360 scientists and experts worldwide to gauge the earth's well-being-assessed the consequences
of ecosystem change for human well-being and the scientific basis for actions needed to enhance the
conservation and sustainable use of those systems.

     The ~s findings, aptly titled Living beyond Our Means, are stark. Human activity is putting
such strain on the Earth's natural functions that the ability of the planet's ecosystems to sustain
future generations can no longer be taken for granted. The report warns that "humans have made
unprecedented changes to ecosystems in recent decades to meet growing demands for food, fresh
water, fiber, and energy" and that "pressures on ecosystems will increase globally in coming decades
unless human attitudes and actions change." The report further stresses that among all ecosystems,
drylands are the most endangered.

      Sustainable land management (SLM) is a topic of contemporary significance. Keeping in mind
the severity of the problems facing ecosystems highlighted by the MA, the immediate, overarching
challenge is to sustain the productivity of land and promote prudent use of this globally important
resource.

     Recognizing the immediacy of the challenge, the Global Environment Facility (GEF), in
partnership with the Global Mechanism of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification
(UNCCD), commissioned this study to provide a synoptic overview of funding activities and resource
mobilization relating to land degradation, the GEF's newest focal area.

    The report, a contribution to the United Nations (UN) International Year of Deserts and
Desertification (IYDD) campaign, presents an overview of this area.

      One of the key findings is that land degradation is a threat especially to the poor, and sustainable
land management is the response with a potential to improve income and well-being and to reduce
the loss of environmental services. Improved reporting systems are needed to learn about the scopes
and levels of effort deployed in combating land degradation both at the local level and in global



                                                                                                      •
programs. The costs of land degradation are estimated at around US$ 65 billion annually whereas the
international investments appear to be around US$ 4 billion annually.

     The report recommends high political commitment and mainstreaming of sustainable land
management in national development policy followed by a long-term, multisectoral approach in
broad partnerships to reduce the barriers to sustainable land management.

     The creation of a conducive, enabling environment is essential for combating land degradation.
Sound national policy frameworks, effective and responsive institutions, new knowledge and human,
financial, and technical resources are needed to meet the multifaceted challenges posed by land
degradation.

      The GEF and Global Mechanism are committed to promoting sustainable land management
and offer this report as a contribution to the IYDD campaign and the ongoing debate on strengthening
efforts to protect the global environment.

                                                              Executive Summary


                   The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) confirmed
                   the findings of earlier assessments-that land degradation is
                   a major insidious global problem. It is especially important in
                   the world's drylands, which are home to more than 2 billion
                   of the world's poorest people. Overall, land degradation
                   probably affects more than 2.6 billion people in more than 100
                   countries. The Millennium Development Goals addressing
                   poverty and environment issues, likewise, direct attention to
                   the links between environmental degradation and poverty in
                   the widespread areas where the economy depends directly on
                   the natural resources base.



      L      e costs of land degradation have been variously estimated, but the monetary value of
lost productivity alone is probably around $65 billion annually. Other costs include off-site impacts
of erosion, plus external costs such as food insecurity, increased poverty, and lost environmental
services.

      A growing response to the problem has included a new, integrated focus on reducing poverty
and environmental deterioration in programs of the major multilateral and bilateral donors and on
lifting this topic to a higher level in country priorities. Sustainable land management has become
an important response to land degradation, involving policy, capacity building, and community
involvement, as well as production-oriented and environmental enhancement components.

      The new Operational Program on Sustainable Land Management No. 15 (OP#l 5) in the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) has provided a catalyst for some ofthis new attention, and the Global
Mechanism (GM) of the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) and its Facilitating
Committee have been a focus for new initiatives. The new partnership programs on land degradation
in dryland ecosystems have all brought attention to the size of the problem, the needs of the countries,
and some institutional solutions.

       Although comparable data are hard to find, it appears that international investment in sustainable
land management (SLM) in response to land degradation is at best about $4 billion annually. The
country response to OP#l5 (which has been overwhelming, suggesting a pent-up demand at the
national level) and the growing identification globally ofland degradation as a problem of the poorest
of the poor indicate that significant additional resources of financing, capacity building, and research
still must be invested. Additional investment would need to be scaled up over time, but a total increase
in investment of 10-15 percent annually would be needed over the next few years. This increase
would begin to address removing the barriers to sustainable land management and would provide a
vital contribution to on-the-ground programs to prevent further degradation.



                                                                                                    •   1
This paper presents five main conclusions:
      1. Degradation has a massive impact on the poor, especially the poor in dryland areas. SLM has
         the potential to improve directly their income and well-being as well as providing multiplier
         effects that include an improved local and national economy and a reduction in the loss of
         environmental services.
      2. SLM requires a long-term, multisector approach, integrating technical, policy, and economic
         interventions aimed at reducing barriers to SLM such as lack of markets and services. This
         is facilitated by a collaboration of all levels of government, donor, nongovernmental (NGO),
         and private sector actors.
      3. Current levels of donor and national investments in SLM are an order of magnitude less
         than what the size of the problem would suggest are necessary.
      4. There is a critical need for an improved system of financial reporting of multilateral, bilateral,
         and national investments in UNCCD-related activities.
      5. There is a compelling need to increase basic knowledge management, evaluation, and
         feedback in SLM programs.

                                                                                                       Introduction


                          The United Nations (UN) Assembly has dedicated 2006 as
                          the "International Year of Deserts and Desertification." In this
                          context, the Global Environment Facility ( G EF), in cooperation
                          with the Global Mechanism (GM) of the UN Convention
                          to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), has undertaken this
                          study on resource mobilization 1, including the current status
                          of funding for activities related to combating desertification.




        L         e GEF Council (GEF/C.27/11) has indicated that this study has the following objectives:
        • To contribute to the celebrations of the International Year of Deserts and Desertification
          (IYDD) and clarify the role of the GEF in SLM as an important approach for the
          implementation of the Convention
        • To contribute to the development of national financing strategies for mainstreaming the
          UNCCD/National Action Plan (NAP) into national development frameworks
        • To highlight the specific contribution of the GEF to SLM over the past decade

     This report provides a summary of the extent and impact ofland degradation, the role of the natural
resources base in economic development and poverty alleviation, a brief discussion on sustainable land
management, and a strategy to address land degradation. It will also present the following:
        • The results of a stock-taking analysis of SLM and other UNCCD-related investments made
          by the major multilateral (GEF, WB, UNDP, IFAD, UNEP, ADB, and the GM) and bilateral
          Ga pan, Netherlands, Germany, UK, Denmark, Norway, US, EU) development agencies (in
          later work, the coverage of the analysis will be expanded to reflect all GEF IAs and EAs and
          all bilateral donors)2
        • Based on the above stock-taking analysis, some of the key issues and challenges associated
          with SLM/UNCCD implementation
        • A set of recommended responses, options, and solutions to the above issues, based on the
          experience and evidence gathered by the GEF, the GM, and their partner agencies

     This report also highlights the need to move to more "integration" of the land degradation issue
within national economic development priorities and within donor development and environmental
protection programs. It is intended to serve as a communication and information tool.

                        Land degradation has been recognized as a global problem
                        associated with desertification and loss of biological diversity
                        in arid, semi-arid, and dry subhumid zones (commonly called
                        "drylands"). 3 As recognized by the G EF, "arid and semi-arid
                        lands have suffered some of the worst forms of degradation,
                        because of their fragility and increased pressure from growing
                        and partially sedentarized populations." 4 Land degradation
                        probably affects about 2.6 billion people in more than 100
                        countries and more than 33 percent of the Earth's land
                        surface. 5



      A        round 73 percent of rangelands in drylands are currently being degraded, together
with 4 7 percent of marginal rainfed croplands and a significant percentage of irrigated croplands. 6 In
the low- and middle-income countries, deforestation is a major cause of land degradation, causing an
average annual loss of 99 ,087 . square kilometers (representing an average annual deforestation rate
of 0.3 percent) between 1990 and 2000. Desertification and deforestation also have strongly adverse
environmental impacts globally. Impacts include loss of biodiversity, degradation of watersheds,
increased stream sedimentation, silting of dams and dust storms, reduced climate moderation, and
lowered levels of carbon sequestration.

      The goals of the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD) address
both the environment and developmental aspects of land degradation. They include " ... to involve
long-term integrated strategies that focus simultaneously, in affected areas, on improved productivity
ofland, and the rehabilitation, conservation, and sustainable management ofland and water resources,
leading to improved living conditions, in particular at the community level." A strategy that addresses
this integrated people-and-environment approach is sustainable land management (SLM).

       While there are varying definitions of SLM, this paper uses this one:

       SLM combines technologies, policies, and activities aimed at integrating socioeconomic
       principles with environmental concerns so as to simultaneously maintain or enhance production,

      SLM activities may include 1) land resources management (e.g., rotational systems, pastoral/
range or forest land management practices, land use planning to, for example, protect watersheds,
fragile areas or to develop mixed-use forests), 2) sustainable agricultural practices to improve long-
term productivity, such as soil and water conservation and land quality management, and 3) other
activities such as changes in land tenure systems, administration or policies to remove barriers to
SLM.


Role of SLM in UNCCD Implementation
The UNCCD Convention states the following:
        1. The objective of this Convention is to combat desertification and mitigate the effects of
           drought in countries experiencing serious drought or desertification, particularly in Africa,
           through effective action at all levels, supported by international cooperation and partnership
           arrangements, in the framework of an integrated approach that is consistent with Agenda
           21, with a view to contributing to the achievement of sustainable development in affected
           areas.
       2. Achieving this objective will involve long-term integrated strategies that focus simultaneously,
          in affected areas, on improved productivity of land and on the rehabilitation, conservation,
          and sustainable management of land and water resources, leading to improved living
          conditions, in particular at the community level.

      Thus, right from the beginning, the Convention language directed attention to addressing the
combined well-being of people and the environment. However, the first 10 years of the UNCCD
have seen a modest start to the fulfillment of these important goals. The Joint Inspection Unit,
mandated by the sixth session of the Parties (decision 23/COP.6), identified a number of constraints
that the Convention had to face during its first 10 years of existence.

      The most acute of the findings is the insufficiency of financial resources: "The Inspectors are
of the view that the financial resources made available so far to UNCCD cannot be described as
substantial; neither can they be considered adequate, timely, or predictable.8 It may be that as the
world directs attention to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and begins to deal directly
with poverty issues, now is the time for a new commitment in the context of a well-grounded action
program. The World Summit on Sustainable Development held inJohannesburg in 2002 labeled the
UNCCD as an important tool for poverty eradication. The ensuing Conference of the Parties, as well
as the sessions of the UN General Assembly, went further to urge development partners to use the
Convention as a tool to reach the MDGs, as they relate to poverty and hunger, essentially forming a
platform for concerted international response to SLM.

6 •     Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding ofActivities Related to Land Degradation
      In some initial responses, programs tended to be focused on physical environment issues and less
on policy and integrated approaches. But as the National Action Plan (NAP) process got underway,
the GM provided support and advice, and as the Committee for the Review of the Implementation
of the Convention (CRIC) evolved, many countries and agencies began to embrace conceptually the
core of the Convention thinking.

      This became institutionalized with the development of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper
(PRSP) process in the World Bank, with 70 NAPs supported by UNCCD and the GM, and with the
initiation of the Land Degradation focal area by the GEF and its designation as a funding mechanism
for the UNCCD. With these changes, a focus on sustainable land management became natural
and logical. Sustainable land management can integrate the objectives of the PRSP, the NAP, and
UNCCD.


Socioeconomic and Cultural Importance
Drylands are now inhabited by more than two billion (2 .03 8 billion) people, 37 percent of the world's
total population. 9 Asia, Africa, and South America have the larger population living in drylands, both
in numbers and percentage: 1.4 billion, 268 million, and 87 million people, or 42, 41, and 30 percent
of each region's population, respectively.10 The drylands are the home of the world's poorest and
the world's most marginalized populations-economically and geographically. The number of poor
rural people living in drylands is estimated to be near 1 billion.11 In the long history of adaptation
to harsh conditions, dryland communities have gained unique knowledge in resource utilization
and management. This local or indigenous knowledge is now recognized as having significant value
to dryland development; yet, there are also varying perceptions as to the importance and value of
drylands (see box 1).

      Scenarios developed by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA) show that, if unchecked,
desertification and degradation of ecosystem services will threaten future improvements in human
well-being and possibly reverse gains in some regions.12 Therefore, desertification ranks among the
greatest environmental challenges today and is a major impediment to meeting basic human needs
in drylands.

     With regard to the ecosystems that are in most need of additional attention from the international
community, it is clear from the MA that land degradation is one of its major environmental and
development challenges. It is also clear that land degradation in drylands is of particular concern.
Nations with vast areas of drylands and with a high number of people living in the drylands-such as
Ethiopia, Kenya, and the West African Sahelian countries-tend to be at the bottom of the United

  Summary of Importance and Challenges
  of the World's Drylands
  Drylands are critically important. They:
        • Occupy 47 percent of the global land area (excluding Greenland and Antarctica), including the African Sahel,
            Australian Outback, South American Patagonia, and North American Great Plains.
        • Support more than 2 billion people, or nearly 40 percent of the world's population.
         • Consist of many land cover types, including shrubs, forest, cropland, and urbanized areas.
         • Produce forage for livestock, which in turn supports human livelihoods with meat, dairy products, and clothing
            materials such as wool and leather.
         • Originated many staple food crops, such as wheat, barley, sorghum, and millet.
         • Serve as sources of genetic plant material for developing drought-resistant crop varieties.
         • Provide habitat for species uniquely adapted to variable and extreme environments.
         • Store large amounts of carbon, most of it in the soil rather than in vegetation.

  Yet, drylands are at the root of many misconceptions: many see drylands as:
         • Empty, barren, and unproductive places where people are unable to survive.
         • Unable to support plant and animal life.
         • Degraded beyond restoration because of misuse and overuse from human activity.
          • Always dry, with drought the main hardship to survival.
          • Low priority for attention.

          Extent of Land Degradation and Desertification


                         .It has been estimated that around 73 percent of rangelands in
                          drylands are currently being degraded_, together with 4 7 percent
                          of marginal rainfed croplands and a significant percentage
                          of irrigated croplands. 13 The lost production resulting from
                          erosion alone has been estimated to be around 0. 5 percent
                          annually in Africa and Asia. 14 The impact of this degradation
                          on productivity and other services is examined in this paper in
                          three categories:
                               • The economic impact of reduced productivity
                               • The social cost in food security and poverty
                               • The loss of environmental services at the global to local
                                 levels

Economic Cost


      T .e economic cost of degradation, though difficult to estimate, is undoubtedly large. The
cost of reduced agricultural production in developing countries has been estimated to range between
1 and 7 percent of Agricultur~l Domestic Product (ADP) in selected developing countries.15 A paper
reviewing studies in Africa concluded that between 1 and 9 percent of agricultural (cropping) gross
domestic product (GDP) was lost in these countries annually.16 These ranges reflect the varying rates
of degradation between countries and the lack of a consensus on how to measure the cost of land
degradation. Assuming that low- and middle-income countries are experiencing from 1 to 9 percent
loss of agricultural productivity, the annual cost to these countries would be in the order of $10 billion
to $89 billion. The annual loss globally would sum to between $13 billion and $116 billion.

      However, the actual financial cost of lost productivity resulting from land degradation is
difficult to calculate, and there is no commonly accepted method. The typical approach has been
to estimate costs in reduced production or in costs to restore land and replace nutrients lost in the
land degradation process (for example, erosion, degradation of soil structure, loss of biodiversity,
salinization, water logging, and loss of fertility). These costs are in turn most accurately calculated in
cases where the ownership of the land is very well defined and costs of capital over specific periods
can be taken into consideration. This is not the case in most developing countries, and few estimates

have been made of the cost borne by developing countries. A widely cited (although dated) analysis by
Dregne and Chou provides a rough estimate of global annual income lost because of degradation of
rangelands at $2 3 billion, loss in irrigated land at $11 billion, and loss in rainfed cropland at $8 billion
in 1990 U.S. dollars.1 7 An inflation-adjusted estimate would be approximately $3 5 billion lost from
rangeland productivity, $12 billion from rainfed agriculture, and $17 billion from irrigated lands, or
a total annual cost of $64 billion.1 8

      Land degradation to date has had significant impacts on the productivity or quality of cropland
in some areas, but not in others. This is also the conclusion arrived at by Scherr,19 who stated that
major productivity declines caused by land degradation have resulted in parts of Africa, Latin America,
and Asia, with hot spots in degradation-prone soils in Sub-Saharan Africa, in inadequately managed
irrigation schemes in South Asia, and through rapidly intensified production pursued without the
technology or the economic incentives for good land husbandry. That study also concludes that
large land areas-5 million to 7 million hectares per year-have gone out of production because of
land degradation. The local impact of land degradation can also often be devastating because poor
people depending directly on land for their daily livelihood are severely hit by land degradation. (The
link between food security and land degradation is a case in point and is discussed elsewhere in this
report.)

      To assess the economic impact of land degradation and to define an approach on how to finance
remedial actions, it is necessary to go beyond the farm level and look at the off-site effects, the external
consequences (externalities) ofland degradation, and the long-term consequences (generational) of
ignoring the phenomenon. It is a question of assessing the costs, both in space and in time. Very little
has been done on these issues, but there is sufficient knowledge to be able to outline the type of policy
and financial support that will be required to remedy the situation. Some analyses have been made of
the costs of ecosystem destruction on environmental services. These show net present value (NPV)
losses of 20-90 percent.20

      On-farm investments such as earthwork, fencing, and application of fertilizer should in principle
be born by the farmer, but this is only likely to happen if the farmer has appropriate information, a
dependable market, secure land tenure, and can justify long-term investments of labor and capital. It
also requires access to credit and inputs at affordable prices. The capital needed for such investments
is in principle private sector-related even though government guaranteed schemes and government-
supported low-interest loans have often had an important impact during the starting-up phase. Off-
farm investments required to support the process will often have to be borne by the public sector
and could include such things as an upgrading of the agricultural extension and veterinary service,
development of marketing and transport infrastructure, and targeted payment for better land
husbandry to protect public investments (for example, in hydro power and water supply). In some
cases, it will also be possible to facilitate contracts between private beneficiaries and land managers.

10 •    Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding of Activities Related to Land Degradation
     The data available on what is currently invested in sustainable land management or in combating
land degradation are very incomplete. This is particularly the case with regard to governments' own
investments in the type of support measures referred to above. It is therefore difficult to provide an
estimate as to how much it would be advisable and realistic to increase current levels of investments,
both by the international community and by governments. However, judging from the increased
attention, over the past five years or so, that the World Bank has given to agriculture and rural
development and that the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) has given to
projects addressing land degradation, it might be realistic to recommend that an annual increase
of 5 to 15 percent above current levels of investment of the international community would be a
reasonable target.


Food Security
Land degradation may not pose a direct threat to global food production, but it is a serious threat
to food security, rural incomes, and rural livelihoods in many parts of the world. The food gap (the
difference between what is produced and what is needed to maintain minimal per capita consumption
needs) is widening in 66 low-income developing countries, most in Africa. This is occurring as food
needs are increasing as fast as or faster than food production increases because of population growth,
lower rates of new land being put into production, and declining yields (Appendixes 1 and 2). Almost
all rural households purchase food, so the relationship between production and food security includes
wider issues of poverty such as the distribution of land, availability of nonfarm income, the availability
of communal natural resources, and economic returns to agriculture. Indeed, studies have recently
documented the close dependence of the poor, especially the poorest of the poor, on natural resources
(Appendix 3).21 The World Bank estimates that 90 percent of the world's 1.1 billion poor (those living
on less than one dollar a day) <lepend on forests for part of their income.22

     The cost of land degradation in food security is articulated in a United States Department of
Agriculture (USDA) report that emphasizes that in Africa there will be an increase in malnourished
people by 15 percent this decade.23 It concluded that land degradation has the greatest impact on
food security in Africa. Similarly, a recent report by Henao and Baanante points out that Sub-Saharan
Africa was forced to import 19 million tons of cereals at a cost of $3.8 billion in 2003.24 By 2020,
imports are expected to rise to 34 million tons at a cost of $8.4 billion in 2003 dollar value.


Land Degradation and Poverty
Land degradation is often closely related to poverty and to food insecurity. Rural regions or households
with high poverty levels often overlap with those suffering from food insecurity and low and declining

agricultural productivity. The close relationship between poverty and land degradation can be the
result of several factors:25
         • Poor people tend to be farming in marginal areas with low productivity ("marginal people on
           marginal lands"). These lands are often semi-arid areas, with steep slopes and poor soils, and/
           or are relatively isolated from roads, markets, or population centers.
         • A household's or group's availability of labor, land, livestock, and nonfarm income is often
           closely associated with the level of soil management, particularly the application of manure
           but also chemical fertilizers and soil conservation measures. These management factors,
           themselves, are closely associated with changes in land productivity.
         • The variability between households in land management and declining productivity is
           frequently correlated with the gender of the acting head of household. In farms with low and
           declining productivity, husbands often leave to seek employment elsewhere and leave the wife
           behind; usually, she is then even less able to invest in land management because of poverty
           and social disparities.
         • In regions in which the agricultural sector is not profitable or where other problems such
           as insecurity affect the local economy, farmers invest significantly fewer labor or capital
           resources in their land, and the effects are reflected in lower productivity and worsening soil
           degradation. The effects of the AIDS pandemic, particularly in Africa, have further aggravated
           the situation for many households.


Environmental
The severity and impact of land degradation on the wider environment is estimated to be large at
both the local and the global levels. A brief summary follows of what is known about the current rates
of degradation and the linkages of land degradation to rangeland, forest, and cropping systems.

Rangeland
Despite the uncertainties in quantification,26 the amount of rangeland that is degraded is probably
the largest extent of all degraded land globally.27 The Global Assessment of (Human-Induced) Soil
Degradation (GLASOD) study concluded that most countries had more than 50 percent of their
rangelands degraded, with many countries in tropical areas having up to 90 percent of their rangelands
degraded.28

      Analyses using remote sensing data and groundwork have found that degradation is often severe
in localized areas (that is, around bore holes) because of a concentration of people or livestock or a
conversion of land use, but rangeland productivity has generally rarely worsened over a large area for

2s   l Olson et al., Spatial Patterns of Land Use Change in East Africa, LUCID Working Paper 47 (Nairobi: International Livestock
     Research Institute, 2004).
26   The amount of degraded rangeland has been difficult to quantify, compared with deforestation or productivity loss in cropping
     systems. This is the result of the lack of a consensus of the definition of rangeland degradation or how to measure it, and the
     difficulty of using remotely sensed data to identify changes in sparsely vegetated areas. Two current efforts to assess rangeland
     degradation include the Land Degradation Assessment in Drylands (LADA) project and the U.S. Department of Agriculture's
     Natural Resources and Sustainable Agricultural Systems project (Pers. Comm. Mark Weltz, National Program Leader, Natural
     Resources and Sustainable Agricultural Systems, USDA/ARS).

an extended period of time. In the Sahel, however, a recent study of changing rangeland vegetation,
using satellite imagery and controlling out the effect of rainfall, concluded that since the 1980s there
has been anthropogenic degradation of the rangelands, except for areas that have received intensive
technical inputs. This has implications for forage productivity and for the impact of drought on the
local population.29 The extent of degraded rangeland globally has recently been estimated at about 12
percent over the past 40 years and worsening at approximately 0.3 percent annually.JO

      Rangeland degradation is commonly blamed on overgrazing and removal of woody biomass for
fuelwood. These can be associated with the concentration of people and livestock following expansion
of rainfed cropping into grazing areas, an increase in livestock numbers, or the sedentarization of
pastoralists. In Ethiopia, for example, there are 67 million head of camel, cattle, sheep, and goats,
which is more than the human population of 62 million.31 The numbers of livestock have increased
30 percent since 1993, approximately the same rate as that of the human population, illustrating
not only the importance of livestock in the rural economy but also the critical nature of developing
proactive sustainable land management programs.

      Environmental conditions associated with rangeland degradation include reduction of plant
cover, especially woody vegetation and palatable species, invasion by shrubs of low grazing value, and
soil compaction and erosion. Rangeland ecosystems may be more resilient than formerly assumed.
Many ecological analyses have concluded that rangeland vegetation follows a nonequilibrium path
because of inherently highly variable climate and stocking conditions, and it can recover from
temporary pressures given the right weather and land management conditions. "What is uncertain
are to what extent the recovery process leads to the original plant species composition and how this
may affect forage quality. Climate change, particularly temperature increases, may be already placing
additional stress on rangeland vegetation and soils.


Forest
The tropical humid forest ecosystem is much more vulnerable to long-term damage to its soil and
biodiversity following the removal of vegetative cover than rangeland ecosystems are. Although
deforestation is usually thought of as the loss of humid tropical forest, the conversion of woodlands
in drier zones to pasture or cropland may be as extensive, if not more so, because woodlands are less
likely to be under protected status.

      Deforestation can be driven by a search for land to cultivate crops or to graze livestock or driven
by an international market for high-value timber. Once converted to pasture or crops, however,
productivity rapidly declines and remains low if the forest is not allowed to regenerate or if the land is
not well managed. The negative effects of deforestation are often observed at the local level because
of this low productivity and at the regional or global levels because of biodiversity loss and reduction
of ecosystem services such as climate moderation and watershed conservation. The rate of forest loss
is particularly worrisome because of the often-irreversible impact on biodiversity.

      Deforestation is relatively easy to estimate from satellite images. Average annual rates
of deforestation vary widely by country. Some of the highest annual rates of forest loss between
1990 and 2000 occurred in Burundi (9 percent), Haiti (5. 7 percent), Cote d'Ivoire (3 .1 percent),
and Indonesia and Malaysia (1.2 percent).3 2 The estimate for Brazil for that decade is 0.4 percent,
but its deforestation rate has historically rapidly risen or fallen with changes in policy. The average
annual deforestation rate was very high between 1990 and 2000 in Brazil (0.4 percent or 23,093
square kilometers), Indonesia (1.2 percent or 13,124 square kilometers), Mexico (1.1 percent or 6,306
square kilometers), Sudan (1.4 percent or 9,589 square kilometers), and Zambia (2.4 percent or 8,509
square kilometers). In the low- and middle-income countries, deforestation is a major cause ofland
degradation, causing an average annual loss of 99,087 square kilometers (representing an average
annual deforestation rate of 0.3 percent) between 1990 and 2000.


Cropping Systems
Production losses in cropping systems are directly related to deteriorating soil conditions such as
declines in organic matter, nutrient losses, soil structure following erosion, removal of vegetative
cover, nutrient mining, and other processes that are greatly affected by land management practices.
Although field-level soil management techniques are more easily understood and measured,
landscape and higher-level land management practices are being increasingly recognized as critical
to (a) understanding the socioeconomic root causes of land degradation-inducing practices and (b)
developing sustainable and effective prevention and mitigation programs.
      The impact of land degradation on cropping systems is outlined because it has perhaps the
most direct impact on rural populations. In sum, our best estimate is that agricultural production in
developing countries is lowered by 3-7 percent annually because of the impact of land degradation
on cropping systems. The losses are proportionately greater in irrigated areas, where salinization has
led to land abandonment in highly productive areas.
     Irrigated land can be among the most productive, but its productivity can be substantially reduced
through salinization. Salinization is a major issue in Asia. In India, 48 percent of soils experienced
more than 3 3 percent productivity loss; in China, losses caused by waterlogging and salinization are
estimated at 25 percent; and in Pakistan, salinization is regarded as the most serious environmental
problem in relation to crop productivity.
      At the regional level, Africa's agriculture has fallen behind that of other regions of the world as
measured by trends in cereal yields (Appendix 2). The stagnation of yields in Africa is probably the
result of a combination of relatively slow growth in the use of pesticides, fertilizers, irrigation, and
high-yielding cultivars; land degradation; and the fact that the new land being put into production by
the growing population is less productive than the land that was already being cultivated.
     The need to maintain productivity is of critical importance elsewhere, as well. Fifty-seven
developing countries have only 1 million to 10 million hectares of cropland, and land pressure is
already high (0.16 to 0.30 hectare per person) or very high (under 0.15 hectare per person) in half of
these countries. Conserving farmland quality must necessarily be a strategic long-term food security
concern.33

14 •       Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding ofActivities Related to Land Degradation
      Worldwide, the rate of increase in yields is slowing while population continues to rise, leading to
a leveling off of food production per capita in many regions and globally (Appendixes 1 and 2). The
reasons for the slowing of yield increases globally could be (a) that the land available to be put under
new cultivation is less productive and more prone to land degradation than previously cultivated
land and (b) that water is a limiting resource for expansion of irrigation. Another factor could be
diminishing returns to fertilizer application, implying that further applications may not be effective
at increasing yields.34 The diminishing returns of fertilizer may be the result of inherent limitations
of current crop cultivars. Thus, the critical importance of preventing and mitigating land degradation
for maintaining adequate food production levels cannot be overemphasized.


Cost and Benefits of Investing in SLM
This section does not attempt a rigorous cost-benefit analysis because the data are not readily available;
rather, it provides a sample of case studies of projects that have provided sound cost-benefit analysis.
(This database is in obvious need of expansion.)

      Investment in land productivity is a vital engine in development. The rural development strategy
documented for the World Bank (2005), for example, shows that for the 35 developing countries in
the analysis, a 1 percent increase in agricultural GDP led to a 1.6 percent gain in the per capita income
of the poorest fifth of the population. A 10 percent increase in crop yields led to a reduction of 6-10
percent of people living on less than US$1 per day. Thus, if land degradation is allowed to continue,
major opportunities for the creation of new wealth and the reduction of poverty will be passed by.

      The benefits of a productive, sustainable rural sector are multiple. Food production issues are
as critical as social and civil issues such as investment in education and reducing out-migration and
conflict over grazing resources. On-site and off-site environmental services sustainability is also
crucial. The costs and benefits of these nonmonetary factors need to be combined with more easily
quantifiable production issues as part of a true cost-benefit analysis.

      There are, however, few examples of robust cost-benefit analyses of integrated, institutional
SLM projects and programs. Those that are documented tend to be success stories or calculated by
the implementing institution.35 Scientific studies,36 as well as governmental reports (such as from
Conference of the Parties [COP] 7), stress that further research is necessary to provide a broader,
long-term perspective of costs and benefits of investing in SLM and the price of inaction at the farm
level to the national level.

      The following case studies, however, provide examples of the type of SLM programs that have
led to positive returns of investments:
             (a) The Keita Valley Integrated Rural Development Project in Niger (1984--99; $65 million)
                 rehabilitated 20,000 hectares of degraded lands through a wide range of interventions. Trees
                 were planted, sand dunes were fixed, stream banks were stabilized, dams and wells were
                 built, farmers were trained, credit was extended, schools were upgraded, and health clinics
                 established. The payoff may justify the project cost over the long term, because its results
                 increased incomes in the area by an estimated $6 million annually.37
             (b) In eastern Morocco, rehabilitation of severely degraded rangelands during the 1990s was
                 achieved by establishing clan-based cooperatives encompassing 8,250 herders over an area of
                 3 million hectares. They were provided with 30 kilograms of barley per year as compensation
                 for setting aside 450,000 hectares for recuperation for two years. The set-aside vegetation
                 recovered, and its productivity jumped from 15 0 kilograms/hectare to 800 kilograms/hectare
                 of dry matter per year, a gain worth 50 percent more than the cost of the set-aside. Controlled
                 rotational grazing now generates enough benefits that the herders pay grazing fees to their
                 cooperatives.38
             (c) In China, the objective of the Second Loess Plateau Watershed Rehabilitation Project (1999-
                 2004; US$150 million) was to achieve sustainable development by increasing agricultural
                 production and incomes and by improving ecological conditions in the Yellow River
                 watershed.39 Key elements included (a) the construction of terraces to create high-yielding
                 farmland on slopes of less than 20 degrees, replacing cropping on eroded slopelands; (b) the
                 protection of slopelands from grazing and planting them with income-earning trees, shrubs,
                 and grasses; and (c) other income-generating farming activities, including stall-fed livestock,
                 dairy cattle, and irrigated agricultural production.

     The project has substantially raised agricultural productivity, increased and diversified farm
incomes, improved the environment, and created conditions for soil and water conservation. From
1999 to 2004, the average annual per capita income of project households increased from renminbi
(RMB)783 to RMBl,624, compared with an income increase from RMB794 to RMBl,318 in the
adjacent nonproject areas. Average annual project per capita grain production increased from 365
kilograms to 591 kilograms, compared with an increase from 397 kilograms to 504 kilograms in the
nonproject areas.

      The accumulated sediment retention caused by the project has reached an estimated total of 53.4
million tons. Tree, grass, and shrub planting increased vegetation cover from 17.3 percent to 33.5
percent. A grazing ban dramatically changed the landscape of the entire region. Realizing the success
of the project's grazing ban, political leadership responded by adopting a grazing ban throughout

in the Loess Plateau than ever before.

     The Loess Watershed project investment has an overall economic rate of return of 21 percent,
with the livestock component having the highest, at 2 7 percent.
         (d) The Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA)40 gives two examples from developing
             countries, in which it compares the NPV of an intact ecosystem with the NPV of that same
             ecosystem converted into a different use. One example is from a mangrove ecosystem in
             Thailand, in which the NPV of shrimp farming is about 20 percent of the value of the
             intact ecosystem. With regard to a tropical forest in Cambodia, the difference is even more
             striking, with the NPV of the converted system (unsustainable timber harvesting) being only
             about 11 percent of the traditional use regime. The MA recognizes that the conversion of an
             ecosystem leads to an economic benefit for those immediately involved, but that the multiple
             benefits that a natural system provides to a much larger group of citizens most of the time
             are lost. In the case of unsustainable timber harvesting in a tropical forest, this is immediately
             clear, while with regard to a shrimp farming system in place of a mangrove, it might be less
             obvious because a shrimp farm can generate income opportunities and, if managed well, can
             be sustained over long periods.

                          The history of investment to improve productivity in rural
                          areas is a long one, documented by a number of different names
                          and programs, such as "Integrated Rural Development,"
                          "Land Quality Improvement," "Integrated Land and Water
                          Management," and the like. Drylands have been an important
                          focus, with attention paid to range management, agroforestry,
                          soil and water conservation, and large- and small-scale irrigation
                          as common management strategies. Generally speaking, the
                          interest in investment in dryland has tended to diminish, with
                          donor attention directed to quicker, less complex projects with
                          more visible returns or on basic services such as health and
                          education.


          S      everal intersecting trends have helped to begin to change this picture:
         • A stronger realization of the global problem of resource deterioration, including land
           degradation
         • More-specific analyses of world poverty and its links with land degradation
         • The definition of millennium goals, with two (1 and 7) directly related to land degradation
           and poverty and the others with strong links41

     A World Resource Institute (WRI) report42 identified four factors that are of importance to
safeguard environmental income for the poor:
         • Using an ecosystem approach to manage natural resources
         • Getting the governance right to ensure access to environmental income (in particular for the
           poor, through a decentralized management system and a system that allows the poor to meet
           their needs through negotiation)
         • Commercialization of ecosystem goods and services so that products can be turned into
           income (calling for better marketing structures and provision of supportive services)
         • Finding innovative sources of environmental income (for example, for environmental services
           and eco-labeled produce), diversifying the source of income and making people less vulnerable
           to shocks in the system

      It is becoming increasingly accepted, however, that addressing the problem of land degradation
is not simple. It requires not only technical approaches but also addressing the socioeconomic causes

behind the unsustainable practices and removing the barriers to the adoption of a more sustainable
system. These barriers can be related to the lack of technical or institutional capacity, a lack of
appropriate or effective policy, a lack of information or knowledge, or a lack of social or economic
incentives.

     The dust storms in the United States and Canada in the 1930s triggered much research, and
the degradation of soils was stopped by using a number of physically based techniques. It is, however,
often forgotten that those technical solutions were accompanied by a package of incentives that
included loans for new machinery and an extension service to advise farmers on how to make their
farming systems compatible with the dryland ecological conditions.

      Today, in developing countries, the most important response to land degradation (LD) at the
farm level is by the land managers as they adapt their system to declining productivity. Responses
often include switching to less-demanding crops such as tubers, and adding inputs such as fertilizers
and manure (if economically viable). We have these and other techniques to reverse the biophysical
process of land degradation. What we are lacking is methodologies to identify effective approaches
that address the root causes and how to design intervention strategies to remove the barriers to
sustainable management.

      By working to address not just the physical manifestations of land degradation but also its root
causes, it is acknowledged that land degradation is a complex issue that requires a broad approach. It
leads to the recognition that people who so often are blamed for the problem must be made part of
the solution. The policy implication that results from this broader approach is that integrated analyses
must be fed into decision-making processes to guide local, national, and international development
and investment strategies. Sustainable land management is the approach that incorporates all these
aspects and puts mitigation of land degradation at the core of the development process.


Institutional, Policy, and Governance Barriers
Institutional, policy, and governance barriers have plagued both donor and rec1p1ent systems.
Such barriers include government and international pricing policies, centralization of government
control, the lack of local institutions (such as market and extension services), and the lack of local
decision-making structures. Other barriers may include policy and legislative issues such as the link
between land tenure and the ability to invest in improvements, the impact of taxation and subsidies
on production and distribution, the role of health and educational services, and access to labor and
effective extension services. Conflicts between modern and traditional systems of management may
also be a factor. The key to removing these barriers is the realization that the problem is multifaceted
and important, and responses need to be mainstreamed into the decision-making process on all sides.
The new attention given to poverty reduction, linked with combating land degradation, has created
new momentum in the institutional, policy, and governance arena. The current international and
national responses to these barriers are outlined below.


Economic and Social Incentive Barriers
Economic and social barriers relate to issues or structures that have prevented investment in
sustainable land management. Common economic barriers at the farm level include low returns to
crops or livestock products that reduce the incentive to invest in productivity-enhancing practices;



20 •   Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding of Activities Related to Land Degradation
the relatively high labor, land, or capital requirements in a sustainable system, compared with those in
a conventional system; and the lack of markets for products produced in a sustainable system. Social
barriers can include wealth, ethnic, or other societal divisions that prevent groups from working together
to develop or implement a sustainable land management plan. Ineffective leadership or institutions,
combined with unclear land tenure, can lead to a lack of the necessary trust for successful land use or
other land management plan. Yet, the inherent strength of many rural systems is their ability to use the
natural resources base in communal, integrated, and effective ways, and building on past or existing
social structures and local knowledge is often the most effective and sustainable approach.


Scientific Knowledge Generation Barriers
Compared with other conventions or sectors, LD and SLM have had at best a modest research base.
The research and knowledge generation that has occurred tends not to be well coordinated and not
easily available to the practitioners. Funding for research and research coordination has been small.
Monitoring and evaluation followed by feedback has not always been a high-priority activity.

      Although SLM involves new approaches to project and framework development, it also involves
new approaches to research and to knowledge generation and management. More important, there
is a need first to integrate the biophysical and social science knowledge base and second to involve
local community knowledge and participation in SLM activities. Winslow et al.43 have identified
the differences in approaches from a Consultative Group on International Agricultural Research
(CGIAR) perspective (Table 1), and the CGIAR has oriented some of its research activities to these
objectives. Some current CGIAR research activities include scientific analyses of the environmental
dimensions of degradation and the socioeconomic causes of the change in land management. With the
collaboration with local partners, these studies develop and implement technological and institutional
intervention strategies. Past UNCCD-related interventions have included hardy crop varieties, land
productivity improvement technologies, and policy reforms.

     A central response to the lack of research and data is LADA (Land Degradation Assessment in
Drylands), a (UN) Food and Agricultural Organization/United Nations Environment Programme
(FAO/UNEP) activity designed to develop and test an assessment methodology for land degradation
in drylands. Once the tools and data are together to understand the root causes, driving forces,
and functioning of the degradation process, LADA will assess land degradation at global, regional,
national, and subnational levels. It has ongoing activities in several countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin
America.44

     UNEP's Desert Margins Programme, led by the International Crop Research Institute for the
Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT), is active in benchmark sites on the border of the desert in nine African
countries. Some of the program activities include the development of indicators of land degradation,
capacity building, and the testing and promotion of "best bet" technologies (including indigenous
technologies) for conserving and restoring biodiversity and degraded lands.45

the impact of land use changes on above- and below-ground carbon sequestration, greenhouse gas
fluxes in slash-and-bum and alternative land use systems, and the effects of macroeconomic factors
on deforestation. Among its successes are (a) the reclamation of unproductive Imperata cylindrica

22 •       Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding of Activities Related to Land Degradation
      Land Use Change, Impacts and Dynamics (LUCID) is a UNEP project (led by the International
Livestock Research Institute) that is examining the linkages between changes in land use, land
degradation, and biodiversity. It used research results from studies crossing ecological gradients in East
Africa to identify the root causes and spatial patterns of change in socioeconomic and environmental
processes, using a variety of methods. Based on these findings, LUCID scientists designed, tested,
and wrote methodological guides to conduct such analyses to be used as the basis for designing
effective land degradation mitigation projects.48

     While these and other projects have generated a significant knowledge base, the challenge is
now to incorporate these findings into project and framework design, both by donors and by host
countries, and to significantly expand the research effort.

     Alongside the development of the integrated knowledge frameworks from a scientific and social
science perspective, there is also a need to bring community knowledge and know-how into the
planning and implementation of SLM. While some of the project examples cited in this document
do that effectively (see Appendix 6), this is not universally the case. However, there are some good
examples in West Africa, particularly where local communities' knowledge and action have been the
key driving force for SLM and new economic growth. 49


Country Response
Although available statistics tend to identify donor investments, those investments and priorities are
based on country assessments and include considerable allocation of scarce resources of people and
finance, including borrowing from multilateral institutions. From this perspective, there has been a
wide spread country institutional, policy, and investment initiatives.

Identifying the Poverty/Environment Problem
Many countries, including Brazil, China, India, and Indonesia (four of the most populous), plus
Bolivia, Mexico, the Central Asian group, and many of the Sub-Saharan African countries, have
identified land degradation as a major national problem and sustainable land management and other
poverty and environment responses as a high national priority. The countries are in various stages
of turning this assessment into practical responses, including policy, institutional, and financial
sectors. Within countries, there have been good examples of regional response to land degradation
by developing sustainable land management. These include Burkina Faso, Kenya, Mali, Niger, and
Tanzania.SO These are sometimes the result of local initiatives, with nongovernmental organization
(NGO) support, and important lessons learned can be derived from these successes. The local level
is the scale where it is easier to integrate the various components of sustainable land management,
providing that appropriate infrastructure, policies, and markets are in place.

Mainstreaming
When the UNCCD supported the development of National Action Plans (NAPs), the initial
general country response was to treat this activity as distinct from most other national planning and
implementation activities. The NAPs tended to be the responsibility of less powerful ministries, and
moving from planning to action was difficult. Financial allocation lagged seriously behind. Hence, the
more recent effort to bring the NAPs into the central planning process will help in the mainstreaming
of the land degradation issue.
      While mainstreaming at country level is still far from universal, some good examples of
mainstreaming are available, even if we use the strict definition, which implies not only priority
setting but also fiscal allocation. The country that has some of the most intense and widespread land
degradation problems is China, and the Government of China (GOC) has responded by identifying
the problem as a priority, allocating significant internal resources to it, and obtaining major loans
and grants to assist in the process. For example, the GOC has allocated at least $13 billion to land
degradation work over the next 10 years. China is also the major recipient of international assistance
for UNCCD-related activities.

      Tanzania is another country whose government has incorporated the SLM process into its
Poverty Reduction Strategy Paper (PRSP) and has set up a system for mainstreaming progress in
tackling these issues (Appendix 4). Burkina Faso has undertaken a similar task and has outlined the
issues for donors and the national government in moving from principle to practice (Appendix 5).

     A report of the UNCCD Secretariat51 identified six actions by which mainstreaming National
Action Plans into the PRSP could move from planning to action on SLM:
        • Incorporating NAP analyses and approaches directly into the PRSP process
        • Focusing on the spatial distribution of poverty, as NAPs are intended to do, and identifying
          remedial action at the subnational and community-based levels through the selection of
          NAP-identified catalytic actions with win-win potential (combating land degradation and
          reducing poverty)
        • Exploring the proximate and root causes of poverty, taking duly into account the loss of
          ecosystem services in the vulnerable drylands and further analyzing land degradation issues
          and their impact on poverty in expanding NAP-related assessment
        • Improving the analysis of the poverty-environment relationship at the household, community,
          regional, and macroeconomic levels while determining the relationship of poverty with other
          factors, such as land degradation, lack of access to private and common resources and services
          (for example, health care, education, land, and markets), social and economic policies, and so
          forth
         • Reviewing the status and inclusion of sustainable land management perspectives in the PRSP
           process and creating equal and win-win structures
         • Defining specific cross-sectoral programs, projects, and investments to address SLM issues

     In a few cases, all six steps have been followed, but in many countries, this process is just
beginning.52


International Response
An initial international response to land degradation was a formal recognition of the problem in
the form of a UN convention following severe droughts and famines in semi-arid Africa. This was
followed by many individual technical, project level initiatives, and more recently by the adoption of
land degradation (desertification and deforestation) as a focal area for investment in the GEE


Institutional
The central global response to the problem ofland degradation was the overarching intergovernmental
treaty establishing responsibility of both developed and developing countries-the United Nations
Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD). The Global Mechanism (GM) was established as
an innovation-supporting financial mechanism.

      We can identify the 2002 World Summit on Sustainable Development; the 2002 designation of
land degradation as a focal area in the Global Environment Facility (GEF); the World Bank's focus
on Poverty Reduction Strategies; the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (MA); the Report of the
Commission for Africa: Our Common Interest (the so-called "Blair Commission Report"); the creation
of the New Partnership for Africa's Development (NEPAD), with its Common African Agricultural
Development Programme and Environmental Strategy; and the growing role of the UNCCD and the
GM as international responses to institutional barriers. These actions by the international community
brought the issues of land degradation to the forefront and renewed the debate on how to best address
them. International agencies-including UNDP, UNEP, the International Fund for Agricultural
Development (IFAD), the regional development banks, and the World Bank-renewed their support
of land degradation mitigation programs. Specialized framework initiatives such as GEF Country
Partnership Programmes (CPP) projects, the World Bank's TerrAfrica, and the People's Republic
of China/Global Environment Facility/Asian Development Bank (PRC/GEF/ADE) Partnership on
Land Degradation in Dryland Ecosystems were initiated. An important feature of the renewed interest
was the realization that the answer to land degradation was not just physical or technical responses
(terraces, dune vegetation, small dams. and so forth) but also a concerted, integrated approach to
sustainable land management with strong links to water management.

      Sustainable land management is now understood to involve a range of policy and institutional
issues. Some are local, such as security ofland tenure and rights of access, participatory decision making,
community-level land use planning, and local institutional capacity. Others are more universal, such
as economic incentives for land management related to access to market and credit and opportunity
costs of sustainable production technologies. Also important are national-level macroeconomic and
multisectoral policies influencing the environment-poverty nexus. Reducing both poverty and land
degradation may require strategic investments and stimulation of complementary secondary and
tertiary activities. The framework approach involving long-term investment and support are a logical
follow-up of this realization.

Mainstreaming
Generally both multilateral and bilateral institutions have started to become more proactive in giving
recognition and priority to land degradation and SLM issues, particularly given the incentive of GEF
support for many of these projects. However, the donors and many countries regard the priority as
applying to incentive funds such as GEF provides and in many cases have not seriously reallocated
their core funding. Given the attention to the MDGs (and to poverty reduction in general) and
the worsening environmental problem in some areas (such as North China), this situation may be
changing.
     The World Bank's PRSP process, the relatively new Rural Development Strategy, and the
renewed attention to Sustainable Natural Resource Management are all initiatives that could lead to
greater investment in SLM. IFAD has already clearly altered the focus of some of its newer projects,
and UNDP and UNEP have a stream of pipeline projects directed to SLM.

      The bilateral donor response is more mixed, but the five major national bilateral providers appear
to be committed to a long-term investment in this area. In all cases, additional financing is needed
to move from plans to activities. Some countries, particularly the United Kingdom and Germany,
see resources mobilization for LD coming mainly through investments in economic opportunities in
drylands.

      Many policy and governance issues such as pricing, the degree of local authority, and market
structures have still to be mainstreamed in both multilateral and bilateral donors' policies.


Financial and Economic Responses in Relation to Needs
In taking on the task of presenting financial data on LD or SLM, there are formidable problems of
data collection and comparison. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of a common definition of
land degradation activities, UNCDD-related activities, and sustainable land management activities
across agencies and between donors. Projects in rural development, forestation, rural infrastructure,
forest management, rural water management, and SLM may have sometimes been included by donors.
Double-counting is another problem. For example, almost every GEF project has cofinancing from
both bilateral donors and host countries, and so these amounts are repeated in some sections of this
report. In many cases, the same contributions are included in bilateral data and separately in reports
to the Committee for the Review of the Implementation of the Convention (CRIC). Periods of
reporting vary by country and by agency.

      The problem is illustrated by the EU compilation of national reports and by the incompatibility
of data sets reported to the CRIC. Previous reports have illustrated the difficulty of accounting for
components within projects.53 A number of initiatives to coordinate data have been launched by
the GM (FIELD),54 the UNCCD Secretariat, the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development/Development Assistance Committee (OECD/DAC), and the EU countries. An Ad
Hoc Working Group (AHWG) to improve the procedures for communication of information, as well
as the quality and format of reports on the implementation of the Convention, has been established

53   L. Berry and J. Olson, "Land Degradation Linkage Study," Working Paper 6, Global Environment Facility (W"ashington, DC:
     World Bank, 2000).
54   FIELD (Financial Information Engine for Land Degradation) is GM's financial database for UNCCD-related activities. See
     Appendix 7. The authors received data from the FIELD database in May 2006 for this report.

by Decision 8/COP7. The deliberations and recommendations of the AHWG will be of crucial
importance to guide future assessments of progress in UNCCD implementation.

       We have attempted to bring different reports into the same time frame. We have provided
references to the data source wherever possible. As sustainable land management activities continue,
it will be important for evaluation and comparison to establish a more coherent database. The FIELD
system of GM, with a more consistent input from contributors, provides a base for such a system
(Appendix 7).

      Equally, definition of needs is hard to pin down, except in relation to the issues of continuing
rural poverty, widespread lack of food security, and ongoing land degradation. The evidence shows
that land degradation, an important global problem, is a significant factor in both food security and
rural poverty, and there is a widespread, regionally focused need for SLM investment on a scale
greater than at present.

      The financial review encompasses a preliminary analysis of bilateral, multilateral, and national
funding ofUNCCD-related activities. This section outlines financial and economic responses to land
degradation (as much as the incomplete and conflicting data sources allow). A preliminary analysis
of the financial data indicates that approximately $4 billion are spent annually on UNCCD-related
activities.


Multilateral Assistance
Between 1999 and 2003, multilateral donors accounted for more than two-thirds of total investment
in UNCCD-related activities, while bilateral donors accounted for about one-fourth, according to
information submitted to the Conference of the Parties (COP)/CRIC by country parties and additional
information provided by multilateral agencies and the OECD/DAC. This ratio is confirmed by
portfolio reviews recently undertaken by the GM in collaboration with major International financial
institutions and by the latest analysis of "Rio marker" data on bilateral aid activities targeting the
UNCCD. 55

     A summary of contributions to SLM by the multilateral agencies is shown in Figure 1. The data
include contributions from other cofinanciers or recipient governments (or both); thus, the amounts
do not represent the exact contribution by each multilateral agency. Data sets from different agencies
and donors show significantly different numbers because of differing methods of estimating financial
contributions.

      Among the top 10 multilateral donors from 1996-2001, the World Bank contributed 38 percent
of the total amount (mostly loans), followed by IFAD with 15 percent and GEF with 12 percent. As
noted above, these amounts are inflated because of the contributions by cofinanciers or recipient
governments (or both).

      A more detailed analysis of each of the main multilateral donors is presented in the following
sections.

World Bank
The World Bank's m1tiative in working with recipient countries to develop Poverty Reduction
Strategies was a good vehicle to begin to address rural poverty and its links to land degradation and
SLM. But (as a recent World Bank publication points out)56 while each of the Bank's sector strategies
contains commitment and approaches to achieve SLM, these strategies have (for the most part) not yet
been integrated into a comprehensive approach. The development of a comprehensive approach to
SLM across these sectors would allow further mainstreaming of this issue within the World Bank.

     In the same way in many instances, a focus on SLM has not yet been incorporated in country
macroperspectives. In some of the Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers (PRSPs) and Country
Assistance Strategies (CASs), the issue is addressed, in others not. While many countries clearly
identify the destruction of natural resources (and, in particular, land degradation), as a major issue, this
recognition has not been followed by making this a priority. However, there are some good examples
where this has happened (for example, Burkina Faso, China, and Uganda). Recent experiences have
shown that it is not enough to get recognition in the PRSPs, the CASs, or corresponding documents
of other donors. Unless a provision is made in the financing plans that are derived from such policy
documents, nothing has in effect been achieved.

      Interest in rural development can be assessed in several ways (for example, in the early 1980s,
lending to agriculture accounted for more than 30 percent of the Bank's total lending); however,
agriculture lending declined markedly between 1982 and 2002, to 8 percent. Table 2 illustrates trends
in World Bank investments in rural areas and agriculture for the period 1999-2005. Lending to rural
areas has increased from about $5 billion to almost $9 billion from 2002 to 2005; however, investment
in agriculture (including agroindustry and marketing) did not change as dramatically and continues to
represent between 7 and 10 percent of the Bank's total lending.

      At the close of FY 2004, the total active projects with environment and natural resources
management (ENRM) content amounted to US$1 l.2 billion, constituting 12.2 percent of the Bank's
total active portfolio. During the same year, global bank investment in sustainable land management
accounted for US$1.6 billion, 14 percent of total investment in ENRM.57

GEF
In most cases, Global Environment Facility (GEF) projects have two interlinked parts: one focusing on
the improvement of people's livelihoods (associated with baseline funding contributed by governments,
NGOs, bilateral institutions, the private sector, and so forth), and the other contributing to the global
environmental system (associated with incremental funding that is eligible for GEF support, but often
shared between GEF and other contributors).58 Since the inception of the GEF, funding to combat

land degradation has been provided for threat-reducing activities in focal areas such as biodiversity,
climate change, and international waters through activities linking LD with the other focal areas.
In 2002, the GEF Assembly approved a new focal area on land degradation (desertification and
deforestation). In May 2003 , the GEF Council approved a new operational program on sustainable
land management as a framework to operationalize the land degradation focal area

      The third replenishment (2002-2006) of the GEF agreed to a proposed programming level
totaling US$500 million to support land degradation prevention and control activities. Of this
amount, US$250 million was programmed as new and additional funds to the focal area (FA) of land
degradation (desertification and deforestation) and another US$250 million for land degradation
activities in linkage projects

      The GEF has a catalytic role in promoting investment in SLM activities. Despite its relatively
small funding portfolio compared to its implementing agencies, it has exerted a large influence by
successfully promoting environmental stewardship in large development projects, by promoting
integrative environmental and social approaches for SLM at the community level, and by successfully
promoting the mainstreaming of SLM in some countries and regions. This has occurred as countries
and implementing agencies have molded their wider project design to accommodate the environmental
mandate of GEF in order to obtain GEF grants. GEF's focus in OP#l5 on the productive sectors of
agriculture, forestry and grazing has meant that it has particular relevance for and potential to impact
economic development projects and programs.
      The following section summarizes the magnitude of resources programmed for land degradation
activities under the land degradation focal area, as well as the focal areas biodiversity, international
waters, and climate change in GEF -3.

     An analysis of the portfolios of the GEF Pilot Phase, GEF-1, GEF-2, and GEF-3 (1991 to
June 2006) was conducted and shows a rapid increase in number of projects during GEF-3 (Figure
2). This growth is an expression of the enhanced recognition of land degradation as an important
global environmental issue because it poses a serious threat to global commons such as biodiversity,
international water bodies, and global and regional climate patterns.

     In GEF-3, projects allocated a total ofUS$197.3 million in 180 projects to activities addressing
land degradation as a threat to biodiversity, international water bodies, and global and regional climate
patterns, with two-thirds being linked to biodiversity.

      Since the approval of the land degradation focal area, the demand for projects under the
operational program on sustainable land management has been overwhelming. All resources allocated
to the LD FA in GEF-3 ($250 million) have been approved and pipelined in the form of projects and
programs. Cofinancing for these projects was $1.06 billion, making a total GEF and cofinancing of
more than $2.3 billion over the four-year period.

       The regional distribution of the OP#15 funding for 2002-2006 is shown in Table 3.

     Table 4 illustrates the allocation of funds from OP#15 to implementing (WB, UNDP, UNEP)
and executing (IFAD, FAO, ADB, AfDB) agencies and the level of cofinancing generated by each.
The cofinancing of World Bank projects resulted in a 7. 7 fold increase in total project funding, while
cofinancing of joint mostly CPP projects resulted in a five fold increase.

UNEP
In addition to being the implementing agency for many GEF land degradation projects, the United
Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has been a strong supporter of several research and
information-sharing activities that promote sustainable land management:59
         • UNEP program on Success Stories in Land Degradation and Desertification publicizes
           projects and community-based initiatives that have successfully addressed the problem of
           dryland degradation.
         • Sustainable Agri-food Production and Consumption Forum provides a network of key
           information sources on agri-food production and consumption, related environmental
           impacts, and practices to prevent or respond to these impacts.




59   Unfortunately, no financial data are available for these activities.




32 •       Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding ofActivities Related to Land Degradation
         • Environmental and Sustainability Indicators-with the International Center for Tropical
           Agriculture (CIAT) and the World Bank-work to improve policy and decision making for
           sustainable land and environmental management.
         • The Global Environment Outlook, GE0-3, provides an overview of the main environmental
           developments over the past three decades and how social, economic, and other factors have
           contributed to the changes that have occurred.
         • Earthwatch provides "integrated" information gathered from across the UN system relevant
           for policy making by building essential partnerships across the UN system with the scientific
           community, governments, and NGOs.

      The role of UNEP as implementing agency of GEF land degradation projects has grown in
the number of projects and the amount of funding over the past few years. Many of the successful
land degradation targeted research projects, for example, were implemented by UNEP (see section
"Scientific Knowledge Generation Barriers"). Financial data for UNEP-GEF are provided in Table
6; the totals include some joint projects, so they are not comparable to the data in the previous section
on GEF, but they do provide an indication of the impact of OP#l 5.

UNDP
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) has been supporting the mitigation of
desertification and land degradation since the inception in the 1970s of the United Nations Sahelian
Office (UNSO), now the Drylands Development Centre. In recent years, UNDP's level of activity
has grown through its activities in the Drylands Development Centre, as an important implementing
agency of GEF land degradation projects, and by providing other UNCCD support activities. For
example, it has provided technical and financial support through the NAP process: direct financial

assistance to the NAPs and SRAPs has been provided to 59 countries in all regions of the world, for
a total of more than US$41 million (see Table 7):

      UNDP is also contributing by supporting the integration of critical land degradation issues
into the national development frameworks, PRSPs, and policy reforms. This is done through
several mechanisms at the country level: (a) donor harmonization; (b) MDG and PRSP integration
and reporting; and (c) several integrated national development programs, such as the Dryland
Development Centre's Integrated Dryland Development Programs,60 the GEF CPPs,61 and various
regional capacity-building and environmental governance programs. UNDP also played an important
role in the establishment of the Global Drylands Imperative, a policy and advocacy mechanism at the
global level, and it established a GEF MSP to catalyze a partnership of around $60 million to support
the World Initiative for Sustainable Pastoralism. UNDP has leveraged both GEF and cofinancing for
implementation of priority projects within the NAP, as well as projects addressing deforestation issues
in line with the United Nations Forum on Forests.


IFAD
The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD), as host of the GM and with its focus
on agriculture, has been a major responder to the challenge of SLM even though many of its projects,
while related, were not specifically directed to integrated land management and poverty reduction.

      A review of IFAD's programs and projects portfolio related to UNCCD objectives shows that
the share of UNCCD-related projects increased from 35 to 63 percent between 2002 and 2006.
These projects represented an investment of $1.850 billion in loans and $119 million in grants over
the seven-year period. Of the total, 47 percent were invested in Africa.62

      IFAD has also been successful in leveraging an additional nearly $2 billion in cofinancing from
its partners, particularly governments, beneficiaries, the OPEC Fund, the West African Development
Bank, GEF, and the World Bank. The main IFAD partners in the implementation of the projects
are the ministries of agriculture and of the environment, CGIAR centers, NGOs, and communities
groups.

      Many of the grants and loans that are targeting more precisely the UNCCD-related activities
are recent and ongoing. This includes funding for a growing emphasis on community-based activities
(mainly in the form of small grants) and more integrated projects (often in the form ofloans).


Global Mechanism
The Global Mechanism (GM) was established as a financial mechanism, not a fund. Its core
responsibility is to promote the mobilization of investments for UNCCD implementation through
the provision of information, catalytic resources, and advisory services on finance. GM's approach
to resource mobilization emphasizes country-driven identification of development priorities, the
importance of domestic public budget allocations, and the need for countries and their development
partners to position the UNCCD and SLM in relevant policy processes.

     To support favorable conditions for investments in SLM, the GM assists affected developing
countries in the establishment ofNational Financing Strategies. This involves analyzing the investment
climate, identifying financing instruments and sources of finance, increasing the complementarity of
finance from different sources, including domestic budgets, and promoting partnerships between
national stakeholders and international development cooperation partners. This process facilitates
the mainstreaming of UNCCD activities into national and external development frameworks.

      Since 1997, the GM has supported the formulation and implementation of more than 70
National Action Plans (NAPs). Several countries, such as Burkina Faso, Tunisia, and Uganda, have
mainstreamed UNCCD objectives into their national development frameworks or PRSPs, opening
channels for increased financing for land degradation activities. At the regional level, the GM has
promoted initiatives such as the Strategic Partnership Agreement (SPA) for UNCCD implementation
inCentralAsianCountries,63theCentralAsianCountries'InitiativeforLandManagement(CACILM),
TerrAfrica in Sub-Saharan Africa, and SolArid in the Sahel and Sahara countries. The primary focus
of these initiatives is mainstreaming SLM into national planning and budgetary processes.

      An example of an outcome of the SPA is CACILM, which was launched as a GEF multicountry
CPP led by the Asian Development Bank. A task force comprising the countries, the GM, the GEF
Secretariat, all of the GEF IAs, and several EAs and SPA members assisted with the design of a 10-
year program seeking to reverse the effects of land degradation through addressing bottlenecks at all
levels. It is anticipated that over the 10-year period, an estimated investment of $1.3 78 billion shall
be invested in SLM-related activities, of which $400 million is to be contributed by the countries



63   Members of the SPA are the Global M echanism of the UNCCD; the Asian D evelopment Bank (ADB); the CCD Project of
     the German Agency for Technical Cooperation (CCD Project of GTZ); the C anadian International Development Agency
     (CIDA); the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); the Swiss Agency for Development Cooperation (SDC);
     the International C entre for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA); the United Nations Development Programme
     (UNDP); the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP); and the W orld Bank (WB).

concerned (Appendix 8). The launching phase has identified approximately $15 5 million, of which the
countries, the development partners, and the GEF are contributing roughly US$24 million, US$110
million, and US$2 0 million, respectively.

      In light of COP and GEF Council decisions concerning the complementary role between the
GM and the GEF, the GM has provided entry points for the integration of GEF activities into
GM-initiated processes for UNCCD financing at national and subregional levels. These have
resulted in the identification and formulation of 20 initiatives under the GEF OP#l5, for which
the GM has provided cofinancing or facilitated the mobilization of cofinancing. The collaboration
between the GM, the GEF Secretariat, and GEF implementing and executing agencies have led to
the mobilization of significant financing during the GEF-3 replenishment period. With IFAD, for
example, the GM has collaborated with and cofinanced GEF proposals in nine countries. The total
investment mobilized for these proposals amounts to approximately US$262.2 million, including
US$44.6 million from the GEF.


Bilateral Official Development Assistance
Recent data for bilateral aid is not easy to obtain, but a recent GM report based on OECD/DAC
data shows that for 1998-2004, activities related to land degradation and desertification represented .
between 1.2 and 2.0 percent of the total Bilateral Official Development Assistance (BODA).64

     The share ofUNCCD-related funding as a percentage of the total BODA has been decreasing
over time (Figure 3). In total funding for UNCCD-related activities, allocations have also decreased
between 1998 and 200565 from US$1.05 billion to US$1.03 billion.
     The top six bilateral donors to UNCCD-related activities for 1998-2000 were Germany, the
Netherlands,Japan, Norway, the United Kingdom, and Denmark. In 2001-2003, Denmark, Germany,
Japan, the Netherlands, and Norway were the top five donors. However, the source of these data does
not indicate whether some of the contributions were channeled through multilateral agencies such
as GEF.66

     Table 8 provides a summary of the contributions to developing countries in Africa by members of
the EU (data on contributions to non-African countries is not available). The reporting varies widely
from country to country and from year to year, making it difficult to compare contributions between
donors and to examine trends over time. Also, some countries reported projected contributions while
others did not, and the data on contributions by the Netherlands includes multilateral funding and
cannot be directly compared with the data for other countries.
     In addition to EU countries, other major donors to UNCCD-related activities include the
United States, which contributed approximately US$42.1 million in 2003; Canada, with an average
annual contribution ofUS$52.7 million in 2001-2003;Japan, with an annual average contribution of
US$380 million in 2001-2002; and Switzerland, with an annual average of US$24 million in 2001-

Country Financial Commitments
While donor commitments are hard to quantify, country contributions to SLM are even more difficult.
There is some eviden~e that countries have been more eager to get grants rather than loans for SLM
based on the lack of clarity on the costs and benefits of investment in this area. This issue of fiscal as
well as more general costs and benefits is addressed in the next section.

      However, in some cases, country commitment has been strong, especially where the problem
is clearly identified as a costly national problem. This can be illustrated by examples from China,
Burkina Faso, and Central Asia.

      As noted earlier, China has allocated at least $13 billion to land degradation work over the next
decade in response to an assessment that direct costs are more than $10 billion a year and indirect
costs more than $30 billion per year.69

    Burkina Faso, whose process of integrating the NAP is outlined in Appendix 5, has allocated
some $170 million to its CPP process, a large contribution for a very poor country.

      In summary, when countries and donors alike identify the important nature and extent of land
degradation, the willingness to invest in sustainable land management is clear. However, even in the
best of these responses, the planned investment is still well below that needed to deal with the issue.


Private Sector
While international agencies are important agents in SLM, the private sector (internationally,
nationally, and locally) is an important actor in many countries, less so in others. International
private sector investments tend to be large-scale, export-oriented activities in citrus, coffee, flowers,
aquaculture, and so forth. In many cases, these investments provide labor and spin off small capital to
invest in local crop production and SLM. In most cases, these activities are not linked effectively with
government and international donors' work, which could benefit from private-public partnerships. At
the national and local scale, integrating critical loan and infrastructure needs for the local companies
may be the most effective way of promoting SLM. The GM is carrying out an inventory of private
support potential in Kenya and South Africa.

       A recent World Bank document provides some examples of private sector involvement in SLM: 70
       • Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)-guaranteed loan support for a coffee-
         processing facility in Uganda (US$7 million) and a flour mill in Guyana (US$9 million)
       • Development of private sector Amelioration Associations (AAs) in Georgia to manage
         irrigation and drainage
       • World Bank-supported development of community forestry in Mexico, primarily by making
         private sector technical assistance available to indigenous communities that own forest land
       • Support Fund to help farmers work with microfinance institutions such as e-Choupal in India.

      The last project cited is a good win-win example. To enable farmers to better negotiate with these
traders, a private company (ITC, India's largest tobacco company) established e-Choupal, which links
rural poor farmers to market information via the Internet, using a VSAT71 or phone connection. 72

      The e-Choupal system allows farmers to assess information that gives them more control over
their choices. They have used this information to achieve a higher profit margin on their crops (on
average, a higher margin of US$6 per metric ton of soya), cheaper procurement of farm inputs,
and improved productivity. In mid-2003, e-Choupal services reached more than 1 million farmers
in nearly 11,000 villages. The computer, typically housed in a selected farmer's house, serves about
a five-kilometer radius. In areas covered by e-Choupals, the percentage of farmers planting soya
has increased 50-90 percent, while the volume traded in formal market auctions has dropped by 50
percent (that is, much of the soya volume is sold via the e-Choupals). In addition to soya, e-Choupals
provide information on wheat, coffee, and aquaculture (shrimp).

   to find prices of soya prevailing in local and international markets, as well as what ITC is ready to pay at its local buying centers;
   hence, the farmer need not travel to find out the price.

Nongovernmental Organizations
Non governmental organizations (NGOs) play an important part in many aspects of rural development,
including SLM. The importance ofNGOs in providing hands-on assistance at the local level is a key
component of many of the funding processes discussed here. However, in the time available, there has
not been opportunity to identify and separate out the NGO component of this process.


Need for a New Level of Financial Response
Although the numerical data on financial responses are far from complete, a rough estimate of the
total bilateral and multilateral loans and grants to recipient countries is approximately US$4 billion
annually. 73 However, the on-site costs of land degradation from lost productivity can be estimated to
be US$65 billion annually. Other costs of land degradation generally not quantified include the off-
site costs (which a Chinese analysis estimated to be approximately four times the value of the on-site
costs)74 and external costs (for example, inadequate food security, increased poverty, lost economic
development, and loss of environmental services).

      The estimated contributions to land degradation rmugation act1VIt1es is thus an order of
magnitude less than the direct cost of lost productivity in affected countries. This points to the need
for a new level of investment in SLM. This need is illustrated by the following:
       • The great compelling need to deal with linked poverty and resource management issues in
         degraded areas
       • The relatively high economic and productivity rates of return of SLM projects, and their
         providing direct benefits to poor land managers
       • The growing awareness by countries of the problem and the increase in mainstreaming SLM
         issues in PRSP~ and other government programs
       • The synergy between improved land management (to reduce land degradation) and improved
         biodiversity conservation, climate change moderation, and watershed management
       • The flood of project activity in Africa, Latin America, and the Caribbean as a result of GEF/
         OP#l 5, reflecting huge pent-up demand at the country level
       • The expressed need in Southeast Asia for framework programs based on their assessment of
         SLM as a major goal
       • The scale of the proposed investment in Central Asia (Appendix 8)

     Conservatively, an additional 10-15 percent a year of new investment, with a total international
investment approaching US$1 Obillion to US$12 billion a year by the end of the decade, would begin to
address removing the barriers to sustainable land management and would provide a vital contribution
to on-the-ground programs to prevent further degradation.

40 •     Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding ofActivities Related to Land Degradation
                                                                              Conclusions




      A        s SLM becomes an important focus for dealing with land degradation and poverty, a set
of guidelines and conclusions emerge:


     1. Millennium Ecosystem Assessment scenarios of future development show that if unchecked,
        degradation of ecosystem services will threaten future improvements in human well-being
        and possibly reverse gains in some regions. Land degradation ranks among the greatest
        environmental challenges today and is a major impediment to meeting basic human needs in
        drylands.
     2. SLM is basically a long-term commitment for both donor and host countries, but the returns
        from that commitment are critical in national, local, and international perspectives. Investing
        in the prevention and mitigation of land degradation provides multiple, synergistic benefits-
        more so than investing in sectorally specific economic development or environmental
        programs. It requires moving away from relying on technological approaches and addressing
        the wider economic, policy and societal barriers to adoption of SLM.
        Local benefits derive from improved resilience of the natural environment; higher investments
        in the local economy; growing economic stability; rising incomes and food security; improved
        social well-being, including better education and health; and increased production from the
        national resources base.
        National benefits derive from reduced poverty and inequality, improved food security,
        sustainable income and growth in rural areas, reduced out-migration, and improved rural
        environment and natural resources base.
        International benefits arise from improved global environment, reduction in inequality, and
        reduction in the need for international relief.
     3. Increased financing of SLM is important if these above-listed benefits are to be achieved.
        This implies both donor and country commitment to long-term mainstreaming of this issue.
        Additional funding should be long-term, be subject to country priorities, and adopt adaptive
        management principles.
        Country mainstreaming implies that this is a priority for grant, loan, and national budget
        investment. Successful national programs have been cross-sectoral, interministerial programs
        with high levels of political commitment. Donor commitment implies a mid- to long-term
        (approximately 10-year) focus on the development of an integrated SLM strategy.




                                                                                                 •   41
          Coordination is vital in this context. GM has an important role in both venues (that is, in
          supporting the mainstreaming process and in developing and coordinating donor support at
          the national and regional levels).
          The rapid rise in numbers of, and investment in, GEF SLM projects has been impressive.
          There are numerous challenges and positive lessons learned from these experiences in
          promoting agency collaboration and in attracting cofinancing and country investments.
          These lessons should be incorporated into future planning.
          The role of GEF in combating land degradation should continue to be as a catalyst for
          ensuring that an integrated, cross-sectoral sustainable land management approach is
          incorporated into development projects and programs of agencies and governments. It should
          also, however, continue to provide leadership in providing capacity building particularly for
          mainstreaming, and it should provide leadership in generating high quality, innovative and
          useful knowledge for improved investment targeting, and for project design and monitoring
          to ensure that environmental and societal objectives are being met.
       4. The priority areas for investment in SLM are in the semi-arid rangelands, irrigated areas
          threatened by salinization, areas of rapid deforestation, and mixed crop-livestock systems
          in the semi-arid to subhumid zones (where degradation processes are occurring and where
          poverty rates are high). The face of land degradation is different in different areas, and there
          is no single global solution.
       5. To improve our understanding of progress in this endeavor, better analysis and accounting
          procedures of both country and donor investments and priorities are needed. UNCCD-
          related activities should be defined uniformly across donor agencies. Reporting based on
          the Rio markers (or some other agreed-upon system) should be standardized or revised (or
          both). Ultimately, this should lead to unified GM and other agency databases to enable better
          understanding of the funding mechanisms and the allocation of funds by both the donor
          community and the countries. The Facilitation Committee of the GM and the UNCCD/
          CRIC should address this issue.
       6. Knowledge generation and incorporation into project and framework design are critical for
          successful SLM activities, particularly because of their interrelated social and environmental
          aspects and the multiple scales of interventions (field, landscape, and national). Applied
          knowledge should be strengthened on how to locate, monitor, and restore degraded rangelands;
          how to determine the costs and benefits of land degradation and SLM strategies; and how
          to develop land use plans to best benefit communities and ecosystems. A common, informed
          approach to the collection of socioeconomic and environmental information would improve
          project design, monitoring, and evaluation. There should be a well-articulated and -funded
          process of knowledge generation and exchange as part of the project process. The GEF IW:
          LEARN model is a good one to build on. In addition, knowledge generation activities by
          projects such as LUCID and LADA should be continued and the results communicated to
          policy makers and planners.
       7. Close coordination between GEF, GM, and the facilitating committee will be needed to
          ensure complementarity between activities and synergy with national goals and objectives.




42 •    Resource Mobilization and the Status of Funding ofActivities Related to Land Degradation
8. The Country Pilot Programs of GEF and the World Bank's TerrAfrica initiative are
   framework activities designed to address SLM in a comprehensive way. Frameworks such
   as these will become increasingly important to coordinate donor investments-to prevent
   concentration or overlap of efforts and to ensure coverage of critical locations and activities.
   Although initial negotiations may take time, this approach is appropriate to the problem and
   should be expanded.
9. While there is some cause for cautious optimism, there are also significant challenges to be
   overcome:
   • Donors should develop long-term cross-sectoral programs and adjust success criteria to a
     new set of project objectives and priorities.
   • Countries must develop cross-sectoral and high-level policy, institutional, and financial
     structures appropriate to address their sustainable land management needs.
   • Donors and governments should find synergistic ways of working closely with the
     private sector and nongovernmental organizations in promoting SLM and reducing rural
     poverty.
   • Nongovernmental organizations should work closely with donors and government
     agencies to support sustainable land management efforts at the local level.

Appendix 3
The Economics of the Rural Poor Depending on Intact Natural Ecosystems


      E     conomies in developing countries are heavily dependent on the renewable natural resources
base. A recent study by the World Bank, Where Is the Wealth ofNations? Measuring Capital for the XX!
Century,75 shows that in 8 of the 10 poorest countries, renewable natural capital makes up 39.4 percent
of total capital, while in 9 of the 10 richest countries, the proportion of total capital represented by
renewable natural capital is only 1.5 percent. Another study, What Is Environmental Income?76 points to
the importance of the natural environment as a source of income for the poorest segment of the rural
population. A study from Zimbabwe found that as much as 40 percent of the income of the poorest
of the rural population was environmental income, not including crop production. And a meta study,
drawing upon data from numerous developing countries, found that more than 20 percent of income
was derived from forest products. The 2005 report of the World Resources Institute (WRI), entitled
The Wealth of the Poor: Managing Ecosystems to Fight Poverty,77 points out that in Africa, more than 7
in 10 poor people live in rural regions and most of them are engaged in natural resources-dependent
activities.

      All these research results point to the importance of the natural resources base in addressing
poverty and, in particular, the situation of the poorest of the poor. From that perspective, it is important
to define what conditions must be in place for the poor to be able to utilize the nattiral resources as
efficiently as possible and the barriers and bottlenecks that must be overcome to allow them to earn
a living from efficient use of natural resources. The WRI study includes five case studies drawn from
Africa and Asia. Three of the five cases are from dryland areas, while one is from a tropical forest,
and one is from a coastal fishery village. 78 A common theme from these studies is that governance
of the natural resources base is of fundamental importance. This does not translate into a call for
privatization of all land, but rather for a system wherein the rights of individuals and groups of the
society are well known, recognized, and respected.

      The study points out not only that environmental income should be seen as a way of safeguarding
against poverty but also that proper management of the natural resources base, be it from wild natural
resources or from agriculture or livestock production, is the first step in the development ladder. This
requires a broader view of the natural resources base, recognizing that an understanding of how the
total ecosystem functions is a prerequisite for optimizing the outputs from components of it. It further
requires that the natural resources-based economy gradually becomes more and more integrated
with, and part of, a larger economy. It is, however, becoming increasingly clear that unless people
living in drylands are brought into the main development process, it will not be possible to reach
the Millennium Development Goals. Both the poverty goal and the environmental sustainability
goal will be in jeopardy unless special efforts are made to more actively incorporate drylands in the
development process.

Experience of Mainstreaming Environmental Issues: Tanzania


      I nstitutional mechanisms to promote the mainstreaming of NAP issues into the Poverty
Reduction Strategy (PRS) process and into governmental poverty reduction policies and programs
are most productive when initiated and coordinated at the national level with strong political will and
support. The Tanzania experience provides insights into how environmental issues related to poverty
can be directly addressed throughout the government structure at a fairly rapid rate. The Tanzania
Parliament established a Parliamentary Committee on Environment in 2001, and soon afterward,
the Cabinet approved an institutional framework for environmental management. This led to the
drafting of a single environmental framework law the following year in the Vice President's Office.
The goal is to streamline existing policies to enhance synergy and complementarity. Issues identified
in the NAP were integrated into the government's Rural Development Strategy and the Agricultural
Sector Development Strategy of 2001. Recently, a cross-sectoral Environmental Working Group was
established to integrate environment into governmental policies and plans to ensure sustainable use
of natural resources for poverty reduction, and it was announced that environmental units will be
integrated into sectoral programs throughout the government.

      Meanwhile, the environment was included as a critical cross-cutting issue in the PRS process, and
outputs of the PRS process included (a) identification of poverty-environment issues, (b) incorporation
of environmental data in the poverty-monitoring system, and (c) capacity building of government
and nongovernment stakeholders. A series of workshops and a newsletter are providing information
to government and nongovernmental stakeholders on poverty-environment issues to integrate into
the PRS process. A Strategic Environmental Assessment was completed concerning sustainable
environmental management for poverty reduction. Poverty-environment indicators are now included
in a revised indicator list for the PRS monitoring system, and environmental sustainability has been
explicitly included in the performance action section of the Poverty Reduction Support Credit.

     Financially, the first Public Expenditure Review (PER) of the environment was initiated to provide
inputs into the government's medium-term expenditure framework and guidelines to mainstream
environmental expenditures into sectoral PERs. Priority NAP issues have been integrated into the
EU Partnership Agreement. To reduce duplication of efforts and to promote efficient utilization
of these and other financial resources, a National Synergy Workshop was held in 2001 to explore
opportunities of coordinating the implementation of the four Conventions (UNCCD, UNFCC,
CED, and Ramsar). A Multi-Sectoral Technical Committee, comprising private sector, NGOs, and
community-based organizations (CBOs), was established during this workshop to address issues
of synergy. Also, the National Coordinating Body (NCB) of the UNCCD initiated a procedure of
regularly meeting with the NCBs of other Conventions.

Mainstreaming NAPs into the PRSPs: Burkina Faso 79


     F inancing the struggle against desertification through classic funding channels turned
out to be a frustrating exercise in many African countries following their efforts to elaborate and
adopt National Action Plans (NAPs) in the framework of the UNCCD. In Burkina Faso, the NAP
elaboration and adoption followed a long participatory process and was launched in June 2000.
     The government also developed a first Poverty Reduction Strategy Framework document in
2000. The following year, Burkina Faso was declared eligible for enhanced Heavily Indebted Poor
Country (HIPC) assistance, bringing the total HIPC assistance to US$424 million.

     The evolution of these two initiatives as parallel frameworks for socioeconomic development in
Burkina Faso ended with the recent integration of the former into the latter.
      The NAP in Burkina Faso includes critical Local Development Funds for financing community-
level development plans. Community projects have been implemented for many decades in the
country. Given the fact that funds provided for the projects are subject to spatial and temporal
fragmentation and that their devolution to the local people has not always been effective, the NAP
retained a National Desertification Control Fund (FND) as the best mechanism to provide sustainable
funding for UNCCD-related activities. It would hold all :financial resources devoted to the UNCCD
and redistribute them appropriately. Unfortunately, for institutional, legal, and procedural reasons,
including those related to the donor community, this FND has not yet been put into operation, despite
governmental budgetary allocations. Activities thus continue to be implemented in the framework of
bilaterally and multilaterally funded rural development projects.

      The first three-year period of PRSP application (2000-2002) yielded mixed results. The
vulnerability of the national economy (which depends on agriculture) to climatic fluctuations
prevented the goal of 5.5 percent annual economic growth to be reached (the actual figure was 3.9
percent). Poverty incidence went up from 45 .3 percent in 1998 to 46.4 percent in 2003. To improve
the country's PRSP implementation, the government paid new attention to the coherence between
the PRSP and other sector-oriented development strategies. In October 2003, the PRSP was revised
to reflect new thoughts on the relevance of its initial objectives, widen the priority sectors, decentralize
the PRSP process, and strengthen the role of the private sector and civil society.

      The Environment Agency of Burkina Faso, noting a persistent lack of enthusiasm from the
development agencies regarding resource mobilization for the NAP, realized that funding the NAP
as a classic "autonomous" program was not meeting the expectations of the government. No direct
funding for the NAP was being received from donors.
      Thus, in 2002, a feasibility study on including the NAP in the PRSP concluded that the PRSP
strategy could and should be improved, that capacity building of the leadership team would strengthen

the process, and that many of the actions should be implemented jointly with other ministries. The
study also recommended that indicators specific to desertification should be included in the PRSP.

     In 2002 and 2003, other studies were conducted (with the support of the Global Mechanism),
which had a major impact on the process of integrating the NAP into the PRSP. These included a
review of past UNCCD-related projects and programs, a NAP financial needs assessment (including
an analysis of the spatial distribution of assistance), and the development of an operational plan for
the funding and implementation of the NAP.
      The new version of the PRSP was extended to include five additional sectors, including NAP-
related sectors. The revised PRSP was discussed at a roundtable meeting, and the donor community
announced its contribution. The global amount of financial resources announced was around US$170
million. Funding the UNCCD NAP through this channel was thus achieved.

     The experience of Burkina Faso in mainstreaming the NAP is at its beginning; time is too
short to draw conclusions. Nevertheless, this approach appears promising, provided the following
conditions are met:
       1. The challenge is great because of institutional barriers affecting cooperation. A strong and
          regular campaign of sensitization and training to acquaint all actors with the UNCCD, the
          NAP, and its operational implementation plan are critical. Memoranda of understanding
          between agencies are necessary.
       2. Two main challenges are related to the donor community: how to encourage their flexibility,
          including how to address their desire for institutional visibility related to specific projects,
          and how to convince donors to support fragmented, community-level activities without
          micromanaging the finances.
       3. In operational terms, one of the challenges is the agreement on the monitoring and evaluation
          mechanism of the NAP. Little progress was made in this area by Burkina Faso. Another
          challenge relates to the local NGOs and CBOs, because some have been established indirectly
          by political leaders and are not independent nor truly represent the rural population.

India's Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Reclamation Project I



      T he World Banlc-supported Uttar Pradesh Sodic Lands Project in the Indian plains worked
toward the reclamation ofland that had become barren because of inadequate water drainage techniques
that had resulted in sodification (severe soil salinization) and almost total loss of production. The
project worked with poor, often landless people. It organized groups of landless farmers into small
cooperatives and provided technology and land reclamation advice.

     Sodification in poorly managed irrigated areas had left an estimated 1.2 5 million hectares of
land barren in Uttar Pradesh. A further 1.25 million hectares of low-yielding, salt-affected lands
cover about 10 percent of the net cultivated area.

      The project had four main components: land reclamation, including environmental protection;
institutional development; agricultural development and technology dissemination; and reclamation
technology development and special studies. The targets for project coverage were increased at
midterm by 50 percent (to 68,800 hectares) for land reclamation, drainage, and cultivation. This
increased the number of target beneficiaries to more than 1 million people.

      The project invested substantially in participatory processes and in community mobilization
and organization before and during implementation. This enabled the physical targets of land
reclamation to be scaled up substantially and led to effective models for poverty alleviation, notably
for landless people, environmental protection, and improved agricultural production. Local NGOs
helped organize water users into basic units of four to five hectares, each of which typically comprised
10-15 families. Project staff worked with farmers to divide the land into parcels and negotiate the
complex process of ensuring clear title.

      As a result, thousands of formerly landless farmers have obtained titles to land. Yields of rice
and wheat doubled, wage rates doubled, and land values quadrupled. Farmers have planted income-
generating, high-value crops. Animal husbandry has improved, and fewer farmers abandoned their
fields to seek work in nearby cities. Women's savings and credit groups were established to supplement
family incomes. Loan repayments have been prompt, and arrears are negligible.Farmers have launched
private sector microbusinesses to provide inputs and services like seeds and tree seedlings, agricultural
extension, and soil testing. Farmers have continued cultivating reclaimed lands even after the end
of project assistance-a strong measure of project sustainability. The project achieved its objectives
of rehabilitating the land; values increased fourfold, and productivity exceeded expectations. A wide
range of collateral benefits ensued to women as well as men, and the project has become a model for
replication.

The Global Mechanism Financial Information Engine on Land Degradation


      T he UNCCD specifies that country Parties shall seek the full use and continued qualitative
improvement and rationalization of all existing national, bilateral, and multilateral funding sources
and mechanisms, while at the same time mobilize additional financial resources from the private
sector and other sources, including nongovernmental organizations (article 20). In the above context,
the Global Mechanism (GM) was specifically requested to identify and monitor funding sources,
financial opportunities, investment patterns, and trends related to UNCCD implementation.

      To discharge the above mandate, the GM built a large database on relevant project activities,
donor profiles, aid policies, and development cooperation strategies. This information is made
available online through the Financial Information Engine on Land Degradation (FIELD): http://
field.gm-unccd.org.

       The GM believes that better use of accurate statistics and knowledge will lead to improved policies
and better development outcomes. FIELD operates in this context, with the objective of supporting
evidence-based policy making, by generating knowledge specific to the resource mobilization process.
It is used not only to inform and sensitize the stakeholders on the financial risks, opportunities, costs,
and returns of investments in SLM and other activities relevant to UNCCD implementation but also
to inform the policy dialogue, monitor progress, and facilitate overall coordination in SLM/UNCCD
implementation.

     The FIELD database currently contains more than 12,000 cross-referenced records, including
more than 7,000 projects and 1, 700 publications related to the implementation of the Convention in
191 countries and regions, collected from about 4,700 official sources of more than 550 organizations
worldwide. It also contains more than 400 profiles of funding organizations involved in UNCCD
implementation, including information on their policies, strategies, priorities, eligibility criteria, and
application modalities. This information is classified according to a multidimensional set of about 150
thematic topics. Between 2003 and 2005, access to the FIELD website increased 2.5 times, from an
average of 13,000 to more than 32,000 monthly visits from more than 150 countries worldwide.

     In the framework of the GM's consolidated strategy and enhanced approach to resource
mobilization, this large information base is instrumental for the identification of the drivers, incentive
measures, and strategies for engaging stakeholders and for mainstreaming SLM into relevant policies,
programs, and investment frameworks. Furthermore, FIELD increases the visibility of emerging
financial opportunities arising from foreign and domestic private investments, trade, subsidies and
market development, carbon finance, renewable energy finance, payments for ecosystem services, and
private philanthropy.

      The Rio markers, developed by the OECD/DAC in consultation with the secretariats of the
three Rio Conventions, represent a first step toward more accuracy, harmonization, and quality in
the relevant data, reports, and analyses prepared by the donor countries. A joint letter sent in January
2004 by the Executive Secretaries of the Rio Conventions to the Chair of the DAC recognized the

importance of the Rio markers, which would allow countries "not only to estimate the ODA financial
flows and identify trends, but can also serve as the basis for streamlining the reporting of the aid-
related activities under the Rio Conventions by Parties, thus ensuring provision of consistent data
and avoiding double reporting."
