Executive Summary
Background

Cities have long held a central place of importance in society as hubs of commerce, culture, and
political power. Because of climate change, however, the clustering together of large numbers of
people and high levels of economic activity also creates vulnerabilities. Some will be found
directly within a city: people living and working in coastal areas or in river floodplains may be
subject to the impacts of sea level rise or extreme rainfall events that put their lives or businesses
at peril. Urban climate change can also take other forms, however, including situations where
impacts occurring far outside of a city can affect systems (e.g. water or energy supply) essential to
life within the city.

In some parts of the world, central governments are taking note, requiring cities to take action to
ensure the economic engine of their country is not harmed. With the support of international
NGOs providing technical support, many local authorities are also becoming more engaged,
concerned about long-term impacts facing their city or cognizant of the fact that some climate
mitigation actions can actually result in cost savings, making the city more economically
competitive.

In Romania, where the urbanization rate is roughly 55%, the Government of Romania has
commissioned this Advisory Services report from the World Bank to explore how to operationalize
an urban climate strategy within the structure of the European Union’s new 2014-2020 Operating
Program. This report presents the results for the rapid assessment of the current state of (and
opportunities for improved) urban climate planning in Romania; what is known about how cities in
Romania contribute to climate change; and how cities in Romania will be affected by climate
change. To complete this rapid assessment, the World Bank team relied on an extensive literature
review and in-person, semi-structured interviews with more than two dozen central and local
government officials, private sector experts, academics, and civil society organizations
knowledgeable about climate change topics in Romania. The depth of this rapid assessment was
necessarily limited by the short time frame available to carry out the research, and by data gaps
on local climate planning activities, local GHG emission levels, and the climate risks faced by cities
around Romania.

This rapid assessment nonetheless found sufficient information to allow the team to develop a
portrait of the current state of urban climate efforts in Romania, and identify gaps that can be
addressed through improved planning practices, policy changes, or capital investments. EU
Operating Program funds for the 2014-2020 period can be instrumental in supporting these
changes, which are presented as recommendations at the conclusion of each section of the
report.




The Current State of Urban Climate Knowledge and Planning in Romania

Globally, cities are estimated to be responsible for 70% of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions,
but little is known about the contribution of urban areas to Romania’s current emissions picture.
There is a similar dearth of knowledge about how Romanian cities will be affected by climate
change, as there has been very little research undertaken to statistically ‘downscale’ global
climate models to provide a more granular, local picture of how the climate will change in the
coming decades. Of course, national level climate studies do exist, projecting that Romania will
get warmer (with strong regional differences) and that both drought and extreme rainfall events
are to become more commonplace in the coming century, again with strong regional differences.
Such information does little to help a local authority assess what specific actions they should take
going forward, however. This knowledge gap could be remedied if the National Administration of
Meteorology were to receive funding support to carry out climate risk studies for each large urban
area around the country. Such work would allow existing disaster planning efforts to broaden
their scope in an informed manner, addressing a wider range of risks that could affect a given city.

In the case of the carbon mitigation side of the equation, more information is known. For
example, as of September 2013, there were 60 communities (representing roughly 5 million
people) from around Romania that have signed up to the ‘Covenant of Mayors’, a European
Commission-supported initiative aimed at promoting sustainable energy use in cities. Each
community is required to develop an action plan within a year of signing up for the Covenant
program. The 30 Romanian communities submitting their plans thus far have heavily emphasized
actions focused on improving energy efficiency in buildings and addressing local transport
problems. Other climate-related planning work is taking place in seven Romanian cities where the
World Bank has supported local energy efficiency planning efforts. These analyses similarly place
a big emphasis on addressing local building energy use and transport issues. It would be helpful if
EU Operating Program funds were made available to broaden the focus and quality of this work,
and to expand the number of cities where such plans have been prepared.

In other words, there is considerable work to be done in Romania on urban climate planning
matters. Specific policy interventions and investments the Government of Romania should
consider for the 2014-2020 EU Operating Program period are as follows, broken out into near- and

Urban Transport Sector

Romania’s transport sector is responsible for 11.8% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions, a
rate lower than the EU average, but one that is growing quickly. Car ownership rates in Romania
are similarly low compared to the rest of the EU, but they too are on the rise, suggesting that as
the Romanian economy grows, car usage will grow as well.

Narrowing the geographic focus, there is little hard information about the urban transport
situation in Romania as it relates to climate change. Several World Bank sponsored energy
efficiency studies indicate that traffic congestion is a big problem in many cities, giving rise to GHG
and other emissions from cars stuck in traffic. Many cities have public transport systems
(including buses, trams and trolleys), but declining ridership makes it difficult for system operators
to finance those upgrades which might bring riders back to the system. Taxis are plentiful in most
Romanian cities, but many of the vehicles are old and not fuel-efficient, mirroring the make-up of
the nation’s vehicle fleet. Some cities have an age limit for taxi vehicles, but this varies
significantly from city to city. Finally, the pedestrian and cycling infrastructure varies greatly in
quality and quantity between different towns and cities, and within different city areas.

A national General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) is currently under development but it does not
cover urban transport investment and policy interventions. This is because responsibility for

urban transport investment generally sits with the municipalities in Romania, under the aegis of
the Ministry for Regional Development and Public Administration, rather than with the Ministry of
Transport, which has responsibility for the development of the GTMP. Sustainable urban mobility
plans (SUMPs) will be developed for the seven growth pole cities and Bucharest/Ilfov by the end
of 2014, but such plans should also be developed for other cities around the country.

Climate change is expected to have several impacts on urban transport systems across Romania,
although the exact nature of these impacts will naturally be very localized. Higher temperatures
and more frequent heat waves (particularly in the south and south-east of Romania) are likely to
cause problems with road and rail infrastructure. Asphalt roads may become soft and deform
under the weight of vehicles, causing traffic restrictions to be put in place, particularly for heavy
vehicles. Railway lines may also buckle under high temperatures, which can again lead to speed
and usage restrictions, while higher temperatures can affect the thermal expansion of bridge
joints affecting bridge operation and increasing maintenance costs. Higher temperatures and heat
waves are likely to cause discomfort and possible safety risk to rail and other transport passengers
in cities, requiring improved ventilation at Metro stations, and improved ventilation or air
conditioning on trains, metro trains, trams, trolleybuses and buses. Intense rainfall and flash
floods may damage rail, road and waterborne transport infrastructure, rendering some systems
temporarily non-operational.

Despite all of these potential impacts, however, concerns about climate change are not likely to be
the key driver of urban transport policies or investment decisions. Instead, local co-benefits – such
as reduced traffic congestion or improved air quality – are much more likely to drive the
development of transport policies.

Urban Energy Sector

In Romania, the energy sector is responsible for 70% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Power and heat generation and non-transport fuel use contribute to three quarters of this total.
GHG emissions from this sector have been declining, due to huge contractions in the economy and
through energy efficiency improvements.

Among EU27 countries, Romania has the lowest per-capita energy consumption. Per capita
consumption of electricity is particularly low, but significant growth in electricity demand is
already occurring, driven mainly by the residential and commercial sectors. Some of this growth is
occurring as households move away from their reliance on district heating. Overall, the number of
households connected to district heating, mostly in large, urban apartment buildings, declined
from 2.2 million to 1.4 million between 1990-2012.

The European Union sets the framework for the sustainable energy policies of its member states.
The overarching long-term goal is the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions 80-
95% below 1990 levels by 2050, through investments in energy efficiency and low-carbon and
smart energy infrastructure. Over the medium-term, the EU’s energy and climate policy is focused
on the so-called 20-20-20 targets that were adopted in 2007: by 2020, GHG emissions should be
20% below 1990 levels; renewables should reach a share of 20% of final energy consumption; and
primary energy consumption should be reduced by 20%, compared with the projected baseline.
Romania is likely to meet all three targets, reflecting a huge contraction of its otherwise carbon
intensive economy.

High level energy policies (e.g. market regulation, pricing policies, etc.) are the province of the
Romanian government, while local authorities are responsible for public service infrastructure
provision and the oversight of buildings within their territory. Local energy planning is required
for all municipalities with more than 20,000 inhabitants. Some municipalities are very interested
and active in energy efficiency/GHG issues, as exemplified by their voluntary participation in the
EU’s Covenant of Mayors Program.

Energy markets around Romania have been partially liberalized. The power sector follows the
model of liberalized wholesale and retail markets. Electricity production is unbundled from
transmission, giving residential consumers the right to switch suppliers. Since this program
started in 2007, however, few have done so because regulated prices are well below free market
rates. Natural gas and district heating rates also remain heavily subsidized. Regulated electricity
and gas prices for non-households are scheduled to be fully liberalized by January 2014 and
January 2015, respectively, and regulated electricity and gas prices for households will be
liberalized by January 2018 and January 2019, respectively. The current price support schemes for
district heating are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable future.

From an urban perspective, the most important issues are energy prices and the Romanian
government’s inability to deal with the ailing district heating sector. District heating systems are a
prominent feature of many Romanian cities, but their use is declining. The 300 systems operating
in 1995/96 had declined in number to 100 by 2011, of which 83 are in urban areas. In 16 of the 31
district heating systems with more than 10,000 customers, the number of customers has dropped
by more than 50%. In many cities, district heating has become a serious drain on public finances
because tariffs for residential consumers are highly subsidized, on average by 50%.

Service quality, cost, and concern over high pollution levels are among the primary reasons for
declining demand. Most of the old inefficient cogeneration units and heat-only boilers have still
not been upgraded or replaced with modern generation equipment, nor are they equipped with
adequate burning equipment, resulting in SO2 and NOX emissions that exceed EU norms. With an
average of 275 tons of CO2 per Gcal, Romania’s district heating producers rank among the most
polluting service suppliers in the EU. Heat distribution networks suffer an average of 30% heat
and water losses, compared to 5-10% for newer networks. As a result of those inefficiencies, the
cost of district heating is about 18-20% higher than in some other EU countries.

investments the Government of Romania should consider going forward include the following.

                 and could potentially attract private financing if
                 proven successful.



Urban Solid Waste Sector

Collectively, the GHG emissions associated with municipal solid waste disposal in Romania total
approximately 2% of the country’s overall emissions. The majority result from the country’s
overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its primary waste management strategy. Organic waste
entombed in a landfill decays anaerobically, produces methane, a GHG with 25 times the heat
trapping potential of carbon dioxide. Unless the landfill is designed to capture the methane via a
series of pipes embedded in the garbage, the gas will slowly leak out of a landfill for many years,
including long after a landfill is formally closed. Very few landfills in Romania have the ability to
capture or flare this gas, meaning most methane is released directly to the atmosphere.

Thanks to extensive EU Operating Program support during the 2007-2013 period, Romania’s EU-
mandated efforts to close and replace poorly managed solid waste dumpsites with sanitary
landfills are well underway, but efforts to address existing methane leakage are unclear. The
Romanian Government can keep this situation from becoming even more problematic going
forward, ramping up efforts to divert organic waste material discarded in cities into alternative
waste processing methods such as composting or anaerobic digestion (AD). Both techniques
prevent the release of methane into the atmosphere, while simultaneously creating either a useful
soil nutrient amendment and/or energy that can replace fossil fuels.

The EU accession agreement has already established a timetable for this to be achieved, requiring
65% of all biodegradable waste generated in Romania to be diverted from landfills by 2020.
Romania’s performance thus far is relatively weak, but achieving this target and other recycling
requirements could cut solid waste GHG emission levels by 50% or more. To succeed, cities
around Romania will likely have to engage in some type of separate collection of waste materials
or otherwise support the development of facilities focused on organic waste processing and
markets ready to consume the resulting high quality soil amendment. There are several city-
based programs around the world that can serve as models for these efforts.

Less clear is the impact that climate change will have on solid waste facilities and programs around
Romania; more work must be undertaken to analyze this issue.

investments the Government of Romania should consider going forward include the following.

Urban Water Sector

Like the solid waste sector, urban water supply and treatment systems contribute very little to
Romania’s overall urban GHG emissions picture, totaling roughly 2.34% of overall GHG emissions
in 2009.

There is nonetheless room for improvement in terms of the efficiency of utility operations,
reducing current high water loss levels and reducing methane emissions from wastewater
treatment facilities. Some system upgrades have occurred during the 2007-2013 Operating
Program period, when a sizable amount of funds were allocated to help Romania address its
historically poor surface and ground water quality. Significant gains have been made at these new
facilities, but much work remains to be done, meaning water system upgrades should continue as
a high investment priority in the next Operating Program. At the same time these investments are
being pursued for environmental quality and cost efficiency reasons, these system upgrades
deliver climate change mitigation benefits at little or no additional cost.

More significant concerns arise in terms of protecting Romania’s urban water supply and
treatment network from the impacts of climate change. Romania’s water supply picture is already
relatively poor compared to most other countries in Europe, with some parts of the country
already enduring supply constraints during the summer. This situation is likely to get worse going
forward. Climate impact studies looking at future hydrological conditions in three of the country’s
11 river basins project the demand-supply gap in these regions is expected to be manageable for
the next 15-20 years, but significant demand reduction measures or new supply capacity will be
needed after that. Additional research is needed in the other water basins, to provide a
comprehensive picture of the challenges certain cities might face in decades to come.

Other investments may be necessary to reduce the impacts on the distribution and treatment
systems. Localized climate impact studies will be necessary to help identify the specific threats
facing these systems.

High priority urban water sector policy interventions and Operating Program-supported
investments the Government of Romania should consider going forward include the following.
Recommendations that can be implemented over a longer time frame are also identified here:

Conclusion

Approaching climate change from an urban perspective places boundaries around the topic that
are different than the national or sectoral orientation traditionally applied to the topic. The use of
urban boundaries changes the conversation in meaningful ways, because the impacts on a specific
economy, piece of infrastructure, or neighborhood become much more tangible.

In the 2014-2020 Operating Program period, the Romanian Government has an excellent
opportunity to target the mitigation and adaptation needs of cities across the country. Some of
these funds would necessarily represent a continuation of initiatives from the prior programming
period, but efforts should necessarily prioritize the energy and transport sectors. These are the
two largest contributors to Romania’s overall GHG emissions picture, and they face greater
vulnerabilities as a result of climate change. The solid waste and water also require continued
attention, however, to ensure that Romania achieves the environmental gains and other accession
commitments it made when joining the European Union several years ago. Efforts targeting these
sectors can still be positioned as climate-related investments, helping satisfy Romania’s obligation
to spend no less than 20% of its operating program funds on climate-focused activities.

This report has also highlighted significant data and planning gaps that must be addressed. Little
is known about the GHG emission profile of most Romanian cities, or the specific climate risks
these cities will face in the coming decades. Using EU Operating Program funds to support such
analyses would provide the foundation for comprehensive planning activities essential to the
future of Romania’s cities. To the maximum extent possible, these climate plans should be woven

into any long term economic and spatial development strategies that central and regional
government officials are already pursuing. Doing so is critical to ensure that Romania does not
lock its cities into a high carbon pathway, or that policies and investments made today will not
place future economic activity or lives at risk once the impacts of climate change become more
manifest.

Section 1: Viewing Climate Change through an Urban ‘Lens’ – A
New Way of Structuring Climate Action Plan Development

1.1 Background

1. Cities have long held a central place of importance in society as hubs of commerce, culture,
and political power. Current global urbanization trends – such as the fact that more than 50% of
the world’s population now resides in urban areas – speak to the desirability of cities on many
different levels.

2. There are consequences of this trend, however. Although cities provide economic
opportunity for many, in some cases serving as economic engines for entire countries, daily life
and commerce occurring in cities also result in high levels of greenhouse gas emissions (GHG)
which contribute to global climate change. In 2013, the Global Energy Assessment estimated that
76% of total global primary energy use occurs in urban areas1, while climate-focused city networks
like the C40 regularly claim that urban-related GHG emissions represent roughly 70% of global
totals.

3. As the impacts of climate change appear to be growing more unavoidable given the lack of
global agreement on how to achieve deep GHG emission cuts, the clustering together of large
numbers of people and high levels of economic activity also creates vulnerabilities. Some will be
found directly within a city: people living and working in coastal areas or in river floodplains may
be subject to the impacts of sea level rise or extreme rainfall events that put their lives or
businesses at peril. World Bank researchers recently estimated that coastal flooding losses in the
136 largest coastal cities around the globe will increase from $6 billion/year in 2005 to $1 trillion
or more every year by 2050 as a result of climate change.2 Another analysis prepared by the
Potsdam Institute for the World Bank found that climate change impacts will also vary widely from
city to city, leaving some cities under water while others must endure crippling drought, losing
access to water for power generation or the local drinking water supply.3

4. Urban climate change can also take other forms, however, including situations where impacts
occurring far outside of a city can create risks to those within the city. An excellent example of
this occurred in August 2013, when a drought-exacerbated wildfire in the mountains of California
shut down a hydropower facility owned by San Francisco municipal government. San Francisco is
located 260 km away from the dam site, but the impacts of the fire were felt directly and

immediately: the local authority was forced to buy electricity on the open market, driving up the
local authority’s electricity expenditures by $600,000 in the first week alone.4

5. As these facts collectively imply, addressing climate change at a city level is a complex but
necessary undertaking for most countries. Part of the challenge arises from the fact that the
evidence base justifying action can be elusive. Few countries have undertaken comprehensive
assessments of the contribution cities make to national GHG emissions. Similarly, few countries
have comprehensive assessment of the impacts climate change might impose on their cities either
positively or negatively.

6. In addition, there is the question of who must take action to reduce emissions or promote
climate resilience within a city. Local authorities do enjoy significant policymaking and regulatory
powers, but there are limits to this power. Sometimes, central government stakeholders or the
private sector must play a more prominent role if a city is to minimize both its greenhouse gas
emissions and its climate vulnerabilities. A common problem is how to pay for the changes
necessary within a city; in some cases efficiency gains may more than offset the cost. At other
times, however, quantifying the benefits of action can be elusive. Finally, the breadth of planning
action that must be taken is necessarily broad, encompassing many sectors that are often treated
as standalone policy silos – transportation, energy, or water systems, for example – making the
planning and implementation challenge more daunting both institutionally and budgetarily.

7. To look at climate change through an urban ‘lens’ is thus to impose different boundaries
around the issue, both from a policymaking and analytic perspective. There has been
considerable work undertaken around the world to explore what cities can do to address climate
change, but as noted above, there are few national level analyses that do this. The Romanian
government is to be applauded for its decision to address climate change from this vantage point.

8. This report is an outgrowth of the Government of Romania’s request that the World Bank
provide Advisory Services on climate change, including operationalizing its climate strategy in
terms relevant to the European Union’s new 2014-2020 Operating Program. This report is a
deliverable under Component B of the Advisory Services (Support the Preparation of the Climate
Change-related Actions under the 2014-2020 Operational Programs.) This report presents the
results for the rapid assessment of the urban sector, seeking to inform the Government’s effort to
identify urban GHG reduction and climate resilient policy and investment activities that can be
carried out under the auspices of operational programs. As background to these
recommendations, the report also discusses:

        a. The current state of urban development and governance in Romania
        b. What is known about how cities in Romania contribute to climate change, and how
           cities in Romania will be affected by climate change.
        c. Global best practice on city-level climate planning, and how this stacks up with the
           current level and type of climate planning underway in Romania.
        d. Strategies the Romanian government can pursue to support the development of more
           comprehensive city-level climate planning efforts around the country.

9. Because the urban sector is a spatially (rather than topically) bounded sector, the report also
necessarily looks at climate change mitigation and adaptation/resilience in four key urban
infrastructure-focused sectors: energy, transport, water, and waste. The energy and transport
discussions synthesize the urban-relevant portions of the larger standalone energy and transport
reports prepared under this Advisory Services project. The water and waste sectors generate a
relatively small amount of GHG emissions, but progress made during the last programming period
(2007-2013) to meet basic health and environmental protection goals simultaneously delivered
carbon mitigation benefits. Work upgrading these operations in cities around Romania will
continue, to ensure compliance with EU accession requirements, so the goal of this report is to
explore whether urban climate ‘lens’ provides new insights to this work.

10. Each section of the report concludes with recommendations on specific steps the Romanian
government should pursue to improve the local climate policy or market landscape, or
programmatic activities that could potentially be supported by EU structural fund allocations.

1.2     Research Methods and Limitations of this Analysis

11. To complete this rapid assessment, the World Bank team relied on an extensive literature
review and in person semi-structured interviews with more than two dozen central and local
government officials, private sector experts, academics, and civil society organizations
knowledgeable about climate change topics in Romania. Recommendations included at the
conclusion of each section were based on input provided by many of those interviewed for this
report, the team’s knowledge of international best practice, and the team’s efforts to provide a
strategic framework that will enhance Romania’s urban climate change planning efforts over both
the short and long term.

12. As this report frequently notes, the analysis was limited by the short time frame available to
carry out the research (June through October 2013). The term’s analysis was also hampered by
significant data gaps on local climate planning activities; local GHG emission levels; the climate
risks faced by cities around Romania; and waste and water system upgrades carried out under the
2007-2013 Operating Program. In many cases, the underlying analytic work does not exist, or it
has not been compiled and made available in published form. Although the team did include
some native language speakers, language barriers may also have affected the team’s ability to
examine the full array of information available via the internet.

13. In the case of GHG emissions data, some information was available from cities participating in
the Covenant of Mayors program, but the methods used to comply with that program do not
present a comprehensive portrait of local emission sources, making the data unusable for this
analysis. This is not necessarily the fault of local authorities, but instead is a function of the
approach endorsed by the EU’s Covenant of Mayors program, the developer of this methodology.
[See Section 1.5 for more information on this topic.]

14. Finally, the timing of the work created some challenges because work occurred concurrently
with the Romanian Government’s development of operating program recommendations for the
next programming period. This timing overlap made it difficult for the team to consistently
contribute to the process and keep track of strategies under consideration by the Romanian
government for inclusion in the final OP submission to the EU.

1.3 Urbanization and Urban Governance in Romania – A Brief Overview

15. Officially, the urbanization rate in Romania is roughly 55%, a level that is somewhat low
compared to other parts of Europe. This rate has remained fairly constant for the past two
decades, thus mirroring the situation in many other Eastern European countries shifting from a
centrally planned economy to free market conditions.

16. As other recent research by the World Bank has pointed out, however, Romania has been
suburbanizing, with the areas immediately around major cities growing by 300,000 even as there
has been significant migration out of the country entirely. Because central government
demographers still categorize some of these regions outside the urban core as rural, this shift has
not yet made its way into the official population statistics.5 If this were done, the urbanization
rate could rise to 65.2%, the level cited in the World Bank’s 2009 World Development Report.6

17. Population losses and location shifts manifest themselves in changing densification rates in
Romania’s growth pole cities. As seen in Table 1, density levels in these cities are declining across
the board, in some cases by as much as 48%.

20. Planning activity in cities and urban regions is largely governed by Law 350/2001 which seeks
to balance social and economic development across the country. The law also seeks to manage
__________________________________________________________________________
Page 22 of 76                                                     Urban Sector Rapid Assessment Report
natural resources, protect the environment, rationalize land use patterns in and around cities, and
provide coherence to planning activities being carried out by different jurisdictions (local
authorities, counties, etc.), each of whom have different, yet occasionally overlapping, sets of
responsibilities.

21. Since 2008, national urban policy has also focused around three different types of ‘growth
poles’ that are to serve as economic engines for Romania. Growth poles are divided into (1) seven
large urban centers (plus Bucharest) and their areas of geographic and economic influence; (2)
‘urban development poles’ consisting of 13 municipalities and towns, and (3) smaller urban
centers consisting of towns over 10,000 inhabitants.

22. The growth pole concept identifies a single local authority at the nucleus of the region that is
to work collaboratively with other territorial administrative units in its vicinity. Integrated urban
development plans (IUDPs)7 must be developed for each of these regions, elaborating both a local
vision and a specific set of projects, timeline, budget, and financing sources designed to deliver
that vision.

23. IUDPs must cover at least two of the three priority investment areas:

        a. Rehabilitation of urban infrastructure and improvement of urban services, including
           urban transport
        b. Development of a sustainable business environment, and
        c. Rehabilitation of social infrastructure, including social housing, and improvement of
           social services

24. Although they may share common themes, Integrated Urban Development Plans vary widely
from city to city, reflecting unique needs and local policy and political preferences.8 It goes
beyond the ability of this rapid assessment project to characterize these plans; gauge the extent
to which each of these plans reflect the critical infrastructure needs of the region; gauge the
extent to which full deployment of these strategies would provide significant climate mitigation
and/or adaptation benefits; or explore the nature of the underlying analysis or political
environment that leads local authorities to identify projects as priority investments. What is
worth noting, however, is the intent to coordinate planning activity across jurisdictions on topics
that are highly germane to a climate planning conversation. A key question, therefore, is the
extent to which these IUDPs can be leveraged to achieve different urban climate goals. This topic
will be taken up below.


1.4 What we know about how Romanian Cities Contribute to Climate Change, and how
    Climate Change may affect Romanian Cities



7
  The concept of IUDPs was established under the EU Regio’s Regional Operating Program Axis 1 , seeking to
ensure comprehensive, integrated plan development rather than sector-specific approaches.

25. It is increasingly recognized that cities can benefit from an inventory that details how GHG
emissions are generated in their city. This inventory is primarily designed to serve as the fact base
upon which a climate mitigation strategy can be crafted. If every city in the world had such an
inventory, it would be an easy exercise to estimate the collective contribution that daily life and
economic activity clustered in cities makes to the global GHG emissions picture. That is
unfortunately not the case.

26. It is a similar situation in Romania. Many cities round the country have prepared some form
of emissions inventory, but this number pales in comparison to the total number of analyses that
would be necessary to give us a clear sense of the level of GHG emissions that Romanian cities
generate in aggregate. Such a number would be powerful, giving the Romanian government
information on the extent to which cities should be targeted for assistance; isolate which sectors
are the greatest contributors to the problem; and identify which cities are most in need of
assistance because of their high rate of emissions.

27. The World Bank team made an initial attempt to extrapolate a Romanian urban GHG
emissions estimate using information provided by several dozen cities that have submitted
Sustainable Energy Action Plans to the EU’s Covenant of Mayors program, as these plans must
include an emissions inventory. Upon review of these inventories, however, it was clear that they
were unusable for this purpose because Covenant rules give cities wide latitude in determining
which sectors to include in their inventory. Some of the inventories submitted thus far are very
narrowly written, ignoring sectors over which the local authority has limited control, such as local
industrial activity. Including these sectors in the emissions inventory would add greatly to local
emission totals, although how much these numbers would change in total is unclear.

28. Limited information is also available on the climate impacts side of the equation, particularly
at the individual city scale.

29. Several national level climate trends have been identified in the draft Romanian Climate
Change Adaptation Strategy9:

        a. Romania is warming, with strong regional differences. Average winter temperatures
           will increase at a faster rate in the Carpathians than in the rest of the country, while
           summer high temperatures will tend to increase more in the south and southeast than
           in the north.
        b. Overall rainfall levels will diminish in the summer, particularly in the south and
           southeast, giving rise to concerns by national water authorities that these regions may
           be unable to meet their future water needs. 10 At the same time, however, extreme
           rainfall events are expected to grow both in frequency and intensity, leading to flash
           flooding.

30. Under ideal circumstances, these types of detailed climate change impact projections would
be developed for individual cities or urban areas. Table 1.3 shows how downscaled climate

models can project climate impacts at the local level. These projections11 were prepared by
university-based climate researchers partnering with the City of New York, and these impact
estimates have served as the basis for New York City’s highly regarded adaptation strategy
released in 2013.

31. To date, the National Meteorology Administration (NAM) has had insufficient resources to
statistically downscale global climate models to provide highly granular information on
temperature, precipitation, and other climate trends for different parts of the country. (The city
of Arad did finance such a study by NAM, but this appears to be the exception rather than the
rule.) Academic researchers have also prepared a climate impacts study of Baia Mare City12, but
this too is a rare case.

conditions. Figure 1.2 displays how future flood risk projections can be converted into highly
detailed estimates of the risk facing individual buildings in a city.

33. Understanding change in the length or intensity of heat waves can be particularly important in
cities, which already experience higher temperatures due to the ‘urban heat island’ effect, a
situation where short wave thermal radiation is retained in paved surfaces and buildings,
increasing ambient temperatures. The lower incidence of natural features (trees, etc.) that cool
the air in urban areas through evapotranspiration also exacerbates the problem. In Bucharest, for
example, the temperature difference in the city center in mid-summer averages +2.9°C compared
to the periphery, and was approximately +3.8°C during the July 2007 heat wave heat that killed
nearly 20 people across the country.13

identify neighborhoods that have large numbers of elderly people or other populations that might
be at risk during extreme heat events. Protocols can then be put in place to target those

neighborhoods for extra assistance or attention during heat waves, much as was done in many
European cities following the deadly 2003 heat wave.14


1.5 Urban Climate Planning as a National Policy Focus

35. Efforts to address climate mitigation and adaptation/resilience concerns in cities have grown
exponentially both in stature and frequency around the world in recent years. The genesis of
these plans varies. Some cities seek to address local health or environmental concerns, or pursue
strategies that enhance the attractiveness and economic competitiveness of their city.
Greenhouse gas reductions or enhanced resilience to the impacts of climate change are a
fortuitous but not essential side benefit of these plans. Other cities are taking action because the
public and/or local politicians wish to take action in the absence of any global agreement on how
to address the problem.

36. For the most part, cities engaging in climate planning are doing so of their own volition, for
the reasons cited above. There are some instances, however, where central governments are
stepping in to require action at the local level. In the Philippines, for example, the Climate Change
Act of 2009 established strong requirements for municipalities across the country, noting that
local government units “shall be the frontline agencies in the formulation, planning and
implementation of climate change action plans in their respective areas.”15 Specific requirement
of the law include:

        a. Municipal and city governments must consider climate change adaptation as one of
           their regular functions.
        b. Provincial government is to provide technical assistance, enforcement and
           information management in support of municipal and city climate change action
           plans.
        c. Local government units must regularly update their respective action plans to reflect
           changing social, economic, and environmental conditions and emerging issues.
        d. Local government units must mobilize and allocate necessary personnel, resources
           and logistics to effectively implement their action plans.
        e. It is the responsibility of national government to extend technical and financial
           assistance to local government units for the implementation of their plan.
        f. Local government units are expressly authorized to appropriate funds from its annual
           revenue allotment to implement local climate plans.

37. In other parts of the world, urban climate plan requirements are taking a slightly different
form. The Republic of Korea’s Framework Act on Low Carbon, Green Growth was passed in 2010,
requiring central government, local governments, and other designated public institutions to
establish energy savings and GHG emissions reduction targets.16 In addition, each year agencies

and institutions subject to the law must report GHG emissions and energy consumption levels and
cities and provinces are required to establish a “Low Carbon Green Growth Local Action Plan”
every five years, which is to include an analysis of previously implemented actions, their updated
vision and strategy, and expected results. The plan must also assign implementation
responsibilities to the relevant local authorities.17

38. In France, the Environmental Code requires regular reporting on greenhouse gas emissions
from the State, regions, counties, cities, and municipalities with more than 50,000 inhabitants. The
report is made public and must be updated at least every three years. Each region’s president is
responsible for the coordination of data collection and consistency of assessments across
localities. 18

39. Thus far, Romanian climate policy has not adopted such a specific urban climate focus, or
embraced specific urban climate planning tenets like those described above. This is a situation the
Romanian Government may wish to reconsider.

40. For example, the 5th National Communication on Climate Change19 (dated 2010) is largely
silent on the type of local level climate planning work that should occur, emphasizing instead the
types of high level sectoral policy or infrastructure changes that are necessary to reduce GHG
emissions or mitigate some of the climate impacts expected in Romania. These changes include
resizing stormwater systems; expanding the level of permeable surfaces in cities; changing market
rules to promote renewables deployment; and developing and implementing green building
guidelines so as to make buildings more climate friendly from both a mitigation and adaptation
perspective. It was also suggested that training programs be established to improve the
knowledge of Romanian architects about climate change issues.

41. More recently, Romania’s National Climate Change Strategy (2012-2020) identified steps that
must be taken to enhance climate resilience around the country. Initiatives or strategies were
identified for the buildings, transport, and water sectors, among others. The project also
identified which stakeholders (generally Romanian ministries) must take the lead in driving this
work. The specific role local authorities are to play was not clear, although some references were
made to their role in increasing public awareness about climate change adaptation. The report
did conclude by noting, however, that “the adaptation component from National Climate Change
Strategy will be overtaken and continuously improved at the local level of public administration,
through specific measures relevant to the geo-politic, economic circumstances, local public needs
and in the same time local administrative bodies will develop action plans on climate change.”20

42. There are, of course, other policy and planning initiatives in place that lend themselves to
climate planning activities in Romania, particularly on the low carbon side of the equation. The
Integrated Urban Development Plans required for growth pole cities and urban development
poles all necessarily focus on transport and other major infrastructure systems, discussing what
must be done to bring them into compliance with EU standards for safety and environmental
quality. Energy efficiency is another common theme in these plans, through the National Energy
Efficiency Strategy (GD 163/2004), the National Strategy Regarding the Thermal Power Supply of
Cities (GD 882/2004), and Government Ordinance 22/2008. Some of these laws place
responsibility for action squarely on local authority agendas.

43. In terms of climate adaptation/resilience, planning activity has largely been driven by disaster
management requirements established under the Ministry of Administration and Internal Affairs
(Ministerial Order 160/2007 and 1474/2006), which allocate responsibilities for different types of
emergency situations. The National Emergency Management System (NEMS) administered by the
Ministry is responsible for the provision of human, material and financial resources in order to
prevent and manage all types of emergency situations, not just those that are climate-related. The
NEMS is comprised by a network of government bodies, which are divided according to their
specific area of expertise and the resources available to them (Government Decision no.
2288/2004). The institutions that support the NEMS on climate change related topics are:

        a. Ministry of Internal Affairs: fires, failure of public utilities.
        b. Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration: landslides.
        c. Ministry of Economy: major failure of electricity transmission lines, failure of hydro-
           technical works, landslides and land collapses.
        d. Ministry of Environment and Climate Change: extreme meteorological phenomena,
           river and coastal pollution, failure of hydro technical works, floods and forest fires.
        e. Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development: drought, hail, pest invasions and
           pandemics.
        f. Ministry of Health: epidemics and pandemics.
        g. Ministry of Transport: heavy snowfalls, glazed frost and ice jams on Danube River.

44. Prevention and management of emergency situations occurs at the county and prefecture
level, with local authorities having responsibility for local level emergency management and
prevention. Local authorities are required to have hazard and risk maps for their territorial-
administrative units but these are reportedly incomplete, inconsistent, out of date, or simply not
available for some cities. The extent to which these plans account for the full array of climate
impacts anticipated across Romania is unclear. Part of the challenge arises from how climate
change is treated from a planning perspective – as purely an emergency response issue, or as
something that can be planned for and adequately addressed over time through capital
investment and policy changes.


1.6 Best Practice Urban Climate Planning and the Current Situation in Romanian Cities

45. There is much work going on in cities around the world that relates to climate mitigation and
adaptation planning, although these efforts vary widely in scope and quality. Generally speaking,


__________________________________________________________________________
Page 29 of 76                                                  Urban Sector Rapid Assessment Report
more attention has been focused on low carbon
planning rather than adaptation/resilience, although
this is beginning to change.

46. City-focused NGOs (e.g., ICLEI Local Governments
for Sustainability, C40 Cities Climate Leadership
Group) or city-focused environmental accords (such
as the Durban Adaptation Charter and the Urban
Environmental Accords) are playing a key role in
supporting this work, providing networking
opportunities or technical assistance and guidance on
how to proceed with climate planning at the local
level. As these entities have grown in prominence, so
too has their political clout and involvement in global
climate negotiations. Technical guidance materials
are now widely available, addressing issues from
either a very narrow or broad perspective. (See Table
1.4 for an example of some of the more noteworthy
documents of this type.)

47. It is difficult to summarize the totality of urban climate planning experience around the world,
but ‘ideal’ plans and planning processes tend to exhibit the following characteristics:

        a. Comprehensive scope of coverage: the best urban climate plans are multi-dimensional
           (meaning they address both climate change mitigation and adaptation/resilience),
           multi-temporal (covering short, medium, and long term time frames), and multi-
           sectoral (covering all relevant infrastructure systems or policy priority areas, including
           energy, transport, water and waste systems; land use planning; industrial activity; and
           climate ‘governance’)
        b. Plans are evidence based: the best plans include an analysis of how GHG emissions
           are generated in a city, and detail how climate change may manifest itself in the
           future, relying on a statistical downscaling of multiple global climate models to
           provide a range of impact estimates relevant to a specific city or metro region. As
           shown above in Figure 1.2, this information can be combined with cadaster maps to
           provide very detailed estimates of where problems might occur under different
           climate conditions.
        c. Broad stakeholder participation – Most cities engaged in comprehensive climate
           planning seek the benefit of broad stakeholder participation, involving
           local/regional/central government representatives, business/industry representatives,
           community participants, experts from local universities, and occasionally, outside
           technical experts or consultants who bring specialized knowledge on different
           planning or implementation issues. Such broad engagement greatly enhances the
           level of knowledge and resources brought to bear on these issues, increasing the
           prospects for buy-in because many issues that could prove contentious are dealt with
           early in the process, rather than after the plan is completed. It is particularly
           important that multiple tiers of government be represented, because as was noted
           earlier, some key systems or decisions are outside of the decisionmaking realm of the
           local authority. This does not guarantee that all issues will be resolved in the favor of
__________________________________________________________________________
Page 30 of 76                                                  Urban Sector Rapid Assessment Report
           the local authority, but it does increase central or regional government’s awareness of
           local concerns, and can influence future funding availability.
        d. Mayor-led or endorsed: Many cities argue the best results are achieved when the
           team responsible for coordinating the climate planning effort resides directly within
           the Mayor’s office, giving the planning team direct access to key decisionmakers. At a
           minimum, the mayor or other key local leaders should publicly endorse this process to
           provide the political support the planning team will need to convince others of the
           seriousness of the endeavor.
        e. Integration with other planning strategies: Similarly, the best results are achieved if
           the climate plan is not treated as a standalone strategy, but rather is systematically
           integrated into other relevant local strategies, such as the local transport plan, waste
           plan, or water strategy. Some cities have gone so far as to integrate climate goals or
           metrics into their regular management reporting system to ensure progress is
           continuously monitored.

48. A good deal of the local climate planning work that has occurred in Romania has been carried
out by cities and towns that are signatories to the Covenant of Mayors, a European Commission-
supported initiative aimed at promoting sustainable energy use in cities. There is a formal sign-up
process, managed by the Covenant of Mayors Office (CoMo) in Brussels, where a local authority
commits to developing and implementing a Sustainable Energy Action Plan (SEAP) within a year of
signing on to the program. A baseline emissions inventory must be prepared to enable
subsequent monitoring of progress towards reductions in energy use. Although there is a
suggested plan format, as was noted earlier, local authorities have great latitude in terms of which
sectors or strategies they choose to focus on in their SEAP. Technical assistance in preparing and
delivering the plan is available from the CoMO and the Joint Research Center of the European
Commission.21

49. As of September 6, 2013, there are 60 communities22 around Romania that have signed on to
the Covenant, collectively representing a population of roughly 5 million people. Signatory
communities include Bucaresti District 1, Timisoara, Cluj, Brasov, Ploiesti and Arad. The majority
of signatories are much smaller, however, with 25 of the 60 signatories having populations of less
than 10,000.

50. To date, thirty of these cities have submitted their SEAP, the majority of which are available
for review online. Program rules state that the SEAP must be approved by a city’s municipal
council and then uploaded to the Covenant website for review by the CoMo. A template is used
to ensure to ensure the data is submitted in a standardized format, and to allow for review by the
EC’s Joint Research Centre, which is looking for inaccurate or inappropriate assumptions. Once
the plan is ‘approved’ by the CoMo, then the city must report annually on its progress toward the
SEAP goals.

51. The contents of all 29 plans submitted as of July 2013 were scanned to gain a sense of where
local authorities were choosing to prioritize their energy planning efforts. As Figure 1.3 clearly
shows, the vast majority of the strategies listed in these plans fall into the buildings and transport
sectors, two sectors that typically dominate local energy use.

52. Within these categories, the strategies most commonly mentioned in the sustainable energy
action plans included:

        a. Buildings
                 i. Refurbishment/thermal rehabilitation of municipal public buildings, including
                    schools
                ii. Energy audits of public buildings and the issuance of energy performance
                    certificates that meet EU requirements
               iii. Thermal rehabilitation of residential buildings (i.e. tower blocks)
               iv. Installation of photovoltaics on municipal buildings
        b. Transport
                 i. Modernization of the public transport system
                ii. Improved transport/local mobility planning
               iii. Creation of bike rental network

53. The City of Brasov’s Agency for the Management of Energy and Environment (ABMEE) serves
as the hub of the “Covenant Club” in Romania, which was established to support signatories by
providing a platform to exchange ideas and information. The Club also seeks to provide a
communal voice on legislative and policy matters in Romania.23 ABMEE also serves as home to
Energy Cities Romania, a consortium of the energy policy managers in Romanian cities.

54. Other climate-related planning work is taking place in seven Romanian cities where the World
Bank’s Tool for the Rapid Assessment of City Energy (TRACE)24 has been deployed to support local

energy efficiency planning efforts. TRACE is designed to help local authorities assess their energy
use in six key sectors under their control: water, waste, transport, public street lighting, buildings,
and the power and heat sector. Cities can benchmark their energy performance against peer
cities in each of these categories, receive guidance on which sectors should be prioritized for
action, and evaluate which specific policy or technology interventions might be most appropriate
in their city. An expert consultant working with local authority staff on data collection and
analysis typically carries out a TRACE analysis, but it can be deployed independently by cities with
some expertise on energy efficiency matters.

55. Given TRACE’s efficiency focus, it does not address a full range of options that cities may
consider to lower carbon emissions, such as the use of renewable energy technology or other fuel
switching strategies. TRACE is also most useful in addressing sectors over which a local authority
has the greatest control – the public bus system, for example, rather than private automobiles –
but many TRACE analyses do adopt a broad perspective about the types of energy actions
necessary in a city.

56. The three Romanian TRACE studies published thus far (Cluj-Napoca25, Ploiesti26, and Brasov27)
and the four other draft studies (Constanta, Craiova, Iasi, and Timisoara) all spend a significant
amount of time talking about transport issues (including high rates of private vehicle ownership,
the old age/inefficiency of both public and privately owned vehicles, parking availability, etc.) and
buildings (the shift away from district heating connections to building-based thermal systems, the
lack of thermal insulation in buildings, etc.) compared to other sectors. The TRACE studies do not
ignore these sectors – for example, each of the three published reports note the district energy
systems in those cities have a high rate of heat loss compared to many other cities – and the
reports each conclude with several recommendations the local authorities are encouraged to
explore in greater depth. As Table 1.5 makes clear, there is considerable overlap in terms of the
recommendations but also several recommendations that are unique to each city.

  and pressure management

57. There are no comparable studies or initiatives detailing the work of local and regional
authorities in terms of adapting to climate change; this is a huge gap that the Romanian
government should focus on going forward.


1.7 Recommendations

58. There is considerable evidence from around the world that cities are recognizing the value of
local climate planning, for both short- and long-term competitiveness reasons. The fact that 60
cities and towns from around Romania have signed up for the Covenant of Mayors program also
speaks to the fact that planning activities of this type can deliver immediate energy cost savings
benefits to a city, freeing up scarce resources to be spent on other pressing public needs.

59. The efforts by countries as diverse as Korea, France, and the Philippines to require local
climate planning through national policy directives also serves to remind us, however, of the
national economic and social implications of effective city-level climate planning. The Romanian
Government’s goal of using the 2014-2020 Operating Programs to recalibrate Romania’s national
climate strategy is thus highly strategic, creating an opportunity to use a spatial – rather than
topical – construct to frame the climate change conversation around the country.

60. The experience gained to date through local disaster planning efforts, participation in the
Covenant of Mayors, and the seven TRACE studies provides a helpful starting point for this work.
Much more should be done to ensure that these efforts are integrated, however, cutting across

traditional geographic, sectoral and ministerial boundaries. The Integrated Urban Development
Plans required by MDRAP are a potential vehicle to build on in this regard, given their broad focus.
It would be relatively easy to identify specific climate-change related topics that must be included
in any IUDPs going forward. Some type of quality control system would likely be required to
ensure that any climate-focused discussion is comprehensive in its coverage, evidence based, and
reflective of inputs from a broad array of stakeholders. The Covenant of Mayor’s strategy of
having outside experts evaluate each plan to ensure a minimum level of quality is an interesting
model the Government of Romania should consider for its own IUDP process.

61. There is also value in having individual cities develop their own climate strategy, however. A
regional strategy would not contain the level of granularity necessary to address all climate-
related concerns in an individual city. In this case, the SEAP and TRACE studies are more relevant
models, although their focus must necessarily be broadened to cover adaptation/resilience topics
in an in-depth manner. Comprehensive emission inventories and climate risk studies should be
required as essential building blocks of these plans.

62. Capacity building strategies will be necessary if this approach is to succeed, providing local
authority staff with both the tools and information they need to develop effective, workable
plans. The good news is that between the World Bank, the European Commission, different city
networks, and other academic and consulting resources in Romania and elsewhere around the
continent, there is considerable support available that can be leveraged for this purpose.

63. Of particular relevance is the fact that in 2014, the World Bank and several international
partners are commencing work on a program to train and accredit individuals attaining certain
minimum knowledge on how to prepare a citywide emission inventory, citywide climate risk
analysis, and comprehensive city-scale climate change action plan. By establishing this program,
the Bank and its partners seek to increase the overall level of human capital available to assess the
challenges facing a city and work on solutions to these challenges. The Romanian Government is
encouraged to actively monitor the rollout of this strategy, and work with the Bank and other
partners to promote awareness of this program and support those officials interested in pursuing
accreditation.

64. Near and long-term policies and investments that should be considered to advance this
agenda include:

Section 2: Urban Transport Sector Analysis
(Note: this is a summary of the urban-relevant sections of the standalone Transport Sector
analysis prepared by the World Bank Transport team)


2.1 Overview

65. Romania’s transport sector is responsible for 11.8% of the country’s greenhouse gas
emissions, a rate lower than the EU average, but one that is growing more quickly. (See Figure
2.1) Road transport is the source of the great majority of GHG emissions in the transport sector,
responsible for 93 percent of domestic transport emissions.28 This is a similar proportion to the
EU-27 average of 94 percent.

                                      Romania                     EU-27


66. Although car mode share in Romania is at a similar level to the EU average, the car ownership
rate in Romania is the lowest in the EU at 201 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2010,29 but has grown
significantly in recent years, up from 150 cars per 1000 inhabitants in 2004.30 Experience across
the world suggests that as the Romanian economy grows, it will continue to grow in future.

67. Other information on the urban transport situation across Romania is extremely limited. The
TRACE studies cited earlier in Section 1 have yielded some information, as do the Sustainable
Energy Action Plans prepared by various Romanian towns and cities as part of the Covenant of
Mayors program. In addition, the World Bank held an initial discussion meeting with the Executive
Director for Transport in the Municipality of Bucharest on challenges and ambitions in Bucharest.

While not comprehensive, this information does paint a picture of the urban transport scene in
Romania:

        a. Modal split -- There is limited reliable information on modal split in many Romanian
           cities, making it difficult to assess the current transport-related GHG emission levels in
           individual Romanian cities, or the proportion of total transport-related emissions that
           occur in urban vs. rural areas of Romania.
        b. Traffic congestion. The TRACE studies in Brasov,31 Cluj-Napoca32 and Ploiesti33 all
           identified traffic congestion as a problem issue; local government officials in Bucharest
           also consider congestion a significant problem.34 Congestion, with the resulting start-
           stop nature of the driving cycle it imposes on vehicles, significantly increases
           greenhouse and other gaseous emissions from road traffic.
        c. Parking. With the rapid growth in ownership and use of private vehicles since
           Romania started the transition to a market economy, the supply of designated parking
           spaces in Romania’s cities has come under pressure and the number is often
           inadequate to meet demand. This often leads to “informal” parking arrangements,
           with vehicles parking on footways, cycle tracks and public spaces as well as on every
           available meter of legitimate roadside parking space. As well as causing difficulties for
           pedestrians, cyclists and other road users, this also adds to the congestion problems
           noted above. Management of parking in some Romanian cities is rudimentary or non-
           existent, with little or no enforcement of parking regulations, nor is there any attempt
           to use parking restraint through charging or enforcement of restrictions as a demand
           management tool. In other cities such as Brasov and Cluj-Napoca, new parking
           management systems are taking hold that allowing drivers to pay for parking meters
           with their mobile phones, but their effectiveness has yet to be assessed.
        d. Public transport. Many cities around Romania have public transport systems. In
           Bucharest, there is a metro system (operated by Metrorex, a state-owned company),
           a tram network, trolley buses, and an extensive bus network, all of which are
           operated by RATB, an operating company overseen by the Municipality of Bucharest.
           In other Romanian cities and towns, public transport tends to consist of buses,
           minibuses, trolley buses and trams operated by the city or a private concessioner. The
           city of Brasov took the decision in 2005 to abandon its tram line due to the prohibitive
           cost of upgrading and maintaining it; it now focuses on buses and trolley buses. Cluj-
           Napoca has upgraded its tram system, while other cities have similar system upgrade
           plans but lack funding to implement them. Part of the challenge facing many of these
           systems is declining ridership levels. In Ploiesti, for example, public transport
           patronage fell from 7 million trips per month in 2011 to 6.7 million in 2012. Some
           cities are making concerted efforts to reverse this trend through modernization of
           infrastructure and services, although lack of funding remains a serious constraint. In

           new vehicles in 2006.
        e. Taxis, pedestrian and cycling infrastructure. There is a plentiful supply of taxis in most
           Romanian cities, but many of the vehicles are old and not fuel-efficient, mirroring the
           make-up of the national vehicle situation. Some cities have an age limit for taxi
           vehicles, but this varies significantly (e.g., Brasov has an age limit of five years, while in
           Cluj-Napoca the age limit is 12 years). Pedestrian and cycling infrastructure varies
           greatly in quality and quantity between different towns and cities, and within
           different city areas. Good cycling infrastructure exists in some cities but it generally
           does not form a coherent network, and is often poorly maintained. Parking on cycle
           lanes is also a problem, reducing their usability further. Efforts to improve walking
           and cycling facilities were reported in the Brasov, Cluj, and Ploesti TRACE studies, and
           mention is made of encouraging these modes in other city Sustainable Energy Action
           Plans.35 Strategies include lengthening the cycle lane network, installing self-service
           bicycle docking stations, and establishing pilot bike-sharing schemes.


2.2 Policy Environment

68. There are several formal documents adopted by the EU that are relevant to Romania’s
transport sector. Key among them is the European Commission White Paper “Roadmap to a
Single European Transport Area: Towards a competitive and resource efficient transport system”
adopted in March 2011.36 The White Paper focuses on assuring sustainable mobility for people
and goods with a strong emphasis on contributing to a very ambitious greenhouse gas emission
target set for the EU as a whole. Because the White Paper covers all forms and aspects of
transport, the goals are necessarily wide ranging, but there is one goal specifically focused on
cities, namely, that by 2050 there be no new conventionally-fuelled cars in cities

69. Interim goals included in the White Paper relevant to cities focus on: (a) developing and
deploying new and sustainable fuels and propulsion systems; (b) optimizing the performance of
multimodal logistic chains, including by making greater use of more energy-efficient modes; and
(c) increasing the efficiency of transport and of infrastructure use with information systems and
market-based incentives.

70. A second key document is a European Commission position paper that specifically sets out its
views on the main transportation challenges faced in Romania and on funding priorities.37 As part
of this report, the EC called for the promotion of sustainable urban mobility plans (SUMPs) based
on low-carbon transport modes for urban areas; investment in the necessary infrastructure and
accessible rolling stock to deliver those plans, and institutional support to improve local transport
management. The position paper also highlighted the need for attention to climate adaptation
strategies and capacity building policies, including the modification of technical standards, and the

need to improve governance and service delivery by tackling the current shortage of civil
engineers trained in transport planning.

71. The scope of EU cohesion funds will remain largely similar to the current period, with support
for investments to comply with environmental standards, promoting energy efficiency and the use
of renewable energy; investments in the Trans European Transit Network, and urban and low-
carbon transport systems. The Integrated Territorial Initiative discussed earlier in Section 1 is also
expected to be a key instrument to implement transport programming, allowing member states to
implement Operational Programs in a cross-cutting way and to draw on funding from several
priority axes of one or more Operational Programs. This is particularly relevant in the case of
sustainable urban transport, given the need to link transport to other regional development goals.

72. At the national level, the Romanian Ministry of Transport (MOT) expects to complete a new
20-year General Transport Master Plan (GTMP) for the country by the end of 2013. As well as
guiding what goes into the 2014-2020 Operational Program, the GTMP is intended to provide “an
integrated strategy for the national transport system”, including short, medium and long-term
transport investment programs and policy measures. As a key part of the development process a
National Transport Model has been developed, to help objectively appraise options and give a
solid basis for the GTMP. The model will be maintained and updated on an ongoing basis
following completion of the GTMP; it is also recognized that the GTMP itself will need to be a
“living document” with periodic updates to reflect changing circumstances and challenges.

73. A preliminary draft of the GTMP, dated August 19, 2013, presented a set of proposed
objectives for the Master Plan projects, including achieving transport economic efficiency;
minimizing negative environmental impacts; giving priority to modes of transport which are more
energy efficient and have lower emissions; and producing a safer transport system. It also sets out
a funding objective which is partly about producing more efficient pricing for transport and partly
about deliverability given likely constraints on transport funding from various national, EU, and
private sector sources. From a climate change perspective, the sustainability objective relates to
mitigation of climate change, although climate change is not specifically mentioned.

74. From an urban perspective, the most important fact is that the GTMP does not cover urban
transport investment and policy interventions. This is because responsibility for urban transport
investment generally sits with the municipalities in Romania (with the exception of the Bucharest
metro network), under the aegis of the Ministry for Regional Development and Public
Administration. MRDAP is also responsible for regional, local and county roads that link the
towns, cities and villages of Romania.

75. The need for Master Plans to guide urban transport strategies and investment has been
identified by both the Government of Romania and by the European Commission. The terms of
reference have been drafted for studies to develop SUMPs for the seven growth pole cities and
Bucharest/Ilfov. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development will play a key role in
procuring consultants to undertake the studies, in support of MRDAP. JASPERS (Joint Assistance
to Support Projects in the Regions) will provide technical support as appropriate. In parallel with
the studies, the World Bank will support spatial planning and integrated development planning for
the growth poles and also continue to assist the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Bucharest.

76. The objectives of the SUMPs, as stated in the draft terms of reference, include:
__________________________________________________________________________
Page 40 of 76                                                   Urban Sector Rapid Assessment Report
        a. Reduce air and noise pollution, greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption;
        b. Improve resilience of transport networks to extreme weather and natural events in
           line with “adaptation to climate change” EU policies.

77. The appraisal process and criteria used in developing the eight SUMPs are not defined at this
stage, although they would be expected to include consideration of climate change issues in line
with the above objectives. A challenge for the client and the consultants appointed to undertake
the studies will be to ensure that the appraisal process and criteria used in each of the eight cities
are comparable. It is not clear at this stage how this will be achieved. The appraisal process and
criteria should ideally be compatible with those used in the development of the GTMP, in order
that there is consistency between urban transport strategy and general transport strategy on the
national networks. The outputs of the SUMP studies are likely to be available towards the end of
2014.


2.3     Options for Controlling Transport GHG Emissions

78. A good way of thinking of mechanisms to reduce emissions in the urban transport sector is the
avoid-shift-improve (A-S-I) strategy, which focus on avoiding growth of CO2 emissions through
urban development strategies that reduce the need for travel in passenger vehicles; shifting
transport to modes with lower emissions (e.g., shifting passenger traffic from private vehicles to
buses, rail or metro, and shifting freight from truck to rail); and improving vehicles efficiency and
traffic management policies.

79. The set of policies aimed at dealing with A-S-I can be broadly considered to be prices,
regulations, and investments. Some policies fall squarely within the control of local authorities;
others are necessarily established or administered at the national/ministerial level. The full
transport sector report goes into this policy discussion at greater depth, and also includes a
discussion of fuel pricing, vehicle fuel economy or emission standards, freight, road/highway, air
travel, and inland waterway policies that will likely have some impact on urban travel or economic
activity. These discussions are far less relevant than the policies summarized here, however:

        a. Road pricing instruments -- Road pricing theory argues that the socially optimal
           amount of transport in total and by mode requires that users pay the full social cost of
           his/her trip at the margin or marginal social cost pricing.38 Some of the pricing policy
           options commonly employed by policy makers wishing to contain the growth of the
           modal share of vehicles in cities include congestion pricing in a targeted cordon zone,
           toll road pricing, high-occupancy vehicle and toll lanes, and parking policies, all of
           which can make mass transit more economically appealing.

        b. Changes in urban form -- As noted in Section 1, urban form affects daily travel
           patterns and thus the amount of annual vehicle kilometers travelled. In many ways,
           the relationship between transport and urban form is mutually reinforcing, in the
           sense that transportation investment decisions influence spatial patterns of

             development, which in turn influence patterns of travel, and these in turn influence
             future transport investment decisions and investments. Clearly, changing what can be
             a “vicious circle” requires addressing urban development and planning issues, which
             will set the transport demand needs for decades to come. The bottom line is that
             once a country has developed an urban form characterized by extensive urban sprawl,
             it becomes exceedingly difficult to control GHG emission growth. This is because low-
             density development where there is separated land use makes a passenger vehicle the
             only efficient transport option. Developing more compact, transit served urban cities
             could reduce transport energy needs by up to three-quarters.


2.4 Impact of Climate Change on Transport Systems

80. Climate change is expected to have a significant impact on urban transportation, affecting the
way transportation professionals plan, design, construct, operate, and maintain different
transportation systems. Decisions taken today, particularly those related to the redesign and
retrofitting of existing infrastructure, or the design of new transportation infrastructure, will affect
how well the system adapts to climate change far into the future. Focusing on the problem now
should help avoid costly future investments and disruptions to operations. To date, however,
research on how climate change will impact transportation is scarce, particularly in a Romanian
context.39

81. Higher temperatures and more frequent heat waves (particularly in the south and south-east
of Romania) are likely to cause problems with road and rail infrastructure. Asphalt roads may
become soft and deform more under the weight of vehicles, causing traffic restrictions to be put
in place, particularly for heavy vehicles. This issue is already recognized by the Romanian national
roads company, which uses adjusted material standards and design norms in vulnerable areas to
cope with higher temperatures and minimize deformation. Nonetheless, restrictions on weight as
well as time of travel (during the day) are sometimes imposed on trucks during the summer period
to reduce road deterioration when the asphalt is soft.

82. Railway lines also buckle under high temperatures, which can again lead to speed and usage
restrictions, while higher temperatures can affect the thermal expansion of bridge joints affecting
bridge operation and increasing maintenance cost. Higher temperatures and heat waves are likely
to cause discomfort and possible safety risk to rail and other transport passengers, requiring
improved ventilation at stations (e.g., Metro stations) and improved ventilation or air conditioning
on trains, metro trains, trams, trolleybuses and buses. This will be important if these modes are to
remain attractive in competition with private cars, in which air conditioning is becoming more
common.

83. Rail, road and waterborne transport infrastructure are potentially vulnerable to the effects of
more intense rainfall and increased frequency of flash floods, which can render can render tunnels
non-operational and disrupt traffic. It may precipitate tunnel failure and damage tunnel power
supply, ventilation, and other utilities. Bridge abutments, piers, road and rail embankments and
riverbanks are potentially vulnerable to flash floods unless measures are taken to protect them.

Flooding will also result in the erosion and scouring of bridge supports, and an increase in
precipitation will increase the risk of failure of cuttings and retaining walls located at and around
tunnel portals. Runoff from increased precipitation levels will also affect stream flow and
sediment delivery in some locations, with potentially adverse effects on bridge foundations.
Intense rainfall can also have adverse impacts on road safety, although in some areas a reduction
in icy and snowy days may counterbalance this on an annual basis.

84. Road and rail traffic on bridges are vulnerable to strong winds associated with extreme storm
events. The structural integrity of long span bridges may also be jeopardized by strong winds,40
leading to bridge closure and failure in extreme cases.

85. Temperature variations, particularly extreme heat and heat waves, will affect transport
construction projects. Extreme heat will create unfavorable working conditions for workers, and
inhibits certain types of construction activities. For example, high temperature, low humidity and
high wind are factors that reduce the setting times and strength of concrete. Nevertheless,
warming temperatures can bring some benefits, particularly in colder areas of the country.
Warmer temperatures could translate into a longer construction season and improved cost
efficiencies, in addition to reducing winter road salt and chemical use, and their accompanying
adverse environmental impacts.


2.5 Recommendations

86. The full Transport Sector report provides a much broader perspective on the range of sectoral-
focused GHG emission reduction and climate adaptation strategies the Romanian government
should consider going forward. This discussion is limited to those topics likely to prove most
relevant from an urban context, although that does not mean that these necessarily fall under the
purview of a local authority.

87. One point is quite clear, however -- concerns about climate change are not likely to be the key
driver of urban transport policies or investment decisions. Instead, local co-benefits – such as
reduced traffic congestion or improved air quality – are much more likely to drive the
development of transport policies.41 Looking at congestion levels in a city like Bucharest and
trends toward increased motorization, the issue is as much a classic problem of transport and
urban planning as it is a GHG emission problem. Co-benefits can motivate discussions on
improved transport policies that are also low carbon or climate resilient strategies.

Section 3: Energy Sector Analysis
(Note: this is a summary of the urban-relevant sections of the standalone Energy Sector
analysis prepared by the World Bank Energy team)

3.1     Overview

88. In Romania, the energy sector is responsible for 70% of all greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
Power and heat generation and non-transport fuel use contribute to three quarters of this total.
GHG emissions from this sector have been declining, due to huge contractions in the economy and
through energy efficiency improvements.

89. Coal-fired thermal plants provide roughly one third of the country’s electricity supply, a level
significantly higher than other EU countries. The share of hydro, wind, solar and nuclear power is
growing, however.

90. Electricity and natural gas prices are both below EU average levels. Natural gas prices are the
lowest of any EU country due to regulatory distortions.

91. Among EU27 countries, Romania has the lowest per-capita energy consumption. Per capita
consumption of electricity is particularly low, but significant growth in electricity demand is
already occurring, driven mainly by the residential and commercial sectors. Some of this growth is
occurring as households seek to move away from their reliance on district heating. Overall, the
number of households connected to district heating, mostly in large, urban apartment buildings,
declined from 2.2 million to 1.4 million between 1990-2012.


3.2     Institutional Environment

92. The European Union sets the framework for the sustainable energy policies of its member
states. The overarching long-term goal is the commitment to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG)
emissions 80-95% below 1990 levels by 2050, through investments in energy efficiency and low-
carbon and smart energy infrastructure. Over the medium-term, the EU’s energy and climate
policy is focused on the so-called 20-20-20 targets that were adopted in 2007: by 2020, GHG
emissions should be 20% below 1990 levels; renewables should reach a share of 20% of final
energy consumption; and primary energy consumption should be reduced by 20%, compared with
the projected baseline. Romania is likely to meet all three targets, reflecting a huge contraction of
its otherwise carbon intensive economy.

93. The Romanian government has primary responsibility for energy regulatory matters (over
both power and district energy systems) through ANRE, and national buildings policies which can
influence energy efficiency efforts. The latter is the province of the Ministry of Regional
Development and Public Administration. Local authorities are responsible for public service
infrastructure provision and oversight of buildings within their territory. Local energy planning is
required for all municipalities with more than 20,000 inhabitants; some municipalities are very
interested and active in energy efficiency/GHG issues, as exemplified by their voluntary
participation in the EU’s Covenant of Mayors Program.

94. Energy markets around Romania have been partially liberalized. The power sector follows the
model of liberalized wholesale and retail markets. Electricity production is unbundled from
transmission, giving residential consumers the right to switch suppliers. Since this program
started in 2007, however, few have done so because regulated prices are well below free market
rates. Natural gas and district heating rates also remain heavily subsidized. Regulated electricity
and gas prices for non-households are scheduled to be fully liberalized by January 2014 and
January 2015, respectively, and regulated electricity and gas prices for households will be
liberalized by January 2018 and January 2019, respectively. The current price support schemes for
district heating are expected to remain in place for the foreseeable time.

95. National energy laws most directly relevant to urban areas include:

      a. Energy performance of buildings directive for public and residential buildings
      b. Local energy planning required in municipalities with more than 20,000

90. From an urban perspective, the most important issues are energy prices and the Romanian
government’s inability to deal with the ailing district heating sector. These systems are generally
owned by municipal authorities, but the buildings they serve (which must also be retrofitted) are
privately owned. Substantial amounts of financing are needed, spread out over a long period of
time. There is also a need for improved coordination to ensure actions are taken in a
complementary manner. This coordination is frequently missing due to inadequate staffing levels,
and due to the fact that the staff lacks experience on EE issues in particular.


3.3       District Heating in Romanian Cities – A Rapid Assessment

91. District Heating systems are a prominent feature of many Romanian cities, but their use is
declining. The 300 systems operating in 1995/96 had declined to 100 by 2011, of which 83 are in
urban areas. The customer base of these systems has declined over time from 2.2 million
apartments in 1990 to 1.4 million by 2012. In 16 of the 31 district heating systems with more than
10,000 customers, the number of customers has declined by more than 50%. In many cities,
district heating has become a serious drain on public finances because tariffs for residential
consumers are highly subsidized, on average about 50%.

92. Service quality, cost, and concern over high pollution levels are among the primary reasons for
declining demand. Most of the old inefficient cogeneration units and heat-only boilers have still
not been upgraded or replaced with modern generation equipment, nor are they equipped with
adequate burning equipment, resulting in SO2 and NOX emissions that exceed the EU norms. With
an average of 275 tons of CO2 per Gcal, Romania’s district heating producers rank among the most
polluting service suppliers in the EU. Heat distribution networks suffer an average of 30% heat
and water losses, compared to 5-10% for newer networks. As a result of those inefficiencies, the
cost of district heating is about 18-20% higher than in some other EU countries.

Section 4: Urban Solid Waste Sector Analysis

4.1 Overview

93. In 2009, 6.94 million tons of municipal solid waste42 was collected in Romania.43 Collectively,
the GHG emissions associated with Municipal Solid Waste disposal in Romania total approximately
2.5 Gg of CO2 equivalent, or 2% of the country’s overall emissions.44

94. On a per capita basis, municipal solid waste generation levels in Romania amount to roughly
365 kg/person/year,45 which puts Romania at the low end of the spectrum compared to other
members of the EU. Urban waste generation levels are higher than levels in rural areas: at one
point residents of urban areas in Romania were reported to generate approximately 0.9
kg/person/day, compared to approximately 0.4 kg/person/day in rural areas.46 Total annual
waste generation have changed quite a bit over the past few years, however, so it is unclear if the
difference has between the two has increased or
decreased.                                           Figure 4.1: Fraction of local waste stream composed
                                                        of organic materials
                           47
95. Overall, roughly 46% of Romania’s
municipal waste stream consists of
biodegradable material (also known as organic
waste), although this ranges from 38-54% in
different parts of the country, according to the
last available estimates. (See Figure 4.1). This
is a fairly commonplace situation in lower- and
middle-income countries as there tends to be
less consumer spending that would produce
higher levels of product or packaging waste.

96. The majority of the emissions resulting from the solid waste management sector are
associated with the country’s overwhelming reliance on landfilling as its primary waste
management strategy, totaling nearly 99% in 2011.48 Organic waste entombed in a landfill decays
anaerobically, producing methane gas, a GHG with 25 times the heat trapping potential of carbon
dioxide. Unless the landfill is properly designed, capturing or flaring the methane via a series of

   According to the Romanian National Waste Plan, municipal solid waste is defined as waste from
households, commercial establishments, institutions, municipal services (including street cleaning and
waste from parks, markets and gardens), and construction and demolition debris.

pipes embedded in the landfill, the gas will slowly leak out of a landfill for many years, including
long after a landfill is formally closed. Very few landfills in Romania have the ability to capture or
flare this gas, meaning most methane is released directly to the atmosphere.

97. As part of the EU accession agreement, Romania has agreed to close down 238 poorly
managed solid waste dumpsites and replace them with sanitary landfills, some of which are
expected to have gas recovery systems installed. The current status of these plans are unclear,
although the team was unable to find any information detailing the level of landfill gas recovery
currently occurring around the country.

98. Aside from gas capture, one way to eliminate methane generation problems at landfills is to
segregate biodegradable waste at its point of generation, diverting this material into alternative
waste processing methods such as composting or anaerobic digesters (AD). Composting organic
waste not only prevents the production of methane, it also can create a useful material that can
be land applied, returning nutrients to the soil. Composting does release CO2, but because that
CO2 was originally sequestered in the plant matter, composting organic waste does not add any
net CO2 to the atmosphere. Sending organic waste to anaerobic digesters produces methane, but
the closed nature of the system means the gas is completely captured, available for use as a
power or heating source, displacing fossil fuel sources. Waste-to-energy (WTE) facilities, where
the waste material is combusted (and power can be generated as a byproduct of the combustion
process), are another increasingly common waste management technique capable of delivering
GHG emission reductions, although generally at a much higher cost.49

99. The exact level of GHG savings achieved by a WTE facility will also depend on the carbon-
content of the electricity that is displaced by this new power generation source. For example,
GHG savings can be high if electricity from a WTE facility is displacing electricity from a coal-fired
plant; if GHG-free hydro-electricity is being displaced, however, emission levels may actually
increase. There are several WTE facility proposals currently under consideration in Romania,
including in Timisoara (150,000 Mg/a), Bucharest (750,000 Mg/a capacity) and Brasov (150,000
tonnes/annum). A fourth facility is also currently in an early stage of development in Northeast
Romania with a capacity of 300,000 Mg/annum.50 At this time, it is unclear what impact these
facilities might have on national GHG emission levels, or when/if they will actually become
operational.

100. Some GHG emissions also arise from the collection vehicles used by municipal authorities or
private waste haulers to transport waste materials, recyclables, and compostables from homes
and businesses to local transfer stations or disposal facilities. Although these emissions will tend
to be small compared to the emissions arising from methane generated by organic waste buried in
a landfill, this is an area easily remedied by local authorities. Strategies to reduce collection-
related emissions can include vehicle replacement, route optimization (to minimize vehicle miles
traveled), the use of intermediate waste transfer stations, or a switch to low-emission forms of
transport – such as rail – if the waste or recyclable materials are to be transported long distances.
These solutions may also deliver significant cost savings benefits to a local authority.

4.2 Policy Environment

101. Romania’s accession into the EU has resulted in sizable changes in solid waste management
practices across the country over the past 10 years, including a heightened focus on regional and
local solid waste planning.

102. The First National Waste Management Strategy of Romania was released in 2004, covering
the period through 2013. Regional Waste Management plans for all eight Romanian regions were
issued in 2006, while county councils are responsible for complying with the regional strategies via
county-level waste management plans. County councils also have the remit for managing disposal
and waste transfer facilities, so landfill closures are their direct responsibility. Solid waste
collection is handled as a municipal government function, by private haulers, and through public-
private partnerships established by the municipality..

103. All solid waste plans are currently designed to help implement the requirements of key EU
directives, including the Waste Framework Directive ((2008/98/EC) which establishes the basic
tenets of EU waste policy; the Landfill Directive (1999/31/EC) which mandates the closure of old
uncontrolled dump sites and the diversion of biodegradable waste from landfills (1999/31/EC);
and the directive requiring the increased diversion of recyclable material (2006/12/EC). Achieving
full compliance with these various directives will reportedly cost €1.8 billion, or approximately
€25-30 million per county. Given that European Regional Development Funds 2007-2013 under
OP Environment Axis 2 (Development of Integrated Waste Management Systems and
Rehabilitation of Historically Contaminated Sites) would provide only approximately half that
amount (€0.93 billion), the funding gap is significant. Difficulty drawing down these funds due to
weak institutional capacity exacerbates this problem even further. 51

104. All relevant EU directives are being pursed, although the closure of over old municipal
landfills and illegal dumpsites appears to be proceeding at a significantly faster pace than others.52
Progress is particularly slow for the diversion of both recyclable and biodegradable materials: by
2020 Romania is required to achieve a level of 50% recycling of municipal solid waste; currently
this level stands at <1% nationally. Some argue that this number should increase fairly rapidly in
the next few years, as more and more municipalities roll out local recycling programs.53 The EU
Landfill Directive requires member states to reduce the biodegradable fraction of the waste
stream entering landfills over time; in Romania, 25% of all biodegradable MSW must be diverted
from landfills by 2010 (compared to 1995 baseline data); 50% by 2013; and 65% by 2020.

105. Although the recycling industry (collection + markets) has ramped up relatively quickly,
Romania’s performance to date on biodegradable MSW collection and processing appears less

successful. A 2013 European Environmental Agency report54 looking at municipal waste
management in Romania noted discrepancies between publicly reported data and circumstances
on the ground. In 2009, for example, the Romanian National Environmental Protection Agency
reported the country had reduced the amount of biodegradable waste being landfilled by 25%
compared to 1995 levels, thus satisfying the 2010 EU Landfill Directive requirement. This
information was contradicted, however, by the fact that at that time there were no functioning
mechanical biological treatment facilities in Romania capable of processing biodegradable waste,
so the genesis of such significant tonnage reduction was unclear. Eurostats drew similar
conclusions, first reporting ‘organic recycling’ (composting and other biological treatment)
estimates in 2006, and noting that levels had changed very little by 2010, totaling just a fraction of
1% of the country’s solid waste output. Most of this amount was attributed to households
composting waste for their own purposes,55 rather than via any large mechanized facility.

      2009                     18,145

106. A 2012 United Nations Environmental Performance Review offered a slightly more
optimistic portrait of the organics scene, noting that 60 composting facilities had been established
around the country with a combined capacity of 166,000 tons/year, although as of 2009, just
18,145 tons of biodegradable waste was reportedly collected.56 (This number has varied rather
widely over time, however, as shown in Table 4.1, and concerns have been expressed about the
accuracy of this data. For instance, these numbers are recognized as artificially low figures, given
that some unknown quantity of materials collected from farms or park maintenance companies
may be handled by entities outside of the formal waste reporting system.)

107. One issue about which little is known is the quality of the compost material being produced
by these facilities. One waste hauler interviewed for this report expressed interest in procuring a
bio-digester, with the intent of running the vast majority of the waste they collect through the
system. Such a strategy achieves significant volume reduction, converting any biodegradable
material (including paper) into a soil-like substance, but one so contaminated with plastic and
other waste materials that there would be no market for this product. The only options would be

to dump it in a landfill or possibly use it as cover material at the landfill, assuming it could meet EU
landfill cover standards. Local authorities must keep this fact in mind when designing their
program, ensuring that the composting operation only handles clean, source-separated materials
free of most contaminants.

108. Limited information is available on solid waste collection fees charged by municipalities or
their contracted service provider, and the extent to which they are sufficient to allow for full cost
recovery of existing services, facility closures, and the investments needed to achieve full
compliance with EU directives. Rate setting is carried out by local authorities that set the tariffs in
accordance with a methodology developed by ANRSC Order No. 109 of 2007. An analysis
conducted by the World Bank of solid waste management practices in Romania and other new EU
member countries raised concerns that tariffs were too low to cover recurring costs, and were
often influenced by local authority concerns about the public’s low willingness to pay for these
services.57

109. In northeastern Romania, an analysis of the solid waste situation for the Bacau region
highlighted the tremendous diversity of fees charged to both households and businesses for waste
collection services. (See Table 4.2) Because fees are generally charged on a flat €/person/month
basis, there is no incentive to reduce the volume of waste generated; moreover, such a system is
predicated upon an accurate assessment of the number of individuals per household. One waste
hauler interviewed for this report expressed concern that the official population estimates used by
the municipality dramatically undercounted the number of individuals receiving waste services
from the company.

4.3 Modeling the Impact of Expanded Biodegradable and Recyclable Waste Capture and
    Processing in Urban Areas in Romania

110. One way to estimate the GHG emission impact of different waste management practices is
through Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), a modeling strategy that calculates the environmental
impacts of alternative collection or waste processing scenarios. A range of LCA models have been
developed over the years, including the WARM model developed by the US EPA.58 LCAs rely on
tonnage figures extrapolated from waste composition studies that sort through material
generated in different locations around the country. In Romania, there are slight differences in
national waste composition estimates and those reported for urban areas such as Bucharest,
where high rates of contamination appear to decrease the amount of recyclable or compostable
materials that can be captured for further use. (See Table 4.3)

111. In the lifecycle analysis below, GHG emission levels are compared under a variety of waste
diversion scenarios:

       a. Baseline rate: Greenhouse gas emissions attributable to the Romanian solid waste
          sector are calculated based on current national waste generation levels, composition
          data, and disposal practices. Projections are also made based on urban waste generation
          and composition estimates for Romanian cities.59

58
  For more information, see http://epa.gov/epawaste/conserve/tools/warm/index.html
59
  Note: These estimates differ from the numbers reported at the beginning of this section because of
differences in the data used and the modeling approach. The purpose of this analysis is to explore the scale
of GHG emission impacts that can be achieved under different diversion level scenarios, compared to some
baseline level.

      b. Alternative scenario 1: Emission impacts are modeled assuming Romania (or urban areas
         in Romania) achieve compliance with EU 2020 recycling and biodegradable diversion
         targets (i.e., 50% recycling rate for glass/plastic/metals, and 65% diversion of
         biodegradable materials (which we interpreted as tree waste and other organics,
         generally food waste))

      c. Alternative Scenario 2: Emission impacts are modeled assuming Romania (or urban areas
         in Romania) achieves diversion levels similar to those of San Francisco (USA), whose solid
         waste program was recently recognized as the best in the world by the Cities Climate
         Leadership Awards program.60 San Francisco successfully diverts nearly 75% of its paper
         waste, 82% of glass packaging waste, 48% of metal, and 28% of organic waste generated
         by households.61

112. The impact on GHG emission levels under the two alternative diversion scenarios are rather
impressive. Achieving EU diversion targets for organics and recyclable materials delivers a 67%
reduction in waste-related GHG emissions. The lion’s share of the reductions come from diverting
food waste to a composting program; paper recycling also delivers a significant emissions bump.
Attaining a San Francisco-level of performance – meaning higher-than EU-required recycling
diversion rates and a solid-but-still-not-EU quality organics diversion rate – still cuts emission
levels in half. A more comprehensive analysis, using a different LCA model that can account for
avoided emissions for electricity purchases displaced by the AD unit’s methane combustion, would
be required to assess whether pursuing anaerobic digestion rather than composting would deliver
better or worse outcomes.

4.4 Solid Waste Program Options Focused on Emission Reductions

113. Compared to 10-15 years ago, Romania has made significant strides in the development of
policies, market structures, and collection networks designed to capture and divert recyclable
commodities from the waste stream. Between 2000 and 2010, the size of the workforce devoted
to the waste sector has doubled in Romania.62 There are now more than 1000 companies
countrywide licensed to collect recyclable packaging waste.63 Monitoring strategies are also in
place to more systematically document the level of recycling diversion achieved. The UN’s 2012
environmental review generally lauds these changes, although it notes that significant challenges
remain if Romania is to achieve the diversion levels required by different EU Directives.

114. Several factors will likely play a key role influencing that amount of GHG emissions that can
be reduced through the urban solid waste system. Most involve national policy mandates or
recommendations encouraging regions, counties, and cities to establish certain types of waste
processing facilities, collection rules and systems, or pricing policies that incentivize waste
prevention and waste diversion into reuse, recycling, or composting programs. Many of these
options are complementary, and would logically be more effective if implemented concurrently.

       a. Waste prevention and material reuse: one of the most cost effective waste management
          strategies is waste prevention, where consumers are encouraged to take account of the
          products they buy to ensure (1) they are necessary, (2) they are minimally or
          appropriately packaged, and (3) if they are no longer needed but are still in working
          condition, that they are sold or given away for others to reuse. The Green Dot and Eco
          Embellage program in other parts of Europe have done a good job at forcing
          manufactures to think about product packaging, but more consumer education would be
          helpful across Romania.

       b. Source separation requirements: Source separation requirements force waste generators
          to self-segregate waste materials into a different collection container or system. Such
          requirements generally result in cleaner, higher value commodities, the sale of which can
          help offset the cost of a separate, possibly duplicative, collection system. It is also
          possible to price collection services at different rates, imposing higher fees for residual
          “waste” materials than for recyclable or organic materials segregated into different
          containers.

           Romania already has many source separation rules in place for different packaging
           materials and hazardous waste, although the separate collection of organics still does not
           appear to be commonplace. In areas with very high volumes of recyclables or organic
           materials, such materials may actually become the dominant focus of local waste
           collection efforts, lessening the need for frequent collection of residual waste materials.
           In 2011, for example, the City of Portland, Oregon, cut the frequency of trash collection to
           every-other-week, maintaining weekly collection service only for household food and yard
           waste collected together in a single container. Because food waste is traditionally the
           material that attracts rodents or other vectors, households are incentivized to maximize
           diversion into their organics waste bin. Capture rates have increased accordingly, with the
           city reporting collection levels three times what had originally been anticipated,64
           generating sizable programmatic cost savings for the municipality. Systems of this type
           would generally be established by local authorities, working in partnership with the public
           or private waste collection networks under their direct purview.

       c. Development of new organics processing facilities: Source separation rules presume the
          availability of composting facilities and anaerobic digestion facilities as alternative disposal
          sites. Composting can be done indoors or outdoors, involving either highly technical or
          very simplistic turning equipment to speed the decomposition of the organic material.
          Sophisticated facilities often have trained staff that monitor the temperature or moisture
          content of the organic material, trying to optimize conditions to speed the conversion of
          organic waste into a useful humus-like material that can be sold or given to farmers or
          gardeners for land-application. Anaerobic digestion facilities tend to be much more costly
          to build and operate, but they break down the waste in just a few days (versus several
          weeks for a composting facility), siphoning off the methane generated during the
          decomposition process in a fully-enclosed chamber for use by homes, businesses, or
          industry. Some facilities combust the methane on site, generating electricity that can be
          sold back into the local power grid.

         The decision of which approach to pursue will fall under the purview of regional and
         county authorities in Romania, who have responsibility for disposal facility operations.
         The decision will largely be a function of the availability of land, the presence of markets
         for the product(s) produced by these facilities, and available human and financial
         resources. The FARMAGAS program funded by the EC/Intelligent Energy Europe, which
         seeks to promote the use of anaerobic digestion for agricultural/farm wastes in Romania,
         may provide some helpful insights here. There is currently no comparable program
         supporting the development of AD programs for food or other organic waste from urban
         areas in Romania, and this may be an area where the Romanian government could take
         action. One potential partner is the Romanian Association of Biomass and Biogas –
         ARBIO65, a trade group recently formed to advance the development of AD projects across
         the country.

         Reflecting on the compost quality issue noted earlier, the Romanian government may
         wish to establish some type of output-based subsidy program for several years. Only
         compost exceeding some minimum quality standard would be eligible for the subsidy,
         encouraging facility operators to promote the development of source-separated organics
         collection networks to minimize contamination. Subsidies could be provided just long
         enough to both build consumer demand for high quality compost, and allow operators
         and haulers to establish the routes and education programs capable of delivering high
         quality material.

     d. Disposal bans: A strategy highly complementary to these other policies would be material
        disposal bans designed to ensure that specific waste materials are diverted to alternative
        (and often safer) disposal alternatives. Bans can focus on hazardous materials, or
        materials that may be more problematic from a management perspective, such as organic
        materials that slowly decompose within a landfill, forming leachate or methane. The EU
        landfill directive does not explicitly require that organics be completely banned from
        landfills, instead simply requiring that less material be managed there. Many cities and
        countries around the world have taken this extra step, however, as way of ensuring these
        materials are managed either at the point of generation, or via more specialized facilities
        better suited to handling high moisture content organic material. For example, the
        Netherlands banned organic waste from landfills in 199866, while Austria took similar
        action in 2004.67 At the city level, Metropolitan Vancouver will ban food and compostable
        organic waste from local landfills effective 2015.68 In 2008, Buenos Aires passed a law
        banning organic waste from landfills effective 2020,69 giving the region considerable time
        to develop alternative disposal options, collection networks, and pricing strategies. In
        Romania, these policies could be imposed at either a national, regional, or county level.

         Bans also play a “market making” role, seeking to ensure that valuable commodities
         remain available for recycling or reuse rather than being incinerated or buried in a landfill.

         Such bans typically have complementary policies aimed at supporting the development of
         specialized handling/processing facilities, or extended phase-in dates, to ensure that
         waste generators (or their haulers) can find appropriate disposal alternatives. Recent
         experience in Hong Kong, where new food waste processing facilities have been little
         used, highlights the problems that can arise if insufficient attention is focused on these
         complementary market-development activities.70

     e. Alternative collection modalities: Cities with newer sewage treatment facilities may
        consider using their existing sewage system as a means of transporting and ultimately
        processing food waste discarded by households or restaurants. Such a strategy requires
        the waste generator to install a food waste macerator in their sink that grinds the food
        down into small particles that can be transported through the regular sewage pipe.
        Material is processed at the sewage treatment facility, where methane gas can be
        captured for power generation or the resulting sewage sludge can be composted for
        eventual land application. There is growing interest in this technique, and a growing body
        of life cycle analysis concluding there can be financial or environmental advantages to this
        strategy in many cities.71 72 In Stockholm, for example, the local water board eliminated a
        tax associated with installation of waste collection equipment after concluding it could be
        beneficial in terms of helping the sewage treatment system generate additional biogas.73
        In the UK, two counties (Worcestershire and Herefordshire,) began subsidizing the
        purchase of garbage disposal units by local householders after research found lower
        waste management costs would offset the cost of the subsidy within three years.74

         The extent to which this option would be appropriate in a Romanian city context will
         depend heavily on the age and sophistication of the city's sewage treatment facilities and
         pipe network, and the purchase and installation cost of the disposer. The latter may be
         too expensive for low-income households, but the price would potentially be offset over
         time through reduced spending on waste collection fees.75 Whether there are carbon
         reduction benefits occurring from this type of switch will depend heavily on the nature of
         the sewage treatment facility, including whether it composts the sewage sludge, or
         captures the methane gas generated by the waste material during the sewage treatment
         process.

   In Romania, implementation of this strategy would require collaboration between a municipality and
its sewage treatment system operator. To the extent the water system is privatized, it may be more
logistically or financially difficult to implement this program because the financial benefits may accrue to
the solid waste system operator or customer, while the costs may accrue to the wastewater treatment
system operator or customer.

4.5 Cost Estimates of Recycling and Composting Diversion

115. There is no readily available local data on the cost of alternative waste system options in
Romania. Going forward, it would be helpful if the Romanian government worked with regional
and local authorities to compile and publish capital and operating costs information on different
types of solid waste management facilities that have opened during the past several years.

116. Some international data sources exist that provide very broad cost ranges for different solid
waste treatment options. The World Bank’s 2012 What a Waste report published data showing
composting facilities are generally are very cost competitive with landfilling operations, with
anaerobic digestion facilities costing slightly more to build and operate. One thing not factored
into these estimates is the value of the compost or gas/electricity that can be sold by composting
and anaerobic digestion facilities. These revenue streams can dramatically offset or possibly even
exceed the costs, generally giving them a significant cost advantage over a straight landfilling
strategy. For example, depending on the quality of the end-product, compost can be sold for up
to $100/ton;76 local rules regarding the sale of energy from independent power production
facilities of this type will determine their revenue potential.

was provided, the number of households to receive the bins was not noted in the report.

4.6 Preparing the Romanian Solid Waste System to Adapt to Climate Change

119. It is difficult to speak in specifics about how waste systems across Romania may be affected
by climate change, because the specific risks faced by waste disposal facilities or collection
systems will be very local in nature. The World Bank79 and others have identified several issues
that could arise, however, linked to specific climate change risks. The Romanian government and
regional authorities may wish to require that municipalities include climate adaptation
considerations in their local solid waste management plan, as a way of mitigating these risks.

     a. Flood Damage: whether due to sea level rise or extreme rainfall events, flooding can
        create several problems at existing solid waste facilities. Composting facilities in low-lying
        areas may be completely destroyed by floodwaters. Excess water can saturate or erode
        the slopes at landfills, exposing previously-covered waste, causing small landslides at
        poorly engineered facilities, damaging methane gas collection equipment or
        overwhelming leachate collection systems. In the US, solid waste rules require all new

           solid waste facilities to be located in areas outside of the 100-year floodplain; facilities
           also cannot be located in geologically unstable areas. New facilities in Romania should
           similarly be located in areas out of harm’s way to the maximum extent possible, while
           existing or closed facilities should be examined to assess whether some type of
           landscaping or other engineered design elements could protect the facility from damage.

       b. Collection Containers: flooding can also delay the collection of waste material following
          extreme weather events, or wash away material set out on the curb for collection,
          potentially contributing to vector problems, contamination of populated areas, or other
          public health risks. The use of sturdier, more water resistant collection containers may
          help reduce this problem, but it is unlikely to eliminate it altogether.

       c. Storm Debris: in areas heavily damaged by climate change-related extreme weather
          events, the volume of waste materials may increase dramatically, requiring emergency
          pickups or temporary staging areas to help store or process all of the waste material.
          Local or regional authorities may wish to identify areas that can used for this purpose, and
          prepare contingency collection strategies on how to move or manage this material.

           Academic and trade literature is generally silent on these topics, meaning there are few
           best practice examples from other cities we may point to that speak to the cost savings or
           avoided damages resulting from proactive planning.

           One area that may be underappreciated is the role that inadequate waste collection
           practices can play in exacerbating climate change-related flooding problems in cities. In
           Bandur Lampang, a city of 800,000 in Indonesia, the city focused on the development of a
           new solid waste plan as a key element of their climate adaptation strategy. Uncollected
           waste materials clogged local rain culverts, leading to heavy flooding every time it rained.
           By establishing improved waste collection and litter prevention procedures, the city
           expects to reduce the incidence of flooding, delivering a range of economic and health
           benefits to local residents.80


4.7 Recommendations

120. Investments in solid waste system improvements have been an important priority of Axis 2
of the OP Environment program for the past 6 years, but as was noted above, the task ahead
remains both extensive and expensive. In particular, the move to get organics out of the landfills
creates opportunities for the development of new commodity markets, producing a soil
amendment that can return nutrients to agriculture lands and marginal soils in a natural way
rather than relying on chemical fertilizers. Diverting organic waste to composting systems can also
deliver climate mitigation benefits, although the impacts are quite small compared to other
sectors. Nonetheless, the Romanian Government is encouraged to continue to expand its solid
waste program efforts because of the multitude of benefits that can be achieved around the
country.

121. Less clear is the need to address the impacts of climate change on solid waste facilities and
programs around Romania. This is a relatively new area, and there may be value on engaging in
some research and planning initiatives to ensure that problems will not arise in the future. Solid
waste facilities have historically been located in marginal lands, which might make them
vulnerable to floods driven by extreme rainfall events.

122. Because this analysis was not focused on the overall logic and structure of Romania’s solid
waste planning efforts, we did not extensively engage on issues associated with tariff structures,
which do appear to be problematic. Romania’s use of the polluter-pays principle is to be
applauded, but the current tariff structure, which appears to be based on a very low, flat fee per
individual per month, does not fully support this principle. Moving more toward a volume or
weight based-approach, which is common in many parts of the world, would aid in truly shifting
the cost burden on those individuals responsible for the highest levels of waste generation, giving
them an economic incentive to reduce. Moreover, a revised tariff structure, which prices waste
materials differently than valuable commodities (such as recyclable material or source-separated
organic waste), can also incentivize households to maximize their diversion of those materials of
intense focus by the European Commission.

123. In our recommendations below, we include these and other suggestions the Romanian
Government should consider, seeking to build local capacity, reduce economic inefficiency, and
grow green jobs focused on harvesting valuable commodities from the local waste stream.

Section 5: Water Sector Analysis

5.1 Overview

124. Compared to most other European countries, Romania’s freshwater resources are relatively
scarce. Although the Danube delivers massive quantities of water along its long Romanian border,
water resources elsewhere in the country have been characterized as poor, with Romanians
enjoying an average of just 2,660m3 water/person/year, compared to a European average of
4,000m3/person/year.81 More recent long run average statistics published by Eurostats peg
Romania’s supply at closer to 2,000m3/person/year.82

125. The Carpathian Mountains in central Romania exert significant influence on the country’s
fresh water resources, with the topography creating or influencing weather patterns that affect
water availability in the 11 water basins around the country. The water supply is also uneven from
a temporal perspective, with the heaviest rainfall occurring in the summer months. There are
however, natural variations from year to year, a situation that is expected to become more
prominent due to climate change. There are 400 dams in Romania which capture runoff in the
mountains, providing flood control protection and balancing water supply availability over the
course of the year. The dams are also used to generate hydropower.

126. The dams are one key element of the Romanian water system’s most noteworthy feature –
its high level of reliance on surface waters. Of the 125 billion cubic meters of freshwater resource
available across Romania each year, approximately 93% is from surface sources—primarily the
Danube and inland rivers—with the remaining 7% supplied by groundwater sources.83 Given that
interior rivers are supplied primarily by snow and rainfall, Romania’s water supply is highly
dependent on weather systems, creating some vulnerability to extreme events and any long-term
shift in meteorological patterns. This may have a disproportionate effect on certain cities and
regions around Romania.


5.2 Water Policy and Market Environment

127. Water supply policy, or the allocation of water between competing uses (industry,
agriculture, households, etc.) during both wet years and times of drought, is the responsibility of
the National Water Administration “Romanian Waters” (Apele Romane), a unit of the Ministry of
Environment and Climate Change. During drought periods, current policy prioritizes water for
human consumption, then animals and ecosystem protection, and then other purposes.84

128. Quality concerns are guided by the original EU Accession Agreement mandating compliance
with the Urban Wastewater Directive (1991/271/EC), the European Commission’s water
framework directive (2000/60/EC), the Groundwater Directive (Directive 2006/118/EC) and
Environmental Quality Standards Directive (Directive 2008/105/EC) have all been the key drivers
of water treatment and delivery policy in Romania over the past decade. The directives focus on
the need for protection from industrial effluent emissions and the biological quality of surface and
groundwaters, specifying threshold concentrations for certain pollutants. Waters exceeding these
levels are considered to lack ‘good ecological status.’ Currently 80% of the water bodies in
Romania are listed as good status, although there are big regional differences. For example, in the
Somes Tisa river basin (where Cluj-Napoca, Baia Mare, and Satu Mare are located), 93% of the
water bodies are in good condition, whereas in the Arges Vedea basin (where Pitesti is located),
just 7% of the water bodies are rated as good quality.

129. The EU directives have been operationalized through GD 188/2002 (urban wastewater
treatment) and Law No. 458/2002 (drinking water quality). The 2008 National Strategy for
Sustainable Development established key deadlines for expanded access to drinking water and
improvements to wastewater management infrastructure and quality in Romania. Specific policy
targets include providing 70% of the population with access to formal water distribution networks
by 2015, and 100% of agglomerations with a population of over 2000 to have access to formal
wastewater treatment networks by 2018. Currently, only 50% of Romanians have access to
sewage systems; of those with access, 90% live in cities.85 (Numbers drop off considerably in rural
areas, where only 33% of rural households are connected to formal water supply networks, while
10% of rural households have access to modern sewage networks and treatment facilities.86)
Even among those cities and towns with sewage treatment, the quality is somewhat suspect, with
the UN Economic Commission for Europe estimating that only around 25% of all wastewater is
appropriately treated, with 35% insufficiently treated and 40% not treated at all.87

130. To comply with the various EU directives, Romania will need to build more than 2000
wastewater treatment plants by 2018.88 The 2007-2013 Environment SOP estimated that
compliance with the various directives would total €9.5 billion, divided between €5.7 billion for
wastewater treatment and €3.8 billion for sewerage systems.89 The 2007-2013 SOP established
water system improvements as Priority Axis 1, allocating nearly 60% (€2.8 billion Euros) of the
total OP funds available for water system upgrades; the Romanian government provided another
€490 in funding for this same purpose. The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development
has been an important ally on many upgrade projects, establishing a €200 million co-financing
initiative that can cover up to 15% of the project capital cost.90 Additional financing may be
provided by local authorities, or via water and wastewater tariffs collected by the system

these goals.

131. Before 1990, water utilities were operated at the county level, generally as part of a large
centralized utility providing multiple public service functions (water, waste, energy, etc.). After
that date, however, Romania began a push to decentralise management of the water system,
consistent with constitutional preferences that sought to return significant responsibilities to local
authority control. One of the problems with decentralization, however, was the fact that small
and medium sized towns were unable to attract financing from international financial institutions,
leading to a lack of investment and gradual decline in the quality of these systems.91

132. A solution came in the form of Law No. 215/2001, which allowed local authorities to band
together form an Inter-Community Development Association (IDA), issue a common tender, and
delegate management of their water systems to a Regional Operating Company (ROC). The
municipalities retain ownership of their systems, although the ROC can also be structured as a
public-private partnership with shared ownership, as is done in Bucharest and Ploesti. The ROCs
receive operating licenses from the National Authority for Regulation of Public Municipal Services
(ANSRC), a unit of the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDAP). The
regulatory agency has the ability to control prices and establish service level expectations to
ensure compliance with EU rules. The legal framework covering water and sewer utilities are laid
out in Law No. 326/2001, Law No. 51/2006, GD No. 32/2002, Law No. 241/2006 and GD No.
246/2006.

133. The overall result of these policies has been a dramatic reorganization of the water sector,
shifting away from a highly fragmented system into one characterized by greater regionalization
of water operations. There are now 44 ROCs operating in Romania, some of which are water-
supply only entities, while others also operate wastewater treatment facilities.

134. The prices charged for water in Romania represent a balance between two goals – the need
to cover the full system cost, including the repayment of loans and system expansion – and a goal
of keeping prices affordable. Currently, the government caps tariffs at 4% of the income of the
poorest 10% of households.92 There is nonetheless fairly wide variability in pricing across Romania
[see Table 5.2], including within the same service territory, where cities in adjacent towns may pay
different rates for water and wastewater services. There is currently a goal of rate harmonization
within each ROC service territory, and progress is occurring slowly but steadily.

135. Overall, tariffs have increased in the past ten years, but industry observers nonetheless note
that absent EU support, tariffs are still too low to cover current system costs.93 Part of the
problem is undoubtedly the high rate of ‘non-revenue water”, which is water that enters the
distribution network but is never paid for by customers either due to theft or leakage from pipe
network. In 2007 19 utilities in Romania self-reported their non-revenue water rate to a global
dataset (IB-NET) operated in collaboration with the World Bank. On average, these utilities
reported a non-revenue water rate of just over 40%, placing them at the high end of the spectrum
compared to other eastern European countries.94 [See Table 5.3]

136. One of the issues that may affect revenue levels is the ability of utilities to adequately meter
usage by customers. There is no systematic documentation about the current level of water
metering in place in cities across Romania, or the granularity of the metering capacity. Although
presumably meters have been installed as part of the system upgrade projects funded by the
2007-2013 Operating Program, no information is published about the extent of this work.

137. The need for more widespread and granular metering is obvious. One now-outdated 2007
study of the situation in Pitesti noted that metering was commonplace across the city, but it was

frequently done at the building, rather than individual dwelling scale.95 This limited the ability of
the local water utility to use the tariff system to hold users accountable for high rates of water
use, since the price impact is not fully borne by those responsible for high rates of use. That same
report noted that some unknown number of customers had illegal connections to the water and
wastewater system, eliminating any chance of holding them financially accountable for their use
of these systems. This echoes another study documenting the situation in Bucharest prior to the
year 2000, noting that water consumption was typically not metered but rather assessed on the
basis of estimated household consumption rates, especially in apartment blocks.96


5.3 Linking Water Supply and Treatment Systems to Climate Change

138. Compared to sectors like buildings and transport, water systems tend to receive
comparatively little attention in either city or national level climate mitigation plans. Arguably this
lack of attention to the link between water systems and climate change is proportional to the
relatively small extent to which water supply and treatment systems contribute to overall urban
GHG emissions. That’s not to say the links don’t exist, however. On the carbon mitigation side,
energy demand for the extraction, pre-treatment, and distribution and wastewater treatment can
contribute to greenhouse gas emissions, although given the paucity of data, there is no clear way
of knowing how significant these are.

139. While there is limited data available on the energy performance of water utilities, the 19
Romanian utilities self-reporting to the global IB-Net database appear suggest that energy
expenditures are declining, although the way the data is reported does not make clear whether
energy costs are actually declining, or whether other costs are increasing. [See Figure 5.1] We
assume it is the former, because utility officials interviewed for this project made clear that
controlling energy costs is a priority because it affects their bottom line.

140. Energy efficiency studies carried out by a World Bank team in Brasov, Cluj-Napoca, and
Ploiesti have noted the amount of energy required to both produce potable water and treat
wastewater in these cities compares rather favorably to other cities included in the Bank’s TRACE
benchmarking database. In particular, the wastewater treatment systems in Brasov and Ploiesti
are among the best performers of the cities in the TRACE database,97 98 99 perhaps a testament to
the recent system upgrade projects in those cities which replaced water pumps, captured
methane gas and reused it on site, etc.

141. One area where more is known at an aggregate level is the issue of GHG releases from
wastewater treatment facilities. According to the last national GHG inventory, a total of
approximately 2538 GgCO2e of methane and 627 GgCO2e of Nitrous Oxide are released from
industrial and commercial/residential wastewater treatment facilities around Romania every
year.100 Collectively, this amounts to a total of 2.34% of all GHG releases in Romania.

142. Emissions are generated as the biological material in the sewage breaks down. In fully
enclosed pipes or treatment systems, anaerobic decomposition of the waste results in methane
generation; in aerobic processes, CO2 is produced through the breakdown of organic matter in the
activated sludge process and through the primary clarifiers. Nitrous Oxide is associated with the
degradation of nitrogen components in the wastewater (e.g. urea, nitrate, and protein), and it
may be released during the de-nitrification process at a treatment facility, or in the water
receiving the effluent released by the facility. Solutions may include designing or redesigning a
system to enable the capture and flaring of the gases; or the use of aerobic wastewater treatment
facilities involving activated sludge or filter bed treatments.

143. There is little published information available on the design of, or existing GHG management
practices at wastewater treatment facilities around Romania, so it is difficult to speak to how easy
it will be to modify facilities to further minimize emissions. It is clear that as part of the water
system upgrade investments being pursued in many cities, gas capture and combustion is
frequently a goal of the new facility designs so they become partly energy self-sufficient.

144. Climate studies looking at future hydrological conditions have been prepared for three of
the 11 river basins (Buzau Ialomita, Arges-Vedea, and Mures), each of which are expected are
expected to see sizable decreases in mean annual flow volumes. For example, in the Buzau
Ialomita basin, the mean annual flow is expected to decline by 15-20% during the period 2021-
2050, jumping to 30-40% for the period 2070-2100. The demand-supply gap is expected to be
manageable for the next 15-20 years, but significant demand reduction measures or new supply
capacity will be needed after that. In the Arges-Vedea and Mures river basins, mean annual flows

are expected to decline 10-15% for the period 2021-2050, potentially hampering river navigability
on the Mures and lower Danube rivers.

145. Adapting water systems to climate change is a topic of growing interest around the world,
largely because of the implications it may hold for water availability. In Romania, the Jiu, Arges-
Vedea, Buzau-Ialomita, Siret, Prut-Barlad, and Dogrogea water basins already face supply
reliability during the summer months, especially in dry years. Some of the larger cities in these
regions include Craiova (Jiu), Pitesti (Arges-Vedea), Buzau (Buzau Ialomita), Bacau (Siret), Iasi
(Prut-Barlad), and Constanta (Dobrogea). The Dobrogea system is the most severely affected,
with 95% of the water supply for Constanta obtained from ground water.

146. Climate change may also have impacts on the distribution and treatment systems. Drought
or extreme heat events can change the temperature of surface waters, leading to algae growth
that clogs intake or outflow pipes. Drought can cause shifts in the soil, cracking pipes buried
underground. Power supplies may fail during extreme heat events, preventing proper operation
of pumping stations or treatment facilities.

147. Flooding can overwhelm wastewater treatment facilities, which typically are in low-lying
areas adjacent to waterways where the treated water is ultimately released. Depending on the
way the stormwater system is designed in a city – combined with the sewage system or handled
separately – heavy rainfall events can also overwhelm the design capacity of a wastewater
treatment system. In such instances, raw sewage is typically released to adjacent waterways,
undermining the investments made to prevent this from occurring.

148. Climate resilient water system designs generally include the following features to address
these problems:

                    increased public greenspace)


5.4     Cost of Alternative System Designs

149. There is no systematic answer to the question of how much various system changes would
cost a local authority. Projects are rarely carried out in isolation, meaning distribution system
upgrades are typically procured at the same time wastewater treatment facilities are upgraded,
and projects frequently target improvements in multiple cities or towns. Three projects recently
completed in Romania involve the following system changes and costs:101 102 103

150. Demand reductions strategies designed to reduce customer water usage tend to be
relatively low cost, and would generally fall directly upon the consumer, although the Romanian
government could subsidize the cost to ensure widespread uptake of low flow technology
equipment such as toilets or washing machines, or rainfall capture systems that can cut
landscaping water costs at homes. Utilities might also be encouraged to provide subsidies to
households to install more efficient water-using devices, as reductions in use could delay or
eliminate the need to expand or upgrade local supply capacity.

5.5     Recommendations

151. Over the past 10 years, great progress has been made in extending and improving the
coverage and quality of Romania’s water supply and treatment systems. These gains have largely
been driven by the EU accession agreement obliging Romania to bring these systems up to much
higher performance standards.

152. Going forward, pressure will remain to deliver gains in regions where system upgrades have
yet to occur. Although urban water systems do not have the same level of climate impact of
other sectors such as urban transportation, energy, and buildings, water system upgrades
should be continued as a high investment priority. At the same time these investments are being
pursued for environmental quality and cost efficiency reasons, these system upgrades deliver
climate change mitigation benefits at no significant additional cost. For this reason, the Romanian
Government should position these projects as climate-related investments. Doing so would help
satisfy Romania’s obligation to spend no less than 20% of its operating program funds on climate-
related investments.

153. Other steps the Government should consider are described below.

Section 6: Conclusion

154. Approaching climate change from an urban perspective places boundaries around the topic
that are different than the national or sectoral orientation traditionally applied to the topic. The
use of urban boundaries changes the conversation in meaningful ways, because the impacts on a
specific economy, piece of infrastructure, or neighborhood become much more tangible.

155. In the 2014-2020 Operating Program period, the Romanian Government has an excellent
opportunity to target the mitigation and adaptation needs of cities across the country. Some of
these funds would necessarily represent a continuation of initiatives from the prior programming
period, targeting district energy system upgrades, building efficiency improvements, the
expansion of public transport systems, improvements to water distribution and wastewater
treatment systems, and the development of improved solid waste disposal facilities.

156. Efforts should necessarily prioritize the energy and transport sectors, however. These are
the two largest contributors to Romania’s overall GHG emissions picture, and they face greater
vulnerabilities as a result of climate change. The solid waste and water also require attention,
however, to ensure that Romania achieves the environmental gains and other accession
commitments it made when joining the European Union several years ago. Efforts targeting these
sectors can still be positioned as climate-related investments, helping satisfy Romania’s obligation
to spend no less than 20% of its operating program funds on climate-focused activities.

157. This report has also highlighted significant data and planning gaps that must be addressed.
Little is known about the GHG emission profile of most Romanian cities, or the specific climate
risks these cities will face in the coming decades. Using EU Operating Program funds to support
such analyses would provide the foundation for comprehensive planning activities essential to the
future of Romania’s cities. To the maximum extent possible, these climate plans should be woven
into any long term economic and spatial development strategies that central and regional
government officials are already pursuing. Doing so is critical to ensure that Romania does not
lock its cities into a high carbon pathway, or that policies and investments made today will not
place future economic activity or lives at risk once the impacts of climate change become more
manifest.
