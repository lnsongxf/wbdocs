Overview

The government of Uzbekistan has set itself an ambitious development agenda known as the Vision 2030
Strategy. Under the Strategy, the government intends to accelerate economic growth to lift its 2012 gross
national income per capita from US$1,700 to more than US$4,000 by 2030, which is the income of an upper-
middle-income country. The government’s strategy to achieve these goals in a sustainable fashion—ultimately
aiming for an expansion of the middle class, the promotion of shared prosperity, and the elimination of
poverty—has hinged on creating quality jobs for its citizens.

This report contributes to Uzbekistan’s Vision 2030 Strategy by offering a policy-relevant assessment of the
impact that skills gaps have on employment outcomes. The report presents findings of a multi-year project
involving a large World Bank team and a group of researchers in Uzbekistan. This report builds on existing
labor market studies and makes an additional contribution by measuring and analyzing various types of skills
in the working-age population. 1

The study on worker skills is the first of its kind in Uzbekistan to go beyond the traditional data on
educational attainment. More specifically, large-scale assessments of cognitive and non-cognitive skills of
workers in both the formal and informal sectors, of job seekers, and of those who are inactive by testing and
interviewing respondents is a relatively rare occurrence in middle- and low-income countries, though OECD
countries tend to conduct these assessments more frequently. Data for this report draws primarily from an
innovative survey on jobs, skills, and migration of citizens in Uzbekistan. The survey was developed
specifically for this study and was conducted jointly by the German Society for International Cooperation
(GIZ) and the World Bank in 2013 (see Box 1). The study introduces international benchmarks where
relevant, a unique feature in the case of Uzbekistan, where the lack of data has historically limited the
comparability of labor market indicators.

The main finding of the report is that worker skills gaps are hindering employment outcomes in Uzbekistan.
In fact, beyond worker characteristics and educational attainment, Uzbek employers—particularly formal
sector employers—seek workers who possess both cognitive and non-cognitive skills. The higher
employability and higher wage rates among higher skilled workers is mostly explained by the use of those
skills in the workplaces. But, despite the higher employability and higher wage rates among higher skilled
workers, skills gaps persist in Uzbekistan. Inactive and discouraged individuals have significantly lower
cognitive and non-cognitive skills than employed individuals. And, a large share of employers report
shortages of high-skilled workers.

The above finding on skills gaps hindering employment outcomes is important as policy makers contend with
the labor market challenges facing the population. While Uzbekistan has been able to maintain an overall job
creation rate that is fast enough to keep pace with population growth, the achievement has disappointed
critics who point to the insufficient job growth in the formal sector. The task of creating quality jobs is
formidable because of certain characteristics of the Uzbek labor market. Two stand out: an uneven
distribution of jobs, where women are particularly underrepresented among the employed; and the fact that
youth are more discouraged—the phenomenon whereby people who are willing to work leave the labor force
because they feel that there are no jobs available—than in other countries.

                                                     1
Among the employed, job quality—which is a multidimensional concept that includes earnings, workplace
safety, job security, learning and advancement opportunities, and health and social protection benefits, mental
and physical health, etc.—is of particular concern given that more than half of Uzbekistan’s workers are
employed in the informal sector, and most workers do not learn new things on the job, performing
predominantly repetitive tasks. Compounding these problems are the challenges stemming from labor force
misallocations resulting from weak labor market information systems. These misallocations lead to poor job
placement and skills signaling, but ultimately to low productivity and economic growth.

As discussed earlier, this report is unique because of its analysis of skills among the working age population in
Uzbekistan. The report defines worker skills as cognitive, non-cognitive (social and behavioral), and technical
skills, and focuses on the first two. Cognitive skills capture the ability to use logical, intuitive, and critical
thinking as well as skills such as problem solving, verbal ability, and numeracy. These skills are the basis for
the formation of technical and job-specific skill acquisition later in life. The cognitive skills measured in this
report include memory, literacy, and numeracy skills. Non-cognitive skills represent personality traits and
socio-emotional skills that are relevant in the labor market, including extraversion, conscientiousness,
openness to experience, agreeability, and emotional stability. This study measures the following non-cognitive
skills: openness/sociability, workplace attitude, decision making, achievement striving, and growth mindset.

The global demand for skills is shifting from routine, manual and cognitive skills toward more non-routine,
higher-order skills, including socioemotional (“soft”) skills. However, the education system in Uzbekistan has
a mixed track record of imparting the type of cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are increasingly
demanded by employers. For women, higher educational attainment levels are generally associated with
higher cognitive skills, but there is no relationship between female educational attainment and non-cognitive
skills. To put it bluntly, women do not gain non-cognitive skills from additional levels of schooling. For men,
there is no relationship between educational attainment and either cognitive or non-cognitive skills. While the
reason for this lack of association between skills and educational attainment requires further work, the study
raises questions about the admissions, curricula, and graduation process, especially at the tertiary level.
Furthermore, there is considerable variation in skills scores for a given educational attainment level, which
raises questions about the quality of the education system more generally and its ability to deliver on labor
market-relevant skills.

This report offers a framework that can be helpful to Uzbekistan in light of budget and capacity constraints
to up-skill the current and future workforce. The policy goals can be informed by the Skills Toward
Employability and Productivity (STEP) Framework, which brings together research-based evidence and
practical experience from diverse areas—from research on the determinants of early childhood development
and learning outcomes to policy experience in the reforming of vocational and technical education systems
and labor markets. 2

This report recommends adopting five policy goals to improve the skills of the current and future workforce
in Uzbekistan:
     Getting children off to the right start by expanding access to quality early childhood development
        (ECD) programs, which are critical to ensuring that all children acquire the cognitive and non-
        cognitive skills that are conducive to high productivity and flexibility that are observed later in
        working life.

      Ensuring that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching quality in order
       to address the weak link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
      Building job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active labor market
       programs, with a particular focus on discouraged workers and on increasing the female labor force
       participation, and incentivizing firms to provide on-the-job training to workers.
      Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation by increasing quality tertiary education access for
       motivated students, which can ensure that higher education graduates possess market-valued skills
       and that investments in higher education pay off.
      Matching the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market information systems,
       which can help to make labor markets more efficient by improving the flow of information between
       job seekers and employers and by helping to secure jobs through job signaling.

Box 1: World Bank/GIZ Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey (2013)

The World Bank/German Society for International Cooperation (GIZ) Uzbekistan Jobs, Skills, and Migration Survey is one
of three identical household surveys conducted in Central Asia in 2013—the other countries covered are the Kyrgyz
Republic and Tajikistan.+ Conducted from July to September 2013, the survey collects comprehensive information not
typically captured by traditional household surveys and is representative at the national, regional (Oblast), and
urban/rural levels.

Two distinct instruments are employed in the survey: a core questionnaire and a skills questionnaire. The sample size of
the core questionnaire is 1,500 households with a total of 8,622 individuals. One individual per household was randomly
selected to partake in the skills questionnaire. This second skills questionnaire sample thus consists of 1,500 individuals.
Qualitative testing and pre-pilots helped fine-tune the questionnaires and organize the modules in order to administer
the survey efficiently and consistently.

1. Core questionnaire*
The core questionnaire contains modules focusing on the following topics: education, employment, migration, health
expenditure, remittances, government transfers, financial services, subjective poverty, housing conditions, and household
expenditures. The core questionnaire concludes with the random selection of a household member aged 15 to 64 who is
not a current migrant (the selection is based on a random number table or Kish grid) to be the subject for the skills
questionnaire.

2. Skills questionnaire*
The skills questionnaire contains detailed modules on labor and work expectations, migration and preparation for
migration, language skills, and technical skill training. A unique aspect of the survey is the battery of cognitive and non-
cognitive questions which help to test a respondent’s ability. The cognitive skills module is based on a recent instrument
developed for a similar survey in Bulgaria. The non-cognitive test modules of the skills questionnaire are based on World
Bank Skills Toward Employment and Productivity (STEP) surveys. The skills modules were developed with the support
of a multi-disciplinary panel of experts in psychology, skills assessment, education, and labor markets.

1       Country Context

Uzbekistan is a doubly-landlocked lower-middle income country of 30 million people located at the
crossroads of Central Asia. Having experienced impressive macroeconomic growth since the early 2000s,
the country has set an ambitious goal of attaining upper-middle income status by 2030. To achieve this, the
government’s strategy focuses on expanding the middle class, promoting shared prosperity, and further
eliminating poverty among its citizens. At the core of these objectives lies the need to continuously expand
the supply of quality jobs available to Uzbekistan’s growing population. The engine of sustained long-term
growth in a robust economy, therefore, is a well-educated workforce that meets the demands of a dynamic
labor market focused on high value-added industries.

This report uses the most recent data to assess three areas of jobs and skills in Uzbekistan. First, the
report presents the current labor market outcomes to examine job creation, job distribution, job quality, and the
flows of information that characterize the country’s labor market. Second, the report evaluates the demand for
skills using innovative skill measurement instruments developed by the World Bank. Third, the report
presents the skill formation over the life cycle to assess whether Uzbekistan’s education and training systems
adequately meet the current and future demands of the country’s economy. Combining the jobs and skills
information on Uzbekistan, the report lays out a skills roadmap offering policymakers concrete solutions to
address the labor market challenges facing Uzbekistan. The groundbreaking research that underpins these
findings marks the first ever use of detailed skill measurement surveys in Uzbekistan aimed at informing
public policies.

2                                Labor Market Outcomes

This section presents an overview of Uzbekistan’s labor market outcomes and seeks to answer three
fundamental questions that shed light on the country’s ability to meet the evolving labor market
demand. The questions addressed are:
   (i) Has job creation in Uzbekistan kept pace with population growth?
   (ii) What is the quality of jobs in Uzbekistan?
   (iii) Are workers in Uzbekistan able to find jobs that match their skills with employers’ needs?

As further explained below, job creation has kept up with population growth, and this is particularly
noteworthy in Uzbekistan where population growth rates are high; however, a number of challenges
affecting labor market outcomes remain. For example, jobs are distributed unevenly and youth labor
market discouragement—the phenomenon whereby people who are willing to work leave the labor force
because they feel that there are no jobs available—is high. Moreover, job quality is of particular concern given
that more than half of Uzbekistan’s workers are employed in the informal sector, and most workers do not
frequently learn new things on the job, performing predominantly repetitive tasks. However, a constraint
facing job seekers is that labor market information systems are weak and this, in turn, has led to poor job
placement and skills signaling. In addition to the results presented in the main body of the report, Appendix
D: Summary Tables contains more detailed results on labor market outcomes.

The Uzbek economy has experienced strong economic growth in the last decade. After a period of
deteriorating socio-economic indicators in the post-independence era, economic growth in the late 1990s and
early 2000s consisted primarily of “catch-up growth.” However, more recent economic growth has been
driven predominantly by strong exports, increasing domestic demand, expansionary government policies, and
a strong inflow of remittances. Attaining a growth rate of nearly 8 percent per year, Uzbekistan’s economic
performance in the past decade outpaced not only its peers in ECA, but also the OECD countries (Figure 1).

Job creation has kept pace with the country’s rapid population growth. Despite Uzbekistan’s relatively
high population growth rates, job creation rates in both the formal and informal sectors have generally
outpaced population growth rates. Uzbekistan’s employment rate has grown at an average rate of 2.87
percent per year since 1996, while the working-age population has grown at an equivalent rate of 2.63 percent
per year. However, job creation has fallen short when compared to economic growth rates. Especially in
recent years, Uzbekistan’s growth has been capital intensive. In a forthcoming World Bank report on Vision
2030 in Uzbekistan, the Bank states that continuing the current capital-intensive growth model would not
deliver the income-generating opportunities envisaged under Vision 2030 nor help Uzbekistan continue along
a poverty-reducing trajectory.

While Uzbekistan’s productivity is low relative to other countries, productivity has grown
significantly in the last decade. Uzbekistan’s output per worker has grown by over 4 percent per year
between 2000 and 2011 (Figure 2). This productivity growth has been higher than those seen in Brazil, Chile,
Poland, South Africa, and Turkey. The productivity increase in Uzbekistan has been pronounced since 2004
reflecting higher labor quality, more productive capital, and some resource reallocation to more efficient
sectors such as communications, transport, and industry. 3 However, real wage rates have consistently
outpaced labor productivity. While high real wage growth is potentially good for poverty reduction, if the
trend continues the economy’s competitiveness will be undermined unless sizable total factor productivity
gains materialize. 4

Uzbekistan’s growing working age population (until about 2040) presents a window of opportunity
for increased economic growth (Figure 3). If current labor force participation rates hold, the labor force is
projected to increase by 3.9 million people by 2030, reaching the fifth largest labor force in all of Europe and
Central Asia (after Russia, Turkey, Ukraine, and Poland). If tapped to its full potential, a young and growing
population places the country in an ideal position to reap the full benefits of economic growth. With
dependency ratios (the proportion of the population above 65 and below 15 years of age to the population

enjoy a significant demographic dividend in the coming years. The rate at which Uzbekistan replaces its
unskilled older workers with skilled youth will be important to maximizing the impact of the demographic
dividend on growth and prosperity, and propel Uzbekistan’s economy toward upper-middle-income status.
The two panels in Figure 3 also show that the widow of opportunity to take advantage of the demographic
dividend will not last forever. Beginning in the 2040s, the window will start to close and policy makers in
Uzbekistan will begin to face an aging population.

2.2                                     Jobs are distributed unevenly and labor market discouragement is high

Women are underrepresented in employment and, hence, they remain an under-tapped resource.
Women also make up a disproportionately large share of the country’s unpaid care work. The disparity in
employment rates between women in Uzbekistan and women in OECD countries is almost 20 percentage
points for 25- to 34-year-olds and, more significantly, 42 percentage points for 55- to 59-year-olds (Figure 4,
panel B). If Uzbekistan’s women enjoyed the average female employment rate of OECD countries, there
would be 1.03 million more women contributing to the Uzbek economy today; if Uzbekistan’s female
employment rate was the same as Russia’s, there would be 1.6 million additional contributors to the Uzbek
economy; and if Uzbekistan’s female employment rate was the same as South Korea’s, there would be
400,000 additional contributors to the Uzbek economy. 5

A considerable portion of the population is discouraged and is consequently not looking for work
(Figure 5). Discouraged workers are defined as persons who are not in the labor force and, although they are
available to work, they are no longer seeking employment because they do not believe they will find any. 6
Youth are particularly affected by labor market discouragement—approximately one in ten people aged 20–
24 are not looking for a job because they do not believe they can find one. By comparison, the average share
of discouraged workers among the young labor force (aged 15–24) was just 0.5 percent in OECD countries in
2012. Older men, especially those aged 55–59, also report higher levels of labor market discouragement. For
men, discouragement rates peak for youth as well as for men aged 50–60. There is no second peak in the
female population likely because older women play a role in caring for grandchildren and the elderly at home,
while this is not as widespread a practice for men.

The population of Uzbekistan is internationally mobile, with an estimated 2 million citizens living
abroad as of 2010, which amounts to an emigration rate of approximately 7 percent of the
population. 7 The country’s emigration rate is more than double the world average (3.2 percent) and that of
other middle-income countries (2.7 percent), yet lower than that of Europe and Central Asia as a whole (10.7
percent). Due in part to regional cooperation agreements permitting visa-free entry and waiving requirements
for employment guarantees pre-arrival, the Russian Federation is the primary destination for international
labor migrants, hosting nearly half of Uzbek emigrants as of 2011. 8 Other CIS 9 member states (particularly
Ukraine and Kazakhstan, neither of which require entry visas), the Gulf Cooperation Council countries,
Israel, and the Republic of Korea also attract Uzbek workers, although in substantially smaller numbers. 10

Among the working-age population in Uzbekistan, one in five males is an international migrant, and
among the youth population the international migration rate is even higher. These high migration rates
stem from deficiencies in the domestic labor market as well as from significant international demand for
Uzbek labor. Among youth, the migration rates are particularly high—one in three males between the ages of
20 and 24 is a migrant. By comparison, female migration rates are not as significant as those of the male
population. In contrast to international migration, domestic migration rates are very low, which suggests that
labor allocation within the country may be less than optimal. Domestic migration, or internal migration, plays
a key role in fostering local agglomeration economies. Figure 6 illustrates these trends.

The vast majority of external migrants work in the Russian Federation, and to a lesser extent in
Kazakhstan. As shown in Table 1, the Russian Federation currently hosts over three-quarters of external
labor migrants from Uzbekistan (86 percent). Kazakhstan, the second most important host of labor migrants,
accounts for 12 percent of Uzbek migrants.

2.3                              The labor market has undergone significant transformations

Uzbekistan’s economy has undergone fundamental structural changes over the last 15 years, shifting
employment from the agricultural sector to industry and services. Since the mid-1990s, the Uzbek
government has adopted an industrialization strategy designed to move away from heavy dependence on
agricultural and natural resources and transform the economy into a modern industrial one. These policies
have changed the structure of the economy considerably—while services continue to be a dominant
economic activity, the share of employment in industry has exceeded that of agriculture since 2006 (Figure
7). 11 By comparison, in the OECD countries the share of employment in services on average is larger (73.9
percent), while employment in industry (22.6 percent) and in agriculture in particular (3.5 percent) is less
prevalent. The shift away from agriculture employment has been an important part of the productivity
improvements experienced in Uzbekistan in the last decade. 12

The majority of the employed population works in state-owned firms. More than one in three people
work in state-owned enterprises (SOEs), which is nearly double the number of people working for private
firms (37 percent compared to 20 percent, respectively). Moreover, 34 percent are self-employed,
representing in particular small, informal businesses (Figure 9).

sector. Ninety percent of all the self-employed workers interviewed in the survey work at firms with fewer
than six workers. About 70 percent of all self-employed individuals do not employ any additional workers and

employed are more likely to engage in the services sector as opposed to industry and agriculture sectors. Note
that the majority of individuals working in agriculture in are unpaid family workers (53 percent).

2.4                                 Job quality remains a significant concern for policy makers

Job quality is a multidimensional concept that includes earnings, but also other concepts such as
workplace safety, job security, learning and advancement opportunities, and health and social protection
benefits, mental and physical health, etc. 13 At the other extreme, not having a job undermines life satisfaction
and especially in countries where wage employment is the norm and where the lack of opportunities
translates into open unemployment rather than underemployment. In this section, the concept of informality,
which is work without a labor contract; the type of work performed at typical workplaces; and the use of
technology at work is explored in more detail.

The informal sector employs slightly more than half of all Uzbek workers, raising significant
concerns about possible worker protection from employer exploitation. Although the definition of
informality varies, for the purposes of this analysis the following definition, which is guided by other research
in Europe and Central Asia, is applicable: informal sector workers are those who lack an employment
contract or are unpaid family workers. 14 In Uzbekistan, the people most likely to be engaged in the informal
sector are men, rural residents, and individuals with lower educational attainment levels (Figure 11). In



13World Bank (2012).
14In some studies, individuals who are self-employed in businesses with fewer than six employees are also considered
part of the informal sector. In Uzbekistan, however, there is some indication that a considerable share of these small
businesses pay taxes, so while they are non-corporate, they should not be considered informal.


                                                                              12
agriculture, for example, almost 80 percent of all workers are engaged in the informal sector according to the
above definition.

Uzbekistan’s recent economic success should not overshadow the importance of understanding the
causes of the country’s widespread economic informality. Understanding how informal work and
economic transactions in unregulated and untaxed markets affect employment, well-being, and risk
management are key steps toward creating more quality jobs in Uzbekistan. In all middle-income countries,
even those with large manufacturing and services sectors, it is common to find a share of the labor force
engaged in the informal sector, and thus beyond the reach of taxation, regulation, and protection. Consider
that in the Philippines more than 40 percent of the labor force is engaged in the informal sector and in
Thailand more than 50 percent; in the Republic of Korea, however, fewer than 25 percent of workers are in
the informal sector and in Japan about 10 percent. There is a vigorous debate about whether firms and
workers “exit” or are “excluded” from formality. However, the consequences are similar. That is, informality
imposes costs to the economy at large. For example, people working informally face explicit and implicit
barriers to public and privately provided insurance instruments to manage shocks. In addition, bigger firms
are often over-taxed to make up for revenue lost to the government from widespread tax evasion. Finally, a
large informal economy imposes heavy costs that tend to deteriorate the provision of services and public
goods. 15

Physical work and repetitive tasks are key components of most jobs in Uzbekistan and only half of
all workers seem to learn new things on the job. In this study, physical work is defined as regularly lifting
or pulling anything weighing at least 50 pounds (25 kilograms). Physical work is unsurprisingly common in
the agricultural and industrial sectors, and less so in the services sector (Figure 12). The majority of tasks
performed at work are repetitive in nature (56 percent), and this holds primarily for jobs in the agriculture and

respondents in all three sectors. Only about 41 percent of all respondents working in agriculture and 53
percent in industry state that they learn new things at least once a week. This share is slightly higher, at 61
percent, in services.

The use of computers on the job is relatively low, although computer use is slightly more common
among younger employees in state-owned enterprises, working in the service sector. In Uzbekistan,
only one in five workers report using a computer. This share is low compared to other developing countries.
In the Yunnan province in China 55 percent of workers use computers, in Bolivia and Vietnam 35 percent of
workers use computers, and in Sri Lanka 30 percent of workers use. 16 In Uzbekistan, younger and middle age
workers are twice as likely to use computers (21 percent) as older workers (10 percent). The share of workers
using computers is the highest in state-owned enterprises or the government (36 percent) and in the services
sector (29 percent). Moreover, workers in richer households are considerably more likely to use computers at
work than workers in poorer households, suggesting that higher paying jobs are more likely to require
computer use.

2.5      Labor market information systems are weak, hindering the job search and skills signaling
         process

Obstacles to learning about job vacancies or demonstrating skills to employers may make it difficult
for workers to optimally match their skills in the labor market. Workers need ready access to
information regarding job openings, job search strategies, and methods to effectively present their
qualifications to employers. There is evidence that information gaps and signaling problems hinder efficient
and equitable job matching in Uzbekistan.

Among eight possible survey responses, individuals reported that learning about job vacancies is the
biggest constraint to finding work in Uzbekistan. More than half of all respondents in Uzbekistan (58
percent) indicated that they do not feel they have ready access to vacancy announcements. This suggests that
there is room to improve labor market information in Uzbekistan, not only to ensure that workers know
where to learn about job openings but, most importantly, to ensure that a search effectively seeks to match
jobs to their skillsets.

In addition, workers state that they have difficulty signaling their skills to employers. Once workers
have found the right job vacancy, a crucial part of the job matching process is for workers to signal their skills
to employers. Given incomplete information about applicants, a resume, references, and/or interviews are
typically used as a first screening mechanism. However, certifying or demonstrating qualifications as well as
preparing a resume are the second and third most important constraints mentioned by respondents in

3        The Demand for Skills

This section presents information about the demand for skills in Uzbekistan, mostly drawing from
the 2013 household survey data. The section addresses a fundamental question, namely what skills are
demanded by Uzbek employers? The details ensue, but the study finds that employers seek workers who
possess both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, even when other factors—in particular the level of
educational attainment—are held constant. The analysis also indicates that these skills are generally utilized in
the workplace, which partially explains their demand in the labor market. The section begins by defining
skills. Box 2 defines skills for the purposes of this report. Because of data constraints, this study focuses on
cognitive and non-cognitive skills. In addition to the results presented in the main body of the report below,
Appendix E: Cognitive and Non-cognitive Skill Mean Scores contains more detailed information on cognitive
and non-cognitive skill outcomes.

Box 2: Defining skills

Workers’ skills consist of cognitive, non-cognitive, and technical skills (Figure B2). Because of data
constraints, this study focuses on cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Cognitive skills capture the ability to use
logical, intuitive, and critical thinking as well as skills such as problem solving, verbal ability, and numeracy.
Social and behavioral skills represent personality traits that are relevant in the labor market, including
extraversion, conscientiousness, openness to experience, agreeability, and emotional stability.

The three cognitive skills measured in this study are memory, literacy, and numeracy. The working
memory score is based on twelve items that asked respondents to repeat a sequence of numbers of increasing
length. The literacy score represents reading comprehension skills and builds on five text comprehension
questions about a story card. The informational numeracy score is built using a total of 10 questions
measuring comprehension of a medicine instructions card, a bus schedule card, publicity, and a graph. It
should be noted that the numeracy score represents various aspects of numeracy skills, which often also
require a broader set of cognitive skills such as being literate. In particular, individuals with a high score on
numeracy have the ability to recognize and manipulate numbers contained in and represented by various
formats.

The five non-cognitive skills measured in this study are openness, workplace attitude, decision
making, achievement striving, and the growth mindset scale. The skills are built using the following
items:
    (1) Openness to New Ideas and People (5 items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are you
        interested in learning new things?”);
    (2) Workplace Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that take a very
        long time to complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”);
    (3) Decision Making (5 items; e.g., “Do you think about how the things you do will affect others?”; “Do
        you think carefully before making an important decision?”);

3.1      Employers demand skilled workers, but have difficulty finding them

Employers in Uzbekistan report that inadequate skills in the workforce pose significant obstacles to
firm growth. A 2008 survey of Uzbekistan’s employers revealed that 73 percent of firms identify inadequate
skills of the country’s workers as an obstacle to doing business—up from 60 percent in 2005. More than one-
third of the firms (35 percent) indicated that employee skills posed a “major” or “very severe” obstacle to
growth. A 2013 survey found that industrial enterprises were the most likely to have difficulty finding the
right skills among the available workforce, with nearly half (49 percent) reporting a lack of sufficient numbers
of qualified specialists with a higher education degree (Figure 15). 17

17 The findings in this paragraph are from the 2014 World Bank Uzbekistan higher education report. It relies on the

2005 and 2008 BEEPS data, as well as an employer survey commissioned in 2013 for the higher education report.

Among the traits that employers value in their workers, several non-cognitive as well as cognitive
skills (e.g. Russian and English language knowledge) emerge as those that are most lacking. In a
recent analysis of a survey that interviewed 232 enterprises 18 in Uzbekistan that employed higher education
graduates, supervisors/managers were asked to rate the “importance” of categories of skills and “satisfaction”
with worker skills. Therefore the difference between the importance score and the satisfaction score is a
measure of the importance weighted skills gaps. The largest discrepancy between importance and satisfaction
scores—representing the weighted skills gap—are found in the area of Russian language skills and a number
of non-cognitive skills categories. Among the non-cognitive skills that employers report are both important
and lacking are accepting responsibility for one’s actions, self-motivation, and creativity (Figure 16).

Employment prospects are stronger for university and secondary special/technical educated
individuals, though the gap is more pronounced among women. While individuals who have completed
a secondary special/technical or tertiary education enjoy high employment rates, individuals who have only
completed secondary general are less likely to be employed. Overall, the employment rate among tertiary
graduates is 77 percent, compared to 57 percent for secondary general graduates. This positive correlation is
mostly driven by employment outcomes for women, however. Among men, employment rates vary from 81
percent for secondary general graduates to 84 percent for tertiary graduates.

In Uzbekistan, preschool attendance correlates with employment outcomes. That is, preschool
attendance as a child is correlated positively with the probability of both being employed and having a better
job later in life (Figure 18), but mainly through higher educational attainment. While not implying causality,
on average, adults who attended preschool as a child are more likely to be employed (73 percent) compared
to adults who did not attend preschool (58 percent). Among the employed, a larger share of adults who went
to preschool as a child have formal sector jobs. Doing agricultural work is also less common among adults
who went to preschool as a child. However, when taking into account demographic characteristics such as
age, gender, marital status, geographic location, and educational attainment, then preschool attendance is no
longer a significant predictor of employment outcomes. Educational attainment, instead, determines labor
market outcomes. Therefore, preschool attendance does not impact employment outcomes directly, but
rather through higher educational attainment.

A considerable wage premium is paid to tertiary graduates in Uzbekistan. Figure 19 depicts the
average percentage earnings premium for workers with a tertiary education level relative to workers with
secondary education (both general and technical) who otherwise possess similar observed characteristics. In
Uzbekistan, workers with a tertiary education on average earn a 55 percent higher wage than similar workers
with a secondary education. A high return to tertiary education is a signal of strong demand for higher
educated individuals in the labor market. As such, there is a positive correlation between the degree of
modernization (reforms to transition to a market economy) and the returns to tertiary schooling. 19 Average
college and university premiums are highest in most EU-10 countries and are comparable to other middle-
and high-income countries. Hence, the value and importance of tertiary education is likely to increase in the
coming years as Uzbekistan progresses toward upper-middle-income status. Ensuring adequate access to
quality tertiary and professional education is crucial for meeting the skills needs of an expanding and rapidly
changing economy. In particular, a gap currently exists between the need for and the provision of highly
specialized post-secondary technical education in Uzbekistan. By diversifying the options for tertiary
education provision—including through the introduction of flexible, short-term technical degree and non-
degree programs in specific technical fields—the education system can begin to meet the varied skills needs
of the labor market.

Workers with a tertiary education report that their education is more useful for their job than workers
with a less than secondary or secondary general education. Four out of five tertiary graduates report that
their formal education is “very useful” for their work. In contrast, this share is much lower for people with
less than secondary or a secondary general level of educational attainment. Hence, not only do employers
complain that the education of the workforce in Uzbekistan is inadequate, but workers themselves also report
that their formal education is not as useful as it should be for their job (Figure 20).

Educational institutions are disconnected from enterprises in Uzbekistan, and this is leading to
significant mismatches. A survey of 232 enterprises in Uzbekistan reveals that employers desire to be more
involved in the education process, but report a low level of interest from higher education institutions to
partner with businesses in this area. 20 The lack of such cooperation may in part explain the mismatch between

the fields in which students graduate and the fields in which jobs are created. In the agricultural sector in
particular, a considerable number of specialized secondary education (SSE) students graduated in the period
between 2005 and 2010, while there was in fact a loss of jobs in the sector (Figure 21). In healthcare, physical
culture, and sport, too, the number of SSE graduates by far exceeded the number of jobs created.

3.2     Skills enhance employment outcomes, even when other factors are held constant

Past research has shown a strong and robust relationship between cognitive skills and labor market
outcomes. Much of that research has focused on developed countries, mostly because of data availability,
but there is a growing body of literature on emerging economies. Box 3 summarizes the key evidence in the
literature.

Box 3: Evidence that skills and labor outcomes are related

Past research has shown a strong and robust relationship between cognitive skills and labor market
outcomes. Studies using longitudinal household surveys in the United States find that cognitive test scores
during schooling years are good predictors of the level of wages attained in the labor market (Heckman, 2000;
Heckman and Carneiro, 2003; Cunha et al., 2006. Moreover, the empirical evidence shows that a shortage of
skills is considered to be one of the biggest barriers to employment (Sánchez Puerta, 2009). The empirical
literature on cognitive skills and labor market outcomes distils two types of causal pathways: (i) direct—e.g.
Murnane et al. (1995) assess the role of math skills of graduating high school seniors on their wages at age 24
and find a positive and increasing impact of cognitive skills on wages; and (ii) indirect—e.g. Cunha et al.
(2005) argue that cognitive skills increase the likelihood of acquiring a higher level of education, which in turn
leads to higher economic returns.

There is also growing evidence that non-cognitive skills are important for labor market outcomes.
Even though a more recent phenomenon, the empirical literature on the skills/labor market outcomes nexus
finds a strong and robust relationship between certain non-cognitive skills, such as dependability, persistence,
and docility and labor market outcomes (Heckman et al., 2006; Blom and Saeki, 2011; and Cunha and
Heckman, 2010). A separate strand of the literature argues that non-cognitive skills are particularly valued in
certain sectors (e.g. services). Finally, recent evidence in the context of high income countries suggests that
employers value non-cognitive abilities more than cognitive ability or independent thought (e.g. Bowles et al.,
2001).

In Uzbekistan, employed people have better cognitive and non-cognitive skills than inactive people.
Employed workers performed better on memory, literacy and numeracy tests than inactive individuals. The
gap between those who are employed and those who are inactive is particularly wide for the memory test.
Most of the non-cognitive scores for employed individuals are higher than scores for inactive individuals. Of
particular note are decision making and achievement striving, whose scores deviate considerably between the
employed and the inactive.

Individuals who are discouraged from participating in the labor market have significantly lower
cognitive skills and—to a certain extent—non-cognitive skills than the employed. In fact, those who
are discouraged from participating in the labor market possess similar cognitive skills as inactive individuals.
In terms of non-cognitive skills, interestingly, decision making in particular seems to be low among
discouraged individuals, while self-reported workplace attitude and achievement striving do not seem
problematic. The skill gaps among discouraged individuals results may, in part, explain why such individuals
face difficulties finding a job. Of course, skills alone do not explain labor market discouragement. Individuals
may exit the labor force for a variety of reasons including high reservation wages, immobility, a lack of
connections needed to secure jobs, or simply unrealistic expectations. However, low skill levels among the

discouraged are particularly noteworthy because youth are overrepresented in the discouraged population,
and given the youth bulge in Uzbekistan, the mismatch in skills raises the stakes for policymakers.

Cognitive and non-cognitive skills are generally stronger among public sector workers, while the
private sector does poorly (Figure 23). The public sector and SOEs attract highly skilled workers—both in
terms of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. Self-employed workers also appear to have high cognitive skills,
but do not score as well on many of the non-cognitive skills except decision-making skills, where they are
particularly strong. The private sector workers, who include workers in the informal sector, do poorly with
respect to cognitive and non-cognitive skills without exception.

Formal sector workers have better memory skills, but other cognitive or non-cognitive skills are
statistically similar between formal and informal sector workers. Figure 24 depicts cognitive and non-
cognitive skill outcomes among formal and informal salaried workers. Despite visible discrepancies in average
cognitive skills between formal and informal sector salaried workers, only memory skills are significantly
better among employees in the formal sector. Among the other measures cognitive and non-cognitive skills,
no statistically significant differences are observed between formal and informal sector workers.

Holding all else constant, cognitive and non-cognitive skills are positively associated with
employment in Uzbekistan. An analysis was conducted in order to assess the probability of being
employed, conditional on a respondent’s set of cognitive and non-cognitive skills. 21 In addition, the model
controls for the usual socio-demographic variables (age, gender, place of residence, and educational
attainment). The findings suggest that certain cognitive and non-cognitive skills are significantly associated
with a higher probability of being employed. In particular, memory score (cognitive skill) and decision making
(non-cognitive skill) are found to be positively and significantly associated with the probability of being
employed, as opposed to being out of work. More specifically, an increase in the memory score by one
standard deviation is associated with a 15 percent increase in the likelihood of an individual being employed;
similarly an increase in the decision-making score by one standard deviation is associated with an increase in
the likelihood of being employed by 14 percent.

The probability of employment in the more modern sector, i.e., industry and services, is significantly
affected by an individual’s cognitive and non-cognitive skills. As economies develop and prosper, they
also undergo a process of structural shift, whereby jobs are shifted from the traditional sectors (agriculture) to
the modern ones (industry and services). This shift also implies a rise in importance of the cognitive and non-
cognitive skills in the so-called “modern” sector. 22 In order to gauge this relationship, we restrict the analysis
conducted above only on the probability of employment in the industry and services sectors. The results

reveal that numeracy and decision making again are significant determinants of employment in the modern
sector, as opposed to working in agriculture or being out of work. However, for women, openness/sociability
is also found to be positive and statistically significant; and for men, workplace attitude is found to be positive
and significant. More work is needed to understand why there is a gender difference in the types of skills
valued by employers, especially given that these hold true even when sectors of employment are also held
constant.

Workers with cognitive and non-cognitive skills are generally employed in formal sector jobs. Higher
skills imply not only higher employability, but also a higher chance of obtaining a job in the formal sector,
typically jobs in the state administration or SOEs, as well as in medium or large privately-owned companies.
There are numerous benefits associated with employment in these sectors, including job security and various
social protection benefits. In order to explore the relationship between a worker’s skills and the probability of
having a formal sector job, the study analyzes employment in the state administration, SOEs, as well as
private enterprises employing more than 6 employees. 23 Workers with cognitive and non-cognitive skills are
generally employed in formal sector jobs.

Young adults possess better cognitive skills than older adults, but the pattern is not as clear for non-
cognitive skills. Figure 25 shows two interesting patterns. First, young adults generally have better cognitive
skills than older adults. Second, with the exception of literacy, employed people have higher cognitive skills
than inactive people. This holds both for the young and old age cohort. Similarly, employed people score
higher than inactive people for most measures of non-cognitive skills as well, for both young and older
cohorts. Among the employed, young people show more openness and achievement striving attitude, a
finding that is also observed in other countries. Older workers and younger workers have similar workplace
attitudes and decision-making skills. Note that young inactive adults scored lowest on all non-cognitive skills,
with the exception of workplace attitude. Also, nearly all cognitive scores reported are negative, indicating
that individuals in the middle-age group (35–54 years old) have better cognitive skills than both young and
old adults.

Box 4: Skills and migration in Uzbekistan and Kyrgyzstan

Existing studies find that migrants and non-migrants differ with respect to education and skills.
Among the reasons are the selective migration of groups who can gain disproportionally from mobility
(Borjas, 1987), investments in higher education for those who aspire to migrate (Mountford, 1997), or
specific pre-migration investments in human capital (Danzer and Dietz, 2014). There is a broad range of
literature on the self-selection of migrants with respect to formal educational attainments (e.g., Chiquiar and
Hanson, 2005; Lanzona, 1998; Orrenius and Zavodny, 2005). However, evidence on the cognitive and non-
cognitive skill endowment of migrants is scarce.

An analysis of adults with the intention to migration in the Kyrgyz Republic and Uzbekistan reveals
that working age adults who plan to migrate typically possess above average cognitive and non-
cognitive skills, compared to adults who have no migration plans (Figure 26). Note that this analysis
cannot be conducted for each of the countries separately because the sample size is too small. For cognitive
skills, the gap between working age adults who do and do not plan to migrate is sizeable for memory skills
(greater than 20% of a standard deviation) and modest for literacy skills, but there is no difference for
numeracy skills. For all measured non-cognitive skills, individuals with migration plans perform better than
individuals without migration intentions; the gap is especially large with respect to achievement striving,
reflecting the fact that migrating abroad implies a strongly positive contribution to family income in Central
Asia. The finding that individuals who are planning to migrate, on average, have better cognitive and non-
cognitive skills than others in the working-age population supports existing selection theories of migration.
The results also suggest that studies focusing exclusively on education may draw very different conclusions.

Similarly, migrants who have returned after working abroad have significantly higher cognitive and
non-cognitive skill outcomes than non-migrants (Figure 27). The gaps in cognitive skills between
migrants who have returned and non-migrants are very large in absolute terms and much larger than the gaps
seen between adults who intend to migrate and adults who do not plan to migrate. While this potentially
implies learning effects through migration, it could also point to the fact that not all individuals who intend to
migrate follow through and actually move migrate. On the other hand, the skills gaps between migrants who
return and non-migrants are lower than the gaps found between adults with the intention to migrate and
working age adults with no migration intentions. The notable exception is decision making, in which migrants
who return have high scores. Hence, while individuals who plan to migrate do not have much higher decision
making skills, actual migrants have much higher decision making skills. This result could point either to the
fact that adults with good decision making skills following through with their migration intentions, or that
migrants learn such decision making skills while abroad. Disentangling these different possibilities remains for
future research.

3.3         Higher skilled workers use their skills more often in the workplace

Comparing a worker’s skillset and use of skills on the job can help establish whether skills are
effectively put to use in the labor market. If the labor market were to effectively make use of workers’
skills, then there would be a positive correlation between ability and the use of skills on the job. For example,
a person with better numeracy ability would use math skills more frequently and intensely on the job. This
section examines whether the labor market in Uzbekistan indeed uses workers’ skills efficiently. It is
important to keep in mind that the results presented are correlations and they do not denote causation. It may
well be that individuals who make more frequent use of math skills on the job score higher on a math ability
test precisely because they use those skills on a daily basis. Such bi-directional links between skill use and skill
ability is an important caveat when interpreting the results.




                                                                     29
In Uzbekistan, workers with better cognitive skills are more likely to use those skills on the job, and
are less likely to engage in physical work routinely. Figure 28 depicts the percentage of individuals with a
low, medium, and high numeracy ability who use math skills (doing any multiplication) on the job (left panel)
and engage in physical work (right panel). There is a clear positive correlation between numeracy ability and
using those numeracy skills on a regular basis on the job. In addition, the share of individuals doing physical
work is lower among those with a high cognitive ability, compared to those with a low cognitive ability. There
is an exception in urban areas, where people with a medium cognitive ability tend to do more physical work
than both the low and high ability groups. As expected, however, physical work is less common across the
board in urban areas compared to rural areas.

skills on the job. The share of respondents having contact with people other than colleagues (such as clients,
customers, or students) is higher among those who self-reported to be relatively open and sociable (Figure
29). Questions designed to determine openness/sociability include “are you talkative?” and “are you outgoing
and sociable?” More details on the non-cognitive skills measures are presented in Appendix B.

4          Skill Formation over the Life Cycle

This section assesses skill formation coupled with educational attainment levels in Uzbekistan.
Relying on the rich household survey data from Uzbekistan in 2013, it addresses a fundamental question:
namely, does the education and training system in Uzbekistan meet the employers’ demand for skills? Or
more specifically, does the education and training system impart the cognitive and non-cognitive skills needed
to successfully participate in the labor market in Uzbekistan? The short answer is that although skills are
formed in every stage of an individual’s life and by a variety of actors, including families who play a very
important role, the government’s track record of meeting the demand for skills in the workplace is mixed.
Uzbekistan has performed better than most middle-income countries to ensure access to general education,
but employer demands for workers with tertiary level skills has gone unmet. With a higher demand for “new
economy” skills in the labor market, as seen around the world almost without exception, Uzbekistan will need
to find a way to compete globally. This study finds that a positive correlation exists between the education
and training system and cognitive and non-cognitive skills for women in Uzbekistan. However, the
correlation is statistically insignificant for men, which is a peculiar finding and raises questions about the
admissions, curricula, and graduation process, especially at the tertiary level.

4.1        Skills are developed throughout the life cycle of an individual

Skills are developed through all stages of life—from conception to preschools, in primary and
secondary schools, in tertiary education, and on the job—and there are sensitive and critical
development periods for each type of skill. Recent evidence suggests that the most sensitive and critical
moments for skill-building differ by skill type; these “malleable” periods are depicted in green in Figure 30.
Cognitive and non-cognitive skills are formed earlier on in life, while technical skills are developed later. The
early childhood period is critical in the development of cognitive skills. This stage marks the first step of skill-
building, and it can be particularly critical in closing the gap between children from poorer and better-off
households. In fact, there are strong indications that the most critical moment for cognitive skill-building is
before the age of 5. By ages 8–10, the foundations of an individual’s cognitive abilities are well set. Non-
cognitive skills are then continuously developed throughout adolescence and into adulthood. 24

To develop the skills needed for productive employment, past studies have shown that developing
solid cognitive and non-cognitive skills early in life is critical. Strong cognitive and non-cognitive skills
feed into the successful acquisition of technical skills, as solid cognitive and non-cognitive foundations will
help workers to strengthen their technical skills throughout their working lives. 25 They also determine a
person’s readiness to learn over their life cycle by shaping the capacity and motivation to absorb new
knowledge, adapt, and solve new problems. This is crucial in a dynamic economic environment where
specific skills can be rendered obsolete. This is not to say that generic skills, particularly non-cognitive skills,
are an alternative to academic qualifications. Instead, careful attention to them is a powerful way to improve
educational attainment, life-long learning, and thus employability. 26

4.2        Access to general education is good, but preschool and tertiary school coverage is low

Uzbekistan has made great strides to ensure universal access to basic education, yet important
challenges remain. Even though enrollment levels in primary and secondary education are now on par with
the developed countries of the OECD, access to pre-primary and tertiary education falls short, given
Uzbekistan’s level of development. Only 26 percent of preschool age children were enrolled in 2011, which
compares unfavorably to Kazakhstan (48 percent), Malaysia (69 percent), Russia (90 percent), and the
economies of the OECD (86 percent). Preschool education is important because healthy cognitive and
emotional development in the early years lead to tangible economic returns. Early interventions are more cost
effective when compared with remedial services later in life. Meanwhile, enrollment in tertiary education is
among the lowest in the world, with only 9 percent of secondary graduates pursuing further studies. In
contrast, tertiary enrollment rates in comparator countries range from 41 percent in Malaysia and Kazakhstan
to 76 percent in Russia and the OECD countries (Figure 31). The consequences of underinvestment in
preschool and post-secondary education are serious. Research shows that investing in children early on can be
the most cost-effective way to impart skills that contribute to higher productivity later in life. Furthermore,

Uzbekistan’s low female labor force participation rates. In addition to the results presented, Appendix D:

the number of children who are of the corresponding school enrollment age.

More than half of all students currently enrolled in higher education belong to households in the top
consumption quintile, which may imply financial accessibility barriers (Figure 32). This suggests that
there may be individuals with a high cognitive ability in low-income households who are unable to attend
higher education. This, too, can explain why some individuals with a low level of completed education have a
stronger cognitive ability than others with a high level of completed education.

Of course, learning does not end at the secondary or tertiary level; a significant portion of learning
takes place on the job and in what is often termed adult (post-formal) education. This includes skills
acquired while learning by doing and during on-the-job training. In the United States, it is estimated that on-
the-job training contributes approximately one-quarter to one-half of all human capital (Heckman et al.,
1998). Not surprisingly, there is ample literature documenting (albeit largely in OECD countries) that adult
education and training increases worker productivity. 27

Despite international evidence about the importance of post-formal education, few firms in
Uzbekistan offer formal training programs to full-time employees. Firms tend to underinvest in their
own employees, possibly as a result of market failures that dissuade such investments. In Uzbekistan, less
than one-quarter of all firms offer their full-time employees formal training programs. This is significantly less
than the proportion of firms offering training in Eastern Europe and less than the training offered in
neighboring Eurasian countries. To illustrate, consider that almost 70 percent of firms in the Czech Republic
offer formal training to their full-time employees and 60 percent of Polish firms do the same (Figure 33).

4.3        The correlation between educational attainment and cognitive skills outcomes is weak, and
           there is significant variation within education levels

Cognitive skills are correlated with educational attainment among women, but surprisingly, among
men this correlation only holds for numeracy skills. For women, there is a significant difference in all
three cognitive skills indicators (memory, literacy, numeracy) across education levels (Figure 34). Among
working-age men, there are no significant differences in memory and literacy skills outcomes across
educational attainment levels, not even between men with a secondary general education and men with

27 A study by the OECD (2004) shows, among other things, that employee training impacts wage growth of young or

highly educated employees, and employee training allows attaining and maintaining the competences required to bring
productivity in line with market wages of older and lower-educated workers.

general education and men with either secondary special/technical or tertiary education. While the cognitive
skills outcomes are not a direct test of a person’s grasp of school-related knowledge, it is nevertheless
surprising that men do not improve their literacy skills with higher educational attainment. Further work is
clearly warranted, but the results raise questions about the admissions, curricula, and graduation process in
Uzbekistan, especially at the tertiary level.

The wide dispersion in cognitive skills among individuals with the same education level may
suggest issues of quality of the education system, though results have to be interpreted with caution.
It is important to note that there are several limitations to interpreting the cognitive skills outcome
distribution (Figure 35). The cognitive skills measures are likely to suffer from measurement error. In
particular, the cognitive skills questions are not able to precisely distinguish individuals with a high ability
from individuals with a very high ability. This can be a reason for the heterogeneity in skills outcomes among
individuals with the same education level. Given these caveats, however, there are individuals who have
completed secondary education but have higher cognitive skills outcomes than individuals who have
completed a tertiary education. These individuals might have had the potential to continue their education but
have not had the opportunity to do so. Barriers to accessing education may play a role in these results. In
addition, variation in the quality of education could be another explanation for the observed results.

There is little data available about the quality of education in Uzbekistan, but the most recent
OECD Program for International Student Assessment (PISA) results in the neighboring country of
Kazakhstan indicate that there is cause for concern. PISA participation has led a number of countries to
realize that their education systems are greatly in need of reform and has, in fact, prompted reforms. While
there are several examples, Germany and Poland are good case studies of countries that were spurred by weak
PISA results to reform their education systems and thereby improve their PISA performance. The OECD
PISA captures the cognitive abilities—reading, math, and science—of 15-year-olds and thus reflects the new
generation of labor market entrants. Both Kazakhstan and the Kyrgyz Republic participated in 2009, and
both scored well below other participating countries, such as Mexico and Turkey, both of which have
comparable GNI per capita levels.

4.4        There is a weak correlation between educational attainment and non-cognitive skills

Good quality schooling can enhance the non-cognitive skills of students. Non-cognitive skills can be
produced in schools under the right circumstances. Several studies in the psychology literature have shown
the important role of non-cognitive skills on schooling performance, 28 comparable to that of cognitive skills.

At the same time, schooling itself is also a determinant of non-cognitive skills in individuals. 29

In Uzbekistan, the majority of non-cognitive skills outcomes are not significantly correlated with
educational attainment. Figure 36 shows that the majority of the non-cognitive skills measured do not
differ significantly across individuals with varying educational attainment levels. Among men, only
openness/sociability is significantly correlated with educational attainment. Among women, the decision-
making score and the growth mindset indicator is significantly higher if a woman completed more education
than a secondary general degree. In general, however, there is a lack of correlation between educational
attainment and non-cognitive skills, which suggests a disconnect in the educational system.

5        The Skills Roadmap in Uzbekistan

Uzbekistan aims to take advantage of its young and growing population and make better use of its
human capital. By boosting its employment outcomes, Uzbekistan intends to attain its Vision 2030 goal of
becoming an upper-middle-income country by the year 2030. Policy makers, however, recognize that
attaining that goal will require skilling up Uzbekistan’s current and future workforce. While this is not an easy
goal, it is an achievable one. Policy makers will have to respond to the increased demands from employers for
strong cognitive and non-cognitive skills. There is a strong demand for skills in the Uzbek economy, as
evidenced by significant positive labor market returns to both cognitive and non-cognitive skills, yet workers
themselves complain about the inadequacy of their training for productive employment.

A number of actors play a role in building skills throughout the life cycle of an individual, targeting
the current and future workforce to different degrees. Policies can target the future workforce, usually by
focusing on families and communities and the formal education system, and/or the current workforce, by
focusing on adult training institutions and firms. Families and communities play an important role in skill
development of the future workforce, especially during the early years by ensuring good nutrition and
stimulation, but they continue to play a role throughout the life cycle. Formal educational institutions,
beginning with pre-schools and extending through to tertiary education, are also important for skill formation
of future workers. Adult training institutions, which include non-traditional training institutions and second-
chance educational institutions, can help to strengthen the skillsets of the current workforce. Similarly, adults
derive skills at work, either during on-the-job training programs or by learning by doing.

The policies pursued can be informed by the Skills Toward Employability and Productivity (STEP)
Framework within the government’s strategic vision. The STEP framework which brings together
research-based evidence and practical experience from diverse areas—from research on the determinants of
early childhood development and learning outcomes to policy experience in the reforming of vocational and
technical education systems and labor markets. 30

This report recommends five policy goals to improve the skills of the current and future workforce in
Uzbekistan:
    Getting children off to the right start by expanding access to quality ECD programs, which are
       critical to ensuring that all children acquire the cognitive and non-cognitive skills that are conducive
       to high productivity and flexibility that are observed later in working life.
    Ensuring that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching quality in order
       to address the weak link between educational attainment and cognitive and non-cognitive skills.
    Building job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active labor market
       programs, with a particular focus on discouraged workers and to increase the female labor force
       participation, and incentivizing firms to provide training to workers.
    Encouraging entrepreneurship and innovation by increasing quality tertiary education access for
       motivated students, which can ensure that higher education graduates possess market-valued skills
       and that investments in higher education pay off.
    Matching the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market information systems,
       which can help to make labor markets more efficient by alleviating lack of information about
       vacancies by jobseekers and help to secure jobs through job signaling.

5.1        Get children off to the right start by expanding access to quality early childhood
           development programs

Uzbekistan needs to expand access to quality ECD programs to enhance cognitive and non-
cognitive skills development from an early age. Getting children off to the right start, with quality ECD,
can contribute to technical, cognitive, and non-cognitive skills conducive to high productivity and flexibility in
the work environment. As discussed earlier, only 26 percent of preschool age children were enrolled in 2011,
which is far below the enrollment rate of OECD countries (86 percent), Russia (90 percent), and neighboring
countries such as Kazakhstan (48 percent). The case for investing in preschools has been made multiple times
and by numerous researchers. The argument is that the intervention is usually the most cost effective way to
produce the desired cognitive and non-cognitive skills in students, and hence, to produce the desired
characteristics that will lead to productive workers. Well-conceived preschool education has been shown to
produce students who are more successful in subsequent schooling and are well adjusted socially and
emotionally. Furthermore, the benefits of well-conceived preschool programs generally dwarf the costs and
hence, universal access is a desirable goal. The Nobel laureate James Heckman estimates that every dollar
invested in high-quality ECD programs yields a 7–10 percent return per annum, and, in fact, policies that
provide ECD to disadvantaged children have even higher returns. 31 These high rates of return are fairly
consistent in the literature because ECD, it is argued, raises the returns to investment later in life as children
learn how to learn. A robust literature has concluded that delays in cognitive development during the early
years of a child’s life lead to reduced employability, productivity, and overall welfare.

5.2        Ensure that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving teaching quality

Policy makers need to ensure that all students learn by modernizing the curricula and improving
teaching quality. Developing modern curricula and teaching methods will strengthen the link between
educational attainment and cognitive and non-cognitive skills. There is a tremendous amount of research and
emerging consensus on the benefits of interventions designed to support skills development during distinct
life stages. Although many of these programs have only been evaluated in the United States and other high-
income countries, there is increasing evidence of their universal effectiveness. In a number of countries,
social-emotional interventions have been integrated into the regular academic curriculum. The empirical
evidence for Uzbekistan clearly shows that stronger cognitive and non-cognitive skills enable workers to
obtain better jobs. Therefore, improving skills is a key policy objective for Uzbekistan’s development plans.
While the country has achieved universal access to general education and completion rates are good, policy
makers also need to improve the quality of education, which also implies improving the cognitive and non-
cognitive skills gained through schooling. Higher quality education will yield better problem-solvers, more
critical thinkers, better communicators, and effective team players—in short, a better workforce.

Policy makers also need to focus on reforming the pre-primary and primary education system so as
to strengthen non-cognitive skills formation. An increasing number of countries worldwide have
integrated non-cognitive learning into the regular academic curriculum by training teachers, adopting a
structured curriculum, and investing in efforts to improve the school climate. Non-cognitive skills acquired at
an early age can lead to lasting habits and characteristics of social interaction. Schools are a key channel for
skills development at a young age, given that children are typically in a single classroom with a single teacher

and the same group of peers for an entire school year. This “single point” of entry reduces the cost of
interventions and increases the likelihood of impacting skills development.

5.3      Build job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active labor
         market programs

Uzbekistan could build job-relevant skills that employers demand by implementing selective active
labor market programs that respond to domestic and international labor market needs. Building job-
relevant skills will require a multi-pronged effort that includes: (i) addressing the technical or job-specific skills
gaps by implementing labor market programs; (ii) addressing market failures that prevent firms from
providing on-the-job training (OJT) and incentivizing firms to provide OJT; (iii) improving migrant skills to
increase their earning capacity, and therefore their ability to support their families in Uzbekistan; and (iv)
strengthening the link between migrants’ skills and labor market needs abroad, the quality of workers’ skills,
and the visibility of those skills.

Up-skilling the workforce in Uzbekistan would boost employment rates by addressing the technical
or job-specific skills gaps by implementing selective active labor market programs (ALMPs). While
the country’s job creation rate has kept up with population growth rates, ALMPs can further boost the
employment rates by activating youth and women. Uzbekistan spends relatively little on ALMPs in
comparison to other European and Central Asian countries; therefore, allocating funds to support effective
programs is likely to yield desirable outcomes. ALMPs can include job placement assistance services,
counseling with employment advisors, job application and interview preparation, CV composition,
informational interviews, and in-depth assessment of skills and abilities. One element in common is that all
ALMPs are designed to encourage the unemployed, the discouraged, and the inactive populations to more
actively seek jobs, thereby improving their prospects for employment. Countries offer a menu of ALMPs
including training programs (including socio-emotional skills), public works projects, employment subsidies,
and matching workers and jobs through intermediation services. As with any program, their efficacy should
to be evaluated to gauge whether the design of the program is optimal given stated objectives.

Uzbekistan can also benefit from addressing market failures that prevent firms from providing on-
the-job training (OJT) and incentivizing them to do so. OJT is an important channel through which
workers upgrade their skills during their time at work. It is also a vehicle that can help firms adopt new
technologies and new business practices. In Uzbekistan, less than one-quarter of all firms offer their full-time
employees formal training programs. This is a lower proportion than most countries in Europe and Central
Asia. In Europe, OJT is far more common. For example, almost 70 percent of firms in the Czech Republic
offer formal training to their full-time employees; 60 percent of Polish firms do so; and 54 percent of
Lithuanian firms do the same. Identifying the reasons for the varying levels of OJT in each country context is
a prerequisite for designing effective policy responses. Uzbekistan must design policies that strive to support
firms that, despite positive expected returns, do not train their workers. To encourage the implementation of
ALMPs, policy makers have several instruments at their disposal, such as credit and subsidy programs or tax
grants that can be used to deal with liquidity constraints and incentivize training. These types of programs
have been used successfully in a number of countries in Western Europe and Eastern Asia.

Similarly, improving migrant skills increases their earning capacity, and therefore their ability to
support their families in Uzbekistan. To do so, policy makers can introduce pre-departure training
programs for migrants to ensure that they have the basic language skills and knowledge of social services


                                                         42
provision and migrant protection programs. The Philippines, for example, carries out pre-departure reviews
and approvals of contract terms, in addition to providing a mandatory pre-departure orientation. In addition,
in order to help migrants secure better jobs abroad, it is important that existing skills are appropriately
recognized and valued. Enhancements to the existing migrant job placement system, including better
registration and pre-selection assessment, could help avoid the “brain waste” that often impacts mid-skilled
workers, devaluing not only their skills while abroad, but also the benefits of the international migration
experience for both the individual workers and Uzbekistan.

Education and labor market reforms—such as public-private partnerships on business-friendly
curriculum development, support for on-the-job training and apprenticeship programs, and
improved labor market diagnostics—can also benefit international migrants. Such programs could
increase Uzbek migrants’ ability to apply their skills abroad by making skills more visible to employers. This
would in turn enable them to expand their skills abroad, which could then be absorbed into the domestic
market upon their return, resulting in productivity and wage improvements at home. This is particularly
important given the large number of migrant workers in sectors such as construction and those with
secondary or technical education, and the fact that mid-skilled workers are often at the highest risk of brain
waste. 32

To improve the link between migrants’ skills and labor market needs abroad, the quality of workers’
skills, and the visibility of those skills, the government of Uzbekistan could pursue a three-pronged
strategy. First, develop partnerships with Ministries of Labor and business leaders in key destination
countries and sectors to identify skills needs and raise the profile of Uzbek laborers. Second, conduct labor
market diagnostics to identify sectors with demand for laborers, both domestically and abroad. And third,
invest in improved vocational and technical training programs.

5.4        Encourage entrepreneurship and innovation by increasing tertiary education access

One way for policy makers to encourage entrepreneurship and innovation is to increase tertiary
education access together with other measures to create an environment that encourages
investments in knowledge and creativity. Emerging evidence shows this requires innovation-specific skills
(which can be developed starting early in life) and investments to connect people with ideas (such as through
collaborations between universities and private companies) as well as risk-management tools that facilitate
innovation. Increasing access to quality tertiary education is essential for the development of a high-skilled
workforce that is entrepreneurial and innovative. Demand for high-skilled labor can be met by increasing the
number of quality tertiary graduates. This is likely to become more important as the economy evolves and
demands more non-routine skills, as observed in other middle- and high-income countries. A recent World
Bank report has highlighted some of the key policies that can address problems associated with access to
tertiary education. 33 They include: increasing the number of spaces available to entering cohorts, especially
women, and differentiating degree and non-degree programs so that short-term technical and occupational
courses can offer more immediate responses to the skills demanded.

To ensure quality at the tertiary level, measuring the skills produced is important. The development of
an independent quality assurance agency is critical for a modern higher education system. The existing State
Testing Center in Uzbekistan can be further equipped to perform this role. In addition, individual institutions

                                                      43
of higher education should perform “internal” quality assurance through so-called Quality Enhancement Cells
based partly on self-assessments and peer reviews by other higher education institutions. Introducing some
elements of the Bologna Process, which aims to make academic degrees and quality assurance standards more
comparable and compatible across Europe, would provide a structure for quality enhancement and systems
integration that could allow the quality assurance system in Uzbekistan to achieve globally recognized
operating standards.

Tertiary graduates should be equipped with market-relevant skills. This requires a three-pronged
approach. First, regular and independent market surveys should monitor the skills requirements in the labor
market. Second, partnerships with both domestic and foreign academic institutions (research partnerships,
faculty exchanges, and training) as well as domestic and foreign industry (modernizing curricula, laboratories,
innovation platforms, research, and joint business development) can help strengthen the links between higher
education institutions and the labor market. Third, more generally, ensuring high-quality equipment in
relevant and priority technical fields, together with modern curricula, trained faculty and staff, and related
university-industry linkages is crucial.

5.5        Match the supply of skills with employer demand by improving labor market information
           systems

Uzbekistan needs to match the supply of skills with employer demand improving labor market
information systems. These systems can help to make labor markets more efficient enables skills to be
transformed into actual employment and productivity. A key reform priority could be to improve labor
market information systems to ease the transition from school to work. In Uzbekistan, more than half of all
respondents (58 percent) indicated that they do not feel they are able to learn about vacancies. The problems
caused by asymmetric information between job seekers and employers are more far reaching because they
affect students’ educational choices, firms’ selection of workers, and/or the time that it takes to fill
vacancies. 34 In other words, labor market information systems speak to the efficient allocation of resources in
a country. Facilitating information flows in Uzbekistan will be important, especially for youth and first-time
job-seekers, because it will help to dismantle the current rigid manpower planned system in which the number
of university slots is determined based on the number of government jobs available for graduates.

A number of modernizing countries have successfully labor market information systems designed to
dismantle planned manpower education structures. In Poland, for example, employment observatories
were introduced to provide information on job availability, wages, career prospects, and hiring expectations. 35
Employment observatories are also available in Chile and Colombia. The key concept behind employment
observatories is that information about major industries, recent growth areas, occupations experiencing
shortages, qualifications needed for jobs, etc., can help people make more informed choices about their
courses and careers. Information of this type is routine in the United States, EU countries, and Australia. A
number of emerging countries are also beginning to expand their labor market information systems.

Employment observatories use a rich array of data to monitor and disseminate information about the
labor market. The data managed by employment observatories include: (1) administrative data from public
employment offices on unemployment, vacancies, and active labor market programs; (2) data from the
national statistics office including labor force survey and household survey information, usually disaggregated

by region; and (3) data from special-topic surveys (usually “sociological”). Employment observatories use
multi-media to disseminate information, ranging from traditional paper-based information to YouTube
videos and text/SMS messaging. The information is disseminated at irregular intervals, dictated by the speed
with which the information is processed.

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 34-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to assess five
different “cognitive” skills. These cognitive skills can be conceptualized as falling into two domains:
     (1) Executive functioning skills, defined as the cognitive control capacities that enable individuals to
         “organize their thinking and behavior with flexibility, decrease their reactive responding to contextual
         cues and contingencies, and engage in self-regulated … behavior” (Welsh et al., 2010). Researchers in
         developmental psychology and elsewhere propose that such skills are important for school readiness
         and labor force attainment since they enable individuals to regulate cognitive and emotional
         responses that in turn allow individuals to engage more effectively in learning activities (Fuchs et al.,
         2005). We assessed one component of executive functioning—working memory—using a 12-item
         memory scale adopted from the Skills and Labor Market Survey (ENHAB) 36. These items tested the
         short-term recall of increasingly longer number sequences (starting with two numbers and ending
         with 9 numbers). Enumerators gave respondents three practice examples with two-number
         sequences to train the respondents on how to answer the questions, and were instructed to read out
         numbers at a regular pace to avoid grouping.
     (2) Domain-specific skills, consisting of “knowledge of ideas, facts and definitions, as well as … formulas
         and rules” (Boekarts, 1997, p. 164) about specific domains such as literacy and numeracy. In turn,
         each broader domain can be conceptualized as including other branches; mathematics, for example,
         includes concepts such as number recognition, arithmetic, and graph comprehension (Fuchs et al.,
         2005; Pinker, 1990). In this study, we assessed various concepts within the domains of literacy and
         numeracy using multiple-choice questions with four answer choices. Within literacy, these concepts
         include: (1) semantics, assessed using seven items, with five items assessing respondents’ familiarity
         with vocabulary, one item testing understanding of a national idiom, and one item measuring
         comprehension of the meaning of a complex sentence; 37 (2) reading comprehension, assessed by asking
         respondents to read a 257-word non-technical narrative text and then answering five questions about
         the text; and (3) information comprehension, assessed using four items based on instructions for taking a
         medicine and reading a timetable describing inter-city bus schedules. Within numeracy, concepts
         include: (1) arithmetic, assessed using three questions about prices in an advertisement; and (2) graph
         comprehension, assessed using three questions based on a graph of Bulgaria’s population growth from
         1900 to 2011. The items assessing reading comprehension and semantics were taken from existing
         instruments fielded by the World Bank with Bulgarian students, while the items assessing
         mathematics and information comprehension were adapted from the Adult Literacy and Lifeskills
         Survey (Murray, Clermont, & Binkley, 2005).

These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover, executive
functioning skills and domain-specific skills are related: A number of recent studies provide evidence that

36 The ENHAB is a recent survey in Peru which gathers data on cognitive and socio-emotional test scores, individual’s
characteristics, educational trajectory, and wages.
37 An issue with translation of the items comprising the semantics scale rendered the data from this set of items

unusable. The semantics scale was thus not considered for analysis, leaving the total number of assessed skills at five.


                                                          54
executive functioning skills such as working memory actually contribute to the development of literacy and
numeracy skills (Blair & Razza, 2010; Swanson, Jerman, & Zheng. 2008). From a policy perspective, this
suggests that educators should focus on the promotion of both executive functioning and domain-specific
skills, particularly in the pre-school and elementary school years when such functions are most malleable to
intervention (Welsh et al., 2010).

Analysis Strategy

All missing values were recoded as incorrect answers, resulting in a set of 33 dichotomous or binary items. 38
In choosing how to score the items, we were motivated by a primary concern of reducing the measurement
error in each score. That is, when we administer a survey measure or test, we want to ensure that the
variability in scores is due to what we are trying to measure—in this study, executive functioning or domain-
specific skills—as opposed to error or bias. Traditional or unrefined methods of scoring—such as summing
the survey items—do not account for this measurement error, leading to bias in future regression analyses
(for more information, see Box C1, “What is Factor Analysis and Why do We Use It?” in Appendix C).
Refined scoring methods that account for measurement error include the production of factor scores using
factor analysis or item response theory (IRT) methods.

Box B1: What is Item Response Theory and When Can We Use It?

Item Response Theory (IRT) is an approach, or family of statistical models, used to analyze assessment item
data, such as cognitive skills assessment data. Several IRT models have been developed to estimate ability or
person parameters that are scored either dichotomously (i.e. only two response categories) or polytomously
(i.e. more than two response categories; Hambleton, Swaminathan, & Rogers, 1991). Traditionally, IRT has
been used for educational applications for Computerized Adaptive Testing (CAT), test score equating, item
analysis, and test banking. However, due to the advantages of IRT, other disciplines have recently developed
an interest in using IRT for scoring, validation, and other psychometric analyses (Reise & Henson, 2003).

There are two over-arching families of item response models which differ greatly in theoretical and
mathematical background and analysis. The first of the two families, the logistic models, relate examinee
ability (θ) and item parameters using logistic functions. The logistic family of IRT models allow for the
estimation of up to three item parameters, or characteristics. The one-parameter (1PL) model is the most
basic and involves, as the name states, only one item parameter: the b-parameter is included in every IRT
model and is considered the difficulty parameter (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006). The b-parameter is at the point on
the θ scale where the probability of a correct response is equal to 0.50 and typically varies from -2.00 to 2.00
(Hambleton et al., 1991; Yen & Fitzpatick, 2006), increasing as items become more difficult. The two-
parameter model (2PL) includes a second item parameter, the discrimination parameter, a. a is the slope of
the item characteristic curve (ICC) at the point of inflection and the higher the value of a, the more sharp the
discrimination (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006). Finally, the three-parameter model (3PL) includes the c-parameter,
called the guessing or pseudo-chance parameter. This parameter was introduced to account for the possibility


38 Ideally, we would be able to identify four, not two, sets of responses: answered correctly; answered incorrectly; not
answered and didn’t know; and not answered due to time constraints or motivation but known. While such codes were
initially included in the survey instrument, issues with data processing rendered such codes unusable. We were thus
forced to collapse the codes into a dichotomous response: correct or incorrect. The implications of this choice are
discussed further in the Implications and Future Directions section.


                                                          55
that even students with low ability have some chance of answering even difficult questions correctly. This
parameter is not always necessary, and if set to zero, equates the 3PL with the 2PL (Yen & Fitzpatrick, 2006).

One of the big advantages of using IRT is that the ability or person parameters (θ) are not item or test
dependent, and item and test characteristics are not dependent on the ability or person parameters. This is
called the property of invariance (Hambleton et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). It means that the test and item parameters
remain the same regardless of the sample of respondents, and the ability or person parameters do not vary
depending on the test items administered or the time of test, provided the items are relevant to and
representative of the same domain of interest.

Although there are clear benefits to the invariance property, there are two integral assumptions of IRT. First,
there is an assumption regarding the dimensionality of the underlying ability or trait. While there are multi-
dimensional IRT models (MIRT), the traditional IRT model requires that a single trait or ability accounts for
an individual’s θ score. When this assumption of the data holds, the examinees can be placed along a single,
meaningful scale (Hambleton et al., 1991). Second, there is the assumption of local item independence. When the
items on an assessment are locally independent, a response to any item is independent of a response to any
other item on the same assessment for a given individual. This assumption allows us to determine the
probability of an individual response pattern occurring given the individual’s ability or trait level (Hambleton
et al., 1991; Lord, 1980). If either of these assumptions is not met, item and person parameters will not be
properly estimated and thus, indefensible.

In addition to these assumptions, an assessment of model-data fit is also important in IRT. A poorly specified
model creates problems with estimating both item parameters and θ scores. Consider the following: An
analyst mistakenly specifies a model which only specifies two parameters when in fact the data fit a model
consisting of three item parameters. Because the pseudo-guessing parameter has not been specified, the θ
values may be over-estimated as the individual’s ability to correctly guess the answer has not been taken into
consideration. Guessing is not considered to be included in ability and, as such, it should not be allowed to
unduly influence scores. While IRT provides distinct advantages to classical methods of analyzing assessment
data, these advantages come with several very restrictive assumptions which, if violated, calls into question
the validity of the results.

In order to assess whether it was appropriate to employ an IRT model with this data, we decided to first
empirically determine the dimensionality of the items by conducting an exploratory factor analysis (EFA) with
an oblimax rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by country (N = 3,965). 39 Should a
one-factor model provide a good fit to the data, we would be able to proceed with IRT analyses. Should a
multi-factor model provide a good fit to the data, the dimensionality assumption required by IRT
methodologies would be violated. In that case, we proceed by examining the results of the EFA and
confirming the factor structure using the second half of the sample (N = 3,964). All analyses were conducted
in MPlus (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any clustering of the data due to
sampling design. 40 Responses were treated as ordered categorical data to account for the skewed nature of the
data.


39An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
40In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyzstan—up to two individuals per household were administered the non-
cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to individuals being nested
in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.


                                                          56
Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual scores on
each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor scoring is preferable in
this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account for: (1) the weight of individual
item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the factors and measurement error (DiStephano,
Zhu, & Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created using maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in MPLUS,
which accounts for the non-normal distribution of item response (Muthén & Muthén, 1998–2012).

Results
The initial EFA indicated that a one-factor model did not provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (324) = 8981.68,
CFI: .888, RMSEA: .082, .081 < 95% CI < .084). 41 Thus we decided that it was not feasible to proceed with
an IRT analysis due to the plausibility of violating the dimensionality assumption. In examining the factor
loadings, we noted that the 12 items making up the original construct of working memory loaded cleanly onto
one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the exploratory analyses. We then chose a 2-factor
solution to model associations between the remaining 15 items. This model provided a good fit to the data (χ2
(76) = 1261.15, CFI=.951, RMSEA=.063, .060 < 95% CI < .066) while modeling the observed indicators
parsimoniously.

A confirmatory factor analysis then confirmed the fit of a 3-factor model for all 27 items in which factors
were allowed to correlate (χ2 (321) = 3128.37, CFI=.981, RMSEA=.033, .032 < 95% CI < .034). 42 The three
identified factors described in Table 1, below, were: (1) Working Memory (12 items); (2) Reading
Comprehension (5 items); and (3) Informational Numeracy (10 items). In addition, preliminary measurement
equivalence analyses indicate that this same factor structure provides a good fit to the data in Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan, and Tajikistan (χ2 (97c3) = 10531.15, CFI=.953, RMSEA=.061, .060 < 95% CI < .062). 43
Finally, given the high correlation between the literacy and informational numeracy items, initial analyses were
also conducted to determine whether a higher-order “cognitive” factor may account for the covariation
between factors (Cattell, 1978). 44 This model was uninterpretable due to factor loadings above 1.




41 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit to the
data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the data while a
CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
42 Factor correlations in the CFA were: Working Memory-Literacy (r=.428, p<.001), Working Memory-Informational

Numeracy (r=.480, p<.001), and Literacy-Informational Numeracy (r=.69, p<.001).
43 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same way

across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that the same
factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the samples from all three
countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of which increases our certainty that
observed differences between countries is attributable only to true differences in the variability of the scores.
44 For over a century, researchers have been interested in defining and measuring an overall measure of cognitive ability,

or “g” factor (Jensen, 1998; Heckman, Stixrud, & Urzua, 2006). It is beyond the scope of this paper to comment
extensively on such research; however, as developmental psychologists with an interest in applying research to policy, we
take the position that it is useful to identify and understand the components of cognitive ability to better design programs
to support the development of such skills.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the cognitive skills module is best represented by three related
factors that correspond to some—but not all—of the five cognitive skills described above. For example, our
analyses indicated items 1–12 all indexed the hypothesized underlying executive functioning skill of Working
Memory, while items 13–17 corresponded to the hypothesized underlying domain-specific skill of Reading
Comprehension. Substantively, this indicates that individuals that have higher Working Memory factor scores
are better able to temporarily store and manipulate information that is necessary for domain-specific cognitive
tasks such as reading comprehension (Baddeley, 1992). Individuals with higher Reading Comprehension

                                                      58
scores have a better ability to read and process text and understand its meaning than individuals with lower
Reading Comprehension scores (National Reading Panel, 2000).

The other factor represented in the data is a combination of items meant to index facets of both Literacy
(items 18–21) and Numeracy (items 22–27). This pattern of relationships can be understood in that the
Information Comprehension items all involved number recognition (a component of numeracy), while the
Numeracy items all tapped the ability to locate and use information contained in various formats such as
advertisements and graphs (a component of information comprehension). Individuals who score highly on
Informational Numeracy have the ability to recognize and manipulate numbers contained in and represented
by various formats.

There are three things to consider when interpreting the above analysis. First, the factor scores created
through the factor analysis procedures described above are not invariant across different tests assessing
cognitive ability. While such scores could have resulted from using IRT methodologies, we have evidence that
using IRT with this cognitive assessment is not defensible given the likely violation of the assumption of
dimensionality and as a result, item dependence. As such, we proceeded with creating refined factor scores
that—although they do not inherently have the property of invariance—reduce the amount of measurement
error contained in the scores. It should be noted, however, that invariance is a property that can be assessed
through the use of factor analytic methods. Second, many of the items included in the cognitive skills
assessment are not “clean” items. That is, they assess more than one skill at the same time: Items meant to
tap the construct of Arithmetic, for example, also involve elements of reading comprehension and
information comprehension. The factors—particularly Reading Comprehension and Information
Numeracy—are thus highly correlated, which may be problematic for establishing predictive validity. To
address this, we recommend that future analyses with this data consider a bi-factor analysis in which
orthogonal or non-correlated grouping factors are created by allowing a “general” trait to correlate with the
items (Reise, Moore, & Haviland, 2010). Finally, as noted in footnote 2, we were limited in our ability to
discriminate between correct, incorrect, and missing answers due to issues in data processing. Given that
missing answers were all recoded to be incorrect, it is likely that the scores underestimate the cognitive ability
level present in the sample population. To address this, we recommend that future data collection activities
carefully assess the type and extent of missing data to allow for better sensitivity tests of results to such
specifications.

Background and Measures

Data for this study come from a 33-item survey module designed for use by the World Bank to assess 11
different “non-cognitive” skills (see Table 1, below; Duckworth & Guerra, 2012). These non-cognitive skills
can be conceptualized as falling into two domains:

Personality traits, defined as enduring patterns of thinking, feeling, and behaving which are relatively stable
across time and situations (Borghans, Duckworth, Heckman, & ter Weel, 2008; Paunonen, 2003). The “Big
Five” factors of personality—openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism (or
emotional stability)—are the most widely accepted taxonomy of broad personality traits (Goldberg, 1990),
having been validated for use across developmental stages (John & Srivastava, 1999) and cultures (Soto, John,
Gosling, & Potter, 2008). The survey assessed each of these five factors with three items in the short Big Five
Inventory (BFI-S) originally developed by John and Srivastava (1999) and later validated in large-scale panel
surveys (Lang et al., 2011). Given its association with important labor market outcomes, assessed grit—a
component of conscientiousness—was also assessed, with three items from the Grit Scale (Duckworth et al.,
2007).

Socio-emotional skills, defined as the learned knowledge, attitudes and skills necessary to understand and manage
emotions, set and achieve positive goals, establish and maintain positive relationships, and make responsible
decisions (CASEL, 2014). Although different cultures may differentially name, conceptualize, and prioritize
such skills, socio-emotional skills and learning are of critical importance across all regions of the world
(Torrente, Alimchandani, & Aber, in press). There does not currently exist an organization of socio-
emotional skills similar to that developed for personality traits; as such this survey measures socio-emotional
skills that are both valued by employers in countries in Europe and Central Asia (World Bank, 2009, 2013)
and amenable to intervention efforts (Yeager & Dweck, 2012). These skills include: hostile bias (2 items;
Dodge, 2003), decision making (4 items; Mann, Burnett, Radford, & Ford, 1997), achievement-striving, and
self-control (3 items and 2 items, respectively; Goldberg et al., 2006). In addition, the fixed vs. growth
mindset, or the belief that intelligence is fixed versus malleable, was measured (4 items; Yeager & Dweck,
2012).

These domains are not meant to be exhaustive, but to serve as useful heuristics. Moreover, personality traits
and socio-emotional skills are related: individuals with certain personality traits may tend to employ certain
socio-emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). For program and policy purposes, however, there is a key distinction
between personality traits and socio-emotional skills: while personality traits are predictive of labor market
outcomes, they are less amenable to direct change via intervention. Socio-emotional skills, however, have
been shown to be malleable to various intervention efforts across cultures (e.g., Jones, Brown, Aber, 2011;
Torrente et al., 2014). In turn, building socio-emotional skills can result in changes to enduring patterns of
thinking and behaving (Dweck, 2008).

Analysis Strategy

Our initial analyses revealed three main issues with the data. First, correlations between items in the same
groupings (e.g., openness, grit) were low—generally ranging from .2 - .4—suggesting that each item is
measuring a different facet of the grouping. Second, sum-scoring items according to the 11 hypothesized
constructs and computing reliability coefficients indicated the scores were composed of a significant degree
of measurement error. Third, the distribution of item responses across the Likert scales deviated substantially
from normality, invalidating the assumptions inherent in traditional statistical measurement techniques. To
address these issues, factor analyses were conducted in a multi-step process.

Box C1: What is Factor Analysis and Why Do We Use it?

Factor analysis is a statistical technique that can be used to examine the relationship between observed items
or indicators (see Table 1, above) and unobserved latent constructs or factors that are hypothesized to underlie
the associations between indicators (in this study, openness, conscientiousness, etc.). There are three primary
goals of or reasons to use factor analysis: (1) data reduction; (2) scale structure; and (3) to reduce
measurement error. First, survey instruments provide a lot of data—some surveys to assess adult personality
factors include over 500 items. Not only is it not practical to analyze that much data, but testing effects on
multiple discrete indicators increases the likelihood of having a “false positive,” or Type I error. Factor
analysis assists with data reduction by establishing a lesser number of factors that account for the variation
between indicators. Second, surveys are frequently designed to capture multiple constructs (in our study,
various personality traits and socio-emotional skills) using items that may relate more strongly to some
constructs than others. For example, in our study, the item “Do you think about how the things you do will
affect your future?” may be a better indicator of Decision Making than, “Do you ask for help when you don't
understand something?” Factor analysis allows us to understand the internal scale structure by quantifying the
number of factors in the data and the extent to which items are related to each factor. Finally, when we
administer a survey measure or test, we want to ensure that the variability in scores is due to what we are
trying to measure—in this study, personality traits or socio-emotional skills—as opposed to error or bias.
Traditional or unrefined methods of scoring—such as summing the survey items—do not account for this
measurement error, leading to biases in regression analyses. Factor analysis allows us to adjust for measurement
error by fitting an underlying model accounting for both variation among observed items and random error
variance.


                                                      64
There are two primary types of factor analysis: exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor
analysis (CFA). While both EFA and CFA attempt to model the relationship between observed items using a
smaller set of latent constructs, they differ in the a priori restrictions that are placed on the model. EFA is a
data-driven technique that is primarily used when the factor structure (e.g, the appropriate number of
underlying factors and the relationships of the items to the factors) is unknown, whether because the survey
has never been administered before or is being administered in new contexts. In CFA, a researcher uses a
strong theoretical foundation to specify at the outset the number of hypothesized factors and the patterns of
how the items relate to the factors. This solution is then evaluated with respect to how well it fits the
observed data. EFA is used most frequently early in the process of scale development, while CFA is used
once the researcher has established the factor structure based on prior empirical and theoretical grounds.

Given that the non-cognitive skills module has never before been administered in the countries of interest in
this study, we decided to proceed by first conducting exploratory factor analyses (EFAs) with an oblimax
rotation on a randomly selected half of participants stratified by country (N = 3,885). 46 In doing so, we are
not making a priori assumptions about the factor structure of the module in these new contexts. Then, to
support the EFA results, the factor structure was confirmed (in a confirmatory factor analysis, or CFA) using
the second half of the sample (N = 3,887). All analyses were conducted in MPlus (Muthén and Muthén,
1998–2012; Version 6.12) and adjusted for any clustering of the data due to sampling design.47 Responses
were treated as ordered categorical data to account for the skewed nature of the data, and full information
maximum likelihood (FIML) estimation was employed to handle missing data. 48

Once we determined a factor structure that provided a good fit to the data, we created individual scores on
each of these factors using refined factor scoring techniques. As detailed above, factor scoring is preferable in
this case to traditional sum scoring methods given that factor scores account for: (1) the weight of individual
item loadings; and (2) shared variance between the items and the factors and measurement error (DiStephano,
Zhu, and Midrila, 2009). Factor scores were created based on the exploratory factor analysis solution using
maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation in MPLUS, which accounts for the non-normal distribution of item
response (Muthén and Muthén, 1998–2012).

Results

The initial EFA revealed two groupings of items: those that loaded well onto one factor, and those that did
not. The 4 items making up the original construct of “Fixed Versus Growth Mindset” loaded cleanly onto
one factor. This factor was left intact and removed from the exploratory analyses; it was subsequently
confirmed to provide a good fit to the data (χ2 (2) = 27.52, CFI: .996, RMSEA: .057, .039 < 95% CI




46 An oblimax rotation was chosen to account for the hypothesized correlation between factors.
47 In Tajikistan—but not in Uzbekistan or Kyrgyz Republic—up to two individuals per household were administered the
non-cognitive skills module. To account for any non-independence of the data that may occur due to individuals being
nested in households, we used the Type=Complex and Cluster=psuid commands in MPlus.
48 FIML utilizes all available data points, even for cases with missing item responses, by assessing during parameter

estimation missing data patterns as well as by using information from all available data points. While FIML does not
impute missing data, its use of information from all observed data is conceptually similar to missing data imputation,
where a missing value is computed conditioned on several other included variables (Muthén, Kaplan & Hollis, 1987). In
this sample, 120 cases did not have data on any of the items and were removed from the analysis.

< .077). 49 Also removed from analyses at this juncture were items that loaded below .2 on any construct and
items that were reverse coded due to factor-item correlations in unexpected directions. We then chose a 4-
factor solution to model associations between the remaining 18 items; in this solution, items were allowed to
cross-load on multiple factors and factors were allowed to correlate. 50 This model provided an excellent fit to
the data (χ2 (87) = 530.89, CFI=.985, RMSEA=.036, .033 < 95% CI < .039) while modeling the observed
indicators parsimoniously.

The four identified factors described in Table 2, below, were: (1) Openness to New Ideas and People (5
items; e.g., “Are you outgoing and sociable?”; “Are you interested in learning new things?”); (2) Workplace
Attitude and Behavior (5 items; e.g., “Do you enjoy working on things that take a very long time to
complete?”; “Are people mean/not nice to you?”); (3) Decision Making (5 items; e.g., “Do you think about
how the things you do will affect others?”; “Do you think carefully before making an important decision?”);
and (4) Achievement Striving (3 items; “Do you do more than is expected of you?”). As detailed above,
confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the fit of this model (χ2 (129) = 2336.52, CFI=.922,
RMSEA=.066, .064 < 95% CI < .069). In addition, preliminary measurement equivalence analyses indicate
that this same factor structure provides a good fit to the data in Uzbekistan, Kyrgyz Republic, and Tajikistan
(χ2 (459) = 69484.24, CFI=.932, RMSEA=.068, .066 < 95% CI < .070). 51

49 In assessing model goodness of fit, the following criteria are used: A RMSEA < .08 provides an acceptable fit to the
data, while an RMSEA < .05 provides a good fit to the data; a CFI > .9 provides an acceptable fit to the data while a
CFI > .95 provides a good fit to the data (Kline, 2011).
50 Factor correlations in the final EFA ranged from .1 to .65. The highest correlations were: Openness-Decision Making

(.535), Openness-Achievement Striving (.556), and Decision Making-Achievement Striving (.65).
51 Tests of measurement invariance seek to establish whether we are measuring the same construct in the same way

across different groups. As of this writing, our preliminary analyses have established configural invariance: that the same
factor structure (e.g., the same number of factors and the same pattern of loadings) exists in the samples from all three
countries. Future analyses will examine other levels of invariance, establishment of which increases our certainty that
observed differences between countries is attributable only to true differences in the variability of the scores.

Interpretation and Future Directions

Our analyses indicated that the data from the non-cognitive skills module is best represented by five factors
that correspond to some—but not all—of the 11 personality traits and socio-emotional skills described in
Table 1. For example, our analyses indicated that items 19-22 and 16-18 index the hypothesized underlying
socio-emotional skills Fixed Versus Growth Mindset and Achievement Striving, respectively. Substantively,
this indicates that individuals that have higher Achievement Striving factor scores tend to strive to go “above
and beyond” and to do more than is expected of them, while individuals who have higher Fixed Versus
Growth Scores tend to believe new skills can be learned.

The other three factors represented in the data are combinations of items meant to index both personality
traits and socio-emotional skills; this pattern of relationships can be understood in that certain personality
traits tend to be related to certain learned attitudes and skills. For example, our factor of Decision Making
consists of items originally thought to index both decision-making skills and the trait of grit. In this case,
individuals who think carefully and thoroughly about the repercussions of their decisions and behaviors (see
items 12–15) tend to follow through with their actions (see item 11)—perhaps anticipating the repercussions
of not following through. Our factor of Workplace Attitudes and Behaviors consists of items meant to index
both Grit and Hostile Bias. Individuals who work very hard when others take a break (see items 6–8) may
tend to feel that others take advantage of them or are mean (see items 9–10). Thus individuals who score
higher on this construct may be workers who work hard and are innovative but perceive interactions with
others as hostile; individuals who score lower on this construct tend to work less hard and on discrete
projects, without perceiving workplace interactions as negative. Finally, our construct of Openness to New
Ideas and People reflects items thought to index the personality traits of extraversion, agreeableness, and
openness. Individuals who score high on this construct are social and open to new ideas, people, and things
(see items 1–5).

There are two plausible reasons why the data did not reflect the expected 11 traits and skills. First, only 2–4
items were used to originally index each trait/skill; this may not have been enough to validly and reliably fully
“capture” the constructs of interest. Instead, these items appear to reflect weak to moderately related aspects


                                                       67
of a trait/skill that co-vary with aspects of other traits/skills. This is unsurprising given demonstrated
correlations between: (a) Big Five personality traits (Digman, 1997); and (b) personality traits and socio-
emotional skills (McAdams, 1995). To address this issue, future surveys should consider including a broader
range of items to represent each trait/skill. A second explanation that we cautiously proffer is that the items
do not relate to each other in the same way in Tajikistan, Uzbekistan, and Kyrgyz Republic as in the samples
from which the items were developed. For example, in the Grit scale in this sample, “finishing what was
begun” is not related to “enjoying working on things that take a long time to complete.” In ECA contexts,
grit might not be well indexed by such behaviors. To investigate this, future research should: (1) conduct
qualitative research to better understand how these traits and skills are understood in ECA contexts; and (2)
test for measurement invariance between the non-cognitive items administered in this study and in other
studies.
