Who Is Responsible for
Producing the Seismic
Preparedness Maps?

In Japan, a local (prefectural or municipal)
government usually develops the Seismic
Preparedness Map with support from seismic
experts and consultants. Specific information
needs of local residents should be reflected
in the Seismic Preparedness Maps through
consultation. Examples of consultations are
discussed under Step 6.

Is Included in Seismic

Preparedness Maps?

Many of the Japanese Seismic Preparedness
Maps follow a format and contain the following
types of information at a minimum:


• The intensity of the earthquake ground-
      shaking hazard under a scenario
• Estimates of the number of casualties and
      damaged or destroyed buildings
• Information on the location and capacity of
      evacuation centers
• Designated emergency evacuation routes
      and information on traffic restrictions during
      emergencies;3 information on the function of
      key public facilities during emergencies




3   In Japan, some key roads are reserved and passable only by
emergency vehicles during emergencies.

      If the tsunami simulation analysis results suggest that there is not enough time for residents to evacuate to safer ground
      inland, building new vertical evacuation towers on the coast may be an option. Local planners must consider the capacity
      needed and suitable locations to build these towers (Figure 21).

     household in Tokyo. The handbook is a risk communication tool that contains practical guidance to reduce the potential
     impacts from natural disasters in an easy-to-understand way using illustrations. The handbook contains images showing likely
     impacts households may encounter during earthquakes, prompting people to be prepared for these situations.
