ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
This Country Partnership Framework (CPF) is the result of a team effort that relied on knowledge, expe-
rience, and guidance from Government, civil society, private sector and development partners across
Myanmar and individuals across the World Bank Group. The World Bank Group would like to thank our
counterparts in the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Develop-
ment, and across the Government of Myanmar, for their country leadership, inputs and advice through-
out the CPF engagement. We would also like to thank all development partners and all stakeholders
participating in consultations for their valuable comments and suggestions.

The CPF was led by Nikolas Myint (IDA), Catherine Martin and Vikram Kumar (IFC) and Paul Barbour
(MIGA), under the guidance of Abdoulaye Seck and Ulrich Zachau. The CPF core team included Corey
Pattison, Keta Ruiz, Ana Maria Torres and Asbjorn Wee.

Inputs to the CPF came from extensive consultations across Myanmar and in locations in Thailand and
the US organized by Paul Donowitz, Meriem Gray, Sai Yarzar Htun, Shona Kirkwood and Kyaw Soe Lynn.
The team is grateful to participants at these consultations for the time they took to share their views
and insights. In addition, the CPF builds on the strong analytical foundations laid by the Myanmar Sys-
tematic Country Diagnostics, led by Khwima Nthara. Finally, the preparation of the CPF benefitted from
a productive launch workshop in November 2013 organized by Edith Bowles and facilitated by Laura
Bailey, and from the early leadership of its development by Kanthan Shankar. The team’s work would
not have been possible without the administrative support of Thida Aung, Aye Me Me Htun and Maung
Maung Win.

The team also wishes to thank the following people for their contributions: Reena Badiani-Magnusson,
Robert Boothe, Greg Browder, Helle Buchhave, Rome Chavapricha, Constantine Chikosi, Christophe
Crepin, Ruxandra Maria Floroiu, Julia Fraser, Anthony Gaeta, Xuemei Guo, Min Ye Paing Hein, Reidar
Kvam, Morten Larsen, Charles Lor, Mark Miller, Shabih Mohib, Elizabeth Moorsmith, Sheila Musiime,
Tenzin Dolma Norbhu, Dejan Ostojic, Hnin Hnin Pyne, Habib Rab, Sjamsu Rahardja, Rawong Rojvanit,
Claudia Sadoff, Charles Schneider, Lou Scura, Lars Sondergaard, Robert Taliercio, Pamornrat Tansan-
guanwong, Mathew Verghis, Xiaoping Wang, Wendy Werner, Ingo Wiederhofer, Andrea Woodhouse,
May Thet Zin, and Sergiy Zorya.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Context: Supporting a Historic Transition

1. The proposed Country Partnership Framework (CPF) will succeed the Myanmar Interim Strategy Note
(FY13-14) and be the first full country strategy for Myanmar since 1984. This CPF comes at a time of great
opportunity for Myanmar; over the three year period covered in this CPF, the reforms initiated in 2011
have the potential to bring Myanmar into a new era of peace and prosperity.

2. Myanmar’s history, ethnic diversity, and geography combine into a unique set of development chal-
lenges and opportunities, including (i) emergence from a long period of international isolation; (ii)
widespread poverty, despite rich land, water, and mineral resource endowments; (iii) a strategic location
in the fastest-growing region in the world; (iv) the role of the military and associated groups in the econ-
omy; and (v) long standing armed conflict and ethnic and religious tensions. Myanmar is on a path of
fundamental transformation, seeking to address all these challenges and opportunities simultaneously.

3. Despite its potential, Myanmar today is one of the least developed countries in Southeast Asia, with
a legacy of conflict, isolation, and ineffective policies. With a population of 51.4 million, the country
has a per capita GDP of US$1,105. The poverty rate in 2010 was estimated at between 25.6 and 37.5
percent, with the lower rate reflecting the Government’s methodology—which showed a 20 percent
decline since 2005—and the higher rate reflecting a more broad based methodology used by the World
Bank.1 Poverty in Myanmar is largely a rural phenomenon, with at least 70 percent of the country’s poor
living in rural areas. Through this CPF the World Bank Group (WBG) will scale up its engagement with
Myanmar to support two critical transformations underway: towards openness and integration, and
empowerment and inclusion. Together, these two socioeconomic shifts offer a historic opportunity and
hold the key to reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in Myanmar.

4. Beginning in 2011, Myanmar launched major political and economic reforms aimed at increasing
openness, empowerment, and inclusion. The past years have seen a dramatic increase of political and
civil liberties and a significant reduction in armed conflict, although conflict continues in Kachin and
northern Shan States. At the same time, new tensions and challenges have emerged, including out-
breaks of unrest affecting the country’s Muslim minorities and particularly those who identify them-
selves as Rohingya in Rakhine State. Parliamentary elections are scheduled for late 2015, and the com-
ing years offer opportunities to deepen reforms further.

5. Myanmar has also begun removing constraints on commerce, trade, and private enterprise that long
held back the economy. Economic reforms have included the unification of the exchange rate, removal
of a host of import and export restrictions, new legislation that provides greater autonomy for the cen-
tral bank, and increased transparency including publication of the Government budget. Overall mac-
roeconomic performance has strengthened, with growth at 8.3 percent in 2013 and estimated around

  The share of the population considered to be poor includes those who are unable to meet their basic needs. The poverty rate
reflects the definition of basic needs used, and there are multiple ways of defining an acceptable standard of living. In 2011, a
group of international technical experts and advisors, working closely with the Government of Myanmar and international or-
ganizations, estimated absolute poverty in Myanmar to have stood at 25.6 percent in 2009/10. In 2014, the World Bank estimated
the poverty rate in 2010 at 37.5 percent. This higher estimate is based on a broader welfare aggregate that includes spending on
health care and the use value of assets, and on alternative assumptions on adult equivalence scales and spatial price deflators.
No trend data are available for this methodology. A nationwide household survey is being conducted to update both of these
poverty estimates, working in collaboration with the Government.

              8.5 percent in 2014 (up from an average of 5.1 percent between 2005 and 2010), inflation down to 5.7
              percent in 2013/14 (from 22 percent in 2008/09), and external debt down to 19.2 percent of GDP in
              2013/14 (from 37.7 percent in 2008/09). However, major obstacles remain, including an underdevel-
              oped financial sector, infrastructure gaps and limited capacities to manage shocks.

              Proposed WBG Program: Pathways for Poverty Reduction

              6. The CPF outlines how WBG global knowledge, financing, and convening services can support My-
              anmar and its people in transforming their country, reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared
              prosperity.

              7. This CPF draws on the findings of the recent Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD) carried out by the
              WBG, lessons learned since the WBG re-engagement in Myanmar in 2012, and extensive consultations
              with a wide range of stakeholders conducted in 2014.

              8. With Myanmar’s poverty rate estimated to have been between 25.6 and 37.5 percent in 2010, the
              group of poor overlaps significantly with the bottom 40 percent of the consumption distribution. The
              SCD identified two main pathways out of extreme poverty. The first is promoting sustainable private
              sector-led growth for more jobs. The second entails promoting universal access and empowerment for
              inclusive growth, particularly in rural areas.

              9. Starting from the development priorities identified in the SCD, the CPF uses three selectivity criteria
              to identify a CPF program of activities for WBG engagement. The three selectivity criteria are: compara-
              tive advantage; impact on achieving the twin goals of absolute poverty reduction and shared prosper-
              ity; and the risk-reward ratio. The resulting CPF program for the WBG is focused in three areas: reduc-
              ing rural poverty; investing in people and effective institutions for people; and supporting a dynamic
              private sector to create jobs. Activities in these focus areas will integrate four cross-cutting issues that
              are important for the achievement of the WBG twin goals: gender, conflict, governance and climate
              change/disaster risk.

              •	   Reducing rural poverty. At least 70 percent of Myanmar’s poor live in rural areas, reducing pov-
                   erty and boosting shared prosperity will entail increasing access to essential services, economic
                   opportunities and markets. The WBG expects to provide support to help increase agricultural in-
                   comes and productivity, rural electrification, community-driven investments in local infrastructure
                   and services, improve Ayeyarwaddy River navigation and flood control, and reduce vulnerability to
                   shocks.

              •	   Investing in people and effective institutions for people. Successful empowerment and inclusion
                   will depend on citizens who are able to make a better future for themselves and on transparent
                   institutions that allow people to do so. The WBG expects to provide targeted support to help My-
                   anmar approach universal access to and improve the quality of essential social services, especially
                   health and education and, over time, skills development to empower people to participate in a
                   growing economy. The WBG also expects to provide support for state institutions to deliver ser-
                   vices effectively, including at the local level. This support is expected to contribute to improved
                   governance in selected sectors as well as more broadly for the citizens of Myanmar.

•	   Supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs. Reducing poverty and boosting shared pros-
     perity will entail diversification beyond extractive-based industries to inclusive growth that creates
     jobs. Increased openness and integration will result in higher growth as labor reallocates to more
     productive sectors and trade drives innovation and productivity. The WBG will seek to foster inclu-
     sive growth and a vibrant private sector that will create jobs through investments and support for
     markets, trade and modern financial institutions.

Implementation: Resources and Partnerships, Risks and Opportunities

10. This CPF covers a period of three years, coinciding with the IDA 17 period. It will include a per-
formance and learning review, planned for late FY16, to allow for mid-course adjustments based on
changes in country context, a review of lessons learned, and the availability of new data (including
a nationally representative household survey). Should the performance and learning review indicate
continuity in Myanmar’s development priorities outlined in the CPF, the WBG may at that time decide
to extend the CPF.

11. Myanmar’s provisional IDA 17 allocation is US$1.6 billion. The CPF identifies an indicative program
based on this amount, with frontloading. In addition, IFC expects to provide up to US$1 billion in in-
vestments over the CPF period and US$20 million in technical assistance. MIGA will provide insurance
against political risks based on demand by private investors.

12. The Government has taken the lead in donor coordination, establishing a set of sector working
groups bringing together development partners in Myanmar. The World Bank Group has developed
the CPF within this framework to ensure alignment with Myanmar’s development priorities, the Gov-
ernment’s reform agenda, and support provided by development partners. As such, the CPF focuses
on areas where the WBG can add unique strengths (through knowledge or financing), seeks to create
platforms for joint engagements between Government and development partners, and to achieve tan-
gible impact on poverty and shared prosperity, including reducing rural poverty and increasing access
to services.

13. Along with unique opportunities, the CPF supported program will also face substantial risks. Po-
litical risks associated with the elections in late 2015 include a polarization among stakeholders, policy
discontinuity, and a slow-down of reforms. The national peace process to resolve decades-old conflicts
remains fragile. On the economic front, risks include vulnerability to volatile oil and gas prices, spending
pressures, an underdeveloped financial sector, and a weak regulatory framework, while overall capacity
constraints may limit the country’s ability to effectively manage macro-financial shocks. The design of
the WBG program will help manage and mitigate these risks, and the WBG will regularly review risks and
opportunities and adapt the CPF during implementation as warranted. A Performance and Learning Re-
view planned for late FY16 will facilitate the adaptation of the WBG program to country developments
as needed.

I. INTRODUCTION


14. The proposed Country Partnership Framework (CPF) will succeed the Myanmar Interim
Strategy Note (FY13-14) and will be the first full country partnership framework for Myanmar
since 19842. This CPF comes at a time of great opportunity for Myanmar: over the three-year period
covered in this CPF, the reforms begun in 2011 have the potential to bear fruit in bringing Myanmar into
a new era of peace, prosperity and stronger participation internally and on the international stage. This
CPF aims to outline how the full range of resources of the World Bank Group can help the country and its
people in this transition and in achieving sustainable poverty reduction and shared prosperity. In doing
so, the CPF draws on the findings of the recent Systematic Country Diagnostic carried out by the World
Bank Group, lessons learned from implementation since the beginning of WBG re-engagement in 2012,
and extensive consultations with a wide range of stakeholders conducted in 2014.

15. Myanmar’s history, ethnic diversity, and geography combine into a unique set of develop-
ment challenges and opportunities: (i) emergence from a long period of international isolation; (ii)
widespread poverty, despite rich land, water, and mineral resource endowments; (iii) a strategic location
in the fastest-growing region in the world, with prospects for rapid economic growth and “catch-up” im-
provements in the lives of people; (iv) the role of the military and associated groups in the economy, and
(v) long standing armed conflict and ethnic and religious tensions. Moreover, Myanmar is on a path of
fundamental transformation, seeking to address all these challenges and opportunities simultaneously.

16. Through this CPF the WBG will accelerate and scale up engagement with Myanmar to
support two critical transformations underway: towards openness and integration, and toward
empowerment and inclusion. Together, these two socio-economic shifts offer a historic opportunity
and hold the key to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in Myanmar.3 In an environment of
limited absorptive capacity and complex risks, selectivity is critical in shaping a rapidly growing WBG
program of support. Among many important priorities, the CPF aims to focus the WBG program on core
areas for reducing extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity.

17. Beginning in 2011, Myanmar launched fundamental political and economic reforms aimed at
increasing openness, empowerment, and inclusion. The past years have seen a dramatic increase of
political and civil liberties and a significant reduction in armed conflict. At the same time, new tensions
and challenges have emerged, including outbreaks of violence. Such tensions and unrest have affected
primarily the country’s Muslim minorities, particularly those who identify themselves as Rohingya in
Rakhine State, or have been related to ongoing armed conflict, including in Kachin State and northern
Shan State. Despite such setbacks, the coming years offer opportunities to further deepen the reforms,
including in the 2015 parliamentary elections.

 The term “triple transition” was used to describe the changes in Myanmar since a new administration took office in 2011: from a
military system to democratic governance; from a centrally-directed, closed economy to a market-oriented one; and from 60 years
of conflict to peace in the border areas. The SCD focuses on the “dual shift” toward opening and integration, and toward inclusion
and empowerment, to highlight the socio-economic changes associated with the triple transition.

    Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




           18. The success of Myanmar’s reforms will depend on the extent of progress with inclusion and
           integration, so all of Myanmar’s people benefit. The key challenge will be to ensure that the political,
           economic and peacemaking transformation gives voice to the whole population, benefits the coun-
           try’s most needy and vulnerable, and develops the non-state sector to support broad-based economic
           growth.

           19. In supporting Myanmar’s unique transformation, the World Bank Group will leverage the
           combined knowledge and financing resources of IDA, IFC and MIGA. In doing so, this CPF is ground-
           ed in a vision of development as supporting the dual transformation to openness and integration, and
           to empowerment and inclusion. In this vision, development builds knowledge and empowers people,
           in particular the poor, by increasing access to opportunities. The CPF sets out a planned program of
           activities to achieve these goals to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. It does so with a com-
           mitment to bring the best WBG global knowledge and adapt it to the Myanmar context, yet in humility
           at the scale of the transition underway.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT AND DEVELOPMENT
    AGENDA

20. Despite its potential, Myanmar is one of the least developed countries in Southeast Asia, a
legacy of conflict, isolation, and ineffective economic policies. In 2013/14, the country’s GDP was
US$56.8 billion. With a population of 51.4 million, the country had a per capita GDP of US$1,105 com-
pared to US$5,779 in Thailand and US$1,911 in Vietnam. The poverty rate in 2010 was estimated at
between 25.6 and 37.5 percent, with the lower rate reflecting the Government’s methodology—which
showed a 20 percent decline since 2005—and the higher rate reflecting a more broad based methodol-
ogy used by the World Bank.4 The Government’s estimated poverty headcount rate in 2010 represented
a reduction from 32 percent in 2005 (the higher end of the range reflects recalculated 2010 data not
available for 2005).


    2.1 Social and Political Context

21. The unfolding shift from state control and exclusion to empowerment and inclusion is
perhaps most evident in the political realm, where reforms have expanded political space in
Myanmar, at both the individual and institutional level. Following the National League of Democ-
racy’s (NLD) decision to participate in the 2012 parliamentary by-election, the NLD and other opposition
parties continued to open new offices, recruit members, and revive their internal structures following
decades of being prohibited from legal operations.

22. In parallel, the Government introduced media freedoms and transparency after decades of
censorship. Beginning in December 2012, the Government has issued licenses for 26 new daily news-
papers, along with over 200 weekly news journals. The Government also continued the practice of pub-
lishing the budget as well as parliamentary debates, the President instituted monthly radio addresses
to the nation, and state owned media began a transition to public service media, including more critical
reporting on Government policies and political, economic and social challenges in the country. While
there is opportunity for further progress in this realm (given recent instances of Government restrictions
of the press), the past years have seen a fundamental transformation of public information in Myanmar.

23. Increased freedoms and better access to information have facilitated greater citizen
engagement. Access to information has improved both due to increases in media freedoms and largely
unfettered access to social media sites as well as liberalization for example in the telecoms sector, with

 The share of the population considered to be poor includes those who are unable to meet their basic needs. The poverty rate
reflects the definition of basic needs used, and there are multiple ways of defining an acceptable standard of living. In 2011, a
group of international technical experts and advisors, working closely with the Government of Myanmar and international or-
ganizations, estimated absolute poverty in Myanmar to have stood at 25.6 percent in 2009/10. In 2014, the World Bank estimated
the poverty rate in 2010 at 37.5 percent. This higher estimate is based on a broader welfare aggregate that includes spending on
health care and the use value of assets, and on alternative assumptions on adult equivalence scales and spatial price deflators.
No trend data are available for this methodology. A nationwide household survey is being conducted to update both of these
poverty estimates, working in collaboration with the Government.

           prices of SIM cards falling from US$250 in 2012 to US$1.5 by 2015. The mix of increased availability of
           information and better means of communication has facilitated public action, including public protests
           over infrastructure projects, displacement from land, and proposed legislation. These debates have in
           turn influenced discussions in Parliament and Government decision-making. While incomplete, this ini-
           tial opening marks the beginning of new feedback loops between citizens and the country’s political
           institutions. This progress is ongoing and uneven, with continued reported shortcomings in the effec-
           tive functioning of an independent judiciary and the consistent application of the rule of law.5

           24. The Government is pursuing efforts to bring an end to the multiple conflicts in ethnic areas.
           Talks between Government and ethnic armed groups to bring about a national ceasefire ahead of a
           political dialogue are continuing, with the Government signaling a willingness to consider decentraliza-
           tion and devolution to accommodate some of the long-standing grievances voiced by ethnic armed
           groups. Following the signing or renewal of a series of ceasefires, the Government and ethnic armed
           groups made progress in their peace talks through a number of leadership meetings starting in late
           2013. A number of ethnic armed groups joined the Government in signing a February 2015 “Deed of
           Commitment” which reiterated the commitment of the signing parties to find a political solution to the
           conflict, and in late March 2015 representatives of Government and ethnic armed groups appeared to
           have reached tentative agreement on a national ceasefire agreement that would pave the way for po-
           litical dialogue. However, the intensification of the conflict with the Kachin Independence Organization
           (KIO) in 2014, with armed clashes in both Kachin and parts of northern Shan State that displaced over
           5,000 people, as well as renewed conflict in the Kokang region of Shan State in early 2015 underlined
           the continued fragility of the peace process and the importance of a successful resolution to establish
           peace and security across the country.6

           25. While peacemaking in the Myanmar context has long been focused on the armed conflicts
           with ethnic minority groups, the recent opening of political space has brought to the fore other
           potential fault lines and areas of conflict. This most notably includes recurrent incidents of com-
           munal violence over the past two years, where finding sustainable solutions is important not only to
           address violent conflict and citizen security, but also to address broader issues of social inclusion.

           26. Establishing peace and security across the country will involve finding a sustainable
           solution to address the exclusion of the Muslim minority that identifies itself as Rohingya in
           Rakhine State. The Government considers members of this Muslim minority to be illegal migrants
           from neighboring Bangladesh and does not recognize them as an ethnic group. Following outbreaks
           of violence directed against this minority in the summer of 2012 that killed 89 people and displaced
           over 110,000, the Government established temporary camps where most of the displaced continue
           to live today.7 Subsequent violence took place against Muslim minorities in Rakhine in 2013 and 2014,
           which spilled over into broader anti-Muslim violence in other parts of Myanmar in 2013 and evolved
           into widespread protests against international aid workers in Rakhine in 2014, demonstrating that the
           issue remains far from resolved.8

27. While members of various Muslim minorities were affected by the violence and unrest in
Rakhine State and elsewhere, those who identify themselves as Rohingya additionally face the
particular challenge of lacking citizenship. Finding a way forward on this issue presents a major chal-
lenge for Myanmar, and at the same time an opportunity to help define a broader national identity
that is more inclusive of other minorities in Myanmar, including minorities identified through ethnicity,
religion or sexual orientation, all of which have suffered varying degrees of discrimination.

28. Myanmar’s fundamental reforms and ongoing historic transformations are complex processes.
Key events over the coming years will test cohesiveness of support for the transformation and its dura-
bility. The national parliamentary elections in 2015 present a watershed moment for Myanmar’s reform
efforts. Yet they also present risks, both in the potential for tensions in the run up to the elections, and a
politicization of sensitive issues, and in testing the fragile political compromises that have held over the
past three years. One unresolved question is the eligibility of the leader of the opposition for high office.


 2.2 Economic Context

29. Since the beginning of Myanmar’s transition in 2011, significant progress has been made in
removing obstacles that long held back the economy. Key reforms include:
  •	 the unification of exchange rates and liberalization of the foreign exchange market;
  •	 removal of various restrictions on imports and exports;
  •	 promulgation of new economic laws, including a Foreign Investment Law that offers improved
      incentives to foreign direct investment;
  •	 a new Central Bank Law that provides for greater autonomy of the Central Bank;
  •	 greater transparency in public financial management, including publication of the budget and
      adoption of an “open tender” system for public procurement;
  •	 improvements in public financial management, including moves towards fiscal decentralization;
  •	 increased budgetary allocations to health and education, as well as the introduction of new pov-
      erty reduction funds;
  •	 opening of the banking sector to foreign banks;
  •	 licensing for two new telecom operators to drive down communication costs, in a process lauded
      for its transparency; and
  •	 successful implementation of an IMF supported Staff Monitored Program, and publication of
      World Bank and IMF mission reports.9

30. In part as a result of these reforms, the economy has started to bounce back, with the
estimated growth rate increasing from 5.3 percent in 2010/11 to 7.3 percent in 2012/13. Growth
in 2013/14 is estimated to have risen further to 8.3 percent, driven by a construction-related boom, con-
tinued rebound in manufacturing output, and the resulting expansion in the services sector. Myanmar’s
gas sector has also been a key source of revenues and growth, with natural gas exports accounting for
around 7.4 percent of GDP in FY2013/14. Inflation has stabilized but remains moderately high, with
inflationary pressures starting to rise in the second half of 2014 (6.1 percent y-o-y in November) due to
the depreciation of the Kyat, increases in food prices and utility price hikes.

    Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




           31. The removal of trade and foreign exchange restrictions, coupled with rapidly rising domestic
           demand, have contributed to widening trade and current account deficits. Imports nearly doubled
           from an estimated US$8.1 billion in 2010/11 to US$14.9 billion in 2013/14. Exports grew by 50 percent
           over the same period from US$8.8 billion to US$12.2 billion, a third of which was exports of natural gas.
           The current account deficit in 2013/14 reached around 5.1 percent of GDP, up from an estimated 4.3 per-
           cent in 2012/13. Capital account inflows, especially foreign direct investment (FDI) and one-off license
           fees paid by telecom operators, have been sufficient to finance the growing current account deficit.
           FDI inflows have been fluctuating in recent years at around 4 to 5 per cent of GDP. The growing current
           account deficit has put downward pressure on the Kyat, which depreciated in the second half of 2014.
           Foreign exchange reserves have fallen to under three months of import cover, which is below prudential
           levels and exposes the country to external vulnerabilities.

           32. The government went through a period of fiscal consolidation between 2010/11 and 2013/14,
           but has more recently adopted an expansionary fiscal policy. The consolidated public sector deficit
           fell from 5.4 percent of GDP in 2010/11 to 1.6 percent in 2013/14. This was largely due to a sharp increase
           in revenue from one-off receipts (e.g. telecom licenses) amounting to roughly two percent of GDP and
           exchange rate liberalization, which led to a more accurate accounting of Kyat denominated receipts
           from gas exports. The draft 2015/16 budget, however, included measures added by Parliament that
           envisage a doubling of the public sector wage bill, reaching around 3.5 percent of GDP. The government
           has taken steps to cut back on capital and goods and services spending, reduced tax exemptions, and
           reduced subsidies to SEEs. Nonetheless, with elections scheduled for November 2015, there are likely to
           be continued pressures on the fiscal stance. Such pressures, together with the proposed increase in the
           wage bill, could contribute to a widening of the fiscal deficit to just over six percent of GDP. Such rapid
           expenditure growth poses risks to fiscal sustainability.

           33. The government has in the last two years targeted increased spending on the social sectors.
           Although still low by international standards, spending on health increased from 0.2 percent of GDP in
           2012 to 1.5 percent in 2013; similarly in education it went up from 0.8 percent to 1.7 percent over the
           same period. The shares of recurrent expenditures in the health and education sectors in total expendi-
           ture have plateaued in the 2014/15 budget. Compared to 2013/14, the approved budget for 2014/15
           shows only a slight increase in the recurrent allocation to education, both as a share of GDP and a share
           of total expenditures – 1.4 percent and 8.4 percent, respectively. For the health sector, the shares have
           remained flat compared to 2013/14 – 0.6 percent of GDP and 3.7 percent of total expenditure. The gov-
           ernment is also pursuing efforts to delegate more fiscal responsibilities to States and Regions in accord-
           ance with the Constitution.

           34. Growth is expected to remain relatively strong over the medium-term. Assuming continued
           growth in gas sector, and expansion of services from the gradual liberalization of the telecom and bank-
           ing sectors, Myanmar could continue growing at around eight percent, like other countries that have
           successfully transitioned to market economies. Maintaining a competitive exchange rate will be impor-
           tant. Continued progress in developing institutional capacity for exchange rate management with sup-
           port from the IMF will be important. Moving toward exchange rate flexibility can help ease pressures on
           the trade balance and reserves. The impact of increased competitiveness and regional integration will
           depend in part on regional and global growth, with the recent economic slowdown, including in China’s
           growth rate, potentially affecting important markets.

                                                                  Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   9


35. However, there are downside risks to sustaining high growth. Continued government spending
growth along current trends may raise fiscal sustainability challenges. Although external public debt is
still within sustainability thresholds, as noted in the last joint Fund-Bank Debt Sustainability Analysis,
overall public debt sustainability is vulnerable to lower real GDP growth and fiscal slippages. This risk
is heightened by recent international commodity price developments. Although the effects of these
have not yet transmitted through to Myanmar, there is a major risk that natural gas prices on Myanmar
exports follow the same trend as oil prices. A sustained downturn in gas prices would adversely impact
government revenues and export earnings, and may negatively affect future investments in the oil and
gas sectors, and thereby economic growth. Having said this, preliminary indications, based on industry
feedback, are that production is likely to increase faster than currently anticipated from fields that have
come on stream recently and production sharing contracts entered into in the past year. This increased
production could mitigate possible falls in natural gas prices.

36. Agriculture is critical for both inclusive growth and poverty reduction. At least 70 percent of
the poor live in rural areas, and agriculture generates over half of employment and 37 percent of GDP.
Yet labor productivity in agriculture is the lowest among all sectors, due in part to the low use of mecha-
nized services and modern inputs. Rice is the main agricultural product covering about 60 percent of
total cultivated areas, and its yield gap with neighboring countries is large. Closing the yield gap is
handicapped by weak irrigation services and overall ineffective agricultural public expenditures, as well
as low usage of fertilizer (with an average of only 60kg/Ha, compared to 300 kg/Ha in Thailand and 690
kg/Ha in Vietnam). The majority of rice mills in Myanmar employ antiquated technology, with less than
one-fourth of them being capable of producing medium-to-high quality rice. This situation limits the
market segments which Myanmar can supply abroad, leads to relatively low unit values for rice exports,
and results in low prices paid to farmers. Historical factors—including periodic or sustained bans on rice
exports and heavy state enterprise involvement in the trade—inhibited private investment in the sector
while policy uncertainties continue to deter some potential investors.

37. Recent steps towards economic openness can support a move towards inclusive growth. A
significant portion of industrial activity has been directly or indirectly controlled by the military Govern-
ment. Since the initial economic opening began in the early 1990s, this included the presence of a small
number of firms with close connections to the military that benefitted from business contracts and oth-
er economic opportunities. Since 2011, the Government has undertaken a number of measures to open
the economic space to a broader range of private sector actors and to reduce corruption, including the
formation in January 2013 of an Anti-Corruption Committee and the enactment of an Anti-Corruption
Law in July 2013. However, significant gaps remain, including in the consistent application of the rule of
law, and Myanmar continues to rank low on the Corruption Perceptions Index, at 156 out of 174 in 2014
(although its rank has improved from 172 out of 174 in 2012). Similarly, in the 2014 Investment Climate
Assessment conducted by the WBG, the proportion of firms reporting the giving of informal gifts or
making payments one of the highest in the region.

38. Going forward, sustainable management of its natural resources will be critical for
Myanmar’s future economic development. This includes the transparent use of revenues from natu-
ral resources and environmentally sustainable practices, including reducing impacts on land degrada-
tion from mining, forestry, and oil and gas extraction. Myanmar’s abundant natural resources account
for the majority of export earnings, mostly from sales of gas. Total reported exports from extractive
industries – till 2014 mostly from natural gas and gemstones – amount to around US$10 billion. Myan-

            mar is the world’s largest producer of jade and extracts significant quantities of other gems and miner-
            als. Improved governance, particularly addressing under-reporting, undeclared exports, and ineffec-
            tive taxation, particularly in the jade and gemstone sectors, could generate significant revenues for
            the state.10 Lack of transparency not only deprives Myanmar of revenues and further constrains public
            sector management capacity, but threatens the longer term prospects of these sectors.11 The Govern-
            ment of Myanmar has demonstrated interest in addressing these issues through, for example, passage
            of an environmental conservation law and accession to the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative.
            Developing the economy will need to take account of sustainable environmental management prac-
            tices and strengthening governance of the natural resources which drive the country’s economy and
            on which the livelihoods of Myanmar people depend. This includes measures to smooth government
            expenditure over commodity price cycles, which are key to help ensure fiscal sustainability and reduce
            the risks of Dutch Disease discussed above.

            39. Higher productivity and job growth, including in manufacturing, can drive poverty reduction
            and shared prosperity. While growth has accelerated since the transition began, the economy remains
            centered on extractive industries (which has a more limited impact on job creation) and agriculture,
            with the latter accounting for 37 percent of GDP, the highest among the countries in the region. In
            contrast, the contribution of more labor-intensive sectors such as manufacturing and services has been
            low. However, analyses suggest that by 2030 Myanmar’s manufacturing sector has the potential to be-
            come the economy’s largest, overtaking agriculture, energy and mining, and creating large numbers of
            jobs.12 Promoting this shift will require addressing hurdles facing the private sector: the Doing Business
            report in 2015 ranked Myanmar 177 out of 189 countries.13 Specific challenges include poor physical
            infrastructure, corruption, outdated regulation, limited access to inputs, including finance, land and a
            shortage of skilled labor.

            40. Among the obstacles facing the private sector, access to finance is a critical constraint for
            micro, small and medium enterprises. The Government has encouraged a modernization of the fi-
            nancial sector, with significant progress in the past three years. This includes the licensing of more than
            200 micro-finance institutions; a rapid growth in bank deposits (from 2012 to 2013 the share of deposits
            to GDP doubled); rapid growth in bank lending (increasing to 12 percent of GDP in 2013, up from three
            percent in 2006); and exponential growth in the number of bank branches, ATMs and other financial
            infrastructure. In addition, the Government has granted licenses to nine foreign banks in early October
            2014. Despite this significant progress, the needs in the financial sector to support a vibrant and diverse
            private sector remain significant: Myanmar remains an economy in which less than half of SMEs have a
            banking account – lower than in any comparator country.

            41. Both policy reform and foreign direct investment (FDI) can play an important role in
            supporting inclusive growth. In this context, a recent shift in foreign direct investment from extrac-
            tives to the manufacturing and services sector signals the potential for FDI to support economic trans-
            formation in Myanmar. In 2013, 45 percent of newly approved FDI in Myanmar was in the manufactur-
            ing sector, up from 28 percent in 2012. At the same time, new FDI in natural resource extraction fell to

2 percent, down from 49 percent in 2012.14 Going forward, attracting and deploying investment in light
manufacturing and other sectors with significant employment generation potential can play an impor-
tant role in supporting inclusive growth in Myanmar. In this context, tourism can play an important role:
in 2014, over three million tourists visited Myanmar, up from approximately two million visitors in 2013
and around 800,000 in 2011, with tourism-related income increasing to US$3 billion in 2014, up from
under US$1 billion in 2013.

42. Regional integration, including in the context of ASEAN, can also promote inclusive growth.
Following 50 years of isolation, Myanmar faces very limited integration into regional and global mar-
kets. As such, the establishment of the ASEAN Economic Community in 2015 could be a major driver
of growth for Myanmar. Beyond the region, economic sanctions have started to be dismantled with
key western markets, opening up additional opportunities. The US suspended most sanctions in May
2012 with imports of most goods from Myanmar now authorized and restrictions on banks eased. In
May 2013, the US signed a Trade and Investment Framework Agreement aimed at boosting trade, and
recently announced its intention to grant Myanmar access to the preferential tariff system of the “Gener-
alized System of Preferences” (GSP). In addition, the EU lifted its sanctions in April 2013 and in July 2013
admitted Myanmar to its Everything But Arms (EBA) scheme, granting zero duties to all goods (besides
arms and ammunition) originating from the country. These market access openings present important
opportunities for Myanmar to diversify its exports and integrate into global value chains.


     2.3 Governance Profile

43. Governance is a key cross-cutting development challenge for Myanmar. Previous governments
emphasized stability and economic self-reliance and favored the centralization of authority in a small
elite group backed by the military at the expense of building an accountable, transparent and effective
public sector. This legacy can be seen in widespread distortions in both the public and private sectors,
and in severely limited mechanisms to design, implement and monitor socio-economic development
policies. Despite recent work by the Government, the WBG, development partners, and civil society or-
ganizations, major gaps remain in the understanding of Myanmar’s governance challenges. Good cor-
porate governance is also key to helping private sector companies gain investor confidence, improve
access to capital, and become more sustainable. Yet the current level of governance standards in most
firms in Myanmar remains very low. The existing regulatory regime includes only very basic provisions
for corporate governance in companies and banks, coupled with low levels of enforcement for those
requirements that do exist. In addition, the Myanmar private sector includes a number of state-owned
companies, with nascent governance structures, outdated management processes, and low levels of
transparency. Finally, audits often include only perfunctory attestations of company financial reports.

44. The current Government has expressed its strong commitment to creating a more effective
and transparent state. From the start of Myanmar’s transition, the Government has made efforts to
proceed in a transparent fashion, including by signing on to international transparency initiatives such
as the Open Government Partnership and the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative, and by es-
tablishing new organizations to monitor and oversee official behavior, such as the Anti-Corruption
Commission and the Rule of Law Commission in Parliament. In addition, the Government has begun to

            clarify the functions of state institutions and to develop the capacity of agencies to carry out their man-
            dates. Finally, the Government launched a substantial reform of its public financial management system
            in order to establish mechanisms for effective management of public funds. However, this transition is
            by its nature a long-term endeavor, and questions remain, including about the formal and informal roles
            of the military going forward, including at the sub-national level.

            45. Supporting governance improvements will be a core focus of the World Bank Group pro-
            gram, in line with the centrality of governance identified in the SCD. International experience from
            similar transformation processes in Latin America in the 1980s and Eastern Europe in the 1990s15 shows
            that fundamental transformations of this order are likely to take decades. Government agencies and
            non-state actors take time to adapt to new roles and develop the capacity (in the form of policies, rou-
            tines, and oversight mechanisms) needed to promote effective governance. Moreover, while this long
            process carries major opportunities for improving state effectiveness, it also carries significant risks since
            it provides vested interest groups in state and society with an opportunity to alter the very foundations
            of the state to their own advantage. The WBG is also well positioned to support the improvement of cor-
            porate governance standards in order to build confidence and facilitate investment in domestic firms.

            46. Central-local relations constitute a centerpiece in Myanmar’s efforts to redefine the organiza-
            tion of the state and more effectively address the demands of citizens. The Government has begun
            to increase the amount of funds available for spending at the State/Region, district and township level
            in an effort to align development projects to local needs. If introduced and implemented in a consul-
            tative and consensus-oriented manner, such decentralization measures can play an important role in
            reaching a stable political settlement. However, the process of determining the division of power be-
            tween different levels of government also carries risks for renewed conflict.16




                  Box 1: Mainstreaming Governance in the WBG Program

                  The focus on governance across all pillars of the CPF program will entail a combination of project, sector, and
                  country-level approaches:

                  •	   During project preparation and implementation, the WBG will work with country counterparts and part-
                       ners to consider how a project might help advance governance (institutional capacity, transparency, ac-
                       countability, participation, and anti-corruption) in Myanmar, and how governance risks may affect the
                       achievement of project development objectives and how to mitigate them. There is no presumption that
                       a project should address a particular governance issue, rather the key is the systematic consideration of
                       governance issues during preparation and their monitoring during implementation.

                  •	   At the sector level, the WBG will integrate governance considerations in its strategic engagement. This
                       will include the identification of key governance issues affecting sectors or sub-sectors to inform not only
                       project design but also policy dialogue. Where feasible, the WBG will support priority activities aimed at
                       addressing these challenges as part of its overall support to the sector, as is the case for example with the
                       WBG’s support to EITI in the area of energy and extractives.

                  •	   At the country level, the WBG will regularly review experiences, including successes and constraints, in
                       governance mainstreaming, and adjust course as necessary in its knowledge and financing work, includ-
                       ing through the CPF’s Performance and Learning Review.

  2.4 Poverty Profile

47. Absolute poverty in Myanmar is estimated to have been between 25.6 and 37.5 percent in
2010, with at least 70 percent of Myanmar’s poor living in rural areas and depending primarily on
agriculture.17 Poverty rates vary across geographical zones, with poverty highest in many areas affect-
ed by conflict and the coastal zone (53.1 percent, including 77 percent in Rakhine State) and hills zone
(40.9 percent), and lowest in the dry zone (29.5 percent). This is consistent with global findings of the
impact of conflict on poverty, and the fact that in Myanmar, conflict has been concentrated in the coun-
try’s remote and often inaccessible border areas.18 However, due to population density, the incidence
of poverty is concentrated also in Myanmar’s farming heartland of the Delta and in the Dry Zone. These
two zones are home to 64 percent of the country’s poor. Urban poverty at 34.6 percent was relatively
higher than expected. According to the 2010 Agricultural Census, 15 percent of farming households
were headed by women, who farm plots that are on average 17 percent smaller than those of male-
headed households. 80 percent of female-headed farming households (or 12 percent of all farming
households) are not able to produce enough food to meet household consumption requirements.

48. Poverty indicators are inconsistent. For example, the 2010 IHLCA household survey found that
70 percent of the population had access to safe water and that adult literacy stood at 90 percent. While
these numbers are impressive, they need to be treated with caution, given the discrepancies across data
sources on some indicators. Other indicators paint a picture of a country that lags significantly behind
many of its peers in the region. In particular, the level of infrastructure development is still very low: the
rural electrification rate is 16 percent and most border regions have no grid-based electricity entirely;
almost half of the roads are not passable during the monsoon rainy season; and railways are old and
rudimentary, with few repairs since their construction in the late 19th century.

49. Over the past years, Myanmar has made significant progress towards several millennium
development goals (MDGs), including reducing child mortality (between 1990 and 2010, the under-
five mortality rate dropped from 100 to 52 per 1,000 live births) and increasing immunization (measles
immunization coverage expanded from 68 percent to 88 percent among one-year old children). The
country has also made progress in combating HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis and malaria. However, progress
has been more limited on other MDGs, including on infant and maternal mortality where improvements
are hampered in part by the low levels of births delivered by skilled birth attendants (71 percent). In
addition, childhood malnutrition remains persistent: in 2010, 1 in 7 infants was born with low birth
weight, 35 percent of children under the age of 5 were stunted. In education, while primary net enroll-
ment rates have improved over the past two decades, enrollment rates drop from 87 percent in primary
school to 58 percent and 32 percent for middle and high school, respectively.




17
   Estimates of the poverty rate depend on the methodology for measuring poverty. The range of estimates between 25.6 and
37.5 percent reflects differences in the consumption basket (inclusion of expenditures on health and durable goods), assump-
tions about the income equivalence for the food calorie intake for adults, and the consideration of spatial differentials in the cost
of living.
18
   For example, the 2011 World Development Report on Conflict, Security and Development found that for every three years a
country is affected by major violence or conflict, poverty reduction lags behind by 2.7 percentage points, with the average cost of
civil war equivalent to more than 30 years of GDP growth for a medium-sized developing country.

            50. Significant gender disparities exist in the public sphere and in access to productive and
            economic resources. On the positive side, the female labor force participation rate (at 86 percent) is
            higher than that of male counterparts (at 83 percent), and women and men have equal rights to land
            ownership. However, women’s participation in politics is low, with women accounting for just 4.6 per-
            cent of the members of Parliament. Similarly, in the public sector, while women account for about half of
            all Government staff in state administrative organizations and union ministries, their work is concentrat-
            ed in lower-level positions: women hold only one-third of managerial positions, and account for only
            one percent at the level of director general and above. Moreover, there is no guarantee of equal pay for
            equal work for men and women and some policies and laws, including customary laws, are obstacles to
            gender equality in land tenure, property ownership and inheritance practices. As a result, land rights
            held by women are often insecure as many women lack awareness of their rights as joint owners of fam-
            ily land or as family members with rights of inheritance.19 The 2013 Gender Inequality Index (GII) ranked
            Myanmar at 83 out of 187 countries.

 2.5 The Systematic Country Diagnostic (SCD): Identifying Drivers
     of Poverty and Development Challenges

51. Myanmar today is one of the least developed countries in the region, despite ample natural
endowments, including fertile land, abundant natural resources, and a strategic location in the most dy-
namic region of the world.20 As the Systematic Country Diagnostics (SCD) makes clear, the root causes
of Myanmar’s lagging development are self-created and caused by decades of conflict and isolation,
which contributed to the gradual development of a rent-seeking economy. The reforms begun in 2011
have opened new pathways to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in the country.

52. In identifying pathways to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity in Myanmar, the SCD
looked at factors responsible for driving people into poverty in Myanmar. These include low labor
productivity, low agricultural productivity, landlessness, erratic rainfall, lack of access to markets due to
poor rural infrastructure, and underdeveloped domestic markets, ethnic conflict and communal vio-
lence, and poor policies. In addition, data also show that many households live just above the poverty
line and are vulnerable to falling back into poverty. Many factors contribute to this vulnerability, inclu-
ding extreme weather events, which are likely exacerbated by climate change.

53. The SCD identified three groups of poor: traditional, transitional and excluded poor. The “tra-
ditional” poor are heavily concentrated in rural areas, have very low levels of education and depend on
agriculture for their livelihood, but have limited access to key productive assets and services such as
land, reliable water supply, and finance. The “transitional” poor typically live in urban and peri-urban
areas, have transitioned out of traditional rural livelihoods but still work as low-skill casual laborers. Fi-
nally, the socially-marginalized and “excluded” poor do not have access to opportunities for productive
economic activity for a range of reasons, including by virtue of ethnicity and geography. The causes of
poverty for each of these groups are many, with some being common to all and some being specific to
one group. Accordingly, the SCD identified pathways out of poverty for each of these groups that have
some common elements and some that differ.

54. Investments in human capital and better access to quality basic services can help reduce
poverty—both the income and non-income dimensions of poverty—among all three groups of
poor. Better access to primary health care, water and sanitation, electricity, and basic education are
important, not only to improve well-being, but also to reduce vulnerability to poverty, promote current
income generating opportunities and lower the inter-generational perpetuation of poverty.

55. For both the “traditional” and “transitional” poor, increasing the returns to their labor will be
essential. There is significant potential for improvement in agricultural productivity in Myanmar—in-
cluding for crop yields, water use, and livestock production—and with rising incomes and urbanization,
there will be greater market opportunities for higher value food sales, benefitting both farmers and
landless farm workers. Increasing access to land and tenure security, through carefully implemented
land reform (based on consultations and a full understanding of the nature and scale of the problem),
will support increased agricultural productivity. In parallel, it will be essential to facilitate the movement



20
  For example, Myanmar has the world’s 25th largest arable land area and has more than ten times the renewable freshwater
resources per capita of India and over 15 times more than China.
16   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            of traditional poor from lower value-added agriculture-related activities to higher value-added activi-
            ties off the farm by stimulating rural business activity and private-sector job creation. For the “transi-
            tional” poor, the opportunities for manufacturing and services employment and income generation will
            be critical.

            56. Lastly, for the “excluded” poor—communities in remote conflict-affected areas, members of
            socially-marginalized groups, families unable to engage in productive work-a focus on increasing
            the returns to labor will not be sufficient. By definition, these groups have been or are likely to be ex-
            cluded from opportunities for productive economic activity, including by virtue of geography, gender
            or ethnicity. Reducing poverty among these groups will have to include specific targeted interventions
            and programs of assistance.


            2.5.1 Potential Sources of Growth and Economic Transformation


            57. The structure of Myanmar’s economy is consistent with that of a lower income country, with
            agriculture playing a dominant role in the economy. According to official national accounts esti-
            mates for 2010, the agricultural sector employed 52 percent of the workforce and generated almost 37
            percent of GDP. The services sector employed 36 percent of the workforce and produced 37 percent of
            GDP. The industrial sector employed only 12 percent of the workers and generated 26 percent of GDP.

            58. Labor productivity in Myanmar, defined as value-added per worker, is low in all sectors and
            is much lower than in most other countries in the region. Most comparator countries in East Asia
            have substantially higher labor productivity in agriculture than Myanmar. Myanmar’s productivity is
            the lowest among these comparator countries in services, and is also the lowest except for Cambodia
            in industry.

            59. Myanmar has a large informal sector with the majority of the poor. According to the UNDP
            IHLCA (2011) report, own-account workers represented 40 percent of total employment in 2009-10.
            Casual laborers represented another 18 percent, mainly from the rural areas, and mainly in the lower
            income deciles. Unpaid family workers represent another 15 percent. Thus, a rough estimate of the
            informal sector in 2009-10 would be 73 percent of the total labor force. As such, efforts to support the
            development of the private sector will also need to address support for formalization and the develop-
            ment of the micro and small enterprise sector.

            60. Myanmar has the potential to emulate the successful growth trajectory of other economies in
            the region. As the country continues to open up the space for investment, Myanmar has strong poten-
            tial to grow initially on the back of capital accumulation. This is likely to drive economic growth in the
            medium-term given the significant infrastructure gaps that have resulted from many years of under-
            investment (for example, only one-third of the population is connected to the electricity grid, with large
            unmet demand). A large part of the capital investments is likely to be in the natural resource sectors: in
            addition to the 17 onshore and four offshore gas projects that are ongoing in Myanmar, nearly twenty
            new production sharing contracts (PSCs) were entered into in 2014 with oil and gas enterprises. The
            latter have indicated that despite recent commodity price developments, at this time they had no plans
            to scale back their investments in Myanmar.
                                                                                Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                            Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   17


61. Aside from the natural resource sector, there are also significant new capital investments
expected in public infrastructure and private manufacturing. Capital spending through the gov-
ernment budget is likely to continue increasing as it starts to address needs in the energy, transporta-
tion and communication sectors in particular. The marginal productivity of public investments is likely
to remain high for years to come as the country gradually rebuilds its stock of physical capital. In private
manufacturing, there has been a surge in foreign investment flows since the country’s transitions be-
gan in 2011/12, and foreign direct investment is expected to reach over five percent of GDP in 2014/15.
Whilst most of the foreign direct investment has been channeled to the oil and gas sectors, more re-
cently major global companies have started to enter the market in Myanmar with investments in manu-
facturing and services.

62. Critical to boosting foreign investment is improving skills of Myanmar’s young and growing
labor force. As noted above, labor productivity in Myanmar is one of the lowest in the region. As pri-
vate investments continue to grow, there will be increased pressure on the short supply of skilled labor.
Ensuring that students have foundational skills such as functional literacy and basic numeracy will be
essential to empowering them to benefit from growing employment opportunities. Investment in edu-
cation will therefore have significant growth dividends over the medium to long-term.

63. Investment in skills will also enhance Myanmar’s comparative advantage in labor intensive,
light manufacturing sectors. Labor costs are comparatively low in the region, and can be a major
source of growth in sectors such as garments, leather, and furniture. Myanmar also has the potential to
join other countries in the manufacturing supply chain. As the skills base begins to develop, Myanmar
can develop its light engineering industry (e.g. automotive parts, motorcycles, selected electronics).
These transitions to light manufacturing and engineering should help facilitate a gradual shift of some
labor from low productivity agriculture into higher productivity manufacturing and services.

64. Growing demands from a rapidly expanding manufacturing sector should fuel rapid growth
in the services sector in the medium to long-term. Over the medium-term, the services sector is
expected to surge thanks to new investments in the telecommunications and banking sectors. Award
of new licenses in both sectors is expected to enable a significant expansion of coverage and access to
critical services for private sector development. With expansion of both domestic and foreign trade, in-
vestments in transport and logistical services will also be very important and an important contributor
to economic activity and employment. Finally in services, tourism is and will be another major source of
growth. Both transport and tourism can become significant sources of job creation in Myanmar.

65. Myanmar’s rich natural resources sector – aside from oil and gas, Myanmar has significant
jade and other precious stones, forestry and other resources – if managed well, can provide an
important source of long-term economic growth.21 According to some estimates, Myanmar accounts
for 90 percent of the world’s jade production and is among the top producers of rubies and sapphires.




21
  Drawing on the 2014 World Bank report on Diversified Development: Making the Most of Natural Resources in Eurasia, My-
anmar can maximize and use the rents from natural resources to diversify national asset portfolios “to ensure a better balance
between natural resources, physical and human capital, and economic institutions”.

     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            66. Myanmar’s location between the two huge markets of China and India presents further
            opportunities for growth. Myanmar will likely gain significantly from increased economic integration
            through the ASEAN Economic Community. Policies to help Myanmar to take full advantage of the gains
            from trade include those promoting access to financing, both domestically and from abroad, strong
            macroeconomic policies (including real exchange rate level and stability), conducive tariff and foreign
            investment regimes.


            2.5.2 Pathways for Ending Poverty and Boosting Shared Prosperity


            67. Building on the above poverty analysis, the SCD identified two main pathways for ending
            poverty and boosting shared prosperity in Myanmar. The first pathway is likely to reach mostly
            the traditional and transitional poor. It entails promoting openness and sustainable private-sector led
            growth for more jobs. Its key over-arching principle is ensuring greater participation of the domestic
            and foreign private sector in the economy (particularly in the sectors which have greater potential for
            job creation), fostering integration with the global economy, enhancing productivity, especially in agri-
            culture, and adopting an integrated approach to the management of the Ayeyarwaddy river basin. The
            second pathway is expected to reach all three groups of poor and entails promoting universal access
            and empowerment for inclusive growth, particularly in rural areas.

            68. In order to accelerate progress towards the twin goals through these two pathways, the SCD
            identified four critical pre-requisites. These are: (i) securing the political transition and improving
            governance; (ii) enhancing social inclusion; (iii) maintaining macroeconomic stability; and (iv) strength-
            ening public sector capacity. The SCD argued that all four prerequisites need to be addressed for mean-
            ingful development to take place since they serve to lay the critical foundation for growth and its sus-
            tainability. In this sense, the pre-requisites identified in the SCD define the overall political, governance,
            and macroeconomic environment of Myanmar within which job opportunities are created, people are
            empowered to take full advantage of these opportunities, and goods and services are supplied and
            delivered.
            	
            69. In all of this, lack of data and information is a key constraint. Myanmar is facing significant
            information and data gaps that make comprehensive diagnostics and targeting difficult. The recently
            completed census will provide much needed baseline data once full results are released in 2015, but a
            key challenge for the coming years will be to deepen a shared understanding, including on the chang-
            ing nature of poverty in Myanmar. The research agenda outlined in the SCD provides an illustration of
            the scope of work needed, and the resulting difficulties in designing and implementing programs in the
            absence of such information.

III. WORLD BANK GROUP COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP
     STRATEGY


70. While the Systematic Country Diagnostic identified the full range of development
challenges facing Myanmar, the Country Partnership Framework aims to identify, among them, the
focus areas for World Bank Group engagement: reducing rural poverty; investing in people and
effective institutions for people; and supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs. In doing
so, the CPF will supplement the analysis of priorities provided in the SCD with a review of the Govern-
ment’s development strategy (section 3.1) and the World Bank Group’s comparative advantage, includ-
ing lessons learned from the implementation of the WBG’s program during the ISN period and stake-
holder consultations (section 3.2). Based on these elements, the proposed WBG program is presented
in section 3.3.


 3.1 Government Program and Medium-term Strategy

71. Since coming into office in 2011, the Myanmar Government has pursued a series of political
and economic reforms to reduce poverty, build peace, and make institutions more responsive,
transparent and accountable. In designing and implementing these reforms, the Government placed
a particular focus on rural poverty reduction through “people-centered development,” to reverse dec-
ades of top-down military planning. The reforms also involved a move towards decentralization to im-
prove local accountability and in response to demands from ethnic minority groups.

72. The rollout of the Government’s reform agenda proceeded in four “waves”: the first wave
focused on political reforms and national reconciliation, and saw the first of a series of releases of
political prisoners, the beginning of a dialogue with the opposition National League for Democracy
that culminated in the NLD’s decision to participate in the April 2012 by-elections, and new legislation
to loosen censorship and promote freedom of press as well as changes of public procurement from
closed to open tenders. The second wave, launched in June 2012, focused on stimulating the coun-
try’s economy through tentative privatization, including a Foreign Investment Law. The third wave, in
April 2013, targeted public administration, including pay rises for civil servants, as well as an increase in
affordable credit for farmers and subsidized mobile SIM cards. The fourth wave, announced in October
2013, targets the private sector by improving rules, regulations and laws governing trade and invest-
ment, as well as logistical and institutional infrastructure.

73. The reforms to date are part of the Government’s five-year development plan, which
covers the term of the administration (2011-2015). The plan focuses on four objectives: (i) agricul-
tural development; (ii) balanced growth among regions and states; (iii) inclusive growth; and (iv) quality
statistics. Specific reform initiatives that will underpin the implementation of the five year development
plan are contained in the “Framework for Economic and Social Reform” (FESR), which seeks to give co-
herence to the Government’s reform efforts, sequence priority reforms, and identify areas where further
analytical work is required. As such, the FESR covers a broad range of areas, including macro-economic
reform; sector policy reform; social and environmental dimensions of development; national harmony
and regional development; improving governance; and repositioning Myanmar in the international
community.
22   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            74. While the FESR and the five year plan provide an overarching framework for the Govern-
            ment’s reform, these have been complemented by a number of sectoral initiatives, summarized
            below. While wide-ranging, these sectoral initiatives share a common goal: a move towards more trans-
            parent, responsive, evidence-based policies that protect the most vulnerable segments of the popula-
            tion and aim to reduce poverty, especially in rural areas.

                 (i)     the development of two key frameworks that place an emphasis on rural poverty reduction
                         and inclusive growth:

                 •	   Preparation of a Rural Development Strategic Framework. In 2014, the Government
                      adopted a Rural Development Strategic Framework to guide its rural development activities.
                      The Framework seeks to achieve inclusive and sustainable rural development, strengthen
                      community-based organizations and build capacity of local communities, and mitigate natural
                      and social disasters. To complement this Framework, the Government is preparing a National
                      Action Plan for Poverty Alleviation and Rural Development through Agriculture.

                 •	   Development of a National Electrification Plan. With support from the World Bank Group,
                      JICA, the ADB and other development partners, the Government has developed a National
                      Electrification Plan and is in the process of establishing an enabling policy and institutional
                      framework for implementing a nationwide electrification program, with a target of achieving
                      universal electricity access by 2030. This target draws on the UN Sustainable Energy for All
                      Initiative, which Myanmar joined in 2013.

                 (ii)	 Education and health strategies oriented towards achieving universal access to quality	
                       basic services:

                 •	   Working towards universal primary school access and increased quality. The Myanmar
                      Government has endorsed goal of achieving universal primary enrollment and documenting
                      quality improvements in education as part of its Comprehensive Education Sector Review, and
                      has increased its education spending more than three-fold since 2011.

                 •	   Working towards universal healthcare coverage (UHC). The Myanmar Government has
                      endorsed the goal of achieving universal healthcare coverage by 2030, as part of the Inter-
                      national Health Partnership Plus Global Compact, which Myanmar joined in 2014, and has
                      increased its health budget four-fold since 2011.

                 (iii)	four strategies for institutional reform and more transparent, responsive, evidence-based
                       policies:

                 •	   Implementing a public finance management reform strategy. The PFM reform strategy
                      was developed based on analytical work that identified constraints in public finance manage-
                      ment systems that affect service delivery, and the Ministry of Finance is implementing the
                      strategy focusing on addressing key constraints. Notable milestones to date have included
                      the restructuring of the Ministry of Finance, amendments to the tax code, and developing a

                                                                  Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   23


          pleted by late 2015, the NSDS will provide a strategic vision for the Myanmar statistics system
          and set out key objectives and goals to be achieved in the medium to long term. The aim is to
          enable the statistical authorities to mobilize resources, coordinate efforts and implement plans
          to deliver the statistical products and services needed by decision-makers at all levels: private
          and public, researchers, analysts and media, civil society and the general public.

     •	   Acceding to the Extractives Industry Transparency Initiative (EITI). Myanmar’s candidacy
          for EITI has been approved. The WBG has played a leading role in supporting the candida-
          cy preparation process, is preparing funding from the Bank-managed EITI multi-donor trust
          funds, and is working closely with all stakeholders on support for Myanmar’s multi-million EITI
          workplan prepared by the EITI multi-stakeholder group, made up of Government, CSO, and
          company representatives, which serves as the national steering committee.

     •	   Creation of a National Water Resources Committee (NWRC). This apex body mandated
          with managing the country’s water resources was created by Presidential decree in 2013. The
          WBG through the Ayeyarwaddy Integrated River Basin Management Project is supporting the
          operationalization of the NWRC and its related Secretariat, Expert Group, Hydroinformatics
          Center and Stakeholder Forum. These structures will provide an institutionalized process for
          decision making in water resources management, supported by a sophisticated decision sup-
          port system and informed by ongoing stakeholder engagement.

75. The broad scope and large number of reforms being initiated by Government pose a chal-
lenge for focused implementation. Some of the strategies are insufficiently grounded in a realistic
assessment of the scope of the challenges or the Government’s capacity to address them. Moving to-
wards realistic and achievable (even if ambitious) targets will be an important part of fostering account-
ability and a focus on monitoring and results within Government policies and planning.



 3.2 Inputs to the Country Partnership Framework:
     Lessons from ISN Implementation and Stakeholder
     Consultations

3.2.1 Lessons from ISN Implementation


76. The Myanmar Interim Strategy Note (ISN), discussed by the Board on 1 November 2012,
charted an ambitious course for the WBG’s re-engagement in Myanmar by focusing on three
pillars: (i) institutional transformation to support the emergence of more transparent, accountable and
effective institutions; (ii) interventions that would deliver tangible benefits for the population; and (iii)
preparing for the road ahead by supporting Myanmar to clear its arrears to IDA and deepen the knowl-
edge base to develop interventions to support poverty reduction.

77. During the ISN period, the WBG delivered significant support across these three areas, with
US$750m in IDA resources delivered during IDA16, supporting a program of activities that closely
mirrors that proposed in the ISN (see Annex 7 for a list of activities undertaken during the ISN period). In
addition, the WBG carried out a broad range of diagnostic and analytical work that provided a founda-
24   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            tion for identifying priority actions by Government and development partners across a range of areas,
            including poverty reduction, agricultural development, public financial management, private sector
            development, and access to finance, as well as assessments of existing procurement/financial manage-
            ment systems in the selected sectors. Gender dimensions were integrated in both analytical work and
            WBG supported operations during the ISN period and have provided a good foundation for gender
            mainstreaming going forward. At the same time, gender concepts were sometimes new to Government
            counterparts, especially at the operational level. Raising awareness and capacity, and improving analy-
            sis and data to inform policy, are core to enhancing gender equality in Myanmar.

            78. Beyond guiding the implementation of a substantial IDA supported program, the ISN guided
            the WBG in the course of its re-engagement. The past two years saw the opening of a country
            office in August 2012, the signing of an Establishment Agreement with the Myanmar Government in
            July 2013, and deepened engagement with Government, civil society, development partners, and other
            stakeholders, including through a series of public events and stakeholder meetings by the World Bank
            country manager and other WBG staff in locations across the country in 2013 and 2014.

            79. Implementation during the ISN period also revealed a number of constraints and important
            lessons for the WBG program moving forward. Limited data complicate targeting efforts for example
            in the health, education and community-driven development projects. While workarounds using con-
            sultative methods and proxy indicators were eventually found, the availability of census and household
            survey data in the future will be important to develop operational mechanisms for effective targeting,
            be it area or household based. In addition, early implementation experience revealed significant chal-
            lenges in inter-ministerial coordination, which remains limited in practice. Finally, across all WBG sup-
            ported operations, experience in the first years has shown limited absorptive capacity and the need to
            focus on simplicity in project design, invest significant resources to allow ongoing capacity building,
            and allow sufficient time for start-up activities to take place. Drawing on these lessons, the program
            proposed in the CPF focuses on strategic initiatives, with relatively larger individual projects that place
            an emphasis on simplicity in design. Implementation support for projects under the CPF will be budg-
            eted to reflect low country capacity, and will draw on expertise from global practices at all stages of the
            project cycle.

            80. Finally, some civil society groups within and outside Myanmar have questioned the World
            Bank Group’s engagement in the country. As part of its commitment to transparency, the WBG has
            engaged in ongoing dialogue with a broad range of civil society on its program, including regular joint
            discussions between Government, the World Bank Group and civil society on specific projects. This
            engagement has been helpful in building mutual understanding and has helped identify issues of par-
            ticular concern, for example around natural resource management.


            3.2.2	 Stakeholder consultations


            81. Given the data constraints and the range of views on key issues facing the country,
            extensive consultations with a broad range of stakeholders were conducted as part of preparations
            for the CPF. With input from civil society organizations the World Bank Group designed a framework
            approach for consultations for the CPF, which was published on the WBG’s Myanmar website in Febru-
            ary 2014. The consultations for the CPF, conducted from June through August, presented initial findings
                                                                    Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.

of the SCD and sought inputs on priorities for the proposed CPF. 16 consultation events were held in six
locations in Myanmar, as well as two events in Thailand (Chiang Mai and Mae Sot) and one in Washing-
ton, DC, bringing together 601 participants from 380 organizations. Written inputs were also received
from a number of organizations, including Oxfam, Human Rights Watch, Global Witness, and Myanmar
IFI Watch, with submissions highlighting the need for transparency in WBG engagements, support for
responsible natural resource management, and continued attention to human rights concerns.

82. The need to focus on agriculture (both productivity and access to markets), as well as
support for health and education were the priorities most frequently articulated at the
consultations, confirming some of the priorities identified in the SCD. A number of participants
stressed the need for careful consideration of the needs of, and the potential impact of WBG programs
on, specific population groups, including women, children, migrants and refugees. Several suggested
that the CPF should include a specific WBG strategy on cross cutting issues such as gender, inclusion of
marginalized groups and conflict sensitivity.

83. These consultations were supplemented by a WBG country survey administered between
June and August 2014 to 662 stakeholders, including Government counterparts, development
partners, private sector, CSOs, and others. With a total of 173 respondents, findings from the survey
suggest that the WBG’s emphasis is aligned with survey respondents’ views of the challenges in the
country: education, governance, rural development, jobs, and growth. Findings also show a strong and
positive relationship between the WBG and the Government and the Bank Group and donors. Notably,
respondents also emphasized that the WBG’s technical assistance is of equal value to its financial re-
sources in as data-poor an environment as Myanmar.


 3.3 Overview of the World Bank Group Strategy

84. This CPF aims to support the achievement of the WBG goals – to reduce extreme poverty
and boost shared prosperity in a sustainable manner – in Myanmar. The CPF outlines a program
of interventions to support Myanmar’s ongoing fundamental shifts towards openness and integration,
and toward empowerment and inclusion, because it is these two shifts that hold the key to poverty
reduction and shared prosperity.

85. The SCD identifies pathways and pre-requisites to reduce extreme poverty and boost shared
prosperity in Myanmar, taking into consideration the sequencing of reforms. From the priorities
identified by the SCD the CPF selects focus areas and specific activities for the WBG program. In doing
so, the CPF applies three selectivity criteria:

    i.	 WBG comparative advantage. In deciding which priorities it will take forward, the WBG will
        review each proposed engagement to identify whether and what the comparative advan-
        tage of the WBG would be compared to other actors, including development partners and
        the private sector. The WBG’s comparative advantage in this context would consist of unique
        strengths either in terms of global knowledge and/or of financial resources (see Box 1 for an
        illustration of the impact of the WBG’s knowledge work), as well as its ability to launch catalytic
        engagements to strengthen the use of country systems to help improve governance in Myan-
        mar.

                      areas for engagement in the CPF period, the WBG will look at the magnitude of the expected
                      impact on the dual transformation to openness and integration, and empowerment and inclu-
                      sion, as the key to poverty reduction and shared prosperity in Myanmar. In each activity, the
                      WBG will seek to maintain a clear line of sight between its engagements in Myanmar and its
                      global twin goals as well as the scope for programs to support Myanmar’s transformation.

                 iii.	 Risk-reward ratio. Finally, the identification of WBG priority interventions will be guided by a
                       more granular understanding of the potential risks and rewards of specific activities. As such,
                       the World Bank Group will not shy away from higher risk interventions where these can have
                       potentially transformative impacts for the country and the achievement of the WBG’s twin
                       goals. This could include, for example support to the sustainable management of natural re-
                       sources, which may challenge vested interests but has an important impact on poverty and
                       inclusive growth, or support for communities in conflict-affected areas where engagement
                       may be more complicated but which are among the poorest of the poor.
                                                                     Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                 Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   27


86. Grounded in the SCD and based on the above selectivity criteria, the CPF program of planned
WBG support will focus on three areas:

    •	   Reducing rural poverty. As at least 70 percent of Myanmar’s poor live in rural areas, reduc-
         ing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will entail increasing access to essential services,
         economic opportunities and markets. The WBG expects to provide support to help increase
         agricultural incomes and productivity, rural electrification, community-driven investments in
         local infrastructure and services, improve Ayeyarwaddy River navigation and flood control,
         and reduce vulnerability to shocks.

    •	   Investing in people and effective institutions for people. Successful empowerment and
         inclusion will depend on citizens who are able to make a better future for themselves, and on
         transparent institutions that allow and encourage people to do so. The WBG expects to pro-
         vide targeted support to help Myanmar approach universal access to and improve the quality
         of essential social services, especially health and education and, over time, skills development
         to empower people to participate in a growing economy. The WBG also expects to provide
         support for state institutions to deliver effectively at the local level.

    •	   Supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs. Reducing poverty and boosting shared
         prosperity will entail moving beyond extractive-based industries to inclusive growth that cre-
         ates jobs. The WBG will seek to foster inclusive growth and a vibrant private sector by support-
         ing institutions and investments that can foster a competitive private sector. This will include
         support to build modern financial institutions and markets, and foster development of the
         formal private sector and trade, investment, and private sector job creation.

87. These three Focus Areas are broadly consistent with the Government’s strategies outlined in
section 3.1 above. Rural poverty reduction, investing in people and effective institutions for people,
and supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs have been core elements of a range of Govern-
ment policies, as illustrated in Figure 2. Each of the Focus Areas contains a strong emphasis on knowl-
edge, to support the Government’s move towards responsive and evidence-based policies.

88. Four important cross-cutting themes will be integrated in the Focus Areas: gender, conflict,
governance, as well as climate change and disaster risk. They are integrated as cross-cutting themes
as they touch on many of the activities proposed under this CPF and by their nature are not contained
within a single focus area.

    •	   Gender: Despite some success, major challenges still persist across the issues of endowment,
         economic opportunity, and agency, with the 2013 Gender Inequality Index ranking Myanmar
         at 83 out of 187. Significant gender disparities exist in participation in the labor force and em-
         ployment (including equal pay for equal work), business and property ownership, and repre-
         sentation in public decision-making bodies. Moreover, the SCD found that gender disparities
         intensify in remote and conflict-affected areas, where violence against women, trafficking and
         HIV/AIDS are major concerns. In recent years, the government has made efforts to provide an
         enabling environment for gender equality, including through the National Strategic Plan for
         the Advancement of Women (NSPAW) 2012-2021. However, many policies and laws, including
28   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




                        customary laws, are obstacles to gender equality. Major gaps in accurate gender disaggregat-
                        ed data are also a challenge which has hampered a meaningful understanding of the gender
                        challenges in the country, and has undermined analysis to improve policy, implementation
                        and enforcement. Gender considerations will be integrated in all IDA-supported operations,
                        and a country-level gender action plan will be developed during the CPF period.22

                   •	   Conflict: Decades of armed conflict between the Government and ethnic armed groups have
                        led to large-scale displacement, destruction of infrastructure and disruption of service deliv-
                        ery, concerns by many about human rights violations in areas affected by conflict, and more
                        broadly to a centralization of power and a militarization of the state. The Government’s peace
                        initiative offers the most hope in a generation for ending these conflicts, but the process
                        remains fragile and at an early stage. In recognition of this, conflict sensitivity will be integrated
                        throughout the WBG program, to identify possible risks and opportunities related to conflict
                        (see also Box 2).




                 Box 2: Conflict Sensitivity in WBG Supported Operations

                 Myanmar’s transition is taking place in a context of continued fragility, conflict and violence, including
                 religious violence and an ongoing but incomplete peace process to address long-standing grievances of the
                 country’s many ethnic minorities. As the World Bank Group scales up its engagement with the country, it is
                 undertaking measures both at the project and at the portfolio level to ensure that WBG engagements are
                 informed by and sensitive to local conflict dynamics. This has included conflict and risk analyses for projects
                 operating in areas affected by conflict, engagement and consultation frameworks for projects in areas with
                 ethnic minorities, and dialogue with a broad range of stakeholders, including ethnic armed groups, to build
                 mutual understanding.

                 With funding from the Korean Trust Fund for Peacebuilding and Economic Transitions, the WBG undertook a
                 systematic review of how these issues have been addressed in WBG supported operations under the ISN, and
                 opportunities for further integration conflict considerations in the future. In the first phase of this process,
                 independent experts with deep knowledge of the Myanmar country context reviewed five WBG engagements
                 (health, education, community driven development, public financial management, and support for EITI) to
                 identify possible risks and opportunities linked to conflict. This included, for example, avoiding inadvertent
                 marginalization of effective service delivery structures maintained by ethnic armed groups, ensuring access to
                 project benefits by marginalized groups, and identifying possible issues of interest from work on decentraliza-
                 tion to inform the broader political dialogue. The findings of this review were discussed in a November 2014
                 workshop with task teams, which led to the development of specific adaptations tailored to the operation
                 and its interactions with conflict issues. KTF funding is now being used to pilot adaptations and review their
                 effectiveness, including for the Myanmar national CDD project to prepare the project’s expansion to Kayin,
                 Kayah and Kachin States next year.

                 Through this approach the WBG expects to address conflict issues systematically in its portfolio. The approach
                 will be applied to all new engagements to promote adaptive learning in a complex operating environment.

              The Systematic Country Diagnostic and CPF are informed by an informal country gender assessment conducted by the World
            Bank, the draft UN Women Country Gender Assessment (forthcoming 2015), the national gender strategy (NSPAW 2012-2021) and
            several thematic gender assessments (e.g.: Gender Profile of the Agriculture Census 2010).

    •	    Governance: In view of the centrality of governance challenges to Myanmar’s transition,
          governance will be a priority cutting across the CPF program. The approach to mainstream-
          ing governance (see Box 1) will be based on leveraging the WBG’s financing and knowledge
          activities at the portfolio level to support improved governance, and improving performance
          at the project level by addressing governance risks to the achievement of project development
          outcomes. This cross-cutting approach will allow the program to engage with a broad range
          of entry points in a rapidly changing environment, including support for improving the perfor-
          mance of core systems (through engagements for example in public financial management) as
          well as sectoral engagements that support the creation of new structures to coordinate poli-
          cies and oversee implementation (such as in the Ayeyarwaddy River Basin project) or improve
          service delivery at the local level (such as in health, education or support for community driven
          development). This work will be guided by analytic work of the emerging governance and
          accountability arrangements at central, agency, and sub-national levels of government.

    •	    Climate change and disaster risk: Natural disasters and the impact of climate change rep-
          resent major challenges for Myanmar. The country is already experiencing increased climate
          variability which will have a growing impact in the coming decades, especially given the
          importance of agriculture for livelihoods. Rising sea levels pose a substantial threat, with ten
          percent of the country projected to be affected by a sea-level rise of between one and five
          meters. Myanmar is also among the world’s countries most vulnerable to natural disasters and
          has suffered through several devastating cyclones, including Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which
          killed about 140,000 people. As part of its program, the WBG will continue the practice of
          building “emergency response contingencies” into IDA supported operations where appropri-
          ate, allowing the rapid reprogramming of funds to respond to natural disasters.

            3.3.1 	 Consistency with the Systematic Country Diagnostics


            89. This CPF is grounded in the analytical framework provided by the Myanmar Systematic
            Country Diagnostics (SCD). It applies the above selectivity criteria to identify, among the SCD
            priorities, the specific priority areas and activities for World Bank Group engagement—as
            outlined in Table 1 below. For example, while the SCD identifies transport, access to safe drinking
            water and sanitation as priorities, the CPF does not propose specific WBG engagements in these areas
            (though the community-driven development project finances small scale road improvements, water
            supplies and sanitation where prioritized by communities). While large scale transport investments may
            have significant benefits, optimizing such investments will require additional knowledge work, such
            as the diagnostics on trade integration currently underway. Similarly, on access to drinking water and
            sanitation, while the impact on the twin goals is high, the WBG’s comparative advantage is relatively
            low given the available financing for these priorities from other development partners.

            90. Moreover, while the CPF reflects key priorities identified in the SCD, it organizes these in
            slightly different ways, so that the Focus Areas of the CPF do not map one-to-one into the poverty
            pathways identified in the SCD. For example, activities under Focus Area 1 bring together key Gov-
            ernment initiatives on rural development (a topic on which the Government places much priority and
            where it has developed a standalone strategic framework), while they span both of the main pathways
            to poverty reduction identified in the SCD.


            3.3.2 Flexibility and scope for adjustments


            91. In recognition of the dynamic environment in Myanmar and the pace of change, this CPF
            covers the three-year period FY15-17, coinciding with the IDA 17 period. This three-year duration
            covers the country’s first general election contested by parties from across the political spectrum in 25
            years, which is scheduled to take place in late 2015. While all parties have publicly confirmed their com-
            mitment to poverty reduction and inclusive growth, the CPF allows for adjustments in the program to
            reflect possible changes in client demand.

            92. A performance and learning review (PLR) is planned in late FY16. This will allow engagement
            with a newly elected Government to discuss development priorities, as well as to take advantage of the
            availability of new data, including the results of the first national census in 30 years (where full data is
            expected by late 2015) and the completion of the first nationally-representative household survey using
            internationally comparable methodology (expected to be carried out in early 2015, with data available
            by late 2015). The CPF is thus designed both to generate new empirical evidence and to use this data to
            inform the WBG’s program in Myanmar, working in partnership with Government, civil society, private
            sector and others to model an evidence-based approach to designing development interventions.

93. Should the performance and learning review indicate continuity in Myanmar’s development
priorities outlined in the CPF, the WBG may at that time decide to extend the CPF. At the same
time, the PLR will also provide an opportunity to review the extent to which activities and focus areas
proposed under the CPF remain relevant, and may consider phasing out ongoing activities (or phasing
in additional ones). This will be particularly critical given the ongoing peace talks, which might impact
on policy issues related to the future structure and organization of the union. In keeping with the frame-
work approach of the CPF, the goal is to ensure that the WBG program as a whole remains poised to
deliver on the CPF’s core objectives, including by learning from experience, adapting to context, and
addressing any identified shortcomings.


 3.4 The WBG Program: Objectives and Planned Knowledge and
     Financing Support

94. Based on the priorities identified in the SCD and application of the selectivity criteria above,
the CPF proposes the following work program over a three year period.


Focus Area 1: Reducing Rural Poverty.  

95. At least 70 percent of Myanmar’s poor live in rural areas, where decades of public under-
investment and market distortions have severely limited livelihood opportunities. The impor-
tance of reducing rural poverty is core to the Government’s development strategy: both the Framework
for Economic and Social Reform and the Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation Strategy recog-
nize the centrality of improving economic opportunities and access to services for rural communities
throughout Myanmar to unlock the development potential of the country and foster inclusive growth.

96. Activities in this focus area aim to reduce poverty by improving access to economic
opportunities and basic services for rural areas in a sustainable manner. It brings together a set
of complementary activities aimed at (i) increasing incomes and access to essential services in rural
areas, including areas most directly affected by past conflict, and (ii) improving national capacity for
sustainable environmental and social management. Together, engagements in this area will increase
opportunities, reduce vulnerabilities and empower poor rural communities throughout Myanmar as
participants in the economy and governance of the country.

97. Knowledge activities in this focus area include analytical and diagnostic work on key thematic
issues, such as on agricultural opportunities, land governance, social inclusion, ethnicity and
gender, and migration. Such work will help Myanmar draw on international experience in considering
key policy decisions, for example on rice prices, agricultural export policies, or the productivity potential
of smallholder farms.

Objective 1.1: Improved power generation and access to electricity

98. Two-thirds of the population is not connected to the national electricity grid and lack of
reliable power is a key constraint to the delivery of important services such as health, education
and finance for rural populations and for private sector development more broadly. The Govern-
ment of Myanmar aims to achieve universal access to electricity by 2030. To this end, the Government
is developing a National Electrification Plan to establish an enabling policy and institutional framework
for a nationwide electrification program. The proposed National Electrification Project is expected to
help increase access to electricity for populations currently not connected to the national grid. The
ongoing Electric Power Project and proposed Myingyan Power Generation Project are expected to con-
tribute to increasing the capacity and efficiency of power generation in Myanmar and strengthening
the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Electric Power and the Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise.
These activities are part of the WBG’s support to the implementation of the National Electrification Plan
which also includes IFC advisory services and will include MIGA guarantees to support electricity distri-
bution and generation (see Box 3 for an illustration of the impact of a joint WBG approach to addressing
energy constraints in Myanmar).

99. The aim of WBG support in this area is to provide new or improved access to electricity for
3 million people by 2017, and to increase power generation capacity from 260 GWh to 660 GWh
by 2017. To maximize synergies in the support to the sector, WBG engagements are part of an agreed
umbrella approach with partners including the Government of Japan, the Asian Development Bank,
USAID, DFAT, DFID, UNDP, Netherlands and Norway under the coordination of the Myanmar Power
Sector Working Group.




  Box 3: Joint WBG Program on Access to Electricity

  Only one in three households in Myanmar have access to electricity, a rate lower than in any of its neighboring
  countries. Per capita electricity consumption is among the lowest in the world, with rural areas in particular
  lacking access to electricity. However, even for those areas connected to the grid, the existing power supply
  is unreliable and frequent blackouts are both a major obstacle for economic activities and a source of public
  frustration.

  To address this constraint, the Government has set a target of increasing the electrification rate to 50 percent
  by 2020. Along with the Government of Japan, the Asian Development Bank and other partners, the World
  Bank Group is committed to helping Government reach this target. The program of WBG support – devel-
  oped as a joint implementation plan (JIP) to leverage the combined skills of the WBG – will include activities
  targeted at increasing the supply and distribution of electricity and set the power sector on a sustainable
  development path.

  To increase the electricity supply, the WBG is supporting an increase in generating capacity, including through
  a US$140 million IDA credit supporting the upgrading of a natural gas-fired power plant that doubled its out-
  put capacity while lowering emissions. To increase the efficiency of power distribution, the IFC is engaging
  with power utilities in both Yangon and Mandalay on their corporatization and commercialization. Jointly, IFC
  and IDA are supporting private sector development of about 750 MW of new gas-fired power generation. Re-
  flecting its extensive international experience and expertise, the WBG expects to play a role in supporting the
  development of a sustainable hydro power sector, as part of a balanced energy mix, in Myanmar during the
  CPF period. Such support may involve the development of some flagship projects that can help set a standard
  for private sector participation in the hydro power sector.

     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




              Finally, to expand access to the national grid and support off-grid electrification, the WBG is providing support
              for the Government’s development of a National Electrification Plan (NEP). Drawing on the combined re-
              sources of the WBG, including MIGA, this will include mobilizing donor and private financing of about US$700
              million for the NEP’s implementation over the next five years. Beyond these immediate steps, the WBG is sup-
              porting the Government through a range of technical and analytical work to make well-informed choices to
              address medium-term challenges, including the development of a well-functioning domestic energy market,
              developing a vision for an optimal fuel mix; and fostering financial sustainability to increase private sector
              participation.



            Objective 1.2: Increased productivity in farming and agribusiness

            100. Half of Myanmar’s poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, but agricultural produc-
            tivity is low, mostly due to poor rice yields and an over-dependence on rice. Low yields in turn are a
            result of a lack of access by farming households to improved agricultural assets, infrastructure and ser-
            vices. Beyond increasing agricultural yields, Myanmar has important opportunities in agro-processing
            and trading activities.

            101. The WBG program aims to increase agricultural productivity by providing 4,500 farmers
            with access to improved agricultural techniques to increase rice yields and providing improved
            irrigation and drainage services covering 10,000 hectares by 2017. To achieve this, the WBG will
            support an integrated program that combines improvements in irrigation and drainage, extension ser-
            vices, and value chain upgrades to increase crop yields and develop a competitive rural sector that
            offers opportunities to all rural households, with particular attention to female-headed households and
            poor or landless farmers. Consistent with IFC’s Agribusiness Strategic Action Plan, IFC’s investments
            and advisory activities will focus on increasing the competitiveness of the Myanmar agribusiness sector
            by (i) supporting agricultural production and risk protection, including potentially through improved
            distribution of agricultural inputs to farmers, and (ii) supporting the development of a robust supply
            chain infrastructure that will allow farmers to get better value for their products while reducing wast-
            age. Finally, the World Bank will support further agricultural productivity enhancements by providing
            agro-meteorological services (e.g. weather predictions and agricultural advisories for planting, harvest-
            ing and crop selection), facilitating inland water transport for agricultural outputs and enhancing the
            government’s capacity to manage and deliver water resources to farmers.

            Objective 1.3: Improved access to critical infrastructure and services for the rural poor

            102. Rural villages experience high levels of poverty, have limited access to quality services
            and infrastructure, and have had limited opportunities in the development process. Opportuni-
            ties for rural communities in Myanmar are severely constrained by decades of underinvestment in key
            infrastructure and services, ineffective economic policies, and the insecurity and destruction caused
            by long-standing conflict in the border areas. Economic reforms, and increased investments in critical
            infrastructure that can improve access to markets and key services can significantly alter the develop-
            ment path by empowering rural communities to increase their production and income.

            103. The aim of WBG support in this area is to increase access to basic services for an additional
            2.5 million people living in rural communities, including in conflict-affected areas, by scaling up
            the IDA-supported national community-driven development program. The national CDD pro-
                                                                    Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   37


gram, launched in 2012 through the first IDA financing to Myanmar in over 25 years, has proved an
effective platform for Government to support communities in identifying and implementing projects
that address critical infrastructure and service gaps. The program helps increase access to and use of
basic infrastructure and services (e.g., small feeder roads, foot-paths and bridges, drinking water sys-
tems, rehabilitation of schools and health centers) through a participatory approach. The program also
finances technical assistance to support capacity development in areas such as participatory processes,
gender equality and inclusion, environmental management and social accountability.

Objective 1.4: Improved national capacity for sustainable environmental and social management

104. If used well, Myanmar’s large endowment in renewable natural resources can support
sustainable diversified development and job creation. However, in the absence of well-defined
environmental and social standards as well as sustainable natural resources management practices and
governance combined with the capacity to implement them, there is a significant risk of adverse social
impacts and eco-system degradation (including deforestation and water and air pollution). With over
half of the land area covered in forest, more than half of the population dependent on forests, fisher-
ies and other renewable resource sectors, and these natural resource dependent populations being
the poorest segments of society, there is a risk that as the economy expands and natural resource use
intensifies, the lack of sustainable natural resource management will threaten the livelihoods of rural
communities, including by increasing their vulnerability to climate change and natural disasters. In
addition, lack of access to land and tenure security are critical constraints to agricultural productivi-
ty and private sector investment. Adopting an integrated approach to the management of natural
resources and developing a national environmental and social risk management framework can help
Myanmar achieve the long-term sustainability of its poverty reduction efforts.

105. The proposed WBG contributions in this area aims to support sustainable development
and effective use of the country’s natural resources. This will include programmatic analytical and
advisory work aimed at building the national capacity for sustainable natural resource and environ-
mental management, including (i) a country environmental and social safeguard capacity assessment
that will identify immediate needs for strengthening Myanmar’s systems; (ii) analysis of challenges in
the management of selected natural resources from the point of view of governance, sustainability,
eco-system resilience, and poverty links; and (iii) analysis of potential environmental impacts associ-
ated with likely development scenarios in selected key sectors, such as energy, transport, mining or
agriculture, engaging with sector stakeholders to develop risk management strategies. These activities
will be complemented by investments to sustainably manage the Ayeyarwaddy River Basin, to support
capacity building of national systems to collect and analyze data to make decisions about possible
uses of the Ayeyarwaddy River, including on possible hydropower development, transport, irrigation
and flood control; and continued support for Myanmar’s implementation of the Extractives Industries
Transparency Initiative as part of responsible natural resource management.

106. Synergies with development partners. In supporting core Government development priorities,
activities in this focus area seek to capitalize on synergies with other development partners. For exam-
ple, the emphasis on rural electrification is part of an agreed umbrella approach with partners including
the Government of Japan and the Asian Development Bank that outlined an end-to-end framework for
addressing Myanmar’s electricity shortages, including on the generation, transmission and distribution
side. Similarly, proposed work on increasing agricultural incomes fits with activities of other donors to
38   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            improve the efficiency of existing irrigation systems, strengthen Government capacity to deliver agri-
            cultural services to smallholder farmers, and increase access to markets through investments in rural
            roads and support for agricultural traders. Support for community-driven development approaches can
            help Myanmar build an intervention platform that uses a mix of Government and donor funds to sup-
            port rural development needs in an integrated manner, with additional support from the Government
            of Japan and the Government of Italy. Finally, on EITI, the World Bank Group’s engagement has been
            partly funded by the UK, which together with the WBG serves as lead donor on EITI, convening regular
            meetings of donors and INGOs engaged with the EITI process. As Myanmar moves to full implementa-
            tion of an ambitious EITI work-plan, discussion is underway for a possible joint funding mechanism.
            Throughout these engagements, World Bank-executed trust funds have provided resources to finance
            enhanced implementation support to build capacity and mitigate risk.

            107. Integration of cross-cutting themes. Gender considerations will be integrated in IDA supported
            investment operations. For example, in the CDD project gender considerations are mainstreamed in
            the project’s design, operations and monitoring framework. Specific components will be included in
            the Ayeyarwaddy river basin project to address governance, climate change, and disaster risks, includ-
            ing a national system to produce and disseminate disaster warning information, including to poor and
            vulnerable populations in risk prone areas, complementing broader support to disaster risk manage-
            ment. Conflict-affected areas are primarily rural and often remote, and activities in this focus area have
            the potential to support increased access to services and opportunities for communities affected by
            conflict. In this context, WBG supported operations such as the community-driven development project
            will also be adapted to operate effectively in conflict areas (see Box 4). Support for EITI is an integral part
            of helping the country address governance challenges related to the extractives sector. Implementa-
            tion modalities such as the community-driven development approach also mark an important shift
            from top-down to bottom-up development, helping rebuild state-society relations and ensuring the
            effective use of scarce public resources. As such, activities in this focus area thus help the Government
            mitigate a number of key risks, including by demonstrating the intent to ensure that benefits from
            the recent reforms benefit the poorest and most vulnerable, including remote and rural areas. This
            marks a significant break with the past, where benefits from economic development and public services
            accrued mostly to a politically connected elite, primarily in urban areas.
            	

            Focus Area 2: Investing in People and Effective Institutions for People.  

            108. Successful empowerment and inclusion relies on an accountable, transparent, and higher
            performing state capable of facilitating improvements in the lives of its citizens. Decades of
            underinvestment in public services (with budget allocations for social services among the lowest in
            the world) have greatly limited the availability and quality of key social services, and the ability of state
            institutions to deliver effectively at the local level. The Government aims to change this, including by
            setting the country on a path to universal healthcare access and increasing budget allocations for social
            services. Activities in this focus area aim to improve institutional performance, with a particular focus on
            access to and the quality of key social services to provide citizens with skills and endowments to make
            a better future for themselves, in line with global evidence which has shown investments in health and
            education as among the most effective long-term investments for sustainable poverty reduction and
            boosting shared prosperity.
                                                                     Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.

109. A broad set of analytical work will inform engagements in this focus area. The SCD high-
lights key data constraints in reliable and robust information on learning outcomes and the health sta-
tus of the population of Myanmar as well as the effectiveness of state institutions at the local level. In
addition to the activities outlined below, knowledge work to be conducted during the CPF includes
analytical work to inform ongoing discussions on decentralization and devolution, including through
the programmatic Public Expenditure Review; an assessment of students’ learning outcomes at key
stages of the education cycle; analysis to assess the overall labor market, returns to education, and the
nature of skills demanded by the private sector, including an in-depth labor market diagnostic study;
and just in time advice for the proposed pension and social protection reforms.

Objective 2.1: Improved capacity to manage public finances and Union-State/Region relations
               for better service delivery

110. Myanmar is a centralized country following decades of military rule, and fiscal and
functional decentralization is a core issue for more effective service delivery at the local level.
Coordination remains weak, especially around the balance between center and Union-State/Region
relations and broader public sector resource management. A critical pre-requisite for Myanmar’s peace
and development is to move from centralized and authoritarian rule towards an accountable public
sector, including at the local level. In addition, the effectiveness and efficacy of the pathways for end-
ing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will depend on the capacity of Government to design and
implement the right interventions, whether in the form of policy, institutional reforms, or investments.

111. WBG support aims to help the Government put in place a plan for central-local fiscal
relations as well as a medium-term fiscal framework. In addition, WBG support for more effective
public institutions is expected to include the continued implementation of an IDA supported opera-
tion that supports modernization of public financial management, providing technical assistance to
address public administration performance constraints in social and economic sectors, as well as a new
programmatic DPO series to support policy reforms related to macro-fiscal management, transparency
and Union-State/Region relations, to help ensure continued macro-fiscal stability while making a grow-
ing budget more responsive to the demands of Myanmar’s citizens. The WBG will also actively seek
opportunities to support the government transformation through providing technical advice and sup-
port to encourage a peaceful resolution to the longstanding conflict in Myanmar. Finally, the WBG
expects to engage with state-owned enterprises, with possible advisory work on improving their per-
formance and possible IFC investment support for corporatization and subsequent privatization.

Objective 2.2: Expanded health services and improved health financing, with a focus on
               maternal, newborn and child health

112. Health care services in Myanmar are constrained by a combination of limited access and
lack of timely and flexibly financing for frontline service delivery. Health outcomes lag significantly
behind other countries in the region: infant mortality still stands at 40 per 1,000 live births; each year,
about 2,000 pregnant women and 50,000 children die from preventable causes; and only 71 percent of
births are delivered by skilled birth attendants and only 78 percent receive post-natal care. The Govern-
ment of Myanmar has committed to overcoming poor access to quality services and low financial risk
protection by setting out a path towards Universal Health Coverage. The World Bank, through financing
and knowledge, supports the country in advancing towards this goal.
40   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            113. The aim of WBG support in this area is to increase the percentage of deliveries with skilled
            birth attendants from 71 to 75 percent and the percentage of deliveries followed by adequate
            post-natal care from 78 to 80 percent. IDA support will aim to expand coverage of essential health
            services of adequate quality, with a focus on maternal, newborn and child health, in support of Myan-
            mar’s move towards Universal Health Care (UHC). This will include strengthening the ability of Govern-
            ment systems to provide resources for front-line service providers through better targeting and moni-
            toring of results, and building the capacity of Government systems to address other dimensions of UHC,
            including financial protection for the poor through a health financing strategy and the development
            of an expanded and costed essential package of health services for UHC. IFC will support investment in
            PPPs in healthcare, diagnostics, skills development and selective engagement in tertiary healthcare, as
            well as advisory services for health systems strengthening.

            Objective 2.3: Expanded and improved education coverage and measurement of learning
                           outcomes

            114. While school enrollment rates in Myanmar are relatively high, completion rates lag behind
            the country’s peers, especially among poorer parts of the population. In 2010, net primary school
            enrollment stood at 87 percent, dropping to 58 percent and 32 percent for middle and high school,
            respectively. Net enrollment rates are lowest for the poor and the bottom 40 percent of the popula-
            tion. Education, especially in rural areas, had historically been underfunded, and this has exacerbated
            inequalities as poorer and more isolated areas comparatively lack financial means and technical capac-
            ity. Increased access to basic education has the potential to play a critical role to ensuring inclusive
            growth.

            115. In addition, as noted in the World Bank Group’s 2014 Enterprise Survey, the scarcity of the
            pool of skilled workers constrains the operation of firms in Myanmar. The acquisition of workplace
            skills is essential to firm productivity, competitiveness and ultimately, inclusive growth. Firms in Myan-
            mar, and SMEs in particular, provide very little training to their employees, with less than 10 percent
            of small firms providing training to their employees. The skills gap indicated in the Enterprise Survey
            indicates that the education system does not produce enough workers with current knowledge and the
            level of skills needed in the workplace. Addressing this challenge is critical for improving the productiv-
            ity and competitiveness of Myanmar firms, especially SMEs who are less able to provide training to their
            workers directly.

            116. WBG support in this area aims to expand the targeted student stipend program to cover
            an additional 30,000 students and expand the existing school grants program. The ongoing IDA-
            supported education operation is expected to help improve and expand the existing school grants
            and targeted student stipends programs, as well as the implementation of professional development
            programs for township and school officials and periodic early grade reading assessments. The IDA sup-
            ported operations will support reforms through (i) expanding the coverage of the stipend program
            and improving operational mechanisms for targeting poor and vulnerable students, (ii) improving the
            reliability and transparency of the school grants scheme; and (iii) building the capacity of the Ministry
            of Education, townships, schools and communities to implement these programs and monitor their
            progress. In addition, IFC will explore support for skills development programs to support the private
            sector, especially SMEs, by improving their competitive edge during this period of reform and market
            opening. To support this, analytical work will be carried out to identify key data gaps, strengthen un-
                                                                          Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                      Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   41


derstanding of students’ learning outcomes at key stages of the education cycle, and assess the overall
labor market, returns to education, and the nature of skills demanded by the private sector, including
an in-depth labor market diagnostic study.

Objective 2.4: Increased understanding of poverty and key related issues

117. Significant data constraints in Myanmar limit an understanding of poverty and related
factors, and complicate efforts at targeting interventions, measuring impact, and applying
global experience in policy design and implementation. To better understand dimensions of pov-
erty in Myanmar and allow targeting of interventions towards the poor, including among Myanmar’s
ethnic minorities (see Box 4), the WBG will support the GoM in the conduct of a nationally-representa-
tive household survey. The WBG will also continue to support the preparation and implementation of a
National Strategy for the Development of Statistics, to help Government map and fill critical knowledge
gap.

118. WBG engagements in this area will support the endorsement and implementation of a
National Statistics strategy and a completed poverty assessment and expenditure review by
2017. This work will be complemented by analytical and diagnostic work on key thematic issues as well
as on reform sequencing. Topics for such work are expected to include trade and agricultural opportu-
nities, land governance, social inclusion, ethnicity and gender, migration, labor markets, skills develop-
ment and job creation, and access to finance in remote areas. This includes the Qualitative Social and
Economic Monitoring research project, which aims to better understand changes in livelihoods and
social structures in Myanmar and is undertaken on behalf of the multi-donor livelihoods trust fund as a
reimbursable advisory service. The WBG will also consider policy notes for the incoming government in




  Box 4: Impact of WBG Knowledge Work – The Example of Poverty

  Building on the 2014 national census, the WBG supported the Government in constructing a master sam-
  pling frame as a coordinating mechanism for a number of national household surveys currently planned in
  Myanmar. In 2015, the WBG together with the Government will implement a pilot small-scale (3,500) house-
  hold survey to collect information on consumption and income levels. This small pilot is designed to provide
  up-to-date estimates of poverty in 2015. Combining data from this pilot survey with unit record data from the
  Population Census, the World Bank will work with the Ministry of Immigration and Population to produce pov-
  erty maps using small area estimation methods and imputation techniques. In addition, the data will inform
  the design and implementation of the large-scale (18,000 households) national survey that the Government
  is planning with support from the WBG and other development partners.

  Together, these data are strengthening the analytical foundation of the Government’s development programs,
  the design and evaluation of the Bank’s lending operations as well as related analytical works on social inclu-
  sion, inequality and poverty in Myanmar to better understand dimensions of poverty in the country, including
  as experienced by ethnic minorities and vulnerable groups.


119. Synergies with development partners. The WBG engagement on public financial management
is co-financed by the UK, Australia and Denmark, reflecting the World Bank’s comparative advantage
and expertise in this area. In education, the program of support builds on the outcomes of the recently
42   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            completed Comprehensive Education Sector Review and extensive dialogue with development part-
            ners, with Australia co-financing the ongoing IDA support. In health, the proposed support aligns close-
            ly not only with Government plans, but also with donor-supported activities through synergies with
            the multi-donor 3MDG Fund that supports the provision of health services in Myanmar to achieve the
            three health-related Millennium Development Goals (e.g. reducing child mortality, improving maternal
            health and combating HIV, tuberculosis and malaria).

            120. Integration of cross-cutting themes. Gender considerations have been integrated in both the
            health and education operations, and are complemented by ongoing work to ensure that inclusion
            issues are addressed effectively in the health operation and conflict risks in the education operation
            (see Box 3). Meanwhile, the engagement on PFM and Union-State/Region relations directly supports
            governance improvements, including through the continued practice of publishing budget informa-
            tion to empower citizens to understand how and where public money is spent.


            Focus Area 3: Supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs.  

            121. Sustainably reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will require moving beyond
            extractive-based to inclusive economic growth that can create jobs. Jobs outside agriculture will
            be essential to lift the transitional and traditional poor in Myanmar out of poverty. As the gas sector is
            not labor intensive, efforts will need to focus on promoting greater private sector investment in non-
            gas sectors such as manufacturing, mining, tourism, ICT, the financial sector, and construction. Creating
            employment opportunities in and around towns and cities will be critical to ending urban poverty,
            particularly through Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) alongside large firms as outlined in the Gov-
            ernment’s Framework for Economic and Social Reforms. Opening up space for investors, markets, elec-
            tricity, finance, and ICT will all be important.

            122. Activities under this focus area seek to foster inclusive growth and a vibrant private sector
            that can drive job creation to reduce poverty. This will be achieved through: (i) improved financial
            infrastructure and access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises; (ii) an enabling environ-
            ment for private sector investment in productive and services sectors; (iii) improved capacity to facili-
            tate and benefit from trade; (iv) increased access to ICT; and (v) direct investment to support the devel-
            opment of the manufacturing and services sectors with job creation demonstration effects.

            123. Activities in this focus area will be anchored in a broad set of analytical and knowledge
            work. They will include advisory work to help Government identify opportunities for public-private
            partnerships to leverage limited public funds by attracting private capital and know-how; diagnostic
            work on improving the regulatory framework and business environment; knowledge work and tech-
            nical assistance to foster a competitive private sector, including the Diagnostic of Trade Integration
            Study described below. Finally, knowledge work will focus on support for the development of a sound,
            efficient and inclusive financial system, including upgrading the legal and regulatory framework for
            the banking system, and work to promote accounting, auditing and corporate governance standards
            for financial institutions and on establishing a credit bureau to enable more efficient functioning of
            domestic credit markets.
                                                                      Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                  Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   43


Objective 3.1: Improved financial infrastructure and access to finance

124. Access to finance in Myanmar is limited, yet critical to promoting inclusive growth and
empowering people. Long-term and broad-based economic growth will depend on a functioning
financial system that provides access to financial services to all types of firms as well as households. The
financial system in Myanmar is at the earliest stages of development and Myanmar lags far behind its
neighboring countries: only 30 percent of Myanmar’s adult population has access to financial services
provided either by commercial banks or microfinance institutions. The WBG aims to support the imple-
mentation of the country’s Roadmap for Financial Inclusion, aimed at increasing financial inclusion from
30 percent in 2014 to at least 45 percent by 2017 and to 70 percent by 2020.

125. WBG support in this area aims to increase the number of people, microenterprises and SMEs
using financial services by 200,000 and to facilitate financing of up to US$40 million by 2017.
WBG interventions in the area of financial inclusion will be structured in a comprehensive program
that is joint between IDA, IFC and MIGA and interested bilateral donors around four areas: (i) modern-
izing payment systems and financial sector infrastructure, (ii) strengthening private financial institu-
tions critical for financial inclusion and access to credit (microfinance institutions, private banks) and
transforming select state-owned banks into financially sustainable institutions, (iii) expanding financial
instruments and products (SME lending, agriculture lending, insurance, digital finance, etc.); and (iv)
strengthening the capability of the Central Bank of Myanmar and Ministry of Finance to monitor the
soundness and integrity of the financial system. IFC will work on strengthening corporate governance
laws and regulations and provide advisory services to banks and other firms and at the market level to
raise awareness of corporate governance standards with an emphasis on particular themes affecting
lender and investor confidence such as transparency, conflicts of interest, related party transactions,
beneficial ownership, shareholder practices/protections and internal control and audit.

126. Ongoing knowledge and advisory work will be particularly critical to improve the financial
infrastructure during the course of the CPF period. The WBG will help Government identify oppor-
tunities for public-private partnerships to leverage limited public funds by attracting private capital and
know-how. To support the development of a sound, efficient and inclusive financial system, the WBG
will also support an upgrade of the legal and regulatory framework for the banking system to bring it
into compliance with international standards, capacity-building support for the regulation and supervi-
sion of microfinance, and work to enhance accounting, auditing and corporate governance standards
for financial institutions.

Objective 3.2: Improved enabling environment for private sector investment in productive and
               services sectors

127. Jobs are a pathway out of poverty, and sustained employment generation is premised on a
diversified investment base across real and services sectors, especially those that have a high job
creation potential. For the majority of the poor, e.g. the “traditional poor” who currently depend on
agriculture for their livelihoods, this will mean both raising the returns to agricultural cultivation, while
in parallel, facilitating their movement from lower value-added agriculture-related activities to higher
value-added activities off the farm by stimulating private-sector job creation. Moreover, opportunities
for private-sector led off-farm employment and income generation will be critical for the “transitional
poor.”
44   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            128. The WBG will assist the Government of Myanmar to mobilize $150 million in private
            investment by creating a business environment that is conducive to private sector investment.
            This will involve improving the legal and regulatory framework to strengthen investor protection,
            streamlining investment entry procedures and improving the investment incentive regime. Such work
            may include the conduct of a Report on the Observance of Standards and Codes (ROSC) to strengthen
            Myanmar’s corporate financial reporting regime and improve financial reporting, thus raising corporate
            governance standards, and increasing transparency and financial stability. With transparency and trust,
            will come more investments and jobs. IFC will undertake additional work aimed at improving the regu-
            latory framework and business environment, including for agribusiness and tourism, through technical
            assistance to Government for a new investment law and implementing regulations as well as support
            for the Myanmar Business Forum to strengthen public-private dialogue with support by both the UK
            and Australia. IFC will provide advisory services to the government and private sector to ensure sustain-
            able development of the tourism sector a key driver of growth that will generate investment and jobs
            and strengthen the linkages between the industry and communities. Subject to improvements in the
            investment climate and a conducive operating environment, IFC will continue to invest in key sectors
            like tourism and retail, which are expected to see significant growth in the coming years. These sectors
            are amongst the biggest employers today and with the projected growth will help create a significant
            number of employment opportunities that are geographically well diversified.

            Objective 3.3: Improved capacity to facilitate (and benefit from) trade

            129. Given its long period of international isolation, to seize increased trade and FDI
            opportunities, Myanmar will need to be part of the regional and global production/value chain
            networks. Transaction costs for international trade can be reduced through reforms of institutions,
            policies, and procedures. Reforms are needed to reduce non-tariff measures (NTMs) and streamline cus-
            toms procedures that are bureaucratic and slow and that contribute to significant delays in the import
            and export process that raise the cost of doing business and discourage the growth of overseas trade.

            130. WBG support in this area is expected to identify and enact policy reforms to facilitate trade.
            To this end, a Diagnostic of Trade Integration Study (DTIS) will be carried out to identify opportunities
            for improving Myanmar’s capacities to benefit from trade. Technical work following on the DTIS could
            include additional knowledge work on trade and transport facilitation assessments, customs moderni-
            zation, and sector specific technical assistance. These engagements would build on the WBG invest-
            ment climate assessment, which will support a policy dialogue on critical bottlenecks for the private
            sector.

            Objective 3.4: Increased access to ICT

            131. Mobile phone penetration was estimated at about 20 percent 2014 while internet
            penetration stood at 10 percent, among the lowest rates in Southeast Asia. Increased access to ICT
            will be critical for Myanmar to seize increased trade and FDI opportunities, identify opportunities to use
            technology for leapfrogging on issues such as increased access to finance, improved service delivery
            and to support a vibrant private sector.

            132. WBG support in this sector is expected to increase access to telephone services (both fixed
            mainlines and cellular phones) to 50 percent by 2017, and increase access to internet services to
            15 percent by 2017. To this end, the WBG will continue implementation of the Telecommunications
                                                                         Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   45


Sector Reform Project. IFC will support private sector participation in the development of an efficient
network infrastructure that will allow the expansion of reach to currently under-deserved areas in the
country while also improving the reliability of existing services; these will include supporting mobile
network operators, tower companies and fiber companies, to improve telecommunication sector cov-
erage. MIGA is also looking at an opportunity to provide political risk insurance to help foreign investors
with their investment in the telecom sector in Myanmar.




  Box 5: WBG Support to the Private Sector

  The Government of Myanmar is implementing legal and regulatory reforms to support the development of
  the private sector. The WBG is supporting the Government’s efforts in this regard through technical assistance
  and diagnostic and benchmarking studies. Key diagnostic work includes the Investment Climate Assessment,
  which highlights issues facing the private sector through an enterprise survey and review of the business
  environment. The Doing Business Report, an annual report benchmarking 189 economies worldwide on key
  indicators of the ease of doing business, provides a comparative assessment of the business environment in
  Myanmar and helps identify key reform areas. The recently initiated Diagnostic Trade and Integration Study,
  supported through the Enhanced Integrated Framework process, is a key study to identify constraints related
  to trade facilitation. Through this study the WBG is working with the government to develop an action plan
  for trade facilitation reform.

  Alongside these studies, WBG advisory services are supporting the government with its investment policy
  reforms, including the preparation of a new Investment Law and implementing regulations. IFC advisory ser-
  vices are supporting the Government in building institutional capacity for competitive selection of independ-
  ent power producers. Other support includes working with the Government and private sector to establish a
  platform for sustained public-private dialogue through the Myanmar Business Forum and a program to sup-
  port the Government with regulatory reforms to improve the ease of doing business. Through this support for
  the reform process, the WBG is enhancing the competitiveness of the private sector in Myanmar by reducing
  the cost of doing business and cutting red tape. This work will also support efforts to open the economy while
  also strengthening integration with ASEAN and the rest of the world.


133. Synergies with development partners. IFC’s work on the investment climate, the Myanmar Busi-
ness Forum and PPPs is supported by both the UK and Australia. Regional integration, including trade
facilitation, is a core part of the ASEAN integration agenda, including plans for an ASEAN economic
community. Similarly, this work complements regional connectivity infrastructure projects initiated by
the Asian Development Bank as part of its Greater Mekong Subregion initiative.

134. Integration of cross-cutting themes. Most of Myanmar’s conflict affected areas are located along
the country’s periphery, and conflict considerations have been integrated in the preparation of the DTIS
work and will continue to guide efforts to support Myanmar in benefitting from increased trade. Sup-
port for access to finance includes particular emphasis on reaching out to women and female-headed
households, while increased phone connectivity can play an important role in early warning systems
and reducing people’s vulnerability to natural disasters.

135. Activities across the three Focus Areas will help the Government mitigate key risks, inclu-
ding by ensuring the effective use of increased allocations to social services and demostrat-
ing that recent reforms benefit the poorest and most vulnerable. The latter marks an impor-
tant break with the past, where benefits from economic development and public services accrued
mostly to a politically connected elite. In contrast, the community-driven development approach marks
46   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            a shift from urban to rural areas, and from top-down to bottom-up development. More broadly, the
            Government has been clear and consistent in its desire to use a greater share of the national budget
            to support service provision. A critical challenge in doing so will be how to spend resources most ef-
            fectively. The proposed engagements in this realm are among the first donor efforts to help strengthen
            Government systems and optimize the use of increased public resources, which will also involve ad-
            dressing the risk of parallel service provision in conflict affected areas.


              3.5 Implementing the Country Partnership Framework

            3.5.1 Financial envelopes and instruments


            136. Given the significant knowledge gaps in Myanmar, an important part of the World Bank
            Group’s role at this critical stage of Myanmar’s development will be about knowledge, technical
            assistance and policy dialogue to support and maximize the impact of investments. In this con-
            text, the CPF program proposed here has a significant emphasis on analytical, advisory and knowledge
            work to share with Government, civil society and development partners, findings on the choices and
            opportunities available to Myanmar to reduce poverty and boost shared prosperity. This work will be
            supported by the strategic use of trust funds and partnerships for knowledge work across sectors and
            global practices.

            137. Beyond knowledge, Myanmar’s total indicative IDA 17 allocation is US$1.6 billion. The CPF
            identifies an initial program based on this amount and envisages substantial frontloading into FY15-16.
            Actual usage of the IDA envelope will follow Myanmar’s performance. That performance is expected to
            continue improving throughout IDA 17 (and indeed the CPF period overall, notwithstanding inevitable
            ups and downs across specific dimensions).

            138. IBRD expects to require additional data to determine Myanmar’s prospects for eventual IDA
            graduation. The IDA cut-off point for FY15 is US$1,215 GNI per capita (Atlas methodology). According
            to OP 3.10, in FY15 Myanmar is characterized as having a GNI per capita of less than US$1,045. However,
            estimates of GDP vary, and margins of errors are likely to be large. The WBG will monitor progress on
            creditworthiness during the CPF period, including at the performance and learning review.

            139. IFC will be providing up to US$1 billion in investments over the CPF period and US$20
            million worth of technical assistance working alongside IDA funds.

            140. MIGA has no pre-determined envelope for guarantees over the CPF period, but will actively
            seek to provide sufficient guarantees to meet requests from foreign investors.

            141. WBG instruments to implement the CPF are expected to include IDA policy based and
            investment financing as well as guarantees, IFC and MIGA resources, which also mobilize
            external private sources of capital and knowledge; trust funds administered or funded by the
            World Bank Group, as well as analytic and advisory services. It is envisaged that the CPF program
            will include one or two development policy operations and several investment financing operations.
                                                                     Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.

In addition, where appropriate, the program will draw on trust funds to increase impact and ensure
responsiveness to country context. If opportunities arise for large scale transformational programs and
conditions allow, the WBG may explore the scope for access to enclave IBRD funding.

142. To support this increased engagement, the WBG will continue to maintain a substantial
presence on the ground, drawing on the joint WBG country office in Yangon and a planned new
office expected to be established in Nay Pyi Taw. This in-country presence will continue to lead the
dialogue with Government, development partners, private sector and civil society, and will draw on
global expertise and knowledge through the WBG’s Global Practices.


3.5.2 Country financial management and procurement capacities


143. The Government of Myanmar recognizes the importance of public financial management
for effective service delivery. To support and help orient Government reform efforts in this area, the
World Bank in 2013 carried out a Public Expenditure and Financial Accountability (PEFA) assessment.
The assessment identified substantial weaknesses in current public financial management systems,
including manual processes of budget preparation and execution, fragmented policies and procedures,
lack of a comprehensive PFM law, and lack of effective internal audit functions. Drawing on the PEFA
analysis, the Government has developed a reform strategy that is being supported by the World Bank
and other development partners, including through a public financial management modernization
project jointly financed by the UK, Australia and IDA.

144. Notable public financial management reforms started during the ISN period. To strengthen
the policy orientation of the 2015/16 budget, a Medium-Term Fiscal Framework was jointly prepared by
the Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development and the Ministry of Finance. In addition,
the Government has established a Treasury Department and Large Tax-Payers Office as part of efforts
to modernize institutional structures. A public debt law has been drafted, which clarifies responsibilities
for contracting debt. Finally, there have been substantial improvements in the quality of fiscal informa-
tion provided to Parliament and subsequently reported in the media, including more accessible budget
summaries and the first parliamentary submission of an audit report.

145. Consistent with the CPF’s emphasis on governance, the WBG will continue to support
Myanmar in the implementation of substantive PFM reform. At the same time, recognizing that
such reforms will take time, the WBG in the meantime has adopted a number of complementary
approaches for its projects. For example, WBG projects in Myanmar use Government PFM systems to
the greatest degree feasible, and following an institutional assessment and ongoing capacity building,
the Office of the Auditor General is being used to audit all World Bank-funded projects in Myanmar.
In addition, the World Bank has conducted sector assessments in selected sectors (electric power, tel-
ecommunications, education and health) to better understand sectoral PFM challenges and integrate
responses in projects design.

146. Consistent with its focus on public financial management, Myanmar has made efforts to
establish a consistent public procurement system, albeit with continuing shortcomings. In June
and September 2011, the Office of the President issued instructions to decentralize procurement to
48   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            union ministries and to change procurement methods from closed tender to open tender. However,
            inconsistent implementation by line ministries left room for interest groups to attempt to gain advan-
            tage. There is no designated institution which leads the procurement reform process to provide guid-
            ance on implementation or collect data about performance at the national level.

            147. Building on these efforts, improvements are expected in the short to medium term. As part
            of its focus on supporting governance improvements, the World Bank since 2012 has conducted pro-
            curement assessments in selected sectors (electric power, telecommunications, education and health),
            with the findings of these assessments being used to improve the existing systems. Going forward, the
            Government has expressed interest in setting up a task force or designating a lead ministry to agree on
            consistent procurement rules and procedures. The World Bank has indicated its readiness to provide
            assistance to this process, including developing supporting tools (standard procurement documents,
            technical guidance, etc.) and building capacity in government agencies. With completion of these activ-
            ities, the public procurement system in Myanmar will be better positioned to support delivery of public
            services and World Bank supported operations will benefit from a strengthened national procurement
            system.	


            3.5.3	 Addressing implementation challenges


            148. In recognition of the constraints and risks described above, the World Bank Group will
            continue to assess domestic capacities on an ongoing basis and evaluate implications for the
            WBG program. Early implementation experience has highlighted capacity constraints, reflected for
            example in relatively low disbursement rates of the WBG portfolio, consistent with similar experiences
            in re-engaging countries and young portfolios. Going forward, a country portfolio performance review
            (planned for late FY15) will help to focus on specific challenges. Many of these are shared by develop-
            ment partners, and are being addressed by a joint working group of development partners and the
            Ministry of National Planning and Economic Development. Findings from the Country Portfolio Perfor-
            mance Review (CPPR) will contribute to this joint effort, as well as inform specific WBG actions, including
            a continued emphasis on simple project design, realistic disbursement forecasts, and project lifecycles
            that take into account client capacity constraints.

            149. To help ensure that interventions supported by Government, the WBG and other
            development partners are successfully reaching the poor, the WBG will provide support for
            developing a practical and operational mechanism for identifying poor areas and poor people
            for program purposes (see for example Box 4). Identifying the poor – beyond big picture poverty
            profiling and monitoring – requires a targeting method and operational mechanism to distinguish the
            poor from the non-poor. This will be challenging in a country with widespread poverty and vulnerability
            and significant data gaps. The World Bank Group has strong experience supporting developing coun-
            tries in this process and through a mix of global experience, analytical work and technical assistance can
            support the Government in establishing such a mechanism.

            150. Remaining responsive to a changing environment will require flexibility to change
            priorities and resources to ensure that the WBG remains a strong partner of Myanmar and its
            people during the transition. Changes in policies, the results of reform efforts and progress in the
            peace process could all provide additional opportunities for engagement. Particular care will be taken
                                                                    Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
                                                                Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017   49


to retain flexibility in implementation arrangements. IDA supported operations will not be limited to
those areas where it is easy to work, but designed in ways that reach those people most in need of sup-
port. This will be especially relevant in conflict-affected areas, where regular IDA implementation mo-
dalities and focus on use of country systems might not be applicable due to limited Government reach
and strong presence of non-state service providers linked to ethnic armed groups. Individual projects
will explore differentiated implementation modalities for different target areas and groups, imposing
additional costs for preparation and supervision budgets. Lack of access may also impose constraints to
regular supervision and monitoring, in which case the WBG would look at alternative options, including
third party monitoring, to track results and progress. The risk section includes a more detailed discus-
sion of options in this regard.

151. Activities under the CPF will include a strong focus on capacity building. Early implemen-
tation experience during the ISN revealed significant capacity constraints across a range of Govern-
ment ministries, a point reinforced by the findings of analytical work and issues raised during consulta-
tions for the SCD and CPF. In the Myanmar context, the WBG’s emphasis on implementing through
national systems and Government agencies sets the WBG apart from other donors. Activities under the
CPF will seek to capitalize on that advantage by including a strong focus on capacity building in both
investment and analytical work, including through enhanced implementation support, continuation of
south-south exchanges in ASEAN and with countries which have gone through complex reform pro-
cesses, and linking Myanmar officials to counterparts in other Governments through participation in
regional professional networks, as is currently happening on both community-driven development and
public financial management.

152. One such area for capacity building may be support for the development of a national
framework for environmental and social safeguards. The WBG is exploring such support together
with other development partners, which would be critical to ensure that needed investments in the
coming years proceed in a manner that is consistent with long-term environmental and social sustaina-
bility. There is broad awareness of these issues among a range of stakeholders in Myanmar, but without
an agreed standard there is a risk that planned investments could apply inconsistent standards and face
significant delays. A national standard would also help Government undertake larger development pro-
jects in a way that adequately assesses and mitigates environmental and social impacts. Many sectors
including those relating to climate change and disaster risk management need to expand to include the
application of best practice of environmental and social standards.

153. The CPF will also continue a focus on strengthening knowledge and analysis in support of
the ongoing transition. This is important as the peace process moves forward and opens up new prior-
ity areas for Government and development partners and as the country readies for a potential change
of Government in early 2016. The WBG will continue its efforts to provide timely policy advice in techni-
cal areas where the World Bank has a comparative advantage.

154. In addition to trust funds under implementation, the World Bank may also leverage other
financing. Sources include financing from thematic World Bank-administered trust funds as well as
other development partners whose knowledge, financing and technical assistance complements the
World Bank’s programs. Decisions on seeking or accepting such additional funds would take place on
a case-by-case basis where it is clear that such financing would complement and advance the strategic
objectives of the country program as set out in the CPF.
50   Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.
     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




            3.5.4	 Coordination and partnerships


            155. For the WBG, partnership continues to be at the core of its engagement in Myanmar, in
            recognition of the scope and scale of development challenges and the limited capacity of
            Government. Collaboration with development partners enables the WBG to leverage its engagements
            and focus on its areas of comparative advantage. For example, following decades during which aid to
            Myanmar was delivered largely through parallel systems, the WBG’s engagement, focused on work-
            ing through Government systems and with Government program, has created opportunities for other
            development partners to use WBG investments as platforms to begin supporting Government systems.

            156. The Government is leading donor coordination, and in 2013 adopted, together with
            development partners, the Nay Pyi Taw Accord for Effective Development Cooperation. The Nay
            Pyi Taw Accord articulates principles for aid effectiveness and was affirmed at second Myanmar Devel-
            opment Coordination Forum in Nay Pyi Taw in January 2014. The third forum took place in early Febru-
            ary 2015 in Nay Pyi Taw with the involvement of CSOs and Parliament.

            157. At the technical level, these commitments and annual forums are being translated into
            action through a set of coordination structures aimed at fostering ongoing dialogue between
            the Government of Myanmar and development partners. A set of 16 sector working groups, span-
            ning thematic areas ranging from public financial management, rural development, gender and health,
            bring together Government line ministries and development partners engaged in the sector, including
            emerging donors and non-OECD development partners.

            158. In addition, development partners coordinate among themselves through a Development
            Partner Group (DPG) that brings together all development partners active in Myanmar, and a
            Development Partners Working Committee (DPWC) that brings together a smaller group of the largest
            development partners. The DPWC meets regularly with the DPG and the Ministry of National Planning
            and Economic Development, and thus serves as a channel for ongoing communications.

            159. However, while the past two years have seen the emergence of a large set of coordination
            structures, these remain primarily focused on information sharing, rather than joint
            programming. There also remains a gap between the development activities discussed under these
            structures and the peacebuilding needs in conflict-affected areas, posing a risk of disconnects between
            peacebuilding and sectoral efforts. This is important given that national decisions in for example health
            or education have important links for conflict-affected areas where parallel systems administered by eth-
            nic armed groups are an integral part of negotiations, as well as in areas such as public financial manage-
            ment and decentralization, where decisions taken at the national level will have a direct impact on
            local communities. Issues related to the peace process are discussed at the Peace Donor Support Group,
            where the World Bank Group has worked with partners to take forward the development of principles
            to govern activities in conflict-affected areas.23



            23
               The Peace Donor Support Group (PDSG) was first convened in June 2012 by the Government of Norway at the request of the
            Myanmar President in order to provide a common platform for dialogue between the donor community and the Government of
            Myanmar, and to better coordinate the international community’s support to peace in general and the provision of aid in conflict-
            affected areas. Initially composed of Norway, Australia, the United Kingdom, the European Union, the United Nations, and the
            World Bank, in 2013 the US, Japan and Switzerland were also invited to join.

   At the initiation of the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries and Rural Development, the Government in early 2014 created a Consor-
tium of Development Partners to support the Government’s Rural Development Strategic Framework. Co-chaired by the UK and
the World Bank, development partner participants include most members of the Sector Working Group on Agriculture.
In addition, at the request of the Ministry of Transport (who hold the mandate for water management in Myanmar) the WBG and
the Netherlands created an informal sector working group on water resources which has met periodically since October 2013.
Participants have included representatives of Australia, Denmark, the EU, Germany, JICA, KOICA, Norway, Sweden, Switzerland,
the US, UK, ADB, UNDP, FAO, NGOs, INGOS and the private sector.

            160. The WBG also seeks to foster joint operational engagement between Government and
            development partners by creating platforms for joint investment and analytical work. These
            allow other development partners to rely on the World Bank Group’s established fiduciary, procurement
            and other controls, providing reassurance as donors begin to provide financing directly to Government
            in support of Government systems. Proposed work to support the development of a mechanism to
            target poor areas and poor people could similarly provide a platform that would help Government and
            development partners ensure that resources reach the poor. Recent examples of cooperation include:

               •	   National Community Driven Development Program: The World Bank is working with Italian
                    Development Cooperation (IDC) on the implementation of a proposed €20 million concessional
                    loan by the Government of Italy to Myanmar to support geographic expansion of the national
                    CDD program, developed and launched with IDA financing and with the Japan Trust Fund for
                    Social Development on a US$11 million grant to scale up the program.

               •	   Public Financial Management: Alongside a US$30 million IDA credit approved in April 2014,
                    Australia (US$8.5 million) and the UK (US$16.5 million) are co-financing this engagement to sup-
                    port efficient, accountable and responsive delivery of public services. Denmark is also support-
                    ing this agenda and overall public administration reform through a grant of US$5.6 million.

               •	   Education: The Decentralizing Funding to Schools Project will include an US$80 million IDA
                    credit and a US$20 million grant from the Government of Australia.

161. This CPF outlines a broad range of activities over a period of significant change in Myanmar.
While individual engagements undertaken under the CPF will be evaluated against their specific results
frameworks, an early Performance and Learning Review is planned for late FY16 to ensure that the WBG
program remains aligned within the changing country context and fit for delivery.




  Box 6: The Myanmar “Umbrella” Multi Donor Trust Fund

  The Myanmar Government has taken the lead in donor coordination as it seeks to effectively use an increased
  amount of aid flows, including those using Government systems. The WBG has supported this, including by
  creating platforms in its work that other donors can use for their financing in line with good principles for
  development assistance. The Myanmar Partnership Multi Donor Trust Fund (MMTF), designed jointly with the
  UK Department for International Development (DFID) and the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and
  Trade (DFAT), was established in 2014 as a country-level WBG trust fund with initial contributions of US$50 mil-
  lion. It provides a vehicle for development partners to work collaboratively to support Government develop-
  ment priorities and the WBG program in Myanmar. In late 2014, Denmark also became a donor to the MMTF.

  By establishing a single mechanism for donors to work with the World Bank Group, the MMTF minimizes trans-
  action costs for donors, Government and the WBG. In addition, as members of the Steering Committee, Gov-
  ernment counterparts are able to ensure alignment of donor activities with the Government’s development
  priorities. Finally, and in keeping with the emphasis placed on knowledge, the MMTF allows for financing and
  co-financing for both projects, analytical work, and joint technical assistance across all entities of the World
  Bank Group. The initial design of the MMTF created four windows (social development and inclusion; insti-
  tutional transformation; enhanced implementation support; and private sector development) but provides
  flexibility to allow for the establishment of additional windows as necessary.

  Financing approved from the MMTF to date include (i) US$30.6 million to co-finance the IDA credit supporting
  reform of Myanmar’s public financial management system, (ii) US$22 million in co-financing for the IDA credit
  supporting the school grant and stipends program; and (iii) approximately US$600,000 to support improve-
  ments in the investment climate, to be implemented by IFC.

IV. ASSESSING, MANAGING AND MITIGATING RISKS
    TO THE CPF PROGRAM

162. Myanmar’s ongoing transition presents a unique opportunity for the country to move to
inclusion, empowerment, openness and integration. At the same time, these shifts present signifi-
cant risks, and there is a continued risk that conflict might reemerge before domestic institutions are
ready to mediate competing demands. Notably, the 2011 WDR on Conflict, Security and Development
found that creating legitimate institutions which can prevent repeated violence takes significant time,
often generations, with even the fastest-transforming countries having taken between 15 and 30 years
to raise their institutional performance from that of a state in transition today to that of a functioning,
institutionalized state.25 Yet this CPF is grounded in the recognition that the risks involved, while high,
are outweighed by the opportunities presented by the transition. The WBG will focus on supporting
these opportunities, despite associated risks, rather than on limiting our engagement to only those
areas where risks can be eliminated.

163. The WBG’s new framework for operations risk management is based on the principle that
risks should be assessed based on their impact on development results associated with the
operational engagement. A core element of the new approach is to develop and regularly update
operations risk ratings by using the Standardized Operations Risk-rating Tool (SORT), which will be used
proactively in reviews and decision-making processes. In addition to the eight risk categories provided
by the framework, the CPF includes risks associated with lack of data, which have significant conse-
quences for the WBG’s ability to design projects and monitor results.

164. Many of the risks to achieving development objectives outlined in the CPF are associated
with the ongoing transitions. Their potential impact on the proposed program could be significant.
In particular, the CPF recognizes the following country risks as critical for the operational engagement:

     •	    Political risks and the continued fragility of reforms. The 2015 elections may test political
           compromises reached over the past three years, including around the eligibility for high office
           of the leader of the opposition. Political risks associated with the elections include a polarization
           among stakeholders, policy discontinuity, and a slow-down in reforms.

     •	    Conflict risks. The ongoing peace process has achieved a significant reduction in armed conflict
           and built trust with a wide group of ethnic armed groups. However, conflict continues in Kachin
           and northern Shan State and a wider return to conflict remains a possibility. Moreover, there
           is a risk that over the course of the peace process, internal division may emerge among armed
           groups with the possible emergence of smaller conflicts or insecurity.

     •	    Social inclusion. With the advent of increased civil and political freedoms, including of tradi-
           tional and social media, previously latent religious and ethnic tensions have surfaced, including
           incidents of violence affecting, in particular, the country’s Muslim minorities.

     Country Partnership Framework for the period 2015-2017




                 •	   Governance risks are high, reflecting a legacy of lack of transparency and weak capacity
                      throughout the public and much of the private sector.

                 •	   Economic risks. Global economic developments, including volatile oil and gas prices, pose a
                      significant risk. Politically-driven spending pressures may translate into fiscal risks. In the context
                      of the entry of new players, both foreign and domestic, in Myanmar’s private sector, the Govern-
                      ment’s limited capacity to enforce regulations and respond to shocks creates new vulnerabilities
                      for the economy.

                 •	   Disaster risk: Myanmar is among the world’s countries most vulnerable to natural disasters
                      and has suffered through several devastating cyclones, including Cyclone Nargis in 2008, which
                      killed about 140,000 people. Natural disasters and the impact of climate change are likely to rep-
                      resent an increasing challenge for Myanmar given the importance of agriculture for livelihoods.

            165. There are at least two implications from the above risk review. First, as noted above, many
            risks are largely outside the control of the WBG. As such, the focus will be less on actions to mitigate and
            more on managing these risks – i.e. accepting the risks and adapting and sequencing the WBG program
            accordingly to reflect the dynamics of the transition, including continuing engagement with a wide
            range of political leaders and broad-based consultations.

            166. Second, for those risks where the WBG can play a mitigation role, the first priority will be to
            do no harm.26 External actors could exacerbate risks by moving too far or too fast in certain areas before
            these have been sufficiently resolved through the political process. Relatedly, there is a risk of moving
            too quickly towards normalization of development modalities without considering necessary adapta-
            tions for areas affected by subnational conflict. As discussed above, a critical element of a risk mitigation
            strategy is adapting IDA supported operations to work effectively in conflict-affected areas.

              The DAC OECD Principles for Fragile States and Situations states: “International interventions can inadvertently create societal
            divisions and worsen corruption and abuse, if they are not based on strong conflict and governance analysis, and designed with
            appropriate safeguards.” < http://www.oecd.org/dacfragilestates/>
                                                                    Myanmar: Empowering People for Inclusive Growth.

167. Building on the new WBG framework for risk management, the CPF will maintain
flexibility, balancing risks against opportunities and measuring the risks of action against the risks
of non-action. To this end, the CPF proposes to mitigate specific risks on a case-by-case basis, using a
set of guiding criteria that span the portfolio and individual projects:

  •	   Manage risks at portfolio level: Given the magnitude of risks that apply to all WBG activities
       in Myanmar, risks will be analyzed at the portfolio level, in addition to the activity level. This
       approach will facilitate an understanding of the balance of risks and results across the portfolio.

  •	   Calibrate support and use of country systems: One of the key assets the WBG brings to Myan-
       mar – both for Government and for development partners – is its readiness and ability to work
       with and through Government systems. At the same time, the extent of using country systems
       will continue to be governed by a clear understanding of risks, including capacity, governance,
       and fiduciary. In conflict affected areas, WBG supported operations will calibrate the use of coun-
       try systems to avoid contributing to conflict or changing the balance of power at a time of ongo-
       ing political discussions.

  •	   Manage reputational risks: As the WBG program scales up, expectations for the World Bank
       Group’s role in Myanmar will rise. The WBG will communicate clearly on its program, including
       expected results and timing of results from IDA or IFC-supported operations. In addition, the
       WBG will continue to engage with a broad range of stakeholders, given the diversity of views on
       international financing for development activities in Myanmar.

  •	   Consider pacing of reforms: As Myanmar’s transition continues to unfold, the WBG will care-
       fully consider the pace of reform, both to adapt and phase WBG support in line with country
       developments, and to avoid overloading systems with limited institutional capacity. The WBG
       will draw on ongoing analytical and knowledge work to help identify and implement solutions
       that are grounded in country context and represent “best fit” rather than a global template.

168. The WBG plans to monitor conflict and governance-related risks and vulnerabilities to the
WBG partnership with Myanmar systematically over time. Such monitoring is expected to entail
short regular reports on the ongoing transition, which aim at providing a framework for understanding
risks to the portfolio.

4/ Calculations of GNI/capita were done using the World Bank Group’s Atlas Methodology that requires the following kinds of
data: GNI in current prices, GNI in constant prices or the GNI deflator, the SDR deflator as a proxy for world inflation, the nominal
exchange rate, and population. Population figures are based on estimates provided from the UN population division and are
largely consistent with the Government’s preliminary population figure from the recent census. Population figures, and hence
GNI per capita numbers will be revised once the final census results have been released.

Annex 6: Results Framework
  Focus Area 1: Reducing rural poverty

  76% of Myanmar’s poor live in rural areas, where decades of public under-investment and market distortions have severely limited livelihood opportuni-
  ties. The importance of reducing rural poverty is core to the Government’s development strategy: both the Framework for Economic and Social Reform
  and the Rural Development and Poverty Alleviation Strategy recognize the centrality of improving economic opportunities and access to services for rural
  communities throughout Myanmar to unlock the development potential of the country and foster inclusive growth.

  Objective 1.1: Improved power generation and access to electricity

  Intervention Logic
  Two-thirds of the population is not connected to the national electricity grid and lack of reliable electricity is a key constraint to the delivery of important
  services such as health, education and finance for rural populations and for private sector development more broadly. The Government had developed a
  National Electrification Plan to establish an enabling policy and institutional framework for a nationwide electrification program. The proposed National
  Electrification Project is expected to help increase access to electricity for populations currently not connected to the national grid. The ongoing Electric
  Power Project and proposed Myingyan Power Generation Project are expected to contribute to increasing the capacity and efficiency of power generation
  in Myanmar and strengthening the institutional capacity of the Ministry of Electric Power and the Myanmar Electric Power Enterprise. These activities will
  be part of the WBG’s support to the implementation of the National Electrification Plan which also includes IFC advisory services and MIGA guarantees to
  support electricity distribution and generation. Given the magnitude of the infrastructure gaps, this is a long-term engagement that involves an umbrella
  approach with many partners (see para 78) under the coordination of the Myanmar Power Sector Working Group, with the objective indicators below
  reflecting targets to be reached during the CPF period.

  Objective 1.2: Increased productivity in farming and agribusiness

  Intervention Logic
  Half of Myanmar’s poor depend on agriculture for their livelihoods, and agricultural productivity is low, mostly due to poor rice yields compounded
  by an over-dependence on rice. Low yields in turn are a result of a lack of access by farming households to improved agricultural assets, infrastructure
  and services. More productive agriculture would also encourage job creation through agro-processing and trading activities. The World Bank aims to
  increase agricultural productivity in order to have a positive effect on agricultural incomes. The World Bank expects to support an integrated program
  that combines improvements in irrigation and drainage, extension services, and value chain upgrades to increase crop yields and develop a competitive
  rural sector that offers opportunities to all rural households. Alongside analytical work, these initial engagements will pilot new approaches, inform the
  policy dialogue and serve a demonstration effect to facilitate reform across the sector. The World Bank will also support further agricultural productivity
  enhancements by providing agro-meteorological services, facilitating inland water transport for agricultural outputs and enhancing the government’s
  capacity to manage and deliver water resources to farmers.

              Objective 1.3: Improved access to critical infrastructure and services for the rural poor

              Intervention Logic
              Rural villages experience high levels of poverty, have limited access to quality services and infrastructure, and have had little voice in the development
              process. Increased investments in critical infrastructure that can improve access to markets and key services can significantly alter the development path
              by empowering rural communities to increase their production and income. The WBG will scale up the national community-driven development program
              to increase access to basic services for rural communities, including in conflict-affected areas. The program helps increase access to and use of basic infra-
              structure and services (e.g., small feeder roads, foot-paths and bridges, drinking water systems, rehabilitation of schools and health centers) through a par-
              ticipatory approach, while creating a platform for government to deliver infrastructure improvements through a bottom up, participatory approach. The
              scale up of the CDD project is scheduled to run through January 2021, with indicators below reflecting only targets to be reached during the CPF period.

              Intervention Logic
              To ensure long-term sustainability of poverty reduction efforts, it will be important for Myanmar to adopt an integrated approach to the management of
              its natural resources and develop a nationally agreed environmental and social safeguards framework. The proposed WBG support in this area would en-
              tail (i) programmatic analytical work that will (a) strengthen and support the quality and standards of the national institutional and regulatory framework
              capacity for environmental and social assessment, implementation and monitoring and evaluation, public participation and transparency to international
              standards level that will promote sustainable country systems to address environmental risks of the country’s investments programs; and (b) assist the
              GoM to manage environmental risks and challenges of natural resources (such as forests) and develop risk management strategy based on analysis of en-

              development, transport, irrigation and flood control; and (iii) continued support for Myanmar’s implementation of the Extractives Industries Transparency
              Initiative as part of responsible natural resource management.

              Focus Area 2: Investing in People and Effective Institutions for People

              A successful shift to empowerment and inclusion will depend on citizens that are able to make a better future for them. Decades of underinvestment in
              public services (with budget allocations for social services among the lowest in the world) have greatly limited availability and quality of key social services,
              and the ability of state institutions to deliver effectively at the local level. The Government aims to change this, including by setting the country on a path
              to universal healthcare access and increasing budget allocations for social services. This focus area aims to improve access to and the quality of key social
              services to provide citizens with skills and endowments to make a better future for themselves, including by equipping institutions to deliver services to
              people effectively.

              Objective 2.1: Improved capacity to manage public finances and Union-State/Region relations for better service delivery

              Intervention Logic
              Myanmar is a highly centralized country following decades of military rule, and fiscal and functional decentralization is a core issue for more effective
              service delivery at the local level and for the current peace process. The effectiveness and efficacy of the various pathways in ending poverty and boosting
              shared prosperity will depend critically on the capacity of Government to design and implement the right interventions, whether in the form of policy,
              institutional reforms, or investments. WBG support for more effective public institutions is expected to include the continued implementation of an IDA
              operation that supports modernization of public financial management and provides technical assistance to address public administration performance
              constraints in social and economic sectors.

Objective 2.2: Expanded health services and improved health financing, with a focus on maternal, newborn and child health

Intervention Logic:
Health care services in Myanmar are constrained by a combination of limited access and lack of timely and flexible financing for frontline service delivery.
Health outcomes lag significantly behind other countries in the region: infant mortality still stands at 40 per 1,000 live births; each year, about 2,000
pregnant women and 50,000 children die from preventable causes; and for those in the lowest income quintile, only 71 percent of births are delivered by
skilled birth attendants and only 78 percent receive post-natal care. The Government of Myanmar has committed to overcoming poor access to quality
services and low financial risk protection by setting out a path towards Universal Health Coverage. Deliveries with skilled birth attendant and adequate
port-natal care are proxy indicators of improved health financing in townships. IDA supported operations will aim to expand coverage of essential health
services of adequate quality, with a focus on maternal, newborn and child health, in support of Myanmar’s move towards Universal Health Care (UHC).

Objective 2.3: Expanded and improved education coverage and measurement of learning outcomes

Intervention Logic
While school enrollment rates in Myanmar are relatively high, completion rates lag behind the country’s peers. Education, especially in rural areas, had
historically been underfunded, and this has exacerbated inequalities, as poorer and more isolated areas comparatively lack financial means and technical
capacity. Increased access to basic education has the potential to play a critical role to ensuring inclusive growth. The Government is working to increase
retention rates, and IDA investments to support reform of basic education will focus on improving and expanding Myanmar’s existing school grants and
targeted student stipends programs as part of this effort, as well as on the implementation of professional development programs for township and
school officials and periodic early grade reading assessments. The operations will support reforms through (i) expanding the coverage of the stipend pro-
gram and improving operational mechanisms for targeting poor and vulnerable students which would improve retention, (ii) improving the reliability and
transparency of the school grants scheme; and (iii) building the capacity of the Ministry of Education, townships, schools and communities to implement
these programs and monitor their progress.

              Intervention Logic
              Significant data constraints in Myanmar limit an understanding of poverty and related factors, and complicate efforts at targeting interventions, measur-
              ing impact, and applying global experience in policy design and implementation. The WBG will support the GoM to conduct a nationally-representative
              household survey to better understand dimensions of poverty in Myanmar and allow targeting of interventions towards the poor, including a better
              understanding of poverty among Myanmar’s ethnic minorities. The WBG will also continue to support the preparation and implementation of a National
              Strategy for the Development of Statistics, to help Government map and fill critical knowledge gaps. These engagements will be complemented by
              analytical and diagnostic work on key thematic issues as well as on reform sequencing, expected to include trade and agricultural opportunities, land
              governance, social inclusion, ethnicity and gender, migration, labor markets, skills development and job creation, and access to finance in remote areas.

              Focus Area 3: Supporting a dynamic private sector to create jobs

              Sustainably reducing poverty and boosting shared prosperity will involve moving beyond extractive-based to inclusive economic growth that can create
              jobs. This focus area aims to foster inclusive growth and a vibrant private sector that can drive job creation to reduce poverty. In order to sustainably reduce
              poverty for the transitional and traditional poor in Myanmar, jobs outside agriculture will be essential. Yet given that the gas sector is not labor intensive,
              efforts will need to focus on promoting greater private sector investment in non-gas sectors such as manufacturing, mining, tourism, ICT, the financial
              sector, and construction. Creating employment opportunities in and around towns and cities will be critical to ending urban poverty, particularly through
              Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) alongside large firms. Current efforts to open up space for foreign and domestic investors will need to be a priority,
              complemented by facilitation of access to domestic, regional, and international markets. In addition to opening up the economic space, attention will also
              need to focus on removing key constraints related to actual factors of production that are critical to business start-up and increased productivity – such
              as electricity, finance, and ICT.

              Objective 3.1: Improved financial infrastructure and access to finance

              Intervention Logic
              Access to finance in Myanmar is limited, yet critical to promote inclusiveness of growth and empowerment of people. Only 30 percent of Myanmar’s adult
              population has access to financial services provided either by commercial banks or microfinance institutions. The WBG aims to support the implementa-
              tion of the country’s Roadmap for Financial Inclusion by modernizing payment systems, strengthening financial sector intermediaries, fostering new
              financial products, and building capacity of financial sector regulators and supervisors. WBG interventions in the area of financial inclusion would be
              structured in a comprehensive program that is joint between WB, IFC and interested bilateral donors around four areas: (i) modernizing payment systems
              and financial sector infrastructure, (ii) strengthening private financial institutions critical for financial inclusion (microfinance institutions, private banks)
              and transforming select State-owned banks into financially sustainable institutions, (iii) expanding financial instruments and products (SME lending, ag-
              riculture lending, insurance, digital finance, etc.); and (iv) strengthening the capability of the Central Bank of Myanmar and Ministry of Finance to monitor
              the soundness and integrity of the financial system.

     Objective 3.2: Improved enabling environment for private sector investment in productive and services sectors

     Intervention Logic
     Jobs are a pathway out of poverty. Sustained employment generation is premised on a diversified investment base across the real sectors. For Myanmar
     to create more jobs in the non-gas and non-agricultural sectors, continuing with current efforts to open up the space for foreign and domestic investors
     will need to be a priority. The WBG will assist the GoM in creating a business environment that is conducive to private sector investment. This will involve
     improving the legal and regulatory framework to strengthen investor protection, streamlining investment entry procedures and improving the invest-
     ment incentive regime. IFC will undertake additional work aimed at improving the regulatory framework and business environment, including technical
     assistance to Government for a new investment law and support for the Myanmar Business Forum to strengthen public-private dialogue.

     Objective 3.3: Improved capacity to facilitate (and benefit from) trade

     Intervention Logic
     Given its long period of international isolation, to seize increased trade and FDI opportunities, Myanmar will need to be part of the regional and global
     production/value chain networks. Transaction costs for international trade can be reduced through reforms of institutions, policies, and procedures,
     and through applying conflict and gender sensitive approaches. Reforms are needed to address non-tariff measures (NTMs) and border management
     procedures that are bureaucratic and slow and that raise the cost of doing business and discourage the growth of overseas trade. A Diagnostic of Trade
     Integration Study (DTIS) will be carried out to identify opportunities for improving Myanmar’s capacities to benefit from trade. Technical work following on
     the DTIS could include additional knowledge work on trade and transport facilitation assessments, customs modernization, and sector specific technical
     assistance. These engagements would build on the WBG investment climate assessment, which will support a policy dialogue on critical bottlenecks for
     the private sector. Advisory services in key sectors, including agriculture and tourism, will enhance Myanmar’s ability to benefit from regional integration
     and support development in key value chains.

     Intervention Logic
     Access to telephone services was estimated at 20 percent in 2014 while internet penetration stood at 10 percent, the lowest rates in Southeast Asia.
     Increased access to ICT will be critical for Myanmar to seize increased trade and FDI opportunities, use technology for leapfrogging on issues such as in-
     creased access to finance, and support a vibrant private sector. The WBG will continue implementation of the Telecommunications Sector Reform Project,
     which will support regulatory reforms which will enable the licensing of new private operators to lower the cost of doing business and foster competition
     leading to lower prices, increased access and improved quality of services. The project will also build capacity of public sector institutions, including in bet-
     ter spectrum management and developing e-government applications. Finally, it will contribute to the extension of basic telecommunications services
     into remote and poor rural communities through a universal access program.

Annex 8. World Bank Group CPF Consultations in Myanmar
1. Between February and August 2014, the World Bank Group hosted a series of public consulta-
tions across Myanmar and outside the country to seek inputs on Myanmar’s development chal-
lenges and the World Bank Group’s strategy from a broad range of government, civil society,
development partner and private sector participants. The first round of these consultations, be-
tween February and June, focused on identifying and prioritizing the key development opportunities
to eliminating extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity in Myanmar to feed into the Systematic
Country Diagnostic and took place between February and June 2014 with 15 events in six locations. A
second round of consultations, focused specifically on the CPF, took place between July and August
2014 and sought input on which of the development priorities for Myanmar identified in the SCD the
WBG should address. A summary of these consultations is available on the World Bank website. These
consultations complemented an ongoing dialogue with stakeholders on the World Bank Group’s en-
gagement in Myanmar which will continue throughout the CPF’s implementation.

2. The consultations on the CPF included 16 meetings in eight locations bringing together over
600 people representing some 380 organizations from civil society, government, development
partners, private sector, media and researchers. The meetings were held in five locations within My-
anmar (Nay Pyi Taw, Hpa An, Yangon, Mandalay, and Taunggyi), two in Thailand (Chiang Mai and Mae
Sot) and one in the US (Washington, DC). Online feedback was also solicited through the WBG Myanmar
website. Written inputs were received from a number of organizations, including Oxfam, Human Rights
Watch, Global Witness, and Myanmar IFI Watch.

3. The consultations adopted an approach and standards agreed on upfront in discussions with
a group of civil society representatives. Invitation packages were sent out at least two weeks in ad-
vance of each event, included summaries of the previous round of consultations, background informa-
tion on the WBG and its activities in Myanmar, and information on the key content of the consultation,
in English and Myanmar in order to enable participants to prepare for the event. Based on feedback
from the first round of consultations on the SCD, pre-visits were undertaken to each of the locations
ahead of the consultations to assist with identifying invitees and distributing paper invitations and
hard copies of materials given the difficulty of some participants to access materials via email or online.
These efforts resulted in significantly increased participation at consultations on the CPF.

4. Key recommendations, concerns and ideas discussed during the consultations were largely
aligned with priority areas of the proposed WBG program. In particular, participants noted the
importance of agricultural development (noting that between 60 and 70 percent of the popula-
tion in Myanmar are dependent on agriculture) as well as the provision of basic health and education
services. Participants also noted the need for comprehensive, long-term engagements in these areas.

5. Many participants also stressed the importance of capacity building for government—particu-
larly in regard to transparency and accountability—and urged WBG support in this area. Several
participants suggested that the WBG should prioritize strengthening governance of natural resources
given the importance of this sector on the economy. A number of participants pointed to the need to
improve public financial management, including the need to increase tax revenue. They also called on
the World Bank Group to support the development of the banking system in Myanmar to increase ac-
cess to finance and to control inflation.

            6. Participants also offered suggestions related to support for the development of the private
            sector in Myanmar. This included improved access to international markets, increased supply of elec-
            tricity and support for the development of legislation to promote trade and encourage foreign invest-
            ment. The issue of land governance came up frequently. Some stakeholders drew attention to the fact
            that foreign direct investment and overall economic development could increase the value of land and
            the potential for land confiscation and landlessness at a time when proper land governance legislation
            and systems are not yet in place. For example, while many participants recommended the World Bank
            Group support for the development of the telecommunications sector, they also urged the World Bank
            Group to carefully assess the risks to land rights involved in building communications infrastructure.
            Several participants also recommended that even small scale hydro-power production must be avoid-
            ed in contested areas during the peace process, as this could disrupt the process.

            7. The most common response on the question of what the WBG should not do in Myanmar was
            supporting Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). Many participants felt that the legal framework needed
            to protect local organizations and workers, and to ensure that FDI met environmental and social stand-
            ards, was not yet in place, and suggested the WBG should instead work to ‘level the playing field’ and
            support the development of SMEs through capacity development programs and improving access to
            finance.

            8. Discussions during the consultations also focused on how the WBG should engage in Myan-
            mar going forward. Specifically, participants emphasized the importance of adhering to international
            standards and principles on all WBG programs and investments in Myanmar. Some stakeholders sug-
            gested that the WBG has the opportunity to – and should – step up to play a leadership role in the de-
            velopment process in Myanmar, including through donor coordination. Several participants noted the
            importance of ensuring that all WBG projects are conflict sensitive, including through the conduct of
            conflict analysis. The primary focus of discussions on conflict sensitivity was on operations in contested
            areas. Several participants underlined that the WBG should recognize the importance and effectiveness
            of and provide support to alternative public services provided by community-based groups, CSOs, the
            border-based health and education programs, monastic education programs and INGOs. Concerns re-
            lated to the problems in Rakhine State and the rise of religious nationalism in Myanmar in general, were
            also raised. Finally, participants emphasized the need for the WBG to ensure adequate staff in country
            to effectively manage the work it undertakes given the complexities of the country context.
