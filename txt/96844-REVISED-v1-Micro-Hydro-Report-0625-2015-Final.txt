l	 Incremental tariff is the difference between the price at which power is purchased by the mini-grid operator (NPR 4.5/kWh), from the MHPs (operating as IPPs in the

   mini-grid) and the selling price to the consumer (NPR 9.5/kWh).
l	 Incremental O&M is taken at 2 percent of capex.

l	 Incremental salaries are salaries incurred by the mini-grid operator, which includes 3 support staff and 1 manager. For simplicity sake, it is assumed that there is no

   increase in salary costs to individual MHPs.
l	 Interest on loan is taken at 14 percent. Debt equity ratio is 20:80.

Estimation of Avoided CO2 Emissions and Economic Benefit from
Sale of CERs

Following the Nepal MHP CDM Project Design Document, the avoided emissions from an micro hydropower
project (in tons of CO2/year) and the value of the associated CERs are calculated as follows:                 115

Annual energy generation (in kWh per year) = Installed Capacity x Plant Load Factor x 24 hours x 365 days

Average technical distribution losses = 10%

CO2 emission coefficient for displaced fuel = 0.9 kg CO2eq/kWh

Avoided CO2 emissions = 	 Annual energy generation / (1 – Average technical distribution losses)) x (0.9 kg
CO2eq/kWh) x (1/1000)

CER price = US$7 per ton of CO2

Economic benefit = Avoided CO2 emissions x CER price

  	 Cost of generation varies with the size of the plant. Larger plants enjoy considerable scales of economy. But energy regulators routinely club micro/mini
    hydropower plants with SHPs (usually up to 5 MW) while determining tariff on a cost+RoE basis. This tends to make the tariffs a little less attractive to MHPs.
