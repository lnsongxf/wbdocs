This poverty map is a labor of love, the fruit of a very productive collaboration between the
Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS) and the World Bank. The granular under-
standing of the relationship between the unique fragmented geography of the Palestinian
territories, and its poverty, health and education and important labor market outcomes is
the result of the combined inputs and hard work of many over the last three years. It is our
sincere hope that the data, analysis, and maps presented in this report are useful for pol-
icy and program design and targeting for the Palestinian Authority and for development
partners. The poverty map was officially launched on June 27, 2013 by the PCBS, and was
presided over by H.E. the Prime Minister.

1   Background and Context

    Country Context

    The Palestinian Territories have a uniquely fragmented geography, characterized by the
    isolation of Gaza from the rest of the world, and the man-made barriers to mobility within
    the West Bank. The internal mobility restrictions imposed by Israel, unique to the West
    Bank, play an important role in explaining spatial variations in outcomes within the West
    Bank. This is strikingly analogous to the role of Gaza’s external barriers in explaining the
    divergence between the West Bank and Gaza. These have consequences for poverty and
    economic development. Detailed analysis using a series of labor force and household
    surveys were undertaken as part of the West Bank and Gaza Poverty and Inclusion As-
    sessment, Coping with Conflict?. The analysis revealed that over the last decade, internal
    and external barriers have been associated with tremendous constraints to growth and
    investment, which is evident in high rates of unemployment, especially in Gaza and among
    women and youth.


    Over the same period, the territories have also witnessed large and widening gaps in pover-
    ty and labor market outcomes between the two territories of the West Bank and Gaza. Argu-
    ably, one of the most important reasons for this divergence is the external mobility restric-
    tions imposed on Gaza, which has been entirely “closed” with almost all movements across
    the border controlled by Israel. In practice, this means that few people and a limited number
    of goods are allowed to travel in and out; in particular, many inputs for commercial produc-
    tion are prohibited from entering the area.1 The lack of inputs and lack of access to markets
    have resulted in a virtual shut-down of the private sector, which in turn, has been associated
    with high levels of unemployment, under employment and higher rates of poverty in Gaza.


    The West Bank too is hampered by mobility restrictions, but of a different kind than Gaza.
    The West Bank is controlled by internal barriers in the form of road closures as well as exter-
    nal barriers. Goods and services still make it across the border, but transportation within the
    area is restricted and often encounters significant delays.2 As in Gaza, the mobility restric-
    tions hamper the growth potential of the private sector, albeit to a lesser extent. What is

2              Poverty Mapping: Methodology

Methodology
The selection of the specific poverty mapping methodology is critical; numerous methods are available
and have been documented by Bigman and Deichmann (2000). A method for Small Area Estimation (SAE)
of poverty rates developed by Elbers et al. (2003) (henceforth referred to as ELL) has gained popularity
amongst development practitioners around the world.


This Palestinian poverty map implements the SAE method developed by ELL. It imputes consumption levels
into census households based on a consumption model estimated from the household survey. In order for
this to be possible, the consumption model must include explanatory variables (household and individual
characteristics) that are available in both the census and the survey. By applying the estimated coefficients to
the “common” variables from the census data, consumption expenditures of census households are imputed.
Poverty and inequality statistics for small areas are then calculated with the imputed consumption of census
households.


One advantage of this method is that it not only estimates poverty incidence but also estimates standard
errors of poverty estimates. Since poverty estimates are computed based on imputed consumption, they
cannot escape imputation errors, and these errors are reflected in the standard errors. ELL analyzed the
properties of such imputation errors in detail and derived a procedure to compute standard errors of pover-
ty estimates. More details on the methodology are described in Box 1.


Main Data Sources and Technical Challenges

The Palestinian poverty map uses unit record Palestine Expenditure and Consumption Survey (PECS 2009)
and the General Census of Population and Housing (2007). The census data covered roughly half a million
households, while the household survey covered around 3,566 households in 2009. A wide range of house-
hold information was collected including educational attainments, labor activities and occupation, and
employment and housing conditions. As is the practice in all countries, the General Census of Population
and Housing did not include household consumption and income levels, but its wide coverage of household

3   Modeling

    Building the Model
    The first stage in setting up the model was the identification of variables common to the
    census and survey that were also important correlates or predictors of poverty. These form
    the potential pool of candidate variables for the consumption model and included:


     Labor market indicators: Working-age males, working-age females, status of the head
       of the household with respect to the labor force, economic activity of the head of the
       household.
     Demographic indicators: The number of adult males in the household, the number of
       adult females in the household, sex of the head of the household, the age of the head
       of the household, marital status head of household, the average household size, depen-
       dency ratio.
     Education indicators: Educational level of the head of the household, the highest num-
       ber of years of schooling for household members.
     Health indicators: The number of individuals with disabilities in the household.
     Housing Indicators: Housing type, household density (number of household members
       per room), home ownership, durable goods such as (car, TV, cooking stove, etc.).


    The model was constructed in an iterative way using an OLS regression, adding one variable
    at a time. At each addition, every variable was tested for significance and retained in the
    model only if significant, and dropped otherwise. This process was then revised again based
    on whether these variables were significant in a GLS regression. The resulting model was
    then tested for stability by making sure the coefficients do not change dramatically with the
    addition or removal of any one variable. For a list of the variables that are used in each of
    the final models, please refer to the section “Models”.

    A Fragmented Landscape
    We begin by describing the physical landscape of the Palestinian territories, paying special
    attention to man-made barriers to movement and access. Following the Oslo Accords in
    1993, the territories were divided into three areas: A, B and C. In Area A, which comprises
    heavily populated cities and towns, the Palestinian Authority (PA) has civil and security con-
    trol. The PA has civil autonomy but no security control in Area B; and no control whatsoever
    in Area C. More than half of the physical territory of the West Bank lies in Area C.
                                                               Map 2 illustrates these three areas

                                First, the control of the Palestinian

                                within the West Bank. Secondly,
                                moving between these ‘islands’ is
                                further restricted by the presence
                                of various types of checkpoints
                                and barriers. Finally, Gaza remains
                                isolated from the West Bank, with
                                restrictions in place on the move-

of checkpoints around the city that
have been in place since the second
Intifada have effectively sealed it
off from the rest of the West Bank.
Elevated restrictions can also be
observed around East Jerusalem, in
the Jordan Valley region (especially
the northern part), parts of the He-
bron governorate, and the northern
border of the Bethlehem gover-
norate which acts as a gateway
between the north and the south of
the West Bank.

When compared with the poverty
map, it is evident that poverty is
correlated with more restricted
areas when they overlap with area
C. Localities in Hebron governorate
and the Jordan valley that have high
poverty rates and lie in area C also

to be almost uniformly dark in Map

makers may need more nuanced

each panel represents a ranking

poverty in the West Bank and Gaza,

Another measure of the same
theme is the density of poverty, or
pockets where a large number of
poor people are concentrated with-
in a certain area. The import of this
indicator is that policies targeted
solely based on headcount rates
could miss these types of high-den-
sity areas because their poverty
headcount rates may not be as
high. Large population centers,

that have less than primary edu-
cation. When compared with the
poverty map, it is evident that in the
West Bank, localities where more
heads of household have low levels
of education are more likely to also
be poor. In Gaza by contrast, this
relationship between poverty and
education does not appear to hold
as strongly.


One possible explanation for the
latter is the severe lack of employ-
ment opportunities in Gaza, so that
education does not guarantee a
source of earnings. In contrast, the
relatively better economic condi-
tions in the West Bank allow for
some positive returns to education
from the labor market, which are
reflected in household welfare

In the West Bank, irregular wage
employment and self-employment
tend to be correlated with poverty.
Particularly in localities in Ramallah
where the dominant employment
status is regular wage employment,
there is also a very low incidence of
poverty. In contrast, the localities in
Ramallah where self-employment
is the dominant form of employ-
ment are marked by high rates of
poverty. Similarly, in some of the
south-eastern localities of Hebron,
where irregular wage employment
is the dominant employment sta-
tus, a correspondingly high degree
of poverty persists.

5   Conclusion

    Given the fragmented geography of the Palestinian Territories, the visualization of small-ar-
    ea poverty estimates is unique and has posed unique challenges. The presence of man-
    made barriers to mobility, the large parts of the West Bank that lie outside the control of
    the Palestinian Authority, and Gaza’s relative isolation imply that localities and communities
    living a few kilometers apart can have wide disparities in welfare. Even within Hebron, the
    poorest governorate in the West Bank, locality level estimates of poverty range from 14
    percent to a whopping 83 percent. There is also a lot of variation in the number of poor
    people in Hebron governorate—from the heavily populated city of Hebron to small, isolated
    Bedouin communities in the south-eastern part of the governorate.


    The poverty map and estimates should be interpreted in relation to the unique nature of
    restrictions in place. For instance, Hebron city itself is divided into H1 and H2, with the latter
    under the control of the Israeli Defense Forces. The city has 11 permanently manned check-
    points. Many communities in the south eastern part of Hebron lie in large part in area C,
    and the resulting isolation and lack of access to services implies correspondingly high rates
    of poverty. Overall, thus, poverty and vulnerability are linked to and must be understood in
    relation to these types of restrictions.

    The poverty map is a visual illustration of estimated poverty indices at locality level. It is a
    powerful tool for policy makers and provides key information at a level of disaggregation that
    matters to prioritize the use of scarce resources in areas that need it most. It is important to
    remember that these are estimates, and are accompanied by standard errors. Therefore, the
    poverty map is in effect a range of poverty rates for each locality. The better the model and
    the quality of data, the smaller these errors, and the more accurate the estimates are likely to
    be.


    This report also provides cartographic representations of various correlates of poverty, which
    taken together with the poverty map are a striking visual story. These correlations illustrate
    the analysis in the poverty assessment for the West Bank and Gaza, Coping with Conflict?.
    Poverty goes hand in hand with labor market outcomes. Several localities with high levels of
    unemployment also lie in the highest quintile of poverty rates, and vice versa. While edu-
    cation matters in many parts of the West Bank, in Gaza, irrespective of education, poverty
    remains high. A sheer lack of jobs and insecure employment are the main drivers of welfare.

                                                               services such as water and sanitation. As a combined and              may not adequately capture other attributes of poverty or
