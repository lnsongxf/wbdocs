     RURAL COMMUNITIES ACCESS BASIC SERVICES
     AND GOODS IN AFGHANISTAN

In July 2012, the Afghanistan Rural Access Project (ARAP) was approved as a follow-on project to the
National Rural Access Program, launched by the Government of Afghanistan in 2003, to support
rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and livelihoods. ARAP’s development objective is to assist the
government in enabling rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and
facilities through the rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure. ARTF’S total
contribution to ARAP is $207 million. ARAP is co-financed by a World Bank grant of $125 million.




CHALLENGE



FOUR DECADES of conflict and fragility severely damaged the Afghanistan road network at all levels, including main
highways and local access roads. As the nation started to emerge from conflict in 2001, only a tenth of the estimated
130,000 kilometers of the major and rural roads network at that time was in good condition. Rural road rehabilitation is
considered crucial to generate significant employment opportunities, while opening up isolated rural areas to basic services.


Afghanistan has made remarkable progress in rural access with 2,000 kilometers of reconstructed roads since 2002.
Nevertheless, rural livelihood remains very challenging and requires more improvement in access to basic services and
necessities. Roads are a particular challenge as it is estimated that Afghanistan has a tertiary road network of 80,000
kilometers, of which only about 7,000 kilometers are accessible to motor vehicles in all seasons.

 APPROACH


IN 2012, the Afghanistan Rural Access Project (ARAP) was approved as a follow-on project to the National
Emergency Rural Access Program (NRAP), launched by the Government of Afghanistan in 2003, to support
rehabilitation of rural infrastructure and livelihoods. ARAP’s development objective is to assist the government in
enabling rural communities to benefit from all-season road access to basic services and facilities through the
rehabilitation and maintenance of rural access infrastructure.


The project is implemented by two agencies: Ministry of Public Works and Ministry of Rural Rehabilitation and
Development, coordinated by a National Coordination Unit of the Ministry of Finance and supported by an
implementation consultant.

Villagers save time and money

Some 30,000 people are benefiting from having the all-season road, built under ARAP, which
was completed in January 2015. The asphalted Ghra Road has also made it easier for
villagers to access healthcare services. “In the past it took us as long as an hour to take our
patients to a health center. If the patient was in a serious condition, then it was a high risk,”
says Ghra village resident Haji Mohammad Wali, 80. “Now it only takes us 10 minutes to
reach the health center.”

Since Ghra Road was built, transportation
fares and expenses have reduced in the three
villages. “We save both time and money,” says
another villager, Haji Abdullah, 54. “We used
to pay 1,000 afghanis to go to Kandahar city.
Now we only pay 300 afghanis. Cars now
consume only two liters of fuel instead of five
on the trip to the city.”
