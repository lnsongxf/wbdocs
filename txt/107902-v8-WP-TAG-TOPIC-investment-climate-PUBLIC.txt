    because of the lack of appropriate database and software.
    IFC has helped develop a methodology for risk-based in-

 •	 Staff vision and problem analysis. The SFSS was not fully on
    board for a new approach to food safety regulation that
    would put more focus on the role of the private sector,
    and seek to minimize administrative burden while preserv-
    ing and even strengthening effectiveness. Crucially, even
    though the SFSS has a strategy document for food safety
    reform, it is based on a somewhat generic goal of “getting
    closer” to EU regulations. What was needed was a proper
    stock taking of issues, gaps and problems to reach specific
    EU regulations. At the same time there was no clear under-
    standing or agreement that the current system is both bur-
    densome and of limited effectiveness. The interim result
    was a bifurcated scenario with a desire for improved safety
    but a reality where some stakeholders sought to introduce
    fees, fines and a heavier oversight process.

of the reform, to get institutions working and improving their
practices, took several years. To some extent, it is still going
on, as the government has been implementing (since 2010) a
comprehensive inspections reform program that covers food
safety as well as all other issues. The aim is to make inspec-
tions more transparent, more risk based, and to help busi-
nesses comply through better information efforts.

    The high point of reforms so far has been the recent
    adoption of a new Law on Food Safety (voted by Par-
    liament on May 18, 2012). This law continues the
    approximation process by setting forth rules on food
    safety that are directly taken from EU legislation. It also
    foresees the creation of a national food safety agency,
    with both regulatory, and inspections and enforcement
    powers. As such, it can be seen to constitute both a
    final step (to the series of legal changes on the food
    safety side) – and a starting point (for implementation
    work to make this new food safety approach a reality).
