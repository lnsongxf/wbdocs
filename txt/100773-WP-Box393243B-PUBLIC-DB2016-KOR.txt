THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

        Request and obtain proof of ownership of land

        BuildCo must obtain proof of ownership from the Property
        Register to show that BuildCo has the right to construct a
        warehouse on the land. The issuance date stated in the Land
        Registry should be within 3 months prior to the date of
        submitting the application for a building permit. Once the
        application for a building permit and the relevant documents are
        filed with the licensing authority, the authority will forward the        1 day             KRW 1,000

        design drawing to the relevant regulatory agencies, the fire
        department and the sewage department. It is possible to obtain
        proof of ownership (from the Court Registry) immediately after
        applying over the Internet. The fee for issuing certificate of
        registered items is KRW 1,000 for issuance via internet.

        Agency: Property Register



        Purchase National Housing Bonds (NHB)

        To qualify for a building permit, BuildCo must purchase National
        Housing Bonds (NHBs) at any commercial bank. The NHB is
        calculated at a rate ranging from KRW 600.00 to KRW 1,300.00
        per sq. m., depending upon the structure of the warehouse. If the
        warehouse is constructed in steel frame, the rate of KRW
        1,300.00 per sq. m. is applied.

   2                                                                              1 day            KRW 169,078
        BuildCo can either receive the money paid for the NHBs upon
        maturity or sell them at a discount (the discount is 10%). Upon
        purchase, the bank issues a receipt, which must then be
        presented to the Building Authorities. The cost is calculated as
        follows: KRW 1,300.00 x 1300.6 sq. m. = KRW 1,690,780.00.
        However, many sell the NHBs immediately at a discount of 10%,
        which brings the actual cost incurred by the company to KRW
        169,078.00.

      Agency: Commercial bank




      Request and obtain building permit

      BuildCo must submit an application for a building permit to the
      County (Ku) Office of Construction. The application must include:
      • The size of construction lot;
      • Documentation showing BuildCo's ownership or the right to
      use the construction lot; and
      • Basic design drawings, which must specify the approximate
      location of the water pipes, sewage, septic tank, electrical
      facilities, and telephone lines.

      Once the application for the building permit with the relevant
      documents is filed with the licensing authority, this authority
      forwards the design drawings to the relevant regulatory agencies
      (such as the sewerage department and the fire department).
      Thus, it is not necessary for the company to obtain separate
      project clearances from these departments.

      Under the Article 10 of the new Building Code, anyone who
      intends to construct a building may opt for a fast-track
      procedure and apply for an "advance decision regarding building
      permit" before applying for a building permit. If an advance
      decision is obtained for the construction, the builder must
      separately apply for and obtain a building permit for the
      construction. However, when the advance decision is obtained,
3     the relevant approval for the development or re-characterization        9 days     KRW 121,500
      of land (such approval is needed in certain zoning areas under
      several relevant laws) is deemed to be obtained. This effect of
      the advance decision is valid for 2 years from the date of
      issuance, before the builder applies for the building permit itself.

      In addition, it is possible to submit simultaneous applications for
      an advance decision and for the traffic and environment impact
      assessment procedures, and the like, if those procedures are
      necessary. Accordingly, if the builder obtains an advance
      decision before applying for the building permit, the time before
      the construction may be reduced more or less. However, this has
      not worked well in practice and many companies follow the
      traditional way.

      According to the Standard for Civil Petitions Treatment
      published by the Korean Government on December 30, 2005, the
      duration for obtaining a building permit for a two-story, 1,300-
      square-meter building is estimated to be 3 -- 14 days, subject to
      certain circumstances, including whether the work is performed
      by an agent (a certified architect). The duration can take a few
      days longer, as the case may be.

      Before construction work begins, the company informs the
      authority thereof. BuildCo must present a notification
      application, including:

      telephone lines.

      Hire a certified inspector

      A certified inspector conducts inspections throughout the period
      of construction. If the company does not hire a certified
      inspector during construction, there is a penalty of up to 2 years’
      imprisonment or a fine of up to KRW 10 million. The inspector is
      independent of the company. The frequency of inspections
      varies depending on the size and cost of construction. Generally,
      an inspection takes place if the inspector and the company deem
      it necessary. However, in some instances, the contract between
      the company and the inspector contains a clause specifying the
      frequency of inspection. There must be at least two inspections        1 day     KRW 19,146,381

      throughout the construction, during which the construction work
      does not stop.

      The cost of KRW 9,059,980.00 is calculated by multiplying the
      value of the project, KRW 702,324,000.00, with the relevant rate
      of 1.29%, in accordance with the Regulation for Scope of
      Architect Services and Fee Standard.

      When installing drainage facilities in a building, the type, size,
      and other features of the drainage facilities must be reported
      pursuant to the Sewage Act to the Public Sewer Management
      Agency. According to the Act’s enforcement provision, the time         1 day       KRW 40,000

      to complete the inspection should be 14 days, and the cost is
      KRW 40,000.00. There is no penalty for the authorities if the time
      line is missed, but they generally meet the deadline.

      Agency: Public Sewer Management Agency



      * Request and obtain fire inspection certificate

      When BuildCo applies for an occupancy permit, the approval
      authority will ask the Fire Department to inspect the building.        1 day        no charge

      The Fire Department will issue an inspection certificate after

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

      Report the real transaction price

      There is a system of reporting 'real transaction price' in Korea. The
      Parties that are going to enter into an agreement for sale of real
      property should report real transaction price to the Tax Department of
      jurisdictional district office (usually to Gu-Office, in case of there's no Gu:
      to City Hall, etc.) within 60 days after signing the sale agreement. This
      procedure is required to prevent tax evasion.

      Both seller and buyer are in duty of reporting the sale price, which can
      be performed via the website (http://rtms.molit.go.kr/) of the Ministry of
      land, infrastructure and transport.

      After the price of the sale has been reported, the Office of the Tax
      Department issues "the real transaction price report".                            Less than a day
       "The real transaction report" includes:                                              (online

      (i) the identification of both parties;                                             procedure)
      (ii) signing date, intermediate payment date, and remainder payment
      date;
      (iii) the location, parcel number and land category of an agreed real
      estate;
      (iv) the type of real estate and the area of an agreed real estate; and
      (v) the real price of a transaction.

      With this report, the District Tax Office will calculate taxes to be paid as
      below ('real transaction price' of the report can also be the 'purchase
      price').

for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
