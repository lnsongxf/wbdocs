     PREFACE & ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS


     This resource note aims to help United Nations (UN) staff to better understand the World Bank Group
     (WBG) and work more effectively with it in fragile and conflict-affected situations (FCS). It is an introductory
     overview that draws on existing guidance and policies, and compiles—but does not substitute for—key
     resources that should be consulted directly in particular cases.

     For background on the nature and extent of UN–WBG partnership in FCS, including perceptions of the
     cultural and other challenges faced, staff should consult the 2013 Review of the UN–WB Partnership in
     Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations undertaken by S. Demetriou and M. Morrison.

     The guide was written by Mary Morrison and Shani Harris with support from the UN–World Bank Fragility
     and Conflict Partnership Trust Fund. The views expressed are those of the authors and do not necessarily
     represent the views of the United Nations or the WBG or their member or shareholder governments. The
     team is grateful to the following United Nations and WBG staff for their comments and contributions to this
     document and to a parallel version prepared for WBG staff: Betsy Alley, Sharif Baaser, Anja Bille Bahncke,

BOX5: NEW DEAL IMPLEMENTATION—
CAPACITY DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT IN SOMALIA

The United Nations and World Bank in Somalia have achieved a
high degree of cooperation based on strong complementarities
and the need to build on the momentum of the government’s
2013 New Deal Compact. The joint UNDP–WB Capacity Devel-
opment Program addresses the priorities identified in the Com-
pact through capacity injection, civil service management and
ensuring coherent approaches in cross-government functions,
in support of the PSG goal of Inclusive Politics. The UNDP and
WB adopted a common program framework, joint management
and results framework and joint reporting structure, but con-
sidered a joint project document unnecessary. The teams found
that sharing documents and information regularly, as well as fre-
quent outreach and meetings, were key to successful collabora-
tion. They also accepted the different timelines and procedures
of each organization rather than trying to harmonize them and
maintained a clear division of labour, based on comparative ad-
vantages. The United Kingdom, Sweden, Norway and the EU pro-
vided parallel funding.

 BOX 8: ROADS FOR PEACE IN LIBERIA

 Struggling in 2006 to generate employment in areas of Li-
 beria where livelihoods were critical to stabilization and
 devastated infrastructure in need of repair, the United
 Nations and WB collaborated on the labour-intensive re-
 pair of feeder roads through a four-party memorandum
 of understanding (Liberian Ministry of Public Works, WB,
 UNMI and UNDP). UNMIL provided engineering equipment
 for the road repairs, amid insufficient private sector ca-
 pacity, qualified workers and perimeter security, extend-
 ing their standing responsibility to keep supply lines open
 in the areas covered. UNDP managed the project, pro-
 curing materials, managing recruitment and payroll with
 $600,000 from a precursor to the SPF Trust Fund. The
 transport sector expertise of WB staff added to this secu-
 rity-stabilization-development effort. A longer case study

BOX 10: UNITED NATIONS–WORLD BANK GROUP
COLLABORATION IN THE GLOBAL EBOLA RESPONSE

The United Nations and WBG are working closely with governments and other partners
in the affected countries, to support immediate response and planning for recovery. In
2014, the WBG mobilized $518 million for emergency response in Guinea, Liberia and Si-
erra Leone to contain and prevent the spread of infections, provide treatment and care
to those already infected, help communities cope with the economic impact of the crisis
and resume essential health services. The funds were disbursed directly to the countries
affected by the Ebola outbreak and to United Nations implementing agencies. Neigh-
bouring countries are taking preventive measures and reallocating WBG funds under on-
going projects to engage United Nations agencies to support this.


In addition to upstream collaboration on analysis and assessments related to the impact
of the Ebola crisis, the United Nations and WBG worked together to deliver rapid assis-
tance. By December 2014, the WBG had provided over $172 million through the United
Nations (UNICEF, WHO, WFP and UNFPA) from an IDA grant. In early 2015, UNOPS re-
ceived WBG funding to provide logistical services for the deployment of international re-
sponders and medical teams in the three countries. United Nations engagement has been
provided for through supplies and technical assistance agreements (contracts with the
government) under the overall West Africa response plan. WBG funding has supported a
large number of national and regional priorities to curb the epidemic, including UNICEF
shipments of essential supplies and vehicle, to Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone, techni-
cal assistance on infection control and social mobilization; UNFPA delivering motorbikes,
computers and other accessories to support the response; WFP provision of ambulances
and mortuary vehicles, and delivery of more than 4,000 metric tons of food to holding
and treatment centres and quarantined communities in Sierra Leone, reaching at least
300,000 households. UNICEF, WFP, WHO and UNOPS have used WBG funding to provide
urgent inputs to the three countries, as well as technical assistance, training and services,
and supporting the deployment of medical personnel. Further information is here.

BOX 11: UNITED NATIONS–WORLD BANK SUPPORT
FOR JORDANIAN HOST COMMUNITIES

In 2013, the UN–WB Trust Fund approved $150,000 to
jump-start UNDP activities under the Kingdom of Jordan’s
$50 million Emergency Services and Social Resilience pro-
gram, financed by an MDTF with contributions from Can-
ada, the United Kingdom, Switzerland and the WB. The
financing allowed UNDP to begin supporting the municipal-
ities in their community outreach efforts since community
participation was a critical component of the project, the
aim of which was to mitigate the impact of the inflow of
Syrian refugees on Jordanian host communities. UNDP’s
next phase of support will likely be funded directly through
the project via a contract with the Government of Jordan.
It will support the prioritization of projects to be funded in
the second year’s round of municipal grants through com-
munity consultations facilitated by the teams who benefit-
ed from the community outreach support.
