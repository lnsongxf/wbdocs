Doing Business in Spain 2015

Doing Business in Spain 2015 is the ﬁrst subnational report of the Doing
Business series in Spain. It measures business regulations and their enforce-
ment in 17 autonomous communities, 2 autonomous cities and 5 ports.
The autonomous communities, autonomous cities and ports are compared
against each other, and with 188 other economies worldwide.

Comparisons with other economies are based on the indicators in Doing
Business 2015, Going Beyond Eﬃciency, the twelfth in a series of annual re-
ports published by the World Bank Group. The indicators in Doing Business
in Spain 2015 are also comparable with almost 400 cities from 55 econo-
mies benchmarked in other subnational Doing Business studies. All data and
reports are available at www.doingbusiness.org/subnational

Doing Business investigates the regulations that enhance business activ-
ity and those that constrain it. Regulations aﬀecting 4 stages of the life
of a business are measured at the subnational level in Spain: starting a
business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property and trading across borders. The ﬁrst 4 indicators were selected
because they cover areas of local jurisdiction or practice. Trading across
borders was selected because it is relevant for Spain’s international trade
integration.

The indicators are used to analyze economic outcomes and identify what
reforms have worked, where and why. The report also includes a new area
of focus that benchmarks the ease of starting operations for an industrial
small and medium-size company. The data in Doing Business in Spain 2015
are current as of March 1st, 2015. For a more detailed description see the
chapter on About Doing Business and Doing Business in Spain 2015, available
in Spanish at www.doingbusiness.org/Spain

Doing Business in Spain 2015 was requested by the Ministry of Economy
and Competitiveness of Spain and ﬁnanced by ICEX Spain Trade and
Investment with funds from the European Regional Development Fund of
the European Union.

      BOX 1.1 Declaration of responsibility: a paradigm shift

        To make starting commercial activities easier, Law 17 of 2009 introduced the concept of declaration of responsibility or prior
        communication, replacing the previous license or special authorization with a communication, followed by supervision.i An
        entrepreneur may now start a business activity without a license—leaving it up to the local administration to then verify
        and supervise the accuracy of the information provided in the communication. The law establishes a common procedural
        framework and a catalogue of activities that no longer require authorizations across Spain.ii Regions and municipalities
        may expand the scope of the declaration of responsibility to include additional activities and specify the requirements for
        documentation and supervision.

        The impact of the reform is already showing. However, while it is no longer necessary to apply for an operating license to
        start a business in low-risk activities anywhere in Spain,iii implementation diﬀers across cities and regions. For example, in
        Ceuta, an entrepreneur must wait 15 days after notifying the municipality, while in the other cities she can start operating
        immediately. In 7 municipalities the declaration of responsibility is free of charge, while in the others municipal fees apply.

        There are stronger diﬀerences for construction permits. In Barcelona, Las Palmas and Valencia, the ﬁrst occupation
        license is obtained by submitting a declaration of responsibility, while in the other cities a license and inspection are
        still required. To obtain an electricity connection for a commercial warehouse, the national legislation allows a simpliﬁed
        mechanism: the region may authorize an electrical connection after it has been installed, without a previous project ap-
        proval. Nevertheless most regions still require a prior project authorization, with the exception of Catalonia, Extremadura
        and Navarre.iv


        i. The terms declaration of responsibility and prior communication are used imprecisely in the national legislation. In some regions and municipalities, they are diﬀerent concepts,
        or one of the terms is preferred over the other. This report uses both terms indistinctly.
        ii. Since 2009 national legislation has expanded the list of activities subject to a declaration of responsibility.
        iii. Low risk activities are those that are not dangerous, unhealthy, damaging or a nuisance to human beings or the environment.

 BOX 1.2 Law on Market Unity: promoting good regulation and preventing market fragmentation

   To reduce barriers to trade, and inspired by the European common market, the Government of Spain approved a Law on
   Market Unity (Ley 20/2013 de garantía de la unidad de mercado or “LGUM”)i to ensure the free circulation of goods and ser-
   vices throughout Spain and to improve coordination across agencies. It also supports the development of good regulations
   based on the principles of necessity, proportionality and nondiscrimination. However, challenges remain to starting and
   operating a company in Spain. Long procedures, overlapping competencies, excessive regulation and the resulting diﬃcul-
   ties in interpreting laws are some of the obstacles that small and medium entrepreneurs face when setting up a business.

   Doing Business in Spain 2015 ﬁnds signiﬁcant diﬀerences across regions in local regulations and practices to incorporate
   a company and obtain a business license for general commercial (low-risk) activities.ii These diﬀerences are more pro-
   nounced when the business performs (even simple) industrial activities. Starting an industrial small to medium-size ﬁrmiii
   takes on average 4.5 more procedures, 4 more months and costs 6.6% income per capita more than starting one that
   performs low-risk activities.

   It is signiﬁcantly more cumbersome to start a small to medium-size industrial ﬁrm than a company performing general
   commercial activities

      BOX 1.2 (continues from preceding page)

       The proportionality principle is applied diﬀerently across public agencies. For the same industrial activity, 10 municipalities
       require a commercial license, while a declaration of responsibility is suﬃcient in all others. Reasons for requiring a license
       can be contradictory. In Valencia one reason for requiring a prior municipal authorization is that the region also grants an
       environmental authorization for activities that are potentially air-polluting. In contrast, in the Balearic Islands the fact that
       the region is performing an environmental review is precisely why the municipality does not require a separate authorization.
       Similarly, diﬀerent criteria and terms are used to classify the industrial activities that are subject to special authoriza-
       tions.iv In some instances these are “classiﬁed activities,” in others “minor or major permanent activities” or even “activities
       subject to environmental licensing.”

       The regulatory hurdles increase when the activity is more complex. Still, the requirements also diﬀer across locations for
       low-impact and low-risk services.v If an entrepreneur who has already set up operations in one region decides to also oﬀer
       her services in the Canary Islands or in Ceuta and Melilla, she has to register for the local taxes: in the Canary Islands the
       General Indirect Tax (Impuesto General Indirecto Canario, IGIC) and the Tax on Production, Services and Imports (Impuesto
       sobre la Producción, los Servicios y la Importación, IPSI) in Ceuta and Melilla, even though the ﬁrm is already registered to pay
       VAT in the home region. The varying requirements generate transaction costs for the entrepreneur—to manage and obtain
       the relevant information and to comply with the regulation—thereby preventing the entrepreneur from using what she has
       learned in the start-up process in one region in another.

       The Law on Market Unity introduces measures to streamline regulations and creates cooperation and supervision systems.
       It sets up thematic working groups, with representation from the diﬀerent territorial administrations, to identify regulatory
       hurdles and areas where regulations overlap or are contradictory. For instance, one working group focuses on streamlin-
       ing environmental and urban regulations to comply with LGUM’s criteria. The working group submitted a proposal with
       speciﬁc measures and a timeline to the regional and municipal governments for approval. Working groups also coordinate
       tourism policies and standardize regulations for the gambling sector, among others.vi The Council for Market Unity and the
       Committee for the Improvement of Regulation, with representation from all regions, supervises the implementation of the
       LGUM. Complaints and consultation mechanisms have been established to issue rulings and provide guidance.

    Note: The distance to the frontier captures the diﬀerence between the performance of each region and the best observed performance (the frontier) at a global level for the 4 areas
    (starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity and registering property). A region’s distance to the frontier is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0
    represents the lowest performance and 100 the best global practice, or “the frontier.” A higher score denotes a more eﬃcient regulatory environment. The aggregate ranking is based
    on an average of the distance to frontier for the 4 areas. For more details, see the section about Doing Business and Doing Business in Spain 2015 available in Spanish at
