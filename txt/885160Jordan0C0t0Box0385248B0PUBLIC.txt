I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
    Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Jordan
       perceive the Bank;
    Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Jordan regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Jordan;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Jordan;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
              work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Jordan;
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Jordan.
    Use data to help inform Jordan country team’s strategy.
II. Methodology
In June 2013, 254 stakeholders of the World Bank in Jordan were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister;
office of parliamentarian, a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency;
consultants/ contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; bilateral and multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the
financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations; the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; the judiciary branch; and other organizations. A total of 132 stakeholders participated in
the survey (52% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Jordan; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Jordan; and the Bank’s communication
and information sharing in Jordan.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.
A. General Issues Facing Jordan: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Jordan is headed
   in the right direction, what they thought were the top three development priorities in Jordan,
   and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth.
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Jordan, Bank staff preparedness to help
   Jordan solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements regarding
   the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner.
   Respondents were asked to indicate the Bank’s greatest values, greatest weaknesses, the most
   effective instruments in helping reduce poverty in Jordan, with which stakeholder groups the
   Bank should collaborate more, in which sectoral areas the Bank should focus most resources,
   to what extent the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, and to what
   reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

II. Methodology (continued)
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results, the extent to which the Bank meets
   Jordan’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty-four development areas, such as public sector governance/reform,
   energy, job creation/employment, anti-corruption, and poverty reduction.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Jordan’s institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Jordan: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Jordan in the near future and to indicate what the
   Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank,
   that the Bank’s websites are easy to navigate and useful, and that the Bank is responsive to
   information requests. Respondents were also asked to indicate whether they primarily use the
   Bank’s country website or the Bank’s main website and whether they primarily use high
   speed or dial-up Internet connection when visiting a World Bank website.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Jordan, and their geographic location.


When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 260 respondents (39% response rate) who completed the country
survey in FY 2006. All responses to comparable questions across years can be found in
Appendix C (see page 86). Notations and/or charts are included in the body of the report when
the differences between years are worth-noting.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
         For further analyses, respondents from PMUs were combined with
          consultants/contractors working on Bank projects; respondents from private sector
          organizations were combined with respondents from financial sector/private banks;
          respondents from private foundations, NGOs, CBOs, and trade unions were combined
          into the “CSO” category; the few respondents from the office of a minister, local
          governments, bilateral and multilateral agencies, the media, the judiciary branch, and
          other organizations were included in the “Other” category. There were no respondents
          from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a Parliamentarian, or faith-
          based groups.

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Respondents from PMUs and consultants/contractors working on Bank projects indicated
        the highest levels of familiarity with the World Bank, whereas respondents from
        academia/research institutes/think tanks indicated significantly lower levels of
        familiarity.
       Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were significantly, moderately
        correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Jordan, the Bank’s
        relevance to Jordan’s development, and the Bank’s ability to help achieve development
        results in Jordan.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Jordan, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the forty-one specific areas of
effectiveness.
Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Jordan. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at urban development; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Jordan, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at job creation;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector governance/reform;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at health;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at competiveness; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at environmental sustainability.
