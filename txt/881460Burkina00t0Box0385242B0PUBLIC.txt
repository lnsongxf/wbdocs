I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Burkina Faso perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Burkina Faso regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Burkina Faso;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Burkina Faso;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Burkina Faso; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Burkina Faso.

       Use data to help inform the Burkina Faso country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In December 2012 and January 2013, 517 stakeholders of the World Bank in Burkina Faso were
invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or
Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry,
ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World
Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks;
NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government
institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the
judiciary branch. A total of 329 stakeholders participated in the country survey (64%).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Burkina Faso, their overall attitudes toward
the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and activities;
working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Burkina Faso, and the Bank’s
communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues facing Burkina Faso: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Burkina
   Faso was headed in the right or wrong direction, the most important development priorities,
   and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic growth
   in Burkina Faso.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Burkina Faso, Bank staff preparedness, the
   extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda, agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to
   reduce poverty in Burkina Faso, with which groups the Bank should work more in Burkina
   Faso, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the Bank’s level of
   effectiveness across thirty-four development areas, the extent to which the Bank’s work helps
   achieve sustainable development results in Burkina Faso, and the extent to which the Bank
   meets Burkina Faso’s need for financial instruments and knowledge services.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities (i.e., Analysis, Studies, Research, Data,
   Reports, Conferences): Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they consult
   Bank knowledge work and activities in the work they do, the areas on which the Bank should
   focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the
   Bank’s knowledge work and activities, including how significant a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Burkina Faso: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Burkina Faso’s development in the near future and
   to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Burkina Faso.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website and PICs. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s
   Access to Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of
   agreement that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data
   policy. Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how
   to find information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Burkina Faso, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 166 respondents (58% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2009 and the 105 respondents (50% response rate) who completed the survey in
FY 2004. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the office of a Minister were
        combined with those from the office of the President/Prime Minister, consultants working
        on Bank-supported projects were combined with those from PMUs, respondents from
        multilateral agencies were combined with those from bilateral agencies, respondents from
        the financial sector/private banks were combined with those from the private sector,
        respondents from private foundations, CBOs, NGOs, trade unions, and faith-based groups
        were combined into a “CSO” category, and the few academic respondents were included
        in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 6.2; this was
        significantly higher than the mean rating received in the FY ’09 country survey (5.4), but
        significantly lower than the mean rating received in the FY ’04 country survey (7.2) .
             Respondents from independent government institutions, PMUs/consultants on
                Bank projects, and those from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister
                and the media had the highest levels of familiarity with the World Bank whereas
                respondents from CSOs, the private sector/financial sector/private banks, and
                employees of ministries had significantly lower levels of familiarity.
             Respondents across geographic locations had statistically similar levels of
                familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
                significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
                effectiveness in Burkina Faso, and significantly, moderately correlated with the
                Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results, and the Bank’s
                relevance to Burkina Faso’s development.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in just three of these thirty-four development areas.

             Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects had the highest
              ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness at “Gender” whereas respondents from the
              office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister, private sector/financial sector/
              private banks, and the media had significantly lower ratings.

             Respondents from PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects and the office
              of the President/Prime Minister/Minister had the highest ratings for the Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Water and sanitation” whereas respondents from private
              sector/financial sector/ private banks, independent government institutions, and
              the media had significantly lower ratings.

             Employees of ministries/implementation agencies and respondents from
              PMUs/consultants on Bank-supported projects, local government, and
              independent government institutions had the highest ratings for the Bank’s
              effectiveness at “Disaster management” whereas respondents from bilateral or
              multilateral agencies and the media had significantly lower ratings.


       As shown on the next page, respondents in this year’s country survey had significantly
        higher ratings of the Bank’s effectiveness across several of these development areas
        compared to respondents from the FY ’09 country survey.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Burkina Faso, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-four specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help ac hieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Burkina Faso. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at energy;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at rural development.
             Of note, the areas determined to be key drivers of the Bank’s overall effectiveness
              in the FY ’09 country survey were:
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the health sector;
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to bring about economic growth; and
                o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to reduce poverty.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related
        to perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Burkina Faso, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers
        of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results.
        The areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at agricultural development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at food security; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth.

VII. World Bank Knowledge and Instruments

Knowledge: Frequency of Use

       Respondents from the office of the President/Prime Minister/Minister, PMUs/consultants
        on Bank-supported projects, the media, and bilateral or multilateral agencies had

stakeholders. With this understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies,
outreach and programs that support development in Burkina Faso. The World Bank commissioned an
independent firm to oversee the logistics of this effort in Burkina Faso. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that
most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank.
