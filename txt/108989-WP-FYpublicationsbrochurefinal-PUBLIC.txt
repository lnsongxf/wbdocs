INTRODUCING THE 2ND ANNUAL
Knowledge in Action: Publications Update

We are very pleased to present the 2016 edition of Knowledge in Action: Publications Update, which highlights key
resources authored by World Bank Group staff and partners of the Trade and Competitiveness (T&C) global practice.
T&C is committed to helping countries develop more dynamic and integrated economies by expanding market opportunities
and enabling private initiative. Our work focuses on strengthening product markets through policies and programs designed
to improve the investment climate, boost trade, promote competition, build sector competitiveness, and foster innovation
and entrepreneurship.
The publications featured here, a portion of the total collection, illustrate the essential role of knowledge creation and
sharing in how we work to deliver for clients in developing countries. T&C offers interdisciplinary, cross-practice analytics
within an integrated package of advisory, financial, and convening services. Our projects are supported within T&C by a
robust knowledge flow, intensive learning, and a culture of innovation. Knowledge exchanges with partners—within the
Bank Group, the private sector, and the international community—are an important source of new ideas and approaches.
We invite you to explore the substance of T&C’s work in private sector development through the empirical evidence, on-the-
ground perspectives, and diverse solutions conveyed in our publications. This edition reflects a full range of topics, and we
hope you’ll find the subjects relevant and the information useful.

    COMPETITION   How Competition Affects the
                  Distribution of Welfare
                  Tania Begazo Gomez and Sara Nyman
                  A literature review shows competition
                  policy reforms can deliver benefits
                  for the poorest households and
                  improve income distribution. A
                  lack of competition in food markets
                  hurts the poorest households the
                  most. Competition in input markets
                  and between buyers helps farmers
                  and small businesses. And more
                  competitive markets bolster job growth
                  over the longer term. (2016)

                  over time and across countries and

After sharply declining in the first half
of 2015, world trade began to grow,
albeit at a slow pace. Recent trade
developments should be seen in the
context of a deceleration in trade
growth since the early 2000s, and
particularly since the global financial
crisis. These developments reflected
old and new cyclical factors as well
as enduring structural determinants,
such as the maturation of global value
chains and the slower pace of trade
liberalization. (2016)
