methodology was used in this study as is takes into account significant income growth in Colombia over the last decade and an expansion
of the air quality monitoring network (and populations of cities with monitoring data are included in the 2010 analysis, whereas in 2002
an extrapolation was used for cities without monitoring networks). About half of the costs are due to population exposure to air pollution

due to air pollution in Bogotá alone would have been 7% higher in 2010 had air quality not improved.

     1  Direct comparison between estimates in 2002 and 2010 should be made with caution. Methodology of environmental health costs quantifica-

     tion significantly improved since 2002 in terms of capturing health impacts of pollution by PM2.5 and valuation of mortality for middle-income coun-
     tries. Furthermore, the air quality monitoring network expanded in Colombia, so it was possible to generate more accurate results in the current
     study using the revised methodology and more accurate estimates of population exposure to pollution based on monitored data instead of extrap-
     olations in cities with no monitoring data, as was done in the earlier study for 2002. Lastly, recent literature concurs that Human Capital Approach
     (HCA)—the valuation method used in the earlier study for an adult mortality risk valuation—should not be used in a situation with a substantial GDP
     per capita growth, which has occurred in Colombia since then. To assess the benefits of an improvement in air quality observed in Bogotá since
     2002, sensitivity analysis was carried out. It shows the changes in mortality and morbidity and the associated costs in Bogotá in two cases: a high
     concentration scenario with the average levels of PM10 measured in Bogotá in 2002, and a low concentration scenario with the levels measured
     in 2012. It is assumed that the ratio of PM2.5 to PM10, with the former being the pollutant due to which the health damages occur—is between 40
     and 60%, and the midpoint of 50% is used in this calculation. It is estimated that 200 additional mortality cases would have occurred in Bogotá
     had the pollution level remained unchanged compared with the 2002 level; and 440 fewer mortality cases would have occurred, ceteris paribus,
     with a concentration level on average equal to 48 µg/m3 (i.e., the level measured in 2012). Thus, the set of policy measures, including the intro-
     duction and enforcement of more stringent fuel quality standards in Bogotá and other measures, and which led to the lower measured levels of
     PM10 in Bogotá, resulted in a reduction of mortality cases in Bogotá by 7% in 2010 relative to what they would have been had air quality not im-
     proved. A further improvement in air quality in 2012 resulted in a reduction of mortality cases in Bogotá by 16% compared with the baseline sce-
     nario. For further details about the methodological differences between the 2002 and 2010 studies, see Annex 3.

     Note: For Colombia, the estimates of the costs of urban air pollution for 2002 and 2010 shown above are not directly comparable as a
     slightly different methodology was used in this study as is takes into account significant income growth in Colombia over the last decade
     and an expansion of the air quality monitoring network (and populations of cities with monitoring data are included in the 2010 analy-
     sis, whereas in 2002 an extrapolation was used for cities without monitoring networks). About half of the costs are due to population ex-
     posure to air pollution in Bogotá, and air quality has improved there since 2002. Sensitivity analysis reveals that, keeping all other fac-
     tors constant, health costs due to air pollution in Bogotá alone would have been 7 percent higher in 2010 had air quality not improved.

                                     Box 1  Bogotá’s Local Air Quality Management Policies

          The local government in Bogotá has made significant efforts in the recent years to improve air quality in the metropolitan
          area. Short of a full policy impact assessment, we cannot establish a direct causality between air quality management pol-
          icies implemented in Bogotá and the observed reductions in particulate matter. However, available indicators suggest that
          most measures and interventions adopted by the city government have likely had a large positive impact. These actions in-
          clude, but are not limited to:

          •	   Diesel fuel quality improvement. The maximum permissible sulfur content of diesel fuel sold in Bogotá in 2008 (500
               parts per million) was reduced to 50 ppm in 2010, although real concentration of locally distributed fuel is around
               30 ppm. As of the end of 2012, all diesel fuel in Colombia must be under 50 ppm.
          •	   Increased use of Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system. Increased occupancy levels in the Transmilenio system have entailed
               comparatively large emission reductions. Current BRT emissions are about 0.058 grams of PM2.5 per passenger, com-
               pared with 0.311 grams in the rest of the current public transportation system in Bogotá (a comparative reduction of about
               80%). Consequently, CO2 emissions of the BRT system are much lower than for other means of transportation as well.
          •	   Restriction on sales of two-stroke engine motorbikes in Bogotá and a later ban on their circulation in Bogotá (subse-
               quently overturned). According to the emissions inventory in the city’s ten-year decontamination plan (PDDB 2010) mo-
               torbikes contribute 25% of total mobile source emissions of PM in the city. Four-stroke engine motorbikes emit 40% less
               PM than two-stroke ones. The ban was only under application for two years, as a new mayor reversed the ban on two-
               stroke engines in 2012.

          Further progress in these areas is part of an ambitious 10-year air quality management plan currently under implementation.
          One important planned city-wide intervention is the integration of the public transportation system; although not yet imple-
          mented, this integration is projected to have a major impact on the city’s air quality. According to an ongoing study by the Uni-
          versidad de los Andes, the reorganization has the potential to reduce PM2.5 emissions from public transport by between 74
          and 80%. That would entail health-related economic savings of 360 million USD over ten years (PDDB 2010).

                         Box 2  The Association between Inadequate Water Supply,
                          Sanitation and Hygiene and Prevalence of Malnutrition

Malnutrition in children under five years of age makes infections worse and often more frequent. Substantial research con-
firms that early childhood repeated infections, including diarrhea, may account for at least one third of weight gain retarda-
tion in children under five years of age, thus contributing as much as half of disease burden from malnutrition. WHO study
(Fewtrell et al. 2007) reports that malnourished children have a risk of dying from various diseases that is several times
higher than non-malnourished children. Then the disease burden from inadequate water supply, sanitation and hygiene
(WASH) as much as doubles compared to only considering the direct effect of inadequate WASH on diarrhea. The methodol-
ogy proposed by WHO incorporates not only direct health risks from environmental factors (such as diarrheal disease burden
from poor water and sanitation), but also seeks to include the indirect risks (concentrating on WASH and its indirect impact
on mortality through malnutrition). Thus, while a traditional burden of disease calculation would associate WASH with only di-
arrheal diseases (see figure below), the inclusion of the indirect path implies the need to include all diseases attributable to
malnutrition (as 50% of the consequences of malnutrition are, in turn, attributed to poor WASH).

     Annex 2. Air Quality Monitoring Data and Pollution Concentration Extrapolation in
              Medium-Large Municipalities in Colombia
     A large number of Colombians potentially exposed                            below summarize basic size and urban population
     to air pollution live in cities that lack systematic                        parameters for cities with and without monitoring
     measurements of air pollutant concentrations. The                           networks in Colombia.
     question for the analyst estimating the health im-
     pacts of air pollution is whether to drop those cities                      With regard to the “urban” character of both groups
     from the analysis or to extrapolate measurements                            of cities, the question remains whether the propor-
