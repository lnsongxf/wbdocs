      BOX 1.1.   SDG 6: Water and Sanitation for All by 2030

      SDG 6 comprises eight ambitious targets rolled into one, including both universal and equitable access to
      safe and affordable water supply, sanitation, and hygiene by 2030, as well as more sustainable water
      resource management. These goals go far beyond the challenge of access to services. They address the
      entire cycle affecting the availability and quality of those services. This starts with abstraction—to ensure
      efficient and sustainable use of water resources—and ends with the proper treatment and disposal of waste
      generated by WSS services, including wastewater and fecal sludge.

      This report focuses on the four targets most closely related to WSS:

      6.1.	 Achieve universal and equitable access to safe and affordable drinking water for all.

      6.2.	 Achieve access to adequate and equitable sanitation and hygiene for all, and end open defecation,
           paying special attention to the needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations.

      6.3.	 Improve water quality by reducing pollution, eliminating dumping, and minimizing release of hazardous
           chemicals and materials, halving the proportion of untreated wastewater, and substantially increasing
           recycling and safe reuse globally.

      6.4.	 Substantially increase water-use efficiency across all sectors and ensure sustainable withdrawals and
           supply of freshwater to address water scarcity, and substantially reduce the number of people suffering
           from water scarcity.

       The World Panel on Finance Water Infrastructure presented its findings in March 2003 at the 3rd World
       Water Forum in Kyoto, Japan. The report’s extensive list of 90 recommendations included improved
       governance, tariff reforms, sector planning, and using official development assistance (ODA) in a more
       catalytic way to facilitate more private finance. The report called for doubling all financial flows to the
       sector from all sources, including private finance. Among the options for accelerating private investment
       flows were credit ratings, multilateral development bank (MDB) guarantees, and political risk coverage;
       the use of securitization and collateralization of loan-debt obligations by banks; public-private partnerships
       (PPPs); output-based aid (OBA) subsidies; and credit pooling by subnational governments. To mitigate
       foreign exchange risk for international water financiers, the report also recommended the creation of a

         BOX 2.3.   The Potential of Climate Finance


         Water is a small piece of the global climate action agenda; most funds are used to finance renewable energy
         projects. An estimated 80 percent of funds are for mitigation and 20 percent for adaptation. The WSS
         sector’s share of mitigation funds is split under an array of measures, including energy efficiency,
         nonrevenue water reduction, pump replacement, network optimization, and reductions in greenhouse gas
         (GHG) emissions. For adaptation, water and wastewater management received $15 billion in funding, of
         which 71 percent went to low- and middle-income regions of East Asia and the Pacific, Sub-Saharan Africa,
         and Latin America and the Caribbean (Buchner et al. 2015).

         A larger portion of these emergent funds could be tapped if water projects were better prepared to
         articulate the cobenefits and the impact they could have on mitigating the effects of climate change.
         The World Bank aims to increase its support of climate resilience and GHG reductions to nearly one-third of
         its annual commitments ($16 billion) and to leverage cofinancing of $13 billion per year by 2020, or the
         equivalent of all ODA currently going to WSS.

       BOX 3.1.   Lessons from the East Asia Financial Crisis


       Many service providers in East Asia during the 1990s had foreign currency loans without accounting for
       foreign currency risk in their tariff formulas. The sudden and sharp devaluations of their local currencies as a
       result of the 1997 financial crisis drastically increased the cost of their financial commitments. The service
       providers attempted to confront the dilemma by increasing tariffs under conditions of substantial economic
       downturns, an exercise that proved largely unsuccessful. It was politically impossible to adjust tariff levels
       upward in the short term to recover current costs and regain lost ground. The impacts can still be felt today
       in Indonesia, where 300 service providers have successfully restructured through agreements with the
       Ministry of Finance and their local governments, yet most are still under significant financial turmoil and
       others bankrupt. This resulted in suspended investments and a decline in national coverage.

        BOX 4.1.   The Cost of Misaligned Incentives


        Indonesia’s 1999 decentralization law gave local WSS service providers (PDAMs) the mandate for WSS
        service delivery and local governments the responsibility for investing in the sector. However, 90 percent of
        local government revenues were still coming from the central government. Moreover, under the
        corporatization law, local governments were allowed to corporatize PDAMs from which they could extract
        revenues, even when they were unprofitable. PDAMs were created in an ad hoc manner and had no real
        power over tariff setting, leaving no incentive to improve performance, increase access, or cut costs.

        To bolster investment, a donor-funded, output-based aid program called Water and Sanitation Hibah was
        introduced in 2009 to expand access to water to 70,000 and access to sanitation to 10,000 poor residents.
        Local governments were required to install and pay for 50 percent of all connection costs. Although Hibah
        expanded much-needed services to the poor, the program was not aligned with the existing incentive
        framework. In 2016 there were 421 corporatized PDAMs, 20 percent of which were financially “sick.”
        Those that expand coverage through such programs will have higher operating costs that will continue
        to be subsidized at low efficiency unless more effective incentives can be introduced.

      Governments that borrow concessional finance generally onlend the funds to local service providers,
      transferring an implicit subsidy to the provider (equal to the difference between the concessional loan terms
      and those of an alternative commercial loan). A comparison of two such loans in Vietnam shows that a
      20-year concessional loan at 4 percent interest and a 5-year grace period yielded a subsidy equivalent to
      66 percent of the loan value, when benchmarked against a commercial loan of similar size at 10.2 percent
      interest and 5-year maturity. In this case, providing a capital subsidy coupled with a commercial loan would
      have been more cost-effective in terms of delivering long-term results, and would also make service
      providers more accountable by taking on more appropriate risk levels. When stakeholders do not quantify
      such implicit subsidies there cannot be a policy debate regarding the alternative uses of public funds.

       BOX 4.5.   Making Fiscal Transfers Dependent on Good Performance in Egypt


       Because of Egypt’s decentralization process, regional water and sanitation companies (WSCs) need to
       manage the WSS assets they have inherited from the central government. Without sufficient tariffs,
       government fiscal transfers attempt to cover the gap at a rate equivalent to 1.25 percent of GDP. Large
       investments in wastewater treatment and sewerage networks have suffered from slow implementation and
       high capital and operational costs. The costs of inefficiencies in the wastewater sector in Egypt have been
       estimated at US$1 billion per year.

       Under the Sustainable Rural Sanitation Services Program for Results, the World Bank is helping the
       government to improve rural sanitation services in three governorates in the Nile Delta. The instrument
       transfers responsibility to WSCs, using formula-based fiscal transfers linked to service delivery performance
       in the areas of operations, financial management, institutional systems, and citizen engagement. Payments
       are made upon meeting any of six disbursement linked indicators (DLIs), providing reasonable cash flow to
       enable WSCs to make sequential improvements. Those WSCs meeting performance standards can then also
       receive performance based capital grants to expand access. These grants are allocated on a per capita basis
       to ensure cost-effectiveness.

       BOX 5.1.   What Makes a Service Provider Creditworthy?


       Creditworthiness is a measure of a borrower’s ability and willingness to service its debt obligations, which
       is more likely to occur when they recover 150 percent or more of their operating costs and have good debt
       service coverage ratios. To be creditworthy, the utility must demonstrate a reliable stream of positive cash
       flow from operations as well as sufficient cash reserves in the case that future cash flows are not
       sufficient. It is important that the evaluation of creditworthiness be based on the entire capacity of the
       utility and not just on analysis of the individual project. Concurrently, the creditworthy utility must have a
       plan to handle contingent or implicit charges, which may include unexpected cost increases and foreign
       exchange losses.

       The degree of creditworthiness is judged through a valuation performed by lenders or independent parties
       to determine the borrower’s potential for defaulting on its debt obligations. There are various tools
       available for assessing credit, from creditworthiness indexing to shadow ratings to credit ratings.

        BOX 5.2.   Key Considerations for Promoting Efficient Service Delivery


        Service standards. Standards may range from water quality parameters and hours of service to the standard
        at which sludge must be treated. Clarity on the standards expected is essential for measuring the efficiency
        of any water service provider. Some large service providers use key performance indicators, which are
        internationally accepted standards that enable service providers to benchmark their performance with other
        similar organizations. Internationally recognized service standards may not exist across all subsectors, but
        they are vital in terms of recognizing what service levels are expected.

        Financial performance. Collection rates, operating ratios, and even credit ratings offer insights on the
        financial status of the institution, as well as on the efficiency level at which they operate.

        Employee levels. This refers to the number of employees deemed adequate to achieve a given service
        standard; it may differ by subsector and the size of the water service providers. This number is generally
        a good indicator of whether the entity is operating efficiently or whether it is being used as a source
        of patronage.

        Customer orientation. Measurements of customer satisfaction are another indication of the quality of
        service. They enable an evaluation of how services are being delivered, the quality of those services,
        and how resources and personnel may be redeployed to make improvements.

        Energy costs. Moving and treating water are large, expensive components of water delivery systems, and
        their costs can be a large part of operational expenditures. Measuring the use and cost of energy per person
        served offers an important insight into the quality and efficiency of the water service provider.

        Risk identification and mitigation. Every service, regardless of the sector, comes with some risks. It is
        important to identify those risks, plan for the related contingencies, and undertake measures to mitigate
        them. The ability to undertake this analysis and put systems in place to address these risks is a key
        indicator in determining efficiency.

                                         At the start of the 21st century, service providers in Vietnam, as state-owned-enterprises (SOEs), received
                                         financial support from the government that inadvertently promoted inefficiencies. DAWACO, one such
                                         SOE serving the city of Da Nang with a population of 1 million, struggled with high levels of NRW and was
                                         only providing service to half of the population. In 2005, the government started a reform process to
                                         commercialize the water sector and eliminated operating subsidies to SOEs. A government decree required
                                         full cost recovery to be achieved by 2015, and allowed service providers to propose tariff adjustments to

       These changes forced DAWACO to set out on a turnaround path and to raise its own private capital. The plan
       was supported by the ADB and a €1.9 million grant for a Utility Support Partnership with Dutch firm Vitens
       Evides International (VEI). VEI provided technical and operational training to DAWACO employees to
       increase managerial efficiency, lower operating costs, and expand services, especially to the urban poor.

       Today, DAWACO is a joint stock company with a mix of employee, government, and private ownership.
       DAWACO’s strategy is now detailed in a business plan and a Water Master Plan, both conducted every
       three years. Success factors included DAWACO staff ownership of the turnaround process and cultural
       prioritization of continuous learning and improvement.

       BOX 6.1.   Blended Finance to Reduce Rural Sanitation Costs in Bangladesh


       Rural populations worldwide generally invest their own financial resources to purchase or build latrines or
       toilets. But the costs can be prohibitive, especially for poorer households or where there is a lack of
       competition between providers.

       This is the case in rural Bangladesh, where despite high demand for sanitation facilities, households cannot
       afford to purchase them without paying in instalments. To address the issue, the country is now embarking
       on a new project to blend output-based aid—under the World Bank’s Global Partnership on Output-Based
       Aid (GPOBA)—and microfinance loans to lower the cost of a latrine and spread repayment out in weekly
       instalments over an entire year. The subsidy consists of about $15 per household and will reduce the weekly
       payment by 11 percent. A second benefit of the subsidy is that it reduces the risk of the microfinance
       institutions in their lending.

       On the supply side, the financiers are also extending loans to microbusinesses that sell latrines and latrine
       construction. This work is augmented by World Bank technical assistance grants to train entrepreneurs for
       construction and help the financiers identify and reach poor households. The blending is expected to
       leverage $22 million in household contributions.

      BOX 6.3.   Incentives for Sector Performance in Kenya


      As Kenya attempts to keep up with rapid urbanization, reaching universal access by 2030 becomes more
      challenging. The Kenya Water and Sanitation Development Project, currently under preparation, will allow
      counties or service providers to apply for several types of RBF depending on their operational and access
      targets. Proposals must meet standard criteria, including financial sustainability, water-source sustainability,
      cost-effectiveness, and cost-reflective user charges. Projects for priority funding are those with the lowest
      ratio between investment costs and results: (a) people gaining access, (b) reduction of cubic meters of NRW,
      and (c) improved reliability of supply.

      To fund these improvements, the government of Kenya is tapping into the International Development
      Association (IDA) Scale-Up Facility, a window that offers soft loans that are considerably more attractive
      than commercial loans at 15 percent interest. The facility provides various options for the type of interest
      rates, grace periods (5–9 years), maturity limits (24–30 years), and amortization profiles. The government is
      considering on-lending by applying no surcharge for well-performing service providers, and a 2 percent
      charge for poorer performers. If combined with commercial borrowings, a blending approach could enable
      faster achievement of the sector targets. In time, this scheme could evolve into a sectorwide approach

       BOX 6.4.   Colombia’s Municipal Development Fund


       Colombia has been a pioneer in blended finance since 1989 when the government established FINDETER
       (Financiera de Desarrollo Territorial), a government-owned, second-tier lender that has maintained a AAA
       local credit rating. The agency provides loans to a first-tier lender, which is often a domestic commercial
       bank that finances infrastructure projects.

       Municipalities and service providers must have their loan applications approved by both the bank and
       FINDETER, and they can also receive project preparation support from FINDETER. The bank gets the loan at
       a discounted rate. Combined, these elements promote bank participation, although the bank retains a
       100 percent credit risk. The service provider essentially receives commercial loans on blended terms.
       A voluntary intercept provision further enhances the terms for lenders as the bank has the right to intercept
       municipal revenues flowing from the central government, if needed.

       Donors were critical to the initial start-up of the fund by providing loans guaranteed by the government,
       and they continue to fund the facility. More liquidity is made available from the revenues of existing loans
       and the issuance of certificates of term deposits. The fund has extended maturities to 15 years compared
       with the 5-year terms usually available in the market.

      BOX 6.5.   A Pooled Municipal Bond Issue to Help Small Providers Access Private Finance in India


      In India, providers had been held back from accessing private finance by a lack of credit ratings or
      inability to cover bond issuance costs or legal fees. The State of Tamil Nadu in 2002 created a
      special-purpose facility—the Water and Sanitation Pooled Fund (WSPF)—to help 13 small- to
      medium-size Urban Local Bodies (ULBs) finance WSS services by accessing long-term domestic
      capital markets.

      The AA-rated bond was for $6.2 million, had a coupon of 9.2 percent per annum, and had a maturity of
      15 years. The debt was repaid through general ULB revenues. Investor confidence was ensured through five
      different credit enhancement mechanisms:

      1.	 State government debt-service reserve fund (DSRF): 1.5 times annual principal and interest payments

      2.	ULB escrow accounts: revenue accounts to pay annual debt service obligations early

      3.	Local debt service reserve fund: 5 percent of the principal borrowed by each ULB

      4.	State revenue intercept mechanism

      5.	Partial credit guarantee: provided by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to pay
         50 percent of the principal in the case of default, paid through the DSRF

       BOX 7.1.   The Evolution of WSS Sector Reform in Mozambique


       The 20-year reform process in Mozambique was top-down and benefited from significant and long-term
       donor involvement. A delegated management framework (DMF) gave responsibility for WSS service
       provision to an asset holding company, FIPAG, which delegated asset operations to various public and
       private entities through management contracts.

       For the first decade, a national regulator, CRA, oversaw only water supply in larger cities. It expanded to
       water and wastewater in secondary cities in 2009 when it decentralized its operations. Financial viability of
       service providers is achieved via the regulation of cost recovery tariffs. Policies provided an incentive for
       continuous service improvements, and the DMF provided a clear concept of the ownership, operation, and
       management of assets.

       The process hit some major obstacles, such as low capacity and inappropriate incentives for staff. However,
       owing to the commitment to the long-term vision and a willingness to change course as needed,
       improvements were made over time. Today, services have improved, although coverage remains relatively
       low at 50 percent for water and 20 percent for sanitation.
