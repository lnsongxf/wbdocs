    Note: The LPI index is a multidimensional assessment of logistics performance, rated on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The six core components captured by the LPI survey are rated by respondents on a scale of 1–5, where
    1 is very low or very difficult and 5 is very high or very easy, except for question 15, where 1 is hardly ever and 5 is nearly always. The relative LPI score is obtained by normalizing the LPI score: Percentage of highest performer =
    100 × [LPI – 1] / [LPI highest – 1]. Thus, the best performer has the maximum relative LPI score of 100 percent.

                                                    LPI results across four editions
                                                    (2010, 2012, 2014, and 2016)

    Scores of the six components across the five LPI surveys were used                    167 countries. Each year’s scores in each component were given
    to generate a big picture to indicate countries’ logistics perfor-                    weights: 6.7 percent for 2010, 13.3 percent for 2012, 26.7 percent
    mance more accurately. This approach reduces random variation                         for 2014, and 53.3 percent for 2016. In this way, the most recent
    from one LPI survey to another and enables the comparison of                          data carry the highest weight.

What is the Logistics Performance Index?
Based on a worldwide survey of global freight forwarders and express carriers, the
Logistics Performance Index is a benchmarking tool developed by the World Bank that
measures performance along the logistics supply chain within a country. Allowing for
comparisons across 160 countries, the index can help countries identif y challenges
and opportunities and improve their logistics performance. The World Bank conducts
the survey every two years.

Reliable logistics is indispensable to integrate global value chains—and reap the beneﬁt
of trade opportunities for growth and poverty reduction. The ability to connect to the
global logistics web depends on a country’s infrastructure, service markets, and trade
processes. Government and the private sector in many developing countries should
improve these areas—or face the large and growing costs of exclusion.




                                                     This is the ﬁfth edition of Connecting to Compete, a report
                                                     summarizing the ﬁndings from the new dataset for Logistics
                                                     Performance Index (LPI) and its component indicators. The
                                                     2016 LPI also provides expanded data on supply chains
                                                     performance and constraints in more than 125 countries,
                                                     including information on time, cost, and reliability and
                                                     ratings on domestic infrastructure quality, services, or
                                                     border agencies. The 2016 LPI encapsulates the ﬁrsthand
                                                     knowledge of movers of international trade. This information
                                                     is relevant for policymakers and the private sector seeking
                                                     to identify reform priorities for “soft” and “hard” trade and
                                                     logistics infrastructure. Findings include:

                                                     •   The “logistics gap” between more and less developed
                                                         countries persists. The gap between the top ranked
                                                         countries and those at the bottom of the scale widened
                                                         in 2016.

                                                     •   Supply chain reliability continues to be a major concern
                                                         for traders and logistics providers alike.

                                                     •   Infrastructure still plays an important role in assuring
                                                         basic connectivity and access to gateways for most
                                                         developing countries.

                                                     •   Improvements in trade facilitation are critical for the
                                                         countries performing lowest in terms of logistics,
                                                         including many low- income economies.

                                                         includes ﬁndings regarding skills shortages and the
                                                         growing demand for sustainable logistics solutions.
