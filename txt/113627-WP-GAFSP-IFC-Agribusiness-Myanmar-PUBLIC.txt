EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
The International Finance Corporation (IFC) manages the Private Sector Window of the Global
Agriculture and Food Security Program (GAFSP - PrSW), which is a multilateral mechanism to assist in
the implementation of pledges made by the G20 in Pittsburgh, USA in September 2009. GAFSP
established a private sector window to provide long and short term loans, credit guarantees, equity
and advisory services to support private sector activities for improving agricultural development and
food security. Through the blending of IFC finance and GAFSP finance, investments can be financed
which are commercially viable, but have temporary higher costs and/or higher risks than the
investments which IFC normally finances, and justify a concessional element in the financing package.
The objective of the IFC managed private sector window is to address the following:

       Support and demonstrate new and innovative financing aimed at agribusiness companies and
        their supply chains,

       Help increase productivity, improve market access, support innovation and development of
        new ideas in financing and technology, reduce information asymmetries between small end
        users of capital and financial institutions, and reduce risks associated with financing small
        holders/companies in the agribusiness sector

       Support projects that foster research, development and innovations through entities
        operating in the ‘last mile’ and projects that can demonstrate higher productivity, lower use
        of water resources and inputs such as fertilizers
As a means to reach this objective, IFC contracted Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA) to
conduct an agribusiness sector diagnostic of Myanmar to 1) analyze/identify the most promising sub-
sectors and commodities for IFC/GAFSP investment and advisory services and 2) identify specific
IFC/GAFSP investment opportunities and related partners. This analysis would include
competitiveness benchmarking to examine investment and trade patterns and evaluate the
competitiveness of specific agri sub-sectors and value chains, as well as considering strategic entry
points for advisory, namely water/irrigation, women, climate change as well as skills development,
mechanization, technology and other potential areas.
This report presents the results of a two-phase assignment, which aimed to identify three to five
agribusiness sectors in Myanmar that have the potential to deliver significant growth and
development impacts as well as investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC. Phase 1 reviewed a
long list of sectors using a two stage assessment process to identify the priority sectors, as follows:
        1. Review FAOStat data looking at the top-50 sectors by export value and by production
           value to identify ten sectors worth looking at in more detail.
        2. Analyze each sector gathering quantitative data and reviewing the sectors’ competitive
           strengths and weaknesses; main sector participants; and providing an overview of the
           recent investment activity in the sector.

Phase 1: Analyze/identify the most promising sub-sectors and commodities for IFC/GAFSP
investment and advisory services

The long-list of sectors were reviewed against five criteria, summarised below.


                                                                                                     v

Based on the analysis and discussions with IFC/PrSW, poultry, dairy, agri-inputs and logistics were
selected for the Phase 2 work. It was recognized that some of these were small/emerging sectors
relative to the IFC investment criteria.

Phase 2: Identify specific IFC/GAFSP investment opportunities and related partners

The Phase 2 work included a country-level fact finding mission to map out and analyze the value chain
of each priority sub-sector and identify their performance and constraints, potential investments and
development opportunities and partnerships for consideration by GAFSP PrSW/IFC. The in-country
work including meeting with various stakeholders including private sector companies, donors,
government officials, commercial banks, industry and farmer associations, NGOs among others.
Below is a brief review of the rationale for selection of the sectors followed by the high level potential
opportunities in each sector.

ES.1    Potential opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in poultry value chain

Due to cultural and religious factors, poultry meat contributes to the largest share of meat
consumption in Myanmar, with consumption of poultry products estimated to have increased at 15%
per annum during the 2012-14 period (FAO, 2015). Current consumption is estimated at
6kg/head/year of poultry meat and 40 pcs/head/ year of egg, which is still very low relative to South
East Asian countries such as Thailand (20kg/160pcs) and Malaysia (32kg/240pcs). There has been a
significant expansion in chicken meat production, which reached 1.08m tonnes in 2013. Chickens
accounted for around 91% of the total poultry population, estimated at around 169m birds in 2011.
A more recent report by the RVO (2015) indicates that the poultry broiler population comprised 144m
birds and poultry layer population, 8m birds as of 2014, with broilers accounting for 75% of chicken
meat; followed by (semi) post layers (15%) and (native) village chickens (10%).
Poultry farming is concentrated in Shan State and Mandalay, Sagaing, Yangon, Bago, and Ayeyarwaddy
Regions, in rice producing areas with abundant and less costly feed resources. It is typically integrated
with other livestock keeping. The high value and low land requirements of poultry raising imply that it
is suitable for landless/ near landless households.
While traditional backyard poultry raising has traditionally dominated production, there has been a
growing presence of modern commercial systems for broilers and chicken eggs production. In
particular, contract farming has emerged as the main business model in broiler production, mainly led
by Myanmar CP – a foreign-based vertically integrated company, part of the Thai-headquartered CP
group – although other companies have also initiated such arrangements.
The overall market structure is highly concentrated. Myanmar CP and Japfa Maykha (another foreign-
based company with a vertically integrated supply chain) combined, account for 70% of the total
market share, with activities that include compound feed manufacturing; breeder farms; hatcheries;
Day Old Chick (DOC) production; commercial broiler farming; and a slaughterhouse (Myanmar CP).
Key issues/opportunities identified in the Sector Diagnostic:

       As GDP per capita continues to grow from its current level of US$1,200 alongside the
        increasing trend towards urbanization it is expected that demand for poultry will increase
        rapidly in the future, with growth rates expected to be in the 15% to 20% per annum range.



                                                                                                        ix
       The commercial poultry production industry is dominated by two companies, who jointly hold
        around 60 – 70% share of the commercial sector: Myanmar CP and Japfa Comfeed.

       One of the issues with the commercial sector is a lack of existing facilities to process the
        chickens. Other than Myanmar CP’s slaughterhouse, a new small slaughterhouse has recently
        been opened in Mandalay. Apart from this the birds have to be slaughtered at one of the
        country’s wet markets. There is currently significant need for additional investment in poultry
        slaughterhouses in Myanmar, particularly in the Yangon area.

       Due to the lack of local consumption of beef, poultry could become an important source of
        cheap protein in the future.

       At present poultry production in Myanmar is not competitive. Existing data suggests that it
        costs around US$1.6 per kg to produce a chicken in Myanmar, which is higher than regional
        competitors and significantly higher than in countries such as Brazil at US$1 per kg. Although
        domestic preference is for fresh chickens the domestic producers are currently benefiting
        from the import restrictions on frozen chickens.

       As demand for chickens continues to grow it is unclear that there is a strong policy rationale
        to continue to protect the sector, which is benefiting primarily the two main producers and
        leading to consumers having to pay a higher price for chicken. Therefore, measures to
        increase the competitiveness of domestic production are key. Given that poultry feed
        accounts for around 70% of costs, interventions that can reduce feed costs are critical for the
        future development of the sector:
            o   Production of maize and (the limited) domestic production of soybean is generally of
                low quality/ yield. Increased access to agri-inputs to increase yields and quality have
                an important role to play in supporting the poultry sector.
            o   Soybean and wheat have to be imported into Myanmar to produce the soybean cake
                and soybean meal that commercial producers need. According to the available data
                import costs are up to 40% higher than Vietnam due to inefficiencies at the port, and
                due to a lack of economies of scale.

ES.2    Potential opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in dairy

Although milk and dairy does not currently constitute a large portion of the typical diet in Myanmar,
there is an expectation that as the trend towards an expanding middle class continues, so too will the
demand for protein and nutrient rich cow milk, particularly for young children. As the country
continues to see an increase in the urban population, it is expected that the demand for milk will
continue to increase: dairy consumption is expected to double over the next eight years creating a
large opportunity for domestic milk farmers to recover market share that is currently being served by
lower priced, higher quality imported milk products.
At present, domestic producers do not have the capacity to meet domestic demand for milk. It is
estimated that less than 50% of milk consumption is covered by local production, and that figure is
thought to be falling. Much of the imports have come through Singapore via official and unofficial
channels. Total imports are estimated to be around $40m, though the figure could be much higher
because of the level of imports entering the country through the black market. Myanmar does not


                                                                                                     x
have much of an export market at the moment; the opportunity for the sector is to aim to substitute
for imports.
Milk consumption in Myanmar is mostly in the form of sweetened, condensed milk which is used in
coffee and tea. However, government has tried to encourage the consumption of Ultra-Heat Treated
(UHT) milk to address issues related to malnutrition within the population. Much of the growth in
recent consumption has been in UHT milk and other products such as condensed milk, evaporated
milk, butter and cheese are imported into the country.
According to a study on the dairy sector by Wageningen UR (2014)1 total production of milk and dairy
products is around 240,000 tonnes, with official imports put at around 55,000 tonnes and unofficial
imports amounting to around 300,000 tonnes. This puts total domestic milk consumption at 600,000
tonnes per annum, which implies that around 10kg of milk and dairy products are consumed in
Myanmar each year (the global average is over 100kg per year). The figures estimated by the
Wageningen paper are significantly lower than official government statistics, which estimate that
1.3m tonnes of milk are produced in Myanmar each year, but this is inconsistent with the number of
cattle that are reported to be in the country by government.
Most of the milk produced in Myanmar is in the Mandalay region, which has around 55% of the dairy
cattle population. The remainder is found in and around Yangon and Naypyitaw. Total processing
capacity in the country is also thought to be low, with around 50 plants producing sweetened
condensed milk and 15 producing pasteurised milk. Local processing capacity is estimated to be
around 150 tonnes per day.
Key issues/opportunities identified in the Sector Diagnostic:

          Although the sector is expected to double in size over the next eight years, it is growing from
           a very low base and therefore is unlikely to support large commercial investment. Though if
           growth continues to occur more opportunities could open up in the longer-term.

          Dairy companies report difficulty in increasing demand for their products given the purchasing
           power of consumers.

          There is a need for interventions to increase the technical capacity of existing dairy farmers
           e.g. in their application of hygienic standards, business planning and use of feed inputs, and
           general farm management practices to increase productivity.

          Policy intervention is required to consider how additional land can be opened up to increase
           the production of quality fodder for cattle. The existing land ownership laws make it difficult
           and expensive to purchase land to grow forage that has been previously focused on the rice
           sector.

          The sector needs wider investment in logistics to support increased and more affordable
           access to cold-chain facilities and transportation of dairy products.

          It is thought that expanding the school milk programme (which currently reaches around
           3,500 children, compared to the 500,000 beneficiaries in Vietnam) could, alongside providing

           immediate benefits in the form of improved nutrition for children, help to develop consumers’
           preference for milk in the longer-term.

ES.3       Potential opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in agri-inputs

Crop yields in Myanmar are significantly lower than in neighbouring countries due to deficiencies in
the supply of agricultural inputs, as well as in terms of affordability for farmers – according to the LIFT
Baseline Survey (2012), the lack of affordable credit in rural areas and high input costs (lack or too
expensive fertilizers) were identified as the most significant constraints by smallholders surveyed.
Despite some enabling reforms such as the exemption of import tax on agricultural inputs, the agri-
inputs industry is still regulated, with restrictions that prevent multinationals from operating directly
in the country unless they have formed a partnership with local distribution companies. The key
players in the agri-chemicals industry include Myanmar Awba, the largest private sector firm, followed
by Diamond Star (Armo), which is part of CDSG.
Fertilizer use in Myanmar is estimated at just 60kg/ Ha as compared to 300 kg/ Ha in Thailand and 700
kg/ Ha in Vietnam. Overall, application of chemical nutrients is just 10% of the South Asian regional
average. The total size of the country’s fertilizer market is 800,000 tonnes, of which only 100,000
tonnes is accounted for by domestic output, mainly in the form of urea produced at three government-
owned urea plants run by the Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise.2 Total production at these plants is
at less than 25% of their capacity.
Key constraints to the expansion of fertiliser production include a lack of modern equipment, high
production costs and inadequate supply of natural gas (due to the government’s preference for
exporting it).On the demand side, key constraints to fertiliser use include the limited access to
seasonal credit and proliferation of adulterated fertilisers in the market.
Low yields are also a result of the widespread use of low-quality seeds – e.g. rice seeds of mixed
varieties retained from previous harvests or traded between farmers – which may not respond to high
input levels or improved water control, and/or produce a high proportion of low-value broken rice
when milled.
Key issues/opportunities identified in the Sector Diagnostic:

          Fertiliser importers currently have no access to formal sources of working capital
           requirements

          Soil testing has not been carried out/ updated in Myanmar across all States, as such farmers
           have continued to rely mainly on the use of urea and Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium
           (NPK), which in all probability is not appropriate for the existing agro-ecological conditions

          There is a need for technical assistance and early-stage project development support to help
           develop potential investment opportunities in the agri-inputs value chain that are in early-
           stage of development.

    There are reportedly five government-owned plants overall, of which only three are in working condition.

       There has been promising developments including increasing cooperation with international
        research institutions; as well as growing private sector investment (both domestic and foreign)
        in seed production, distribution and marketing

ES.4    Potential opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in logistics

According to the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), Myanmar was ranked 145 out of 160
countries in the 2014 assessment. Across all the indicators covered in the assessment: customs;
infrastructure; international shipments; logistics competence; tracking and timeliness Myanmar is
scored below its regional comparators. While the BMI Research (2015) logistics risk report highlights
that Myanmar’s potential to act as a regional hub for goods in Asia is limited by the poor quality of
ports infrastructure, the paucity of railways and the limited quality of good roads.
As a result of the poor-quality of the infrastructure networks in Myanmar, the methods used to
aggregate agricultural products are often unsanitary and result in lower quality product. This is
particularly true for the milk sector where collectors often rely on bicycles or public transportation to
collect milk from smallholder dairy farmers. Furthermore, as onsite quality testing consists of the
collector running bare hands through the milk, diseases spread rapidly between farms.
Many smallholder farmers face the problem of inadequate storage facilities for their crops. This forces
farmers to sell at sub-optimal prices given that they can’t hold onto their crops to achieve a better
price when market forces allow. For perishable goods, this problem is made worse by the lack of cold
chain storage facilities and the unreliable electricity supply.
Due to poor transportation networks and underdeveloped value chain coordination, Burmese farmers
face constraints in getting their products to market, whether goods are destined for domestic or
international consumers. Yet, with the expansion of infrastructure aimed at transferring goods to
export markets, several distribution business have emerged in the agricultural sector.
Key issues/opportunities identified in the Sector Diagnostic:

       Supply chain relies on several middlemen to make deals with large wholesale traders. This
        increases the complexity of getting products from rural companies to trade centres and
        warehouses in Yangon.

       Expansion of domestic retail chains such as City Mart and Sein Gay Har, are helping to
        streamline distribution practices.

       The underdevelopment of the power sector forces farmers to keep agricultural products at
        room temperature, restricting the length of time products can be stored and the distances
        these products can travel.

ES.5    Cross-cutting constraints

       Relatively low yields. Small scale cultivation and limited use of inputs limits ability to realise
        the full agricultural production potential. As of 2010, only 5.6% of total estimated agricultural
        land was allocated to large-scale commercial farming.

       Limited/ unreliable rural electricity, dis-incentivises investment in irrigation.



                                                                                                       xiii
   Poor post-harvest practices, given the lack of investment in storage and post-harvest
    facilities.

   High transport costs due to limited structures linking water, road and rail transport; and high
    costs and inefficiencies of Yangon port. According to the World Bank’s Logistic Performance
    Index, Myanmar ranked 145 out of 160 countries in 2014.

   Lack of value chain coordination and regulation (particularly for cross-border transactions)
    contribute to poor reputation for quality in many export markets.

   Only 20% of land is registered; land tenure security is still an issue for investors and most
    SHFs due to: (i) complex and long registration process; (ii) rigid land classifications; (iii) lack of
    recognition of customary land use rights; (iv) weak protection of registered land use rights; (v)
    inefficient land administration; and (vi) large-scale land allocations without adequate
    monitoring, safeguards and limited capacity to solve land disputes. VFV Lands Law is identified
    as a key factor contributing to land grabbing by large agribusiness companies recently.

   Effectiveness of MOAI is constrained by budgetary limitations, weak technical expertise and
    low coverage of extension services. Only $0.06 of every $100 in agricultural output is spent
    on agricultural research compared to $0.41 by Asian neighbours. Department of Agriculture
    (DOA) received just 4.5% of MOAI’s budget in 2013-14, although responsible for research,
    extension, seed multiplication & plant health service. Links between extension staff,
    researchers and farmers are weak.

   Vulnerability to climate change. Water availability is unpredictable and seasonal, as well as

1.         INTRODUCTION
Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA) was appointed by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) to carry out analysis of the agribusiness sector in Myanmar to support work related to the GAFSP
PrSW/ IFC.

1.1.       Background to the assignment

GAFSP PrSW is a multilateral mechanism that is managed by the IFC. It is designed to assist in the
implementation of the pledges made by the G20.
GAFSP PrSW provides long and short term loans, credit guarantees, equity and advisory services with
the aim of improving agricultural development and food security in targeted developing countries. It
targets agribusiness investments across the value-chain that are commercially viable but have
temporary higher costs/ risks that would otherwise prevent them from attracting/ affording finance
on more commercial terms.

1.2.       Objectives of the report and approach

This report presents the results of Phase 1 of the assignment, which aims to identify three to five
agribusiness sectors in Myanmar that have the potential to deliver significant growth and
development impacts for Myanmar as well as investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. The
sectors are taken forward to Phase 2 of the assignment where we identify the key industry players
operating in each sector and investment opportunities for consideration by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC.
To identify the sectors we have carried out desk-based research of secondary sources of information
on the agribusiness sector in Myanmar.
We first reviewed some selected quantitative indicators to identify a long-list of sectors that were
worth looking at in more detail. We then completed qualitative and quantitative analysis of these
sectors to identify a short-list for Phase 2.

1.3.       Structure of the report

This report is structured as follows:

          Section 2 provides an overview of the agribusiness sector in Myanmar.

          Section 3 provides an overview of the supply chain for agricultural inputs.

          Section 4 analyses the long-list of sectors.

          Section 5 presents our ranking analysis of the sectors to identify the short-list; provides
           conclusions on the priority sectors and sets out next steps.

          Annex A summarises the different Micro-Finance Institutions (MFIs) operating in Myanmar.

          Annex B discusses main constraints to financing the agricultural sector and government policy
           responses.

          Annex C includes a summary of donor activity in agribusiness.


                                                                                                      1

Paddy is the main crop grown – largely to meet domestic consumption – and accounts for more than
than half of the sown area for annual crops. Beans and pulses (mainly green gram, black gram and
pigeon pea) have become the largest agricultural export item. Most rural households also raise
livestock (mainly cattle, buffalo, pigs and poultry), with livestock and fisheries collectively estimated
to contribute to 20% of agricultural incomes.

2.2.       Agribusiness enabling environment

In terms of the overall business environment, Myanmar ranked 177 out of 189 in the World Bank
Doing Business 2015 Survey, receiving the lowest ranking among all 189 countries with regard to
starting a business. Key issues for agribusiness investors centre on uncertainties stemming from the
unpredictable and uneven implementation of policies, such as the use of export restrictions, as well
as unclear criteria and restrictions governing Foreign Direct Investment (FDI). However, the desk-
based research suggests that GoM has begun to take some steps to improve the business
environment, including for foreign investors:

          Establishment of the Myanmar Investment Commission (MIC) as a one-stop service center
           to facilitate investments. GoM has started to streamline approval processes for investments
           and reduce documentary requirements for company incorporation to two weeks for foreign
           investors.

          Modernisation of Company Law (2015). Asian Development Bank (ADB) has provided
           technical assistance to Directorate of the Investment and Company Administration (DICA) to
           help strengthen the institutional framework and investment climate including supporting
           updates to the 1914 Company Law. DICA’s Company Act reforms have aimed to modernise
           the law and bring it in line with international developments and modern commercial practices;
           clarify and enhance the law, policy and procedures for companies in order to provide certainty
           for businesses and aid administration by DICA; and to strengthen the economy through clear,
           transparent, consistent, stable regulations with better corporate governance and
           accountability. The new draft Myanmar Companies Law is available on DICA’s website.

          Enactment of Foreign Investment Law (2012) to develop a more open legal environment for
           FDI. While there are still restrictions around foreign ownership in certain sectors (e.g. GoM
           does not permit 100% foreign ownership in agricultural inputs and food processing, FDI is
           generally permitted in all agricultural activities. Once approved by MIC, foreign investors can
           lease land for indefinite periods for seasonal crops and up to 60 years for other crops; lease
           period is even longer if less developed or remote areas are targeted.

          Strengthening the domestic industry. Although 100% foreign ownership is permitted in food
           processing or value-added production for export, it is not permitted for domestic markets in
           an effort to promote small and medium enterprises. Only Joint Ventures (JVs) with majority
           national ownership are permitted in seed, fertilizer and pesticide, and rice and pulse milling,
           in order to facilitate technology transfer. With the support of the IFC, Myanmar is now
           reportedly drafting a new investment law to supersede the existing laws governing both
           domestic and foreign investments, with a view to modernising the rules and regulations
           around investments.

          Promoting modern large-scale commercial farms and plantations. Under the VFV Lands
           Management Law, GoM has been allocating large concessions to investors of 2k-20k Ha at low
           prices. As of May 2013, 0.94m Ha of VFV land were allocated to 377 domestic companies




                                                                                                        5
           (average concession size of 2,497 Ha), with nearly 2m Ha granted in large land concessions
           overall.3

          Reforms in the tax regime. In an effort to move away from an arbitrary and uncertain tax
           regime4, GoM has clarified and formalised certain tax policies. Corporate income tax has been
           reduced from 30 to 25%, while the commercial tax of several key agricultural commodities
           have also been removed. VFV lands are exempt from land taxes in the initial years following
           issuance of land use rights. Tax incentives for foreign investors are particularly generous, and
           include income tax exemptions for up to three years and up to 50% reduction on income taxes
           on export products.
However, as suggested above in Section 2.1, there is a question around the extent to which these
different reforms have been successful. Many large concessionaires seem to have acquired land rights
for non-farming purposes (e.g. mineral extraction and lumbering); only 24% of VFV concessions have
reportedly been developed/ planted, even though they should have been fully developed by now (as
per grant rules).

2.3.       Major agribusiness firms

A major share of industry in Myanmar appears to have both direct and indirect interests in agriculture
– out of 43,239 registered private industries, 35,827 represent food industries including 35,667 private
companies, 354 state-owned companies and 6 municipal companies. The largest registered
agribusinesses operate as rice, bean and oil mills.
Through our desk-based research, we have identified a number of domestic agribusiness/
conglomerates across the supply chain from production and distribution of inputs to trading/exports
of key agricultural commodities. Examples are presented in Table 2.1 below.
There are also a number of a large foreign-based agribusiness firms operating in the country, such as
the vertically integrated companies, CP Livestock and Japfa May Kha, in the poultry sector (further
detail is provided in Section 4.9), in addition to major investments planned recently by foreign
investors. For instance:

          Wilmar, a Singapore-listed group, which is the world’s largest processor of palm oil by volume,
           is planning significant investments in Myanmar with a focus on rice, fertilizers, sugar and
           vegetable oil.

          Cargill is exploring investment opportunities for importing and exporting food and livestock
           feed.

          Yoma Strategic Holdings Ltd, a Singapore listed conglomerate is planning a number of
           activities including: (i) a JV with Switzerland-based ED&F Man Holdings Ltd to plant 3,700 Ha
           of robusta coffee at Yoma’s plantation in Ayeyarwaddy region; (ii) investments in the dairy
           industry, with the company already having signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU)
           with local partners to import milk powder and products from countries such as Australia, and
           to supply the government's school milk program; and (iii) a partnership with Japanese

3
  Rubber, oil palm and rice have received the largest VFV land allocation, with significant areas also granted to
jatropha, sugarcane, rice, cotton, and cassava.

  For instance, Awba was taxed based on import volumes.

                                                                                                               6
    distribution co Kokubu & Co., to provide storage and transportation of agricultural produce
    and seafood in Myanmar.

   Unilever, in 2013 announced that it would re-enter Myanmar with an investment plan of
    $656m. The project includes assisting local farmers in the development of sustainable
    practices and working towards the establishment of Myanmar as a regional leader in
    agricultural commodities, specifically coconut sugar. Investment was expected to lead to
    employment of over 2,000 people at Yangon factory by 2015.

2.4.        Access to finance

Overall, Myanmar ranked 171 out of 189 countries in terms of access to credit, under the World Bank
Doing Business 2015 Survey. Limited access to finance is particularly a constraint for the agriculture
sector, which receives only 1-3% of the total volume of formal bank loans.
The Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank (MADB) has effectively been the only major source of
institutional credit for smallholder farmers; however, its loans are estimated to cover just a third of
the farming population, with paddy production accounting for 90% of its portfolio.5 As a result,
agricultural lending is dominated by informal sources of credit – according to Livelihood and Food
Security Trust Fund (LIFT’s) 2012 Survey, family and friends are the most common source of rural
household borrowing, followed by moneylenders and shopkeepers.
GoM has prioritised the development of microfinance, approving a new Microfinance Law in 2012
with the objective of legalising previous informal microfinance operations and facilitating the
establishment of new Micro Finance Institutions (MFIs) by local and foreign investors. An overview of
the microfinance sector is presented in Box 2.1 below, while Annex A provides further detail on the
portfolios of the broad categories of MFI providers. A discussion of the various constraints to the
growth of MFIs, as well as to the rural outreach of the commercial banking sector is presented in
Annex B, along with a summary of key government policy initiatives to improve access to agricultural
credit.
Box 2.1: Microfinance in Myanmar

    The Microfinance Law imposes interest-rate caps on micro-loans (2.5% flat per month; 30% p.a.) and micro savings
    (minimum interest rate of 1.25% per month; 15% p.a.). Following updates in 2014, key features of the microfinance
    legal framework include:

            A ten-fold increase in the single loan size cap from $390 to $3,900, with MFIs/ MFOs required to hold at
             least 50% of their portfolio in rural areas.

            Local MFIs/ Micro Finance Organisations (MFOs) are permitted to borrow from Myanmar Economic Bank
             for investment funds, while International MFIs/ MFOs can borrow from foreign financial institutions, for
             maximum loan size of $3m.

            All MFOs/ MFIs are permitted the use of payment systems via mobile phones.

            MFOs/MFIs can charge a maximum annual interest rate of 30% for loans; and are required to pay a
             minimum annual interest rate of 15% for deposits/savings.

    Currently, there are an estimated 215 licensed microfinance organisations (MFOs) including MFIs, with a total
    outreach of approximately 1.2m clients and an overall loan portfolio exceeding $150m. MFIs include banks,
    cooperatives, specialized agricultural development companies, political and government organizations, NGOs and
    companies such as AEON and ACLEDA. In particular, total assets of ACLEDA MFI Myanmar Company Limited “ACLEDA
    Myanmar”, were estimated at $9.3m as of the end of 2014, including a total loan portfolio of $8.8m covering 31,610
    active borrowers. ACLEDA Myanmar has benefited from a debt/ equity investment of up to $3m from IFC, in addition
    to a debt investment of up to $3m from GAFSP, with the objective of boosting its agricultural micro-lending portfolio.

 In principle, the size of the loan is meant to be determined by borrower’s demand and repayment capacity and
cover approx. 30% of production costs. However, in reality, loan amounts are as small as $25-50/ Ha compared
to estimated production costs of $250-475/ Ha. Although loan sizes have increased recently, credit still covers
only a quarter of input and hired labor costs. Other issues include high non-performing loan rates and low
efficiency due to high operational costs of reaching rural areas.

                                                                                                                   9
 Other donor initiatives include the Livelihood and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT), a Western microfinance initiative
 supported by countries including Denmark, EU, Netherlands, New Zealand, UK, Sweden and Switzerland. LIFT
 provides small agricultural loans ranging from $60-600, as well as providing funding to several MFIs including PACT
 Global Microfinance (PGMF), which is identified as the only institutionally and financially sustainable MFO in the
 country, serving around three quarters of total active clients.

 In addition, GoM is reportedly launching a state-sponsored microfinance initiative in 2015, which will provide
 lending in amounts 100,000 kyats/ acre (just over $100) to families particularly in rural areas, with a further option
 of borrowing an additional 500,000 kyats (10pprox.. $500) if loans are repaid in time.

2.4.1. Main government policy initiatives

Agricultural development is prioritised in the first of the four key national economic objectives.
Agricultural policy objectives centre on food security, export promotion and increased farmers’
income and welfare, and are supported by key targets set to achieve a surplus in rice production; reach
self-sufficiency in edible oils; and step up production of exportable pulses and industrial crops
More specifically the MOAI has identified five key strategies with regard to agricultural development:
(i) development of new agricultural land; (ii) provision of sufficient irrigation water; (iii) provision and
support for agricultural mechanization; (iv) application of modern agro-technologies; and (v)
development and utilization of modern varieties.
The Figure below provides information on the medium and long-term plans which present Myanmar’
agricultural policy.




                                                                                                              10
Figure 2.2: Agricultural Policy Frameworks in Myanmar

                                      Medium term agricultural policy framework

   • Framework for Economic and Social Reforms (FESR) Policy Priorities 2012-15, target agricultural
     productivity improvements by increasing extension services and government loans, removing supply
     chain barriers and promoting demand-oriented market support mechanisms. Key interventions involve:
     (i) improving productivity of the rice sector through improved seed quality, better agronomic practices,
     optimized fertilizer and input dosages, and integrated pest management; (ii) promoting dry season
     diversification of small farmers into high-value horticulture, fresh fruit, poultry and small livestock; (iii)
     improving farm-level water management by promoting low-cost micro irrigation; and (iv) expanding
     microfinance in rural areas.

   • Five Year Development Plan (2011-12 to 2015-16) targets an overall GDP growth rate of 7.7%. Five
     priority areas are identified for agriculture: (i) seed production and emergence of a seed industry; (ii)
     training and education; (iii) research and development; (iv) commercial contract farming; and (v) market
     liberalisation. The Plan aims to intensify production, particularly to double rice exports within two year.



                   20-Year Development Plan in the Agricultural Sector (2011-12 to 2030-31).

   Under its long-term plan, MOAI is focused on capturing market share at regional and global markets for
   important crops and agro-based, value-added products; promoting food security for rural people; and
   increasing green-growth production in conformity with natural environment. Major policies under the
   framework focus on:

   • Enhancement of agricultural productivity, such as through high yield and quality seeds production and
     distribution; promoting utilization of agricultural inputs.
   • Enhancement of Technologies and Extension Services, such as promoting agricultural mechanization,
     irrigated farming; and undertaking R&D for advanced agricultural technologies
   • Improving access to market, including development of a of a sustainable market (high value-added
     agricultural products and promotion of agro-based industry).
   • Agricultural statistics, including upgrading accuracy of settlement and land record in agricultural
     statistics.
   • Reviewing and evaluation of existing agricultural laws and regulations
   • Promoting dissemination of Information and development of media


2.5.    Donor interventions

A broad range of international donors are active in Myanmar’s agriculture sector, including the World
Bank (WB); ADB; USAID; International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD); Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO); Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT); Global Environment Facility (GEF);
Australian Centre for International Agricultural Research (ACIAR); Japan International Cooperation
Agency (JICA); Korea International Cooperation Agency (KOICA); and Netherlands Enterprise Agency
(RVO).
The projects largely aim to promote agricultural production, drive improvements in food security, and
introduce regional and global best practices in sustainable and scalable smallholder agricultural and
rural development. Below, we provide examples of some of the key activities that have been and/ or
are being undertaken. A more detailed summary of donor interventions in Myanmar is provided in
Annex C.




                                                                                                                      11

                                       Examples of donor activities in agribusiness

    • Support for climate-smart agricultural production. GEF is promoting adoption of climate smart agriculture and
      sustainable forest management policies and practices, while the World Bank’s Ayeyarwady Integrated River Basin
      Management Project aims to strengthen integrated, climate resilient management.

    • Provision of inputs and support for on-farm mechanization. For instance, KOICA’s Land Reform Project for
      Transformation into Mechanized Farming will help help Myanmar establish a training school for agricultural
      mechanization at Yezin, while farmland in other Zabuthiri townships in the same area will also be upgraded. More
      broadly, around 183,000 households have accessed credit for farm and non-farming purposes from LIFT.

    • Strengthening research. ACIAR is researching ways to improve quality seeds and food production techniques that
      can be relayed to farmers and rural households, and is also researching rice, legumes, livestock and fisheries.

    • Development of infrastructure, particularly irrigated agriculture. For instance, IFAD’ Fostering Agricultural
      Revitalization in Myanmar (FARM) project contributes to on-going expansion of irrigated areas, covering command
      areas of six irrigation schemes in Nay Pyi Taw Union Territory (more than 35 Ha within five townships), in addition
      to 10k Ha of rain-fed lowlands and uplands located around these townships. ADB has also proposed a project
      aimed at rehabilitation and modernization of irrigation infrastructure in the Central Dry Zone.

    • Post-harvest support. LIFT & ADB have both prioritized improvements in post-harvest storage and processing
      facilities, while KOICA has funded construction of a Post-Harvest Technology Training Centre to provide training on
      post-harvest techniques for a number of sectors including rice and fruits.

    • Capacity building. A number of donors including Italy and JICA are undertaking capacity-building activities; while,
      overall around 294,000 people have participated in capacity development training funded by LIFT projects.

    • Strengthening institutional framework. ADB is providing support to strengthen government capacity to develop
      and implement policies through a combination of policy advice, learning programs, workshops and seminars to
      share knowledge and discuss economic development and policy issues

    • Agricultural and business services. IFAD’ FARM project involves a component to finance the sustainable growth of
      rural micro-businesses and SMEs.

3.         AGRI-INPUTS SUPPLY CHAIN
Crop yields in Myanmar are significantly lower than in neighbouring countries due to deficiencies in
the supply of agricultural inputs, as well as in terms of affordability for farmers – according to the LIFT
Baseline Survey (2012), the lack of affordable credit in rural areas and high input costs (lack or too
expensive fertilizers) were identified as the most significant constraints by smallholders surveyed.
Despite some enabling reforms such as the exemption of import tax on agricultural inputs, the agri-
inputs industry is still regulated, with restrictions that prevent multinationals from operating directly
in the country unless they have formed a partnership with local distribution companies. The figure
below illustrates the key players in the agri-chemicals industry, indicating Myanmar Awba to be largest
private sector firm, followed by Diamond Star (Armo), which is part of CDSG. An overview of both
conglomerates is presented in Section 2.3, as part of the summary on major agribusiness firms in
Myanmar.

This sub-section presents an overview of the supply chain for the key agricultural inputs – fertilizers;
pesticides; and seeds – as well as a discussion of the underlying constraints.

3.1.       Fertilisers

Fertilizer use in Myanmar is estimated at just 60kg/ Ha as compared to 300 kg/ Ha in Thailand and 700
kg/ Ha in Vietnam. Overall, application of chemical nutrients is just 10% of the South Asian regional
average. The total size of the country’s fertilizer market is 800,000 tonnes, of which only 100,000
tonnes is accounted for by domestic output, mainly in the form of urea produced at three government-
owned urea plants run by the Myanmar Petrochemical Enterprise.6 Total production at these plants is
at less than 25% of their capacity.


6
    There are reportedly five government-owned plants overall, of which only three are in working condition.

                                                                                                               13
However, domestic output may increase with the development of two new fertiliser plants producing
urea; in addition, there may be scope to establish private fertiliser compounding plants – small
amounts of compound fertiliser, bio-fertiliser and foliar fertilisers are already being produced by State-
owned entities and private companies from imported materials. For instance, Myanmar Awba Group
has a steam granulation compound fertilizer plant. The figure below presents the market shares held
by key players in the fertilizer market.

Key constraints to the expansion of fertiliser production include a lack of modern equipment, high
production costs and inadequate supply of natural gas (due to the government’s preference for
exporting it). Overall, fertiliser production is not perceived as profitable for most enterprises, despite
the relative lack of competition in the market, as well as the presence of excess production capacity;
increasing demand; removal of subsidies (which have allowed prices to rise in line with international
levels); and import tax emptions for private sector firms to import and distribute fertilizers.
On the demand side, key constraints to fertiliser use include the limited access to seasonal credit and
proliferation of adulterated fertilisers in the market. OECD (2014) reports that most farmers surveyed
indicated that they were unable to determine whether the fertilizer purchased (either imported or
purchased domestically) was adulterated, with the exception of some brands selling at a 50-100%
premium.
The supply of unregistered, low quality fertilisers is in large part due to lack of registration and
inspection of fertilisers imported through cross-border trade with China (only 20% of fertilizers are
imported through the sea port), with this problem compounded by the lack of a bilateral agreement
with China on imported fertiliser quality control. Further, there is a general absence of a systematic/
risk-based inspection process, with inspection of fertilisers on the retail and wholesale market – by
the Land Use Division – often reactive in nature, to address complaints. As a result, fertilisers often
contain less nutrient gradients relative to registration standards. With regard to domestic production,
a survey by Myanmar Farmers Association (MFA) indicates that some samples only contain about 1-
2% of the nutrient gradients in other countries. Locally produced fertilisers reportedly also lack

3.2.     Pesticides

Low agricultural output is also a result of inadequate development of Crop Protection Products (CPPs)
– use of CPPs in Myanmar is estimated at just 8 – 10% of the corresponding level in Vietnam. While
there is a registration process in place for new CPP imports, in order to enable the GoM to identify the
origin and active ingredients in the products as well as determine effectiveness through testing, this
is a relatively lengthy procedure which can take more than two years. Further, similar to fertilizers,
anecdotal evidence indicates that registration is mainly applied to imports through the sea port, with
products entering through land border trade from China largely excluded from the registration
process.
Although pesticide application is reportedly increasing, as is the case with the broader inputs industry,
a lack of finance and weak awareness of crop protection constrain adoption by smallholders. However,
large formal pesticide distributors are reportedly undertaking initiatives to expand the market such as
through setting up agricultural demonstration sites and agriculture-related technical training. Key
developments also include establishment of the country’s first privately owned ISO 9001:2008
certified pesticides formulation plant by Myanma Awba Group.

3.3.     Seeds

Low yields are also a result of the widespread use of low-quality seeds – e.g. rice seeds of mixed
varieties retained from previous harvests or traded between farmers – which may not respond to high

Overall, the quantity of quality seed supplied by state seed farms is insufficient to meet farmers’
needs. DOA’s limited budget has impeded the ability of the Seed Division (SD) to efficiently undertake
production and distribution of certified seeds for major crops. While SD operates 22 seed farms and
the Myanmar Rice Research Centre (MRRC), expenditure on seed research is low – only $6,640 of its
total budget of $2.3m was allocated to research in 2013/14. The figure below presents a summary of
key constraints to the development of the seed industry in Myanmar.

                                              Supply side constraints

     •   Under-funded research and extension activities.
     •   Weak incentives for growers and private sector companies to invest in the seed industry.
     •   Inadequate infrastructure to support production, seed testing, processing and storage; and lack of
         systematic distribution system.
     •   Weak capacity of growers, technicians and researchers; and inadequate skills for technical support.
     •   Weak facilities for seed quality control, management and monitoring.
     •   Difficulties underlying import and export of seeds due to lack of SPS and weak quarantine procedure.
     •   Lack of diversification, with a focus mainly on rice, vegetables and maize.

                                             Demand side constraints

     •   Low awareness and knowledge with regard to quality seeds; and lack of clear benefits from use.
     •   Price and affordability.
     •   Weak access to the market
     •   Quality assurance.

In terms of private sector involvement, Rice Specialisation Companies (RSCs) have reportedly engaged
in certified seed production and distribution in targeted areas through contract farming arrangements
– however, as is discussed in Section 4.2, contracted ventures have largely failed and are now mostly
dormant due to issues around side selling and loan defaults, which have limited the viability of such
operations.
Nonetheless, there have been a few promising developments including increasing cooperation with
international research institutions; as well as growing private sector investment (both domestic and
foreign) in seed production, distribution and marketing – in particular, a few local and foreign seed
companies are reportedly producing hybrid seeds for paddy (Myat Min), corn (CP Company) and fruits
& vegetables (Known You Seed company, Malar Myaing, East West Seed Company, Genuine Seeds
company and small private individuals), with the support of MOAI.

4.      LOGISTICS SECTOR
4.1.    Overview of logistics sector

According to the World Bank’s Logistics Performance Index (LPI), Myanmar was ranked 145 out of 160
countries in the 2014 assessment. Across all the indicators covered in the assessment: customs;
infrastructure; international shipments; logistics competence; tracking and timeliness Myanmar is
scored below its regional comparators. While the BMI Research (2015) logistics risk report highlights
that Myanmar’s potential to act as a regional hub for goods in Asia is limited by the poor quality of
ports infrastructure, the paucity of railways and the limited quality of good roads.
The logistics sector covers a range of different issues, for the purposes of this desk-based study we
have carried out research to identify some of the main factors affecting the collection, storage and
distribution of agricultural produce. This is summarised in the sub-sectors below.

4.2.    Agricultural collection

As a result of the poor-quality of the infrastructure networks in Myanmar, the methods used to
aggregate agricultural products are often unsanitary and result in lower quality product. This is
particularly true for the milk sector where collectors often rely on bicycles or public transportation to
collect milk from smallholder dairy farmers. Furthermore, as onsite quality testing consists of the
collector running bare hands through the milk, diseases spread rapidly between farms.
In order to address these issues, the Animal Production and Health Commission for Asia (APHCA)
created programs to improve management and collection practices in the Myanmar dairy industry.
Myanmar based milk collecting business Double Cow Dairy, is implementing Resazurin tests for
farmers. WALCO MCC, another Myanmar collector has created an incentive payment system where
a surplus milk price will be applied according to milk hygiene, with testing training provided by APHCA.
Silvery Pearl, also benefitting from the APHCA program, now conducts laboratory testing at the time
of collection. After completing the APHCA program, WALCO and Double Cow Dairy received
certification from the Food and Drug Administration Department under the Health Ministry. The price
of milk received by all three companies increased by 16-30% after implementing the program.

4.3.    Storage facilities

Many smallholder farmers face the problem of inadequate storage facilities for their crops. This forces
farmers to sell at sub-optimal prices given that they can’t hold onto their crops to achieve a better
price when market forces allow. For perishable goods, this problem is made worse by the lack of cold
chain storage facilities and the unreliable electricity supply.
This problem is especially pertinent for the rice, grain and seed storage sectors. With the risk of
excessive moisture and infestation of insects and rodents, stored goods can suffer reduced
germination or become unsaleable. GrainPro, Inc., a USA-based company with a subsidiary in the
Philippines, has developed hermetic storage systems with plans to distribute across Myanmar
targeting smallholder farmers. The Myanmar Rice Federation will aid in the storage problem by
opening several warehouses both for use as storage, and also for use as collateral to secure bank
loans. Myanmar Agribusiness Public Corp. (MAPCO) is currently building export bases for rice storage
near major cities. The facility near the Thilawa port, with expected completion in 2015, will handle

                                                                                                      17
shipments of domestically produced long-grain rice in the amount of 300,000 tons per year, or 20% of
total rice exports. These MAPCO facilities will also allow for quick loading of rice during rainy season,
where currently these capabilities do not exist.
With respect to temperature controlled storage for livestock and poultry production, the
underdevelopment of the power sector forces farmers to keep agricultural products at room
temperature, restricting the length of time products can be stored and the distances these products
can travel. To address this issue, several cold storage businesses have been started in the sector in
recent years. For instance: Premium Sojitz Logistics (PSL), a joint venture between Myanmar-based
Premium Distribution Co (PDC) and Japan-based Sojitz Logistics was formed in 2013. PSL plans to build
cold-storage facilities in Yangon with warehouse conditions of room temperature, refrigeration and
frozen temperatures to store various perishable items. Additionally, PSL will initiate long-distance cold
chain logistics connecting Yangon, Naypyitaw and Mandalay and eventually develop two cross-border
cold chains connecting to the greater Mekong region.
Other cold-chain agribusinesses currently operating in Myanmar include:

          Myanmar-based Ice Mountain Cold Storage (horticulture, egg and fish storage) and Delhi-
           based Sohan Lal Commodity Management Pvt. (warehousing and agri-commodity storage).

          Yoma Strategic Holdings, in partnership with Kokubu & Co. is developing end-to-end cold
           chain logistics facilities throughout Myanmar to facilitate storage and transport of perishable
           goods. The partnership, known as Kospa Cold Chain Logistics, will initially involve the
           construction of distribution centres in Yangon and Mandalay and eventually develop into a
           cross-border logistics network.

4.4.       Distribution/export

Due to poor transportation networks and underdeveloped value chain coordination, Burmese farmers
face constraints in getting their products to market, whether goods are destined for domestic or
international consumers. Yet, with the expansion of infrastructure aimed at transferring goods to
export markets, several distribution business have emerged in the agricultural sector.
For example, in the beans and pulses sector, the supply chain relies on several middlemen to make
deals with large wholesale traders. This increases the complexity of getting products from rural
companies to trade centres and warehouses in Yangon. Similar issues exist in the livestock sector
where the lack of cold chain transportation, the number of intermediaries between farmers and
markets and the geographically isolated location of many of the rural farming communities impede
the flow of products from farmer to market. On the other hand, the expansion of domestic retail
chains such as City Mart and Sein Gay Har, are helping to streamline distribution practices. Several of
the businesses involved in cold chain storage and warehousing, such as Premium Stojitz Logistics and
Kospa Cold Chain Logistics are also involved in cold chain transportation.
There are currently private sector distribution businesses operating in both domestic consumer
markets and export markets. For example, Yangon-based Consumer Goods Myanmar Co. is a large
distribution company with branches in all 14 states of Myanmar with over 300 distribution trucks, 130
warehouses and 500 retail outlet members, focusing on distribution for local consumption. On the
other hand, Shwe Myanmar Investment and Commercial Co., also based in Yangon, specializes in

exportation of beans and pulses, fish and other goods to Singapore, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and
China.

5.             SECTOR ANALYSIS
This section provides a summary analysis of a long-list of agribusiness sectors in Myanmar. First it
explains how the long-list was identified, it then provides sector summaries.

5.1.           Long-list of sectors

The long-list of sectors covered in this report was identified following discussion with the IFC team.
The following sectors were considered to be important to follow up with:

              Rice

              Beans and pulses

              Horticulture

              Coffee

              Sesame seed

              Milk

              Livestock

              Poultry
A review of each sector is presented in the following sub-sections.

5.2.           Rice

Rice is the most important agricultural sector in Myanmar, accounting for 40% of gross agricultural
output and 13% of overall GDP. As a key staple food, rice contributes two-thirds of calorie intake and
68% of daily protein consumption of Myanmar’s population. The annual per capita consumption of
around 175 kg of milled rice is the highest in Asia. Paddy accounts for the largest share of total planted
area (30%) of all crops. The trends in land used for rice, production of rice, and rice yields are illustrated
in the charts below.

According to FAOStat data (which is derived from official government data), the area under rice
production averaged 8m Ha between 2009/10 – 2012/13, with an average yield of around 3.8 tonnes
per Ha. FAOStat data estimates that total rice production in Myanmar is around 30m tonnes per year.

                                                                                                                                                                                         21
These estimates are higher than USDA data, which indicates that national harvested area averaged
6.7m Ha over the corresponding period, with actual production around half the level reported by the
MOAI. It is difficult to determine what is the more reliable source of data from a desk-based review;
other studies such as Denning et al (2013) produce estimates of production that are broadly in line
with USDA’s calculations.7
Rice farming contributes to the livelihoods of around 70% of the rural population, with approx. 3.4m
households actively involved in the value chain. Approximately half of total production is concentrated
in the delta growing zone (Ayeyarwaddy, Bago and Yangon regions), a quarter in the dry zone
(including Mandalay, Sagaing, and Magway regions), with the balance in coastal and mountainous
areas. Most paddy production is on small farms, averaging 2 Ha in size, with around 80% of annual
production harvested during the monsoons.
Rice is an important source of export earnings for Myanmar, with UN Comtrade data suggesting that
earnings were over $150m in 2013. World Bank (2014) reports that Myanmar exported 1.3m tonnes
of rice in 2012/13, which is below the 2m target set by government.
Around 75% of all rice shipments are directed to Africa (particularly, Ivory Coast, Guinea, and Burkina
Faso) and another 14% to Bangladesh. Exports are also directed to Indonesia and the Philippines, while
there has also been a notable increase in informal border trade with China, mainly for the 25% broken
rice variety. Overall, low quality 25% broken rice accounted for around 92% of Myanmar’s total
exports between 2010 to 2012.
The recently formulated Myanmar Rice Sector Development Strategy (MRSDS) is the government’s
policy framework for the rice sector. Further detail is presented in Box 5.1.
Box 5.1: The Myanmar Rice Sector Development Strategy

    MOAI is aiming to increase milled rice production to 10.13m tonnes for local food consumption and to at least 6m
    tonnes for international trade by 2030. To achieve this they want to maintain 7.70m Ha of rice area, which delivers
    an average yield of at least 4.20 tonne/ Ha per cropping season. Interim targets include an increase in sown area to
    7.59m tonnes in 2020/21, with an average yield of at least 3.9 tonnes per Ha per season.

    Ten activities to achieve these targets by 2030 are guided by the following strategic objectives: (i) improving rice
    productivity, rice quality and nutritional value; (ii) adapting to, and mitigating effects of, climate change and reduce
    risks, while protecting rice ecosystems and the environment ; (iii) protecting Myanmar rice as a quality brand to
    enhance its competitiveness in international trade; (iv) improving the well-being and capacity of smallholder
    farmers; and (v) enhancing efficiency in the rice value chain and reducing post-harvest losses.

    In summary, three main action areas are suggested for achieving the vision by 2020: (i) increasing investment in
    capacity building, research, development and extension; (ii) increasing investment in rural infrastructure; and (iii)
    implementing institutional and policy reforms and innovations.

There is a significant level of donor involvement across the rice value chain, from support targeted at
development of a quality seed supply – e.g. JICA, the World Bank-funded Agricultural Development
Support Project (ASDP) and LIFT’s proposed Delta 3 Programme – to development of post-harvest

5.2.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in rice

Although global demand for rice is growing there has been a decline in demand for the low-quality
rice which accounts for close to 95% of Myanmar’s recent exports. The opportunity for Myanmar to
increase its rice production for regional and global exports will thus depend on its ability to diversify
the type and quality of rice exports to include aromatic, jasmine, glutinous and parboiled rice. At
present its competitiveness and ability to enter these higher value segments is limited by the low
productivity and low quality of rice production at farm-level, inefficiencies and outdated state of the
milling industry, inadequate and high costs of infrastructure, as well as policy uncertainty which deters
private investment.
In light of these constraints, there is need for government/ donor investment in a number of areas
starting with investments to address bottlenecks in the supply of inputs, such as by supporting
agribusiness investments in the seed industry. For instance, MOAI has reportedly leased ShweTaung
Farm to a private company for five years for development of hybrid rice seed, while there are also
reports that a few private players have started to provide farm machinery rental services, indicating
the potential to partner with the private sector for delivery of appropriate and farmer-responsive
technologies.
Given inadequacies in post-harvesting facilities and the antiquated state of rice mills, there is also
need for investments in modern and efficient equipment and facilities for drying, milling and storage.
Of the 1,362 mills identified as being in operation in 2013, 348 of these were between 30-64 years of
age and 68 were over 65 years old. Only 64 rice mills were suitable for the production of super 5% to
100% (grade A) and 265 rice mills for 15% to 10% (grade B), with almost half of the total, 640 rice mills,
suitable for 25% broken milling, and 393 rice mills for 35% broken milling.
Our desk-based research indicates that a number of challenges have impeded private sector
involvement in the required investment to date. For instance, side selling and loan defaults have
limited the viability of contract farming – of the 50 contracted ventures undertaken by RSCs, offering
contracted rice cultivation, only three were in operation as of 2013. A lack of transparency regarding
the investment laws have also reduced foreign investor interest. For instance, three of the ten largest
Thai rice exporters are reportedly investing in rice mills in Cambodia, while others are considering
Vietnam – virtually all are reported to be unwilling to invest in Myanmar.
Nonetheless, there have been some recent signs of private sector activity in the sector. For instance,
a joint venture between French firm, Societe Industrielle Agricole et Commercial D’Outre Mer, and XY
Trading was recently approved by the MIC, to establish a white and parboiled rice mill in
Ayeyarwaddy’s Hinthada Township. The available reports suggest that a second joint venture
involving Thailand’s CP Intertrade, to build a white rice mill in Naypyitaw is also under consideration.
The Singapore listed group, Wilmar, is also planning to undertake investments in rice.
In terms of the domestic players:

       Diamond Star, the country’s largest exporter which is sole supplier to Louis Dreyfus, has
        planned to build a large rice polishing factory, in addition to investing in a rice loading port in
        Thilawa.

       MAPCO, the publicly-owned company, is reported to be undertaking the Integrated Rice
        Complex project, which encompasses 15 individual projects to be completed by 2020. Each


                                                                                                        26
           project will comprise white and parboiled rice mills, dryers, storage, a rice bran oil plant, a rice
           noodle factory, and a rice husk-fired generator. MAPCO also plans to construct Agribusiness
           Service Centres at ten sites in Lower Myanmar, with the objective of leasing tractors,
           harvesters, driers etc. to farmers.

          Green Land Agricultural Cooperative Society, one of the largest rice traders is said to be
           expanding milling and polishing capacities.
Overall the size of the rice sector makes it possible that there could be some interesting investment
opportunities for consideration by GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. There is also some evidence that some
international and local businesses are starting to consider projects in the sector.

5.3.       Beans and Pulses

Myanmar is the third largest producer of pulses globally, after India and Canada, with around 5.4m
tonnes produced in 2013. Within Myanmar, pulses represent the third largest crop sector after rice
and sugarcane (in terms of tonnes produced), accounting for 15% of domestic agriculture output and
the second largest share of the harvested area, following paddy. Total area under pulses was
estimated at 4.5m Ha by 2010-11, a large proportion of which is located in the delta and dry zones.
However, yields lag behind the top producers, with USDA data (2015) indicating that average pulse
yields range between 0.7 – 1.3 m tonnes per Ha.

As the charts below indicate, according to FAOStat data there has also been a significant increase in
production of beans, growing from 1.8m tonnes in 2003 to an estimated at 3.7m tonnes in 2013. The
increase appears to have been largely driven by an initial expansion in land planted with beans, given
that yields have remained relatively low, exhibiting only a marginal increase in recent years.

Production of beans and pulses is mainly carried out by smallholders on 1-2 Ha farm sizes. Over 20
varieties of beans and pulses are produced, most of which are solely for export markets given the
relatively low level of domestic consumption. Matpe, green mung bean, and pigeon pea are identified
as the main crops, with matpe production estimated to be two times higher than that of the green
mung and pigeon pea, according to Thura Swiss, 2013. Combined with chickpea, these four crops
collectively represent almost 90% of the total production of pulses (OECD, 2014).
Pulses represent by far the largest agricultural export item in Myanmar; the country ranks as the
second largest exporter of pulses globally after Canada. Exports were valued at $1.2bn in 2012-13
(CSO, 2013). In addition to black gram (matpe), green gram (green mung bean) and pigeon beans, the
main export varieties also include kidney beans and cowpeas. India accounts for more than 70% of
Myanmar’s beans and pulses exports; while other key markets include UAE, Thailand, Bangladesh and
Japan. Most of the beans sent to India are classed as being of ‘Fair Average Quality’, while special
quality and first quality production is directed to markets such as Korea, Japan and China.
We have not found any specific government policies for beans and pulses, the sector is targeted under
broader agricultural strategies. In particular, the 20-Year Development Plan in the Agricultural Sector
(2011-12 to 2030-31) highlights the importance of increasing production of advanced value-added
agricultural products from pulses, with the objective of developing an agro-based industry.
A small number of donor programs are also identified as targeting the bean and pulses sector. For
instance, ACIAR and JICA are planning support for pulses production in the Central Dry Zone (CDZ).
ACIAR will undertake R&D and extension activities in terms of soil/ water quality/ crop, as well as
providing training to extension workers, students and farmers regarding measurement of soil water
retention capacity. In addition, beans and pulses are supported under the World Bank’s ASDP, as part
of the project’s focus on quality seed production through developing farm-based seed multiplication
infrastructure and facilities and strengthening seed supply chains, as well as its emphasis on crop
diversification.

5.3.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in beans & pulses

Despite the volatility in year-to-year demand, it is expected that there will continue to be strong
demand for beans and pulses from the Indian market, whilst there is also scope for Myanmar to
further capitalise on its proximity to Bangladesh and China - at present, even after taking into account
unofficial border trade, rough estimates suggest that Myanmar contributes less than 20,000 tonnes
to China’s total 750,000 tonnes of imports of pulses. Further, there is potential for growth in the

domestic market fuelled by both, increasing domestic consumption and demand from the feed
industry.
As has been highlighted above, Myanmar’s ability to a capture a higher share of growing world
demand will depend on critical investments to improve on-farm productivity, and value-add of
production. In this context, there may be scope for investments to help promote private sector
involvement in the production of beans and pulses, by supporting contract farming and a cluster
development approach. Reports indicate that such initiatives have the potential to increase area
under cultivation by 5% and improve yields by 25%.
There is also potential to support the development of value-added processing activities, including
canned packaging and development of consumer products; (e.g. soup mixes, dehydrated powders,
gluten free flour, precooked frozen products, stews and snack food), with the objective of reducing
dependence on Indian demand and diversifying into higher-value markets such as EU, US and Middle
East.
While there is some potential to develop the sector, it is not clear from the desk-based research that
there are many large private sector firms operating in the beans and pulses sector that could partner
with GAFSP PrSW/ IFC, nor is there much evidence that there has been much large commercial
investment in the sector in recent years.

5.4.             Horticulture

Around 15% of rural households in Myanmar are estimated to earn some income from producing
horticultural products. The sector has benefited from an increase in urban demand – driven by rising
incomes – and has also started to tap into the potential for exports to neighbouring countries.
The charts below present key trends in production of fruits and vegetables. Given the declining trend
in yields, the expansion in the production of vegetables appears to have been supported by an increase
in the agricultural land harvested. In comparison, fruit production is lower and has been steadily
declining since 2008, despite having a relatively larger area under production than vegetables. Both,
the area harvested and yields of fruits have been stagnant in recent years. Overall, FAOStat data
indicates a total production of 3.4m tonnes of vegetables and 1.3m tonnes of fruit in 2013, accounting
for 256,000 Ha and 360,000 Ha of land under production respectively.

Horticultural crops are grown across the country, the hilly zones of Shan State and other border
regions particularly account for a large share of production. In general, the high value and low land
requirements are found to make horticulture farming particularly viable for landless/ near landless
households. For instance, onions, garlics and potato fields have an average size of around 0.6 Ha, while
plots sown with vegetables and cut flowers range between 0.24 - 0.28 Ha. The table below presents
detail on the five largest fruits and vegetable crops grown, based on data from 2009-10.

While traditionally, fruits and vegetables have been mainly exported to China, Myanmar has recently
targeted markets such as Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand. For instance, dried chilies and onions are
now exported to China, Thailand, India, Malaysia, Indonesia. In addition, the Myanmar Fruit and
Vegetable Producers and Exporters Association (MFVPEA) has indicated that England, Germany, Japan
and South Korea are interested in importing fruits from Myanmar. Available data on the sector is quite
limited, but an estimate by Advance Consulting (2014) estimates that vegetables exports totalled
$818,820 in 2013.
The sector is supported under agricultural policy frameworks such as the 20-Year Development Plan
in Agriculture Sector. There are also a small number of examples of donor support for horticulture.
For instance, KOICA has funded construction of a facility to provide training on post-harvest

5.4.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in horticulture

Myanmar’s horticulture sector is very small but has the potential to tap into the growing world
demand – global trade in processed and unprocessed fruits and vegetables is projected to increase to
$60.2bn by 2019. Realizing this potential growth will depend on improvements in quality of production
driven by investment across the value chain from building up a local supply of quality seeds to
developing post-harvest capacity, including cold storage packing houses, cool chain facilities and
logistics.
While still limited, private sector involvement in horticulture appears to be growing. For instance,
some agribusinesses are getting involved in producing vegetable seeds. While, the Northern Royal


                                                                                                            34
Jade Company, partly financed by Chinese investments, has obtained a 12,000 Ha concession near
Hkaya village, part of which includes a banana plantation. MIC has also approved a joint venture
between the Japanese agricultural company Megumi No Sato, and Myanmar’s City Mart Holding Co.
to cultivate fruit and vegetables in the Mandalay region.
The desk-based research suggests that there may be scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC to partner with the
private sector to support contract farming operations and/ or supply chain integration. Contract
farming is seen as particularly viable for perishable products that have to be processed or shipped
quickly. Key developments in this area include a venture between PepsiCo (Thai) Trading and
Myanmar’s Diamond Star Group to export potatoes from Shan State to Thailand. Capital Diamond
Group has established a $500,000 modern storage facility in Aung Ban, with a target to eventually
export up to 100,000 tonnes of potatoes annually. It is also aiming to develop a new supply chain for
the local potato market and has initiated contract farming, whereby it provides farmers with fertilizers,
seeds and insecticides, as well as requiring them to move to the Atlantic variety of potato (which is
reported to have double the yield of local varieties). Capital Diamond Star also offers a premium of
almost 30% to farmers, in order to ensure supply.
In addition, investments could support agribusinesses to capture higher value through development
of processing activities such as canning, fruit drying, packaging etc. A recent study estimates that the
implementation of industry-focused initiatives in Myanmar could generate additional export revenues
of $1.2bn in 2023 from processed fruit and vegetable exports, assuming 40% of production is exported
in the form of value-added products. Some agro- and small-scale processors are already reported to
be producing red wine based on table type of grapes, albeit in small marketable volumes. In general
though, small suppliers appear to be at a disadvantage, given the demanding process standards for
some high value horticulture crops in export markets and the fixed cost of certification – indicating
that investment opportunities may be better targeted at more large-scale agribusinesses.

5.5.    Coffee

Coffee is a relatively small sector in Myanmar. It is harvested on around 12,500 Ha of land, compared
to crops such as tea which is produced on 79,000 Ha and sugar which is produced on 158,000 Ha.
Overall, FAOStat estimates that total coffee production in 2013 was just over 8,000 tonnes and that
the sector contributes approx. $9m to GDP.
There are a small number of commercial plantations in Myanmar, such as two estates owned by an
entrepreneur called Tint Soe Lin – one a 120 Ha estate that is under production and a plan to have a
400 Ha farm producing coffee by 2018. Other commercial producers include U Than Aung, which has
a 40 Ha plantation growing mainly Arabica coffee in Northern Shan State and Blue Mountain coffee
which has a plantation of around 28 Ha, located in Mandalay.
Around 80% of coffee is produced by smallholder farmers on small plots (0.4 Ha) with approximately
25,000 smallholders involved in production. Smallholders are typically growing coffee alongside a
variety of other crops such as fruits and vegetables (and also poppies - there are a number of reports
that smallholders are increasingly substituting their production of poppies in order to produce crops
such as coffee and rubber). Smallholder production is unorganised; there are few cooperatives/
farmer organisations in the sector.




                                                                                                      35
Coffee production in Myanmar is currently geared towards the domestic market. The available data
suggests that around just 50 tonnes of coffee is exported each year. Thus, although there are various
reports about international coffee firms, such as Green Mountain Coffee, exploring the potential to
source supply from the country the export market is yet to develop.
The coffee sector has been growing in importance for Myanmar over the last decade. The growing
rate of substitution in Asia from tea to coffee, combined with the growing middle-class in Myanmar
that are demanding coffee has supported the recent growth. The growth of the sector is constrained
by low yields: according to FAOStat the country achieves around 0.6 tonnes per Ha, which is
significantly lower than Vietnam which achieves 2.2 tonnes/ Ha. However, the quality of production is
rated highly. Coffee is graded on a scale of 1 to 100, with products needing to score higher than 80 to
be speciality coffee. Myanmar’s coffee is believed to be over 80. According to the Specialty Coffee
Association of America, Myanmar’s coffee crop has the potential to qualify as “premium and specialty
coffee” but current production methods yield a very inconsistent product.

Arabica coffee, high in quality and value, grows mainly in the northern states of Myanmar including
Shan States, Mandalay Division, Chin State, Kachin State, Kayin State, Bogo Division, Rakhine State and
Mon State because of ideal climate conditions such as red soil plateaus, elevations greater than 1000
meters above sea level, well distributed rainfall and a distinctive dry season. Robusta, the lower
quality and lower value alternative to Arabica coffee is suitable to be grown in warmer climates at
lower elevation and is thus grown mainly in the southern regions of Myanmar. Given the southern
location of Yangon, Myanmar’s largest port, most of the coffee reaching international markets via the
Yangon port is of the Robusta variety. Conversely, the higher quality Arabica coffee is often sold to
Chinese buyers at prices lower than commercial value due to low bargaining power of the unorganized
suppliers.

5.5.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in coffee

According to the available reports Myanmar has the growing conditions in place to facilitate the
development of a large coffee sector. In particular it has ideal growing conditions for both the higher
value Arabica and Robusta varieties.
However, the sector is at a nascent stage, with most production carried out by smallholders and only
a few commercial firms in the sector are too small for a GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment. Further, the
country has yet to develop much of an export market and there is uncertainty around the potential of
the sector to compete in the coffee export market.
However, there are reports that international investors/ agribusinesses are beginning to explore the
potential to invest in the market. For instance, Green Mountain Coffee has reportedly explored the

potential to purchase green coffee from farmers as part of a project that is being led by Winrock
International (a non-profit organisation) to develop the coffee sector in Myanmar. In addition, a
Singapore-listed company is partnering with eD&F Man Holdings (a global agricultural commodities
company) in a $20m investment over four years to produce Robusta coffee for export markets on
3,700 Ha of land in the Ayerwaddy Division of Myanmar. Thus, there may be some interesting
investment opportunities to consider alongside companies seeking to enter the sector.

5.6.    Sesame Seed

Myanmar is the world’s leading producer of sesame seed, with production totalling 890,000 tonnes
compared to the next highest producing country India, which produces around 770,000 tonnes.
Sesame contributes an estimated $600m to Myanmar’s economy.
While sesame is widely consumed across Asia, particularly China and Japan, Myanmar contributes only
3% to international sesame trade. Instead, most production is consumed domestically. Sesame is an
important part of the local diet in the form of snacks, flavouring, and cooking oil and is also used as
livestock feed. According to FAOStat data, just 38,000 of the 890,000 tonne production was exported
in 2012; the country made around $37.5m in export earnings. Part of the reason why exports of
sesame are low, is that the quality of local production is not sufficient for international exports.
Sesame seed is grown on over 1.5m Ha of land, with production dominated by smallholder farmers
growing on plots typically ranging from 0.9 Ha to 1.5 Ha. Production takes place almost exclusively in
Mandalay, Sagaing and Magway. These regions are located in Myanmar’s Central Dry Zone, which is
highly conducive to sesame seed cultivation as the seed can be planted and harvested throughout the
year. A wide variety of seeds are native to these regions including higher quality black seeds,
consumed frequently by the Japanese, and white, red and mixed seeds which are often pressed into
sesame oil or consumed whole.
As shown below, exports of sesame increased significantly after the GoM removed the export ban on
sesame in 2006, but have since returned to near export-ban levels. Further, sesame crop yields have
been stagnant for a number of years averaging around 0.5 tonnes per Ha. Myanmar’s yields are
estimated to be higher than the global average, but there is some scope to increase them, as according
to FAOStat they are significantly less that crop yield rates in neighbouring China, which achieves nearly
1.5 tonnes per Ha.

5.6.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSw/ IFC investment in sesame seed

The oilseed sub-sector in Myanmar is an important part of the country’s agribusiness sector. Sesame
accounts for around 50% of the total area dedicated to oil seed production; other important oilseed
crops in Myanmar include sunflower, oil palm and groundnut.
There is some potential to expand the export industry for sesame seeds given Myanmar’s proximity
to China and Japan the world’s largest two importers of sesame, provided production volumes and
quality can be increased.
According to the available reports, Myanmar also has the potential to add value to sesame seed
exports if investment is made to upgrade its seed crushing infrastructure. At present, the country
produces low quality sesame oil for which there is little demand in international markets. As a result,
nearly all Myanmar’s exports are in the form of unprocessed seeds, which typically attract a price of
$1,800 per tonne; whereas quality sesame oil can attract prices well above $4,000 a tonne. A KPMG
report estimates that Myanmar captures only 2% of the value in its sesame supply chain and could
increase export earnings by 500% to over $300m, if it improved the quality of its sesame oil
production.
To achieve this, significant investment in sesame oil processing facilities is required. Currently, there
is said to be strong interest from Dutch private sector investors to enter the Myanmar sesame market.
But beyond this, it is unclear which are the private sector organisations operating in the sector that
are of sufficient size to work with GAFSP.



                                                                                                            41
Significant challenges in the regulatory environment also remain in the sesame sector. While GoM
has recognized the development of edible oils as a national priority, it has committed little thus far to
further develop the export industry. Previous price controls and export bans in the sector have
distorted market functionality and has limited the ability for the private sector to invest. Although
MADB funding exists for farmers, priority is given to paddy farming and thus sesame seed farmers
have extreme difficulty accessing adequate financing. Additionally, irrigation systems that would
increase land area suitable for sesame cultivation are currently devoted to paddy production, even
though rice margins are significantly lower than sesame seed.
Efforts to increase sesame seed production and improve the quality of sesame include donor
interventions such as from the OPEC Fund for International Development. The OPEC project is a $14m
intervention that is working to support the production of certified seeds, assist 6,000 smallholder
farms in improving yields and quality, and support the training of 31 post-graduate students in
disciplines related to oil crop development. The project will also work to develop quality standards
and testing facilities that meet ASEAN requirements. Without the development of the value-added
market in Myanmar, it is unclear that commercial investment to increase sesame seed production is
viable at this stage.

5.7.       Milk

Although milk does not currently constitute a large portion of the typical diet in Myanmar, there is an
expectation that as the trend towards an expanding middle class continues, so too will the demand
for protein and nutrient rich cow milk, particularly for young children. As the country continues to see
an increase in the urban population, it is expected that the demand for milk will continue to increase:
dairy consumption is expected to double over the next eight years creating a large opportunity for
domestic milk farmers to recover market share that is currently being served by lower priced, higher
quality imported milk products.
At present, domestic producers do not have the capacity to meet domestic demand for milk. It is
estimated that less than 50% of milk consumption is covered by local production, and that figure is
thought to be falling. Much of the imports have come through Singapore via official and unofficial
channels. Total imports are estimated to be around $40m, though the figure could be much higher
because of the level of imports entering the country through the black market. Myanmar does not
have much of an export market at the moment; the opportunity for the sector is to aim to substitute
for imports.
Milk consumption in Myanmar is mostly in the form of sweetened, condensed milk which is used in
coffee and tea. However, government has tried to encourage the consumption of Ultra-Heat Treated
(UHT) milk to address issues related to malnutrition within the population. Much of the growth in
recent consumption has been in UHT milk and other products such as condensed milk, evaporated
milk, butter and cheese are imported into the country.
According to a study on the dairy sector by Wageningen UR (2014)8 total production of milk and dairy
products is around 240,000 tonnes, with official imports put at around 55,000 tonnes and unofficial
imports amounting to around 300,000 tonnes. This puts total domestic milk consumption at 600,000
tonnes per annum, which implies that around 10kg of milk and dairy products are consumed in

Myanmar each year (the global average is over 100kg per year). The figures estimated by the
Wageningen paper are significantly lower than official government statistics, which estimate that
1.3m tonnes of milk are produced in Myanmar each year, but this is inconsistent with the number of
cattle that are reported to be in the country by government.
Domestic milk production in Myanmar is currently characterised by three farming systems:

      Smallholder farmers produce around 85% of milk in Myanmar. There are around 50,000
       smallholders each of whom keep 2 or 3 cows. The milk produced by smallholders is milked by
       milk collectors, who pay the farmers for the milk.

      Medium-sized farms that keep around 20 to 40 cows. There are a small number of these
       farmers in Myanmar. They are able to give the cows some inputs (sufficient water, some agro-
       industrial by-products and they also receive some vaccination services from government).

      There are also around 200 commercial farmers in Myanmar, which each keep around 80 to
       200 dairy cattle.
Most of the milk produced in Myanmar is in the Mandalay region, which has around 55% of the dairy
cattle population. The remainder is found in and around Yangon and Naypyitaw. Total processing
capacity in the country is also thought to be low, with around 50 plants producing sweetened
condensed milk and 15 producing pasteurised milk. Local processing capacity is estimated to be
around 150 tonnes per day.

5.7.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in Milk

Although the availability of quality statistics on the sector is limited, the existing reports all suggest
that demand for milk is growing in Myanmar. However, it is expected that the growth in dairy
consumption will continue to be satisfied by imports, as domestic production does not have the
capacity to meet demand and is not competitive with imports.
Overall the sector is at an early stage of development and needs considerable investment in better
equipment, higher quality feed and fodder and quality testing methods amongst other things, to make
the product more competitive against lower priced, higher quality imports.
Investments in the sector could have significant development impacts; for instance an FAO study
found that one full time job can be created off-the-farm for each 30-50 litres of milk collected,
processed and marketed. However, it is unclear from the desk-based research that there are many
commercial businesses operating in the sector that could benefit from a GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment.
The few examples of commercial investments in the sector are foreign businesses that have entered
the domestic market.

          For instance, according to the available reports the IFC has already discussed the potential to
           invest in Yoma, which has signed an MoU with PMM Partners Limited to form a joint venture
           to supply UHT milk to the domestic market as part of an estimated $46m investment. The
           group aims to produce and distribute 1.5m packs of milk per day, of which 0.5m will be
           sponsored by donors and distributed to the poor. In separate investments Yoma is also
           reported to be investing in cold storage and logistics facilities in a $12m project and in a
           commercial vehicle leasing business.

          In addition, a company called Dutch Mill a Thai dairy company, has reportedly begun to build
           factories in Myanmar to increase their capacity to serve both the local and other Asian
           markets.

5.8.       Livestock

The livestock sector as a whole contributes 10% to Myanmar’s agricultural GDP and according to a
USAID survey around 8% of workers in Myanmar draw their income from livestock. While the majority
of livestock production and consumption is in poultry, there are several other subsectors in early
stages of development such as cattle, swine and buffalo that play a number of livelihood and income-
generating functions in the rural areas of Myanmar.
Total cattle holdings are estimated to be between 10m to 14m, with the number of pigs and goats
estimated to be at around the same level. The dry zone of Myanmar is an important area for livestock
production. Many of the farmers that keep cattle in the region do so to provide themselves with some
protection from the adverse effects of draught/ other extreme weather conditions.
Cattle and buffalo are used mainly for milk production, as the meat from these animals is often older
and of lower quality than imported products. While swine is the second most important source of

                                                                                                       45
meat after poultry, making up 30% of total meat output in Myanmar. More than 90% of swine
production comes from small-scale farms, which typically have around two to four pigs; pig meat is
an important source of local meat consumption for rural communities. The few commercial pig farms
are located mainly in the Yangon region.
Over the past decade, GoM has created several policies and ministries aimed at improving the disease
environment, increasing research and development of breeding, increasing trade and improving
livelihoods of livestock farmers. Donor interventions in the sector seems to be quite limited relative
to other sectors reviewed in this study.

5.8.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in Livestock (non-poultry)

Similar to the dairy and poultry sectors, demand for the other livestock related products is expected
to continue to rise alongside population growth and the growing trend towards urbanisation in
Myanmar. Therefore, there could be opportunities for investment in the sector to increase and
modernise domestic production capacity to satisfy demand. With higher and more consistent quality
meat, Myanmar could develop an export market for its swine producers, especially given the proximity
of swine farms to markets such as India and China, where there is high demand.
However, given the nascent stage of the sector, it is likely in need of government and/ or donor
investment to develop; for instance to carry out research in the genetic varieties most suited to the
region; work to improve both awareness and adherence to standards to reduce the incidence of
diseases; and investment to improve the provision of quality extension services to farmers.
It is not clear from the research that much of the required investment represents a commercial
opportunity at this stage, which is in part reflected by the lack of commercial investment activity in
the sector. The main organisation operating in the sector is CP Livestock of Thailand, which is involved
in swine contract farming in Myanmar. It provides inputs to its farmers via short-term credit and takes
repayment in-kind. The company is also involved in meat processing and trading. Beyond CP
Livestock, it is unclear that there are many other potential private sector companies of the size and
track-record to make them viable investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC. Overall, based on
the desk-based research, the scope for commercial investment in the sector seems to be quite limited.

5.9.     Poultry

Due to cultural and religious factors, poultry meat contributes to the largest share of meat
consumption in Myanmar, with consumption of poultry products estimated to have increased at 15%
per annum between 2012 and 2014 (FAO, 2015). Current consumption is estimated at 6kg/head/year
of poultry meat and 40 pcs/head/ year of egg, which is still very low relative to South East Asian
countries such as Thailand (20kg/160pcs) and Malaysia (32kg/240pcs).
The chart below illustrates the significant expansion in chicken meat production, which reached 1.08m
tonnes in 2013. Chickens accounted for around 91% of the total poultry population, estimated at
around 169m birds in 2011. A more recent report by the RVO (2015) indicates that the poultry broiler
population comprised 144m birds and poultry layer population, 8m birds as of 2014, with broilers
accounting for 75% of chicken meat; followed by (semi-) post layers (15%) and (native) village chickens
(10%).

Poultry farming is concentrated in Shan State and Mandalay, Sagaing, Yangon, Bago, and Ayeyarwaddy
Regions, in rice producing areas with abundant and less costly feed resources. It is typically integrated
with other livestock keeping. The high value and low land requirements of poultry raising imply that it
is suitable for landless/ near landless households.
While traditional backyard poultry raising has traditionally dominated production, there has been a
growing presence of modern commercial systems for broilers and chicken eggs production. In
particular, contract farming has emerged as the main business model in broiler production, mainly led
by Myanmar CP – a foreign-based vertically integrated company, part of the Thai-headquartered CP
group – although other companies have also initiated such arrangements. Contract broiler farms are
relatively small, with an average 3,000 birds. Egg production is based on a different business model,
in which farmers receive advice from CP Company’s input sale unit (such as on feeding and health
care), but produce eggs without contracts, selling them in the open market.
The overall market structure is highly concentrated. Myanmar CP and Japfa Maykha (another foreign-
based company with a vertically integrated supply chain) combined, account for 70% of the total
market share, with activities that include compound feed manufacturing; breeder farms; hatcheries;
Day Old Chick (DOC) production; commercial broiler farming; and a slaughterhouse (Myanmar CP).
Further detail on their operations is presented in Annex D.

While there does not appear to be a national-level strategic development plan for the poultry sector,
it is targeted under the 20-Year Development Plan in the Livestock and Fishery Sector (2011-12 to
2030-31). For instance, policies under the Short Term Plan (2011-12 to 2015-16) seek to improve
livestock production, control animal disease, produce required biological products against infectious
disease and transfer of appropriate technical know-how to farmers; while broader agriculture sector
policies also highlight priorities such as the development of the animal feed supply.
A few donor projects have targeted improvements in animal health; these include ACIAR’s research
program into improving management, nutrition and health of village poultry in the central dry zone,
as well as FAO-led support for controlling avian influenza. The Netherlands-Myanmar PPP was also
recently announced earlier this year, whereby stakeholders from the Dutch poultry sector will support
strengthening of Myanmar’s poultry sector such as through improving and expanding curricula of
knowledge institutes, executing joint applied research, offering training programs and demonstrating
best practices. The Netherlands Enterprise Agency is also undertaking the ‘Facility for Sustainable
Entrepreneurship and Food Security: Sustainable and affordable poultry for all’ project to address
limited competition in feed and poultry and increase production capacity, food safety and
sustainability of the Myanmar poultry industry by introducing new technology and training methods.
The project aims to increase supply of chicken meat by 18 million kg per year, equivalent to the annual
consumption of 1m people, and generate income for about 6,700 people.

5.9.3. Scope for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in poultry

Demand for poultry meat is expected to more than double between now and 2025, indicating that
there could be a range of investment opportunities to support the growth of domestic production
capacity to meet demand. Given strong market prospects, private companies from the Dutch poultry
sector are reportedly also exploring options for engaging in Myanmar’s poultry sector.
First, investments could target an expansion in local production of feed ingredients to reduce imports
and secure feed supply - the projected increase in total annual poultry meat consumption implies an
increase in feed production of 1m - 1.5m tonnes, and in the area growing feed ingredients by 400-
600,000 Ha (RVO, 2015). Myanmar Livestock Federation (MLF) suggests that feed production has
received the most private investment in the broader livestock sector, particularly from Myanmar CP
and Japfa May Kha. In addition, there are planned investments by new foreign entrants such as De
Heus, New Hope and Sunjin.
Support could also be provided for further development of contract farming initiatives, similar to the
arrangements pioneered by Myanmar CP for broiler production: contract farmers receive chicks, feed
and vaccines on short-term credit from the company, combined with advisory services; half the

farmers also receive long-term co-financing for construction. Myanmar CP then buys the broilers at
market-determined prices, processing these into fresh meat and processed meats such as sausage and
chicken balls. In addition to Myanmar CP and Japfa May Kha, there are also a few domestic players
which appear to be vertically integrated including Crystel Diamond; Tet Chaung; and MRC.

6.      PRIORITY SECTORS AND NEXT STEPS
In this report we have presented an overview of selected agribusiness sectors in Myanmar to identify
the three to five sectors to take forward to the second phase of the project. In Phase 2 we will identify
both the key stakeholders and specific investment opportunities that could be suitable for support
from the GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in the priority sectors.
It is important to emphasise that this does not preclude any GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investments in the
sectors not taken forward – we note in particular that some interesting cross-sector opportunities
might present themselves during the country visit.
It is necessary to identify some priority sectors to guide the Phase 2 analysis. It is probable that through
the process of consulting with multiple country stakeholders additional opportunities in non-priority
sectors will be identified.

6.1.    Approach to identifying the priority sectors

To identify the short-list we have reviewed each sector against five criteria, summarised in the Table
6.1. Each sector is scored out of five for each indicator – the maximum score possible is 55.
Table 6.2 sets out the data gathered for each of the sectors.

6.2.       Priority sectors

We ranked each of the ten sectors in the long-list against the different criteria described in the table
above. The final scores for each sector are shown in Table 5.3 below.
The assessment of of each sector considered is summarised in Table ES.3. Overall the results of the
ranking analysis has the rice and the beans and pulses sectors as the highest scoring sectors.

          Rice is critical for food security in Myanmar, and as such is found to receive a significant level
           of support from government and donors. Although private sector activity can be observed to
           some extent, our desk-based research suggests that the sector has been detrimentally
           impacted by the policy uncertainty in the past.

          Beans and pulses represent the largest export sector, with export earnings estimated to
           exceed $1bn. Market prospects are strong on the back of continued demand from India and
           the potential to develop exports to China. However there appears to be limited scope for
           adding value, given that most private sector firms appear to be involved in trading.
However, while completing the desk-based research on both rice and beans and pulses one of the
important findings was that while both sectors score highly on potential development and economic
impact, neither sector looks likely to yield a number of investment-ready opportunities for GAFSP
PrSW/ IFC. Given that one of the key priorities for this assignment is to find these opportunities the
IFC have suggested that we focus on the following areas for phase 2 of the study:

          Poultry and dairy. Our desk-based research suggested that both of these sectors are expected
           to grow significantly in the coming years as a result of increased domestic demand for the
           products. To support the growth of the domestic industry it is expected that there will be
           need for considerable investment in animal feed, and so there may be scope for GAFSP PrSW/
           IFC to help this.

          Inputs for the agribusiness sector (including mechanization). We carried out some additional
           research on the inputs sector and found that there is significant need for investment in inputs
           to support the increased competitiveness of Myanmar’s agricultural sectors. It was therefore
           determined that a priority for the phase 2 work should be to review the extent to which GAFSP
           PrSW/ IFC can support increased investment in the sector.

          Logistics for the agribusiness sector, with a focus on the aggregation, storage (particularly
           cold-chain facilities) and distribution of agricultural goods. One of the important findings from
           our desk-based research across all the sectors that we reviewed is that the paucity of
           Myanmar’s existing logistics infrastructure for the agribusiness sector is a key constraint for
           the sector. This is particularly the case in the dairy and poultry sector, given the lack of cold-
           chain facilities. However, there is some evidence that private companies are entering the
           sector and as such it is worth following-up to see if there is potential for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC to
           provide additional investment.

6.3.       Next steps

For phase 2 of the assignment the team will visit Myanmar to meet with key private and public sector
stakeholders.

                                                                                                          57
The objective of this visit will be to update the information available on the key stakeholders present
along each stage of the value chain for the priority sectors and to identify a pipeline of investment
opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC.

ANNEX B: CONSTRAINTS TO FINANCING AGRICULTURE
Due to the ban until recently, MFIs are still in a nascent stage of development, with limited scope and
scale in terms of number of rural farmers and areas covered. Further, there are still a number of
constraints to the growth of MFIs such as:

       Fragmented supervision across government agencies with limited capacity.

       Regulatory framework, such as in terms of methodology and limited differentiation between
        deposit and non-deposit MFIs; low capital requirements for deposit-taking institutions; and
        the prescribed interest rate ceilings.

       Challenges underlying funding, given that the current legislation doesn’t allow MFIs to seek
        out refinancing from local and foreign financial institutions.

       Bottlenecks relating to telecommunications and transportation.
The commercial banking sector’s outreach to the rural population also faces a number of challenges
including:

       Interest rate caps. The minimum deposit rate has been lowered from 10% to 8%, and
        maximum loan rate from 15% to 13%. Given the narrower spread, banks have less incentive
        to target the lower end of market segment due to high operating costs.

       Regulatory restrictions. Deposits are limited to 25 times paid-up capital, while banks are
        required to maintain a liquidity rate of 20%. The laws around collateralized lending are
        restrictive, with a 50% loan-to-value ratio.

       Unfavourable enabling environment. Uncertain prioritisation of creditors and highly
        unpredictable enforcement of debt actions contribute to costly procedures for creating and
        enforcing secured transaction. Other impeding factors include limited scope to use technology
        to increase rural access.
Given these various challenges, GoM is planning several initiatives to import farm input credit:

       Reforms to the MADB. The draft amendment to the MADB Law (to be presented to
        Parliament through MOAI) proposes increasing MADB capital and reserves to $11.4m and
        increasing loans extended to each farmer producing rice and sugarcane from $226 to $283
        per ha.

       Implementation of relaxed bank lending regulation (while waiting for results of financial
        sector master plan). GoM is considering allowing commercial banks to lend for terms
        exceeding one year while enabling mortgage finance to get started. GoM will also permit and
        encourage use of moveable assets (including exportable crops and gold) as collateral for
        lending, (although this will mainly benefit large farmers). The list of eligible collateral has also
        expanded to include key agricultural export goods besides real estate and fixed deposit
        accounts.

       Syndicated loan system, being implemented by GoM will have a preference rate of 11% p.a.,
        2% less than the regular lending rate, provided for agribusinesses.


                                                                                                         61
   Accelerating land registration to enable farmers to use land as collateral. MOAI conducted a
    land registration survey (slated to have ended in March 2013) with the objective of making
    long-term loans available for farmers equivalent to 30% of their land value (although MOAI
    has indicated that this would exclude farmers owing debts to MADB or Specialised Agricultural
    Development Companies).

   Opening up of banking sector. GoM has committed to permit foreign banks to establish
    wholly owned operations once domestic banks have been prepared for foreign competition.

   Deposit insurance scheme. 17 private banks have already participated in the scheme
    introduced by Myanmar Insurance Corporation to address lack of insurance and protect small
    depositors from losing their deposits in the event of bank failure. The corporation indicated
    in June 2013 that it would also provide insurance to farmers, although the types of insurance
    and start date of the scheme were yet to be decided. In addition, the government has recently
    permitted operations by private insurance companies (with private players coming in since
    mid-2013).

PRIVATE SECTOR WINDOW

SECTION 2: AGRIBUSINESS COUNTRY DIAGNOSTIC – MYANMAR PHASE 2

SUMMARY FINDINGS
Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons
This report presents the findings of phase 2 of the assignment. The focus of this phase of work has
been to complete a country visit to Myanmar to meet with stakeholders to identify the nature of any
specific potential investment opportunities for consideration.

Findings on investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC in Myanmar

Important context for our findings on investment opportunities is that GAFSP PrSW/IFC is looking to
support projects of a minimum size of $5m and ideally bigger than US$10m. The investment criteria
has an important impact on the number of projects that can realistically be considered for investment
in the Myanmar at this stage.
Most sectors/ agribusinesses in Myanmar are too early-stage and few local players/ international are
big enough to carry out investments of the required size. Furthermore, IFC are already active in
agreeing mandates with a number of the relatively few major agribusinesses that could support large
investment in the target sectors. An additional factor is that a number of the other large firms either
have access to their own sources of finance or have strong links with the previous government regime
making them not suitable for investment.
Despite this we identified a few interesting, albeit very early-stage, opportunities. These opportunities
are at an early stage of development, in both cases they are with large companies that have the
capacity to finance their own activities. Their main interest in working with GAFSP PrSW/IFC is to
receive early stage project-development support to help develop the projects into viable
opportunities. We recommend an immediate follow up with both organisations by the relevant IFC
team to determine whether GAFSP’s private sector advisory funds could be used to support feasibility/
early stage work in these instances.
In addition, we consulted with Infra Capital Myanmar (ICM), a project development company
operating on behalf of InfraCo Asia in Myanmar. The immediate action for IFC is to meet with the ICM
team to understand more about the project.
The remainder of this summary outlines our main findings.

Summary of our findings

In phase 1 of this study we carried out desk-based analysis to select priority sectors for review in phase
2. Following discussions with the IFC we identified:

       Agri-inputs

       Poultry

       Dairy
As the priority sectors. A summary of findings for each sector is given below. We covered the
opportunities in the logistics sector when reviewing the value-chains of the other priority sectors.




                                                                                                        ii
S.1 Findings on the agri-inputs value chain

In the agri-inputs sector our main findings focused on the opportunities to support the development
of projects with CSDG and ICM. We also consulted with June Industry that wants support to explore
its concept to develop its production of bio-fertiliser and to develop the demand for bio-fertiliser in
Myanmar.




                                                                                                     iii
S.2 Findings on the poultry value chain                              Summary of findings on the poultry value chain
                                                     As GDP per capita continues to grow from its current level of US$1,200 alongside
Figure S.1: Overview of the poultry value chain       the increasing trend towards urbanization it is expected that demand for poultry will
                                                      increase rapidly in the future, with growth rates expected to be in the 15% to 20%
                                                      per annum range.
                                                     However, poultry production in Myanmar is not efficient and production costs not
                                                      competitive with international standards. Domestic producers are currently
                                                      protected by the import restrictions on frozen chickens.
                                                     There is some uncertainty about whether the import restrictions will be removed.
                                                      While there is currently a preference amongst local consumers for fresh chickens,
                                                      as demand grows/ urbanization continues domestic producers will need to reduce
                                                      costs of production of chicken otherwise there is a risk that the country will be
                                                      reliant on imports.
                                                     The main constraint identified in the sector is the lack of access to affordable and
                                                      high quality feed, which accounts for around 70% of costs. Interventions designed
                                                      to increase the quality of feed inputs, the logistical challenge faced in transporting
                                                      them from the main producing area in Shan State to the producers in Yangon and
                                                      the high import costs faced due to port inefficiencies could help to support the
                                                      development of the sector.
                                                     The Dutch (together with a number of Dutch companies) are currently funding a
                                                      range of activities across the poultry value chain and could provide a natural partner
                                                      for interventions designed to support the improved competitiveness of domestic

Commercial investment opportunities in the poultry value chain

We understand that IFC is in the process of agreeing a project to invest in a feed mill. Beyond that,
given the relatively concentrated nature of the sector the number of potential investment partners is
limited, though it is worth continuing to monitor the progress of the relatively new entrants Sunjin
and New Hope.

S.3 Findings on the dairy value chain                                Summary of findings on the dairy value chain
                                                Our view is that the dairy sector is too early stage to provide investable opportunities for
Figure S.2: Overview of the dairy value chain   GAFSP PrSW/ IFC in the short to medium-term. Although the sector is expected to
                                                double in size over the next eight years, it is growing from a very low base and is unlikely
                                                to support large commercial investment at this stage. Opportunities could open up in
                                                the longer-term. To demonstrate this on the next page, we profile the current
                                                investment needs of one of the biggest dairy firms in Myanmar.
                                                One of the fundamental issues faced by the dairy sector is a lack of demand given the
                                                current purchasing power of consumers and because consumers have not really
                                                developed much of a preference for dairy products. Current estimates suggest that
                                                consumption of dairy products is around 10kg per capita (against international averages
                                                of around 100kg). To increase demand there is need for marketing/ awareness
                                                campaigns to build local preferences for dairy products.
                                                The Dutch are carrying out a range of development activities in the dairy sector, so could
                                                be a partner for GAFSP PrSW/IFC to help identify future investment opportunities.
                                                The study also identified the need for policy intervention to consider how additional land
                                                can be opened up to increase the production of quality fodder for cattle. Government
                                                intervention is also needed to reduce the regulatory burdens in place that make it
                                                difficult for dairy producers to import semen straws to enable them to improve the
                                                genetic variety of their cattle.

Commercial investment opportunities in the dairy value chain

As summarised above, our view is that the dairy sector is currently too small/ early stage to support
investments of the size being targeted by GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

S.4      Additional sectors covered during the field visit

In addition to the priority sectors review we met with stakeholders in the finance, horticulture and
sesame, beans and pulses sector during our visit. We summarise our findings from those sectors in
the table below.

 Horticulture
     The sector is very small, but there is some optimism that there is a good opportunity for future growth
      because of optimal growing conditions in areas such as Shan State. There are existing exports of fruits
      such as melon, mango, pomelo and avocado are currently exported for below-market prices mainly to
      China, a country with low quality requirements. Further some of the companies consulted, such as Shan
      Maw Maye are producing dried fruits such as mango for export to Japan and Thailand.
     Our overall findings from the country visit is that Myanmar’s horticultural is not competitive at the
      moment, and needs long-term work across the value chain before it is likely to yield a pipeline of GAFSP
      PrSW/IFC sized investment opportunities. Horticulture growers remain fragmented and disconnected
      from market centres due to poor infrastructure, low quality inputs, lack of farmer skill and knowledge
      and poor access to finance.
     Following a roundtable meeting organised by the Ministry of Agriculture and Irrigation (MOAI) and the
      Dutch Embassy a task force has been established to support the growth of the sector. One of the main
      current areas of focus is the implementation o f a plan to train one million vegetable growers in 4 years’
      time.

 Sesame, beans and pulses
     Our consultations in this sector confirmed the findings of the desk-based review in that Myanmar is
      currently the world’s largest sesame exporter, but only exports unprocessed seeds which attract prices
      of around US$1,800 per MT compared to the US$4,000 per MT that high-quality sesame oil can attract.
      Most of the agribusinesses involved in the sector are traders/ exporters, there is no processing
      infrastructure/ technical know-how to establish in Myanmar at present so sector is reliant on an, as yet
      unidentified new entrant.
     Myanmar also exports pulses, mainly to India and some to EU markets. There was no evidence that there
      are commercial investment opportunities, particularly because there is seemingly no investment/ activity
      in the processing part of the value chain, the main focus is on trading.
     In terms of sector development efforts are focused on supporting producers to improve the quality of
      production to ensure that local producers comply with the new EU regulations on food safety related to
      the sector, and are of the required quality for sprouting. Again the Dutch are supporting a small project
      alongside the MOAI EastWest Seed (a Dutch importer) and Wageningen University to develop improved
      seed varieties.

 Financial sector
     IFC has provided support through its engagement with ACLEDA bank, which facilitated the establishment
      of the ACELDA Micro Finance Institution (MFI) in Myanmar. IFC has also given loan support to Yoma bank
      and provided a trade finance credit line for the Myanmar Oriental Bank.



                                                                                                               vii
   Giving existing activities, the scope for additional IFC support in the sector seems limited in the short-
    term. One of the constraints is that it is difficult to find additional partners due to the nature of the
    shareholders of various banks. For example, commercial banks such as Ayeyarwaddy (AYA) Bank and
    KBZ are not accessible to the IFC even though they would theoretically benefit from IFC financing and are
    of appropriate size and scope.
   An additional issue is that while IFC can provide loans in local currency, this creates complicated hedging
    and foreign currency costs. However, one area that GAFSP might be able to provide additional support
    to open up new investment is helping to supporting more favourable hedging arrangements.

1.         INTRODUCTION
Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons
Cambridge Economic Policy Associates (CEPA) was appointed by the International Finance Corporation
(IFC) to carry out analysis of the agribusiness sector in Myanmar to support the identification of
possible investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

1.1.       Background to the assignment

GAFSP PrSW/IFC is a multilateral mechanism that is managed by the IFC. It is designed to assist in the
implementation of the pledges made by the G20. GAFSP PrSW/IFC provides long and short term loans,
credit guarantees, equity and advisory services with the aim of improving agricultural development
and food security in targeted developing countries. It targets agribusiness investments across the
value-chain that are commercially viable but have temporary higher costs/ risks that would otherwise
prevent them from attracting/ affording finance on more commercial terms.
GAFSP PrSW/IFC is looking to support projects of a minimum size of US$5m in developing countries.
A project size of US$5m is at the bottom end of IFC’s financing range, so any such project would need
to have a strong developmental case. In practice the target investment size is US$10m and preferably
higher. IFC can finance 15 - 35% of the company’s capitalisation (depending on the company’s credit
rating and size of financing) this can increase to 50% for expansion projects. There is no limit to the
proportion of the project that IFC can finance as long as the capitalisation requirements explained
above are met.
For the purposes of the Myanmar study we have focused on investments that meet these criteria, but
have also included smaller projects where there may be scope for additional investment in the
medium-term given the expectation that give the size/ level of development of the agricultural sector
in Myanmar the number of investment opportunities of the required size is likely to be quite limited.

1.2.       Objectives of the report and approach

This report presents the results of phase 2 of the assignment where we identify the key players
operating in the priority sectors identified during the phase 1 study:

          Agricultural inputs (Section 2 of this report).

          Poultry sector, including animal feed (Section 3).

          Dairy (Section 4).

          Logistics (which we covered when looking at each of the other priority sectors).
In each section we then identify the investment opportunities that have the potential to be supported
by GAFSP PrSW/IFC in each sector and suggest options for follow up.




                                                                                                     1
2.         AGRI-INPUTS VALUE CHAIN
Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons
This section details our findings on the agri-inputs value chain and then presents the investment
opportunities found for consideration by GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

2.1.       Agri-inputs value chain

The IFC commissioned a comprehensive study of the agri-inputs value chain in 2015 that gives a full
overview of the existing players engaged in the supply chain and highlights the main issues affecting
the sub-sector. Rather than repeating the content of that report, below we highlight any additional
information that we found during the field visit:9

Lack of soil testing equipment/ knowledge

Soil testing has not been carried out/ updated in Myanmar across all States, as such farmers have
continued to rely mainly on the use of urea and Nitrogen Phosphorus and Potassium (NPK), which in
all probability is not appropriate for the existing agro-ecological conditions. This is reducing farmers’
yields and also potentially damaging the quality of soils in Myanmar.
Investment in soil testing equipment and dissemination of information on the appropriate fertilisers
for the soil characteristics of Myanmar’s agro-ecological zones is particularly needed to support the
growth of niche sectors such as horticulture. The horticulture sector requires the use of a wide range
of different fertilisers to fit the needs of the various crops and soil characteristics. If horticultural
farmers have to rely on just NPK and Urea it is unlikely that they will be able to compete with other
horticultural producing countries.

Working capital finance

Another issue that was highlighted during the visit is that the fertiliser importers currently have no
access to formal sources of working capital requirements. It was reported to us that the current
banking regulations do not permit the provision of credit for working capital in the agricultural sector.
This may not be a significant issue for some of the larger cash-rich agri-input importers, but does add
to the costs faced by smaller importers. For instance, one company reported to us that it has to make
use of informal loans from its business partners to fund its working capital requirements. They have
to pay between 2 – 3% interest per month, which is passed on to the price paid by farmers.

Dutch activities in the inputs sector

The Netherlands Ministry of Economic Affairs is supporting a range of activities in the agri-inputs
sector as part of the Myanmar-Netherlands Agri Programme (MNAP):

          Based on the findings of a recent report the Dutch are working together with the MOAI to
           improve Myanmar’s regulatory framework to bring the regulatory system and capacity for
           phytosanitary services and pesticide regulation more in line with international standards to

           help improve food safety and protect current and future export markets.10 Some of the key
           areas that these efforts will target include developing new regulations around pesticide
           registration and the capacity of government officials to enforce them to help stem the tide of
           illegal pesticide imports.

          The programme has begun a project to train 1,000 local farmers in all aspects of the potato
           value chain. Farmers in South Shan will receive training in multiplying high quality seed
           potatoes imported from the Netherlands, including farm management techniques. They have
           also established a €2m PPP project to begin testing and selecting potato varieties under
           different ecological conditions across Myanmar.

2.2.       Investment opportunities in the agri-inputs value chain for GAFSP PrSW/IFC

Through our consultations in Myanmar we identified that IFC are in discussions with a local fertiliser
company to support their investments in the fertiliser value chain. In addition to this opportunity we
found some opportunities for consideration by GAFSP PrSW/IFC.

2.2.1. Additional meetings on developments in the agri-inputs sector

In addition to the investment opportunities identified above we met with additional companies that
for different reasons did not provide sufficient information on investment opportunities that can be
considered by GAFSP PrSW/IFC at this stage:

          The Myanmar Agribusiness Public Corporation (MAPCO)

          AWBA
These companies are discussed below.

MAPCO

We met with the MAPCO, a non-government organisation that is owned by private investors. MAPCO
describes itself as the business arm of the Myanmar Rice Federation, and aims to address food security
concerns in Myanmar working closely together with government. MAPCO has strong links to the
previous government regime, and potentially as a result IFC have deemed them to be not suitable for
investment from GAFSP PrSW/IFC. We met with them to understand more about the type of
investments that are being planned in the agricultural sector in Myanmar.
 MAPCO is an agricultural services firm that is involved in a range of activities across the rice value
chain e.g. developing its Agribusiness Service Centre concept to provide smallholder rice farmers
access to a one-stop shop where they can access all of their extension services, seed, agro-chemicals
and providing storage facilities. MAPCO also acts as an off-taker for rice produced by farmers and is
involved in trading within Myanmar (around 80% of rice is for local consumption) and export to
countries in Asia region with a target of 325,000 MT per annum for 2016 – 2018.
The business model aims to work by importing the materials required to blend NPK (Nitrogen,
Phosphorous and Potassium) fertiliser in Myanmar. They intend to blend different types of NPK to

meet the needs of farmers across Myanmar’s agro-ecological zones. They intend to offer the fertiliser
to farmers through an input-credit model, recovering the costs of fertiliser by taking payment in kind.

AWBA group

We also met with AWBA, which is the largest agri-inputs firm in Myanmar. They currently provide
agri-inputs (chemicals, fertiliser) to 4m farming households in Myanmar and account for a reported
40% of the market. They make use of dealer-based loans, through their agro-dealer network, to get
credit to farmers. They also have over 1,000 agronomists as part of their company, which in their
reckoning makes them the largest functional extension service in Myanmar.
AWBA were of the view that if GAFSP PrSW/IFC is to be truly additional to existing DFI/ provision of
finance from private sources, it should take a more developmental approach than focusing on risk
sharing arrangements and/ or investment in existing large and well-established agribusinesses, most
of which in his view can already secure finance on cheaper terms than IFC could offer.
AWBA’s suggestion is that GAFSP PrSW/IFC focuses on providing investment more directly to farmers,
by enabling selected farmer groups/ individual farmers to purchase equity in newly developed
agricultural companies. They think that long-term development of the sector can only come if farmers
have a better incentive to grow and invest in themselves – which will only come if they have a stake
in the profitably and success of their agricultural activities. In such an arrangement AWBA would
identify relevant sectors (examples given included strawberries and black sesame) and also provide
for off-take arrangements – if GAFSP PrSW/IFC would provide investment to enable the farmers to
purchase a stake in the business developed around the chosen sub-sector. This is very much a
suggestion that is at concept stage, they are not clear on the size of the investment and accept that
there is limited change for such an investment to provide a return in the short to medium-term.

2.3.    Next steps in the agri-inputs value chain

The analysis of the agri-inputs value chain has identified interesting potential investment partner that
could both yield investments that fit with the GAFSP PrSW/IFC criteria. However the opportunities
with are at an early stage. Rather than just investment they both need technical assistance in the form
of early-stage project development support to help develop further the opportunity.

3.      POULTRY VALUE CHAIN
Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons
This section provides an overview of the poultry value chain and the investment opportunities for
GAFSP PrSW/IFC identified during the country visit. The main findings are summarised below, the
detail then follows.

                                 Summary of findings on the poultry sector
    As GDP per capita continues to grow from its current level of US$1,200 alongside the increasing trend
     towards urbanization it is expected that demand for poultry will increase rapidly in the future, with
     growth rates expected to be in the 15% to 20% per annum range.
    Due to the lack of local consumption of beef, poultry could become an important source of cheap protein
     in the future.
    At present poultry production in Myanmar is not competitive. Existing data suggests that it costs around
     US$1.6 per kg to produce a chicken in Myanmar, which is higher than regional competitors and
     significantly higher than in countries such as Brazil at US$1 per kg. Although domestic preference is for
     fresh chickens the domestic producers are currently benefiting from the import restrictions on frozen
     chickens.
    As demand for chickens continues to grow it is unclear that there is a strong policy rationale to continue
     to protect the sector, which is benefiting primarily the two main producers and leading to consumers
     having to pay a higher price for chicken. Therefore, measures to increase the competitiveness of
     domestic production are key. Given that poultry feed accounts for around 70% of costs, interventions
     that can reduce feed costs are critical for the future development of the sector:
         o    Production of maize and (the limited) domestic production of soybean is generally of low
              quality/ yield. Increased access to agri-inputs to increase yields and quality have an important
              role to play in supporting the poultry sector.
         o    Soybean and wheat have to be imported into Myanmar to produce the soybean cake and
              soybean meal that commercial producers need. According to the available data import costs
              are up to 40% higher than Vietnam due to inefficiencies at the port, and due to a lack of
              economies of scale.
    The Dutch are currently funding a range of activities across the poultry funding chain and could provide
     a natural partner for interventions designed to support the growth of the poultry sector.

 Inputs into poultry feed
 Soybeans: Soybean production in Myanmar is quite a marginal crop. It is       One of the factors preventing the expansion of soybean production has been the low margins
 produced mainly by smallholders in Shan State (around 80% of production       achieved by farmers as a result of inefficient land preparation techniques creating an

achieves yields of around 4.8 MT per Ha in China.
Poultry feed
   In 2014 total feed production was 1.7m MT. New foreign firms have entered the market: De Heus, New Hope, Sunjin and the established vertically integrated poultry
    firms such as Myanmar CP and Japfa are contributing to the expansion of the market – feed production has been increasing by 14.1% (CAGR) since 2012.
   De Heus is in the process of establishing a feed mill in Yangon. The feed mill will have the capacity to produce around 10,000 MT per month, but they have the
    potential to double capacity relatively easily if they need to/ as and when the market continues to develop. They will source maize from local maize producers and
    import the soybean. They expect to continue to sell their feed product through their agro-dealer network, through which their agro-dealers provide the feed to
    farmers on credit. De Heus have reportedly been in initial discussions with potential partners to consider the potential to provide inputs on credit to poultry farmers
    on a bigger scale/ through a more formal system, potentially targeting farmers in the Shan State region.
   Sunjin Myanmar, was established in 2014 but is part of the wider Sunjin group that is the biggest livestock company in South Korea (reported to be the biggest in
    poultry and animal feed), but also has a presence in USA, China, Vietnam and the Philippines – Sunjin is part of the Harim Group which has total sales of US$4.6bn
    and over 10,000 employees. In the poultry sector Sunjin makes total sales of US$1.4bn of sales and around US$2.2bn in the animal feeds business. Sunjin established
    a feed mill in Yangon in September 2014, which has a production capacity of 5,000 MT per month and employs around 100 people. They produce animal feed for
    poultry (broiler and layer feed) and for pigs and reportedly sold 36,000 MT of feed in 2015. We had a brief consultation with them; our initial understanding is that
    they are currently focused on trying to establish their business/ solidify their existing market share and have no immediate plans for expansion.
   New Hope, a Chinese poultry company with subsidiaries in Singapore and Myanmar. They entered Myanmar in 2012 opening a feed mill factory. They are a family
    owned business and employ 75 people in the Myanmar subsidiary and estimates production to be 30,000 MT of feed, annually. We understand that the company is
    currently not turning a profit as they are still trying to gain a share of the market.
   The main constraint that is faced by the feed sector is the lack of quality and quantity of local production of inputs into domestic feed production, in particular soybean
    and wheat. They have to import inputs from US, Brazil, Argentina etc. Importing costs are reported to be substantially higher (25 – 40%) than in markets such as
    Vietnam because of the inefficiency at the port and logistical challenges. Although sufficient quantities of maize are produced in Myanmar the fact that most of it is
    produced in Shan State creates a logistical challenge/ higher costs for the poultry producers.

Breeder and hatchery
   Both CP and Japfa are the only two firms reportedly operating breeder farms and hatcheries at the moment.
   It is currently possible to import day-old-chicks into Myanmar for a zero tariff. However, it is necessary to get a veterinary certification from the government of the
    country of origin and also the approval of the Ministry of Livestock and Veterinary Department in Myanmar.

Poultry production
   Myanmar’s broiler population in 2014 was estimated to be 144m birds. Poultry farming is concentrated in the Shan State, Mand alay, Sagaing, Yangon, Bago and
    Ayeyarwaddy regions of Myanmar. Smallholder poultry production continues to be the dominant source of chicken according to reports, but the commercial sector
    is growing. Smallholder production is affected negatively by a range of factors such as a lack of access to funds to purchase appropriate chicken feed and other inputs
    and poor hygienic and health & safety conditions – Myanmar has suffered from a number of outbreaks of bird flu in recent years.
   The commercial poultry production industry is dominated by two companies, who jointly hold around 60 – 70% share of the commercial sector:
        o    Myanmar CP. A Thai vertically integrated company that has been active in Myanmar for over 20 years. It has four feed mills: Yangon, Mandalay, Kyaut Me
             and Taung Gyi; Breeder farms; two hatcheries and the only commercial slaughterhouse in Myanmar, which is based in Yangon and has a capacity of 1,500
             heads per hour. Myanmar CP is estimated to have around a 40 – 45% share of the market. A rough estimate based on information gained during meetings
             suggests that they could turnover around something in the region of US$140m - US$160m per annum.
        o    Japfa. An Indonesian vertically integrated company that has been in Myanmar since 1995. It has two poultry feed mills in Myanmar and is planning to open
             another feed mill in 2016. The company also has a broiler and layer factory, a hatchery that produces day-old-chicks and carrier out commercial broiler
             breeding in a number of locations. Japfa has a 20 – 25% market share of the poultry sector and a turnover of around US$80m in 2015.
   The other main companies operating in the market are:
        o    Crystal Diamond, which is a vertically integrated operator with two feed mills. It also distributes veterinary products. It has around a 10% share of the market.
        o    Tet Chaung, which has a presence in Shan State. It has around 6 – 8% share of the market.
        o    MRC, which is estimated to have a less than 5% share of the market.
   One of the issues with the commercial sector is a lack of existing facilities to process the chickens. Other than Myanmar CP ’s slaughterhouse, a new small
    slaughterhouse has recently been opened in Mandalay. Apart from this the birds have to be slaughtered at one of the country’s wet markets. There is curr ently
    significant need for additional investment in poultry slaughterhouses in Myanmar, particularly in the Yangon area. Myanmar CP is reportedly considering investing in
    another slaughterhouse.
   One of the factors reported to be limiting the scope for investment in additional slaughterhouses is the existing land use policies. It is said to be difficult for investors
    to access land for the purpose of livestock, given government’s preference for crop production.



                                                                                                                                                                                    8
   Given the limited capacity in the existing slaughterhouses and consumer’s continued preference for live chickens, most chicke ns sold are slaughtered manually at one
    of the country’s wet markets. Yangon’s largest wet market has the capacity to handle over 100,000 birds per day. Typically over 50 ,000 birds are slaughtered manually
    on site each day. The level of hygiene at the wet markets is generally low, creating significant risk of diseases spreading amongst the chickens.

Poultry consumption
   Consumption of poultry meat is estimated to be around 6kg per capita per year, which is low relative to South East Asian countries such as Vietnam (11.5kg) Thailand
    (20kg) and Malaysia (32kg). According to the Myanmar Livestock Federation, Myanmar’s consumption had been growing by around 5% per annum until 2013, but
    since then growth is estimated to be around 15% to 20% per annum.
   In Myanmar the local people generally do not eat beef for religious reasons and cultural preferences. As a result other than fish, poultry is seen as having significant
    potential as a source of animal protein particularly as GDP per capita continues to increase from its current level of around US$1,200 and the trend towards
    urbanisation continues.
   The market for chilled/ frozen chicken is also growing. KFC have entered Myanmar in recent years (and currently has to buy its chickens from Myanmar CP with whom
    it also competes in the prepared chicken food market). Japan-based Lotteria, a chicken fast food chain, also opened in Myanmar in 2013 and also buys chickens from
    competitor Myanmar CP. Alongside the likes of KFC and Lotteria (and CP Fresh Mart that is part of Myanmar CP), there is also increasing demand from supermarkets
    (City Mart being the largest and Sein Gay Har), hotels and urban consumers. However, at the moment there is a strong preference amongst consumers for fresh
    chickens, which in part reflects a lack of awareness about chilled/ frozen chicken consumption. Japfa spoke of the need for a campaign to promote the benefits of
    chilled/ frozen chickens.
   It is understood that there is a cap in place on poultry imports protecting domestic producers from competition from cheap imports, however there is some uncertainty
    as to the exact status of this policy. There are reports that Myanmar has recently agreed to let Brazilian poultry imports into the country and is considering opening
    up the market. While some information suggests that importers of frozen meat products have to produce a Certificate of Origin and indicate where the imported
    goods will be sold before imports are permitted, the aim of this new policy is to restrict the flow of illegal cross-border imports.
   Currently domestically produced chicken is very expensive to produce, with costs of around US$1.6 per Kg (cost of producing live chickens) compared to US$0.75 to
    US$1 per kg in Brazil and US$1.1 per kg in the US. The future government policy with regards to the import ban is a risk for the growth of the domestic poultry
    production sector in Myanmar. It is clear that without considerable investment along the supply chain, domestic producers won’t be able to compete with cheap
    frozen chicken imports – though an important caveat to this is that in the short-term the domestic preference is very much in favour of fresh chickens, and the cold-
    chain logistics are not in place to distribute frozen chicken imports across Myanmar, so the potential removal of the import ban is more a threat to the longer-term
    development of the poultry sector. However, if more competition doesn’t develop in the market in the coming years there is a policy question about whether
    consumers should have to continue to subsidise inefficient producers operating in an oligopolistic market.

Policy constraints in poultry sector
   The poultry sector is regulated by the MLFRD who has made it a policy priority to increase GDP contribution from livestock and fisheries sector threefold.

                                                                                                                                                                               9
   Players across the poultry value chain have expressed uncertainty surrounding the future of poultry import restrictions. They have noted that if the poultry ban is
    removed, the market will be flooded with lower priced international products to which local companies cannot compete.
   There is a lack of product standards for poultry (meat quality and DOC) that impacts the export potential for poultry value chain products and also contributes to
    hygiene concerns among domestic consumers. Hygiene and disease of livestock is monitored by the Ministry of Health.
   Unclear land ownership laws restrict the ability of farmers to obtain land licenses and also restrict farmers’ self -determination of crop production. This makes it
    difficult to register land as collateral in obtaining loans and prevents designated lands to be used in poultry sector development. In addition, it is noted that existing
    regulations do not allow poultry farms to be developed on industrial land, and more generally increasing urbanisation has meant that residential areas have been
    encroaching on poultry farms.

3.2.    GAFSP PrSW/IFC Investment opportunities in the sector

It is unclear that there will be scope for additional GAFSP PrSW/IFC investment in the poultry feed
value chain in the short to medium-term, though it is possible that new entrants such as Sunjin and
New Hope will be potential partners in the future.
Given the relatively concentrated nature of the sector the number of potential investment partners is
limited. CP Livestock, the market leaders in the poultry sector, are reportedly able to access relatively
cheap capital from banks in Thailand so have shown less interest in the opportunity to partner with
vehicles such as GAFSP PrSW/IFC.




                                                                                                      11
4.      DAIRY SECTOR
Some Information in this section has been omitted for confidentiality reasons
This section provides an overview of the dairy value chain, and the nature of the investment
opportunities identified during the country visit. The findings are summarised in the box below, the
detailed findings then follow.

 Summary of findings on the dairy sector
 Given the current status of the sector, our view is that it is not at a stage of development that will provide
 opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/ IFC investment in the short to medium-term. Although the sector is expected
 to double in size over the next eight years, it is growing from a very low base and therefore is unlikely to
 support large commercial investment. Though if growth continues to occur more opportunities could open
 up in the longer-term.
 Dairy companies report difficulty in increasing demand for their products given the purchasing power of
 consumers. Furthermore, in Myanmar milk is currently consumed mainly in the form of condensed milk which
 is used in tea and coffee, beyond that consumers have not really developed much of a taste for dairy produce.
 To help increase demand there is need for more marketing/ awareness campaigns to build local preferences
 for dairy products.
 This suggests that any large-scale investment/ entry into Myanmar’s dairy sector would need to be co -
 ordinated across each stage of the value chain, including developing the market. This would be risky/
 challenging particularly for any new (as yet unidentified) entrant.
 In the short-term more effort in the form of technical assistance, provision of grants, and policy development
 is needed to support the development of the sector. For instance the Dutch Embassy has funded the
 completion of a scoping study identified a number of strategies to support the development of the sector.
 Their report highlighted the need for interventions to increase the technical capacity of existing dairy farmers
 e.g. in their application of hygienic standards, business planning and use of feed inputs, and general farm
 management practices to increase productivity. As a result of their work the Ministry of Livestock, Fisheries
 and Rural Development; FrieslandCampina (a Dutch dairy cooperative), De Heus and the Wageningen
 University have carried out a study to determine the potential to establish a dairy cluster in South Shan – the
 Dutch government has reportedly provided some seed capital to support further development of this
 concept.
 In addition to developments within the sector, there is a need for policy intervention to consider how
 additional land can be opened up to increase the production of quality fodder for cattle. The existing land
 ownership laws make it difficult and expensive to purchase land to grow forage that has been previously
 focused on the rice sector.
 Government intervention is also needed to reduce the regulatory burdens in place that make it difficult for
 dairy producers to import semen straws to enable them to improve the genetic variety of their cattle.
 Government policy targeting industry consolidation in the form of dairy clusters or cooperatives could bring
 scale to the sector to allow large international private sector investments. The industry is currently
 fragmented and dispersed, leading to higher costs. There is also need for wider investment in the logistics
 sector to support increased and more affordable access to cold-chain facilities and transportation of dairy
 products.

We describe each sub-sector of the dairy value-chain below.

4.1.1. Input suppliers

Inputs for breeding

Most smallholder/ medium-sized farmers lack the access to affordable finance to support investment
in improved inputs and more generally they may have a limited awareness of the importance of the
breed of cattle for the productivity of their stock. They generally make use of cross-breeding for
reproduction.
There is currently only one artificial insemination centre operating in the country, which is operated
by the Ministry for Livestock and Fisheries. This produces around 30,000 semen straws, which can be
used by dairy farmers for reproduction. The straws are given free of charge, but the farmer has to pay
a charge to cover the cost of getting the veterinarian to travel to their location. According to
Wageningen (2014) there are a number of problems with the existing service: the number of straws
produced is insufficient, the farmers have no choice of breed, and the veterinarians inseminating the
cows do not have sufficient skills leading to inefficiency and waste.
Commercial farmers try to import semen themselves and often have to resort to ‘informal’ channels
through Chinese trade because it was reported to us that existing government policies make it difficult
to import the semen straws required to improve their stock of cattle. There are a number of
regulations involved in the process, creating the opportunity for corruption by government officials.
Farmers without access to the artificial insemination centre use bulls for insemination which dilutes
the breed and lowers the quality of dairy product.

Feed inputs

The market for feed inputs is generally restricted to commercial farmers. Feed costs account for
around two-thirds of commercial farmers’ costs, and the quality of feed is a key determinant of the
cow productivity.
The commercial farmers grow forage to feed their cattle, but some report that the opportunity cost
of using the land to grow grass is too high – for instance, one of the commercial farmers reported that
they now use their land to grow rice, because of the low profits that they got from using it to grow
forage crops for their cattle. One of the issues is a problem of logistics. The optimal growing regions
for protein-rich by-products and grazing areas are Shan, Chin and Kachin states. However, there is
currently no real market for dairy produce in these areas and the costs involved in transporting either
the fodder/inputs to dairy farms or finished dairy produce to consumers in Yangon/ Mandalay is
prohibitive. Beyond the limited availability of land, the climate in Yangon also prohibits growing forage
crops as the grass is not resilient through monsoon season.
According to Wageningen (2014) the amount of forage produce covers only 40 to 50% of the cows’
requirements.11 The farmers are also providing their cattle with readymade food supplies, such as
cotton and sesame seed and rice powder. These products are typically bought from nearby farmers
and are not designed specifically to meet the nutrition requirements of cattle and can actually in some
instances be harmful to the growth and productivity of cattle stock. There is a general lack of

of cattle. CP Livestock is reported to be the only agribusiness producing feed for cattle, the quality of
this feed is unknown.

4.1.2. Dairy farmers

Most of the milk produced in Myanmar comes from the Mandalay region (55%), the other main
producing regions are Yangon (15%) and Naypyitaw.
Domestic milk production in Myanmar is currently characterised by three farming systems:

       Smallholder farmers supply around 85% of milk production in Myanmar. It is estimated that
        there are around 50,000 smallholders in Myanmar owning two or three cows each. The milk
        supplied by smallholders is milked by milk collectors, who then supply their milk to milk
        processors or sell to market in the form of raw milk – some smallholders milk their own cows
        and then sell the raw milk themselves. The smallholders typically feed their stock with freshly
        cut grass and/ or feed them at the roadside. It is been reported that smallholders yield around
        1 litre of milk per cow each day and can usually milk their cows for around 7 months of each
        year.

       Medium-sized farms that keep around 20 to 40 cows. There are a small number of these
        farmers in Myanmar. They give their cows some basic inputs: water; by-products from
        agricultural for feed alongside low cost concentrate feeds, fresh cut grass and rice straw; and
        they also receive some vaccination services from government programs. The cows are either
        milked by the farmers and/ or the milk collectors. According to surveys, they typically obtain
        yields of around 4 litres per cow per day.

       There are also around 200 commercial farmers in Myanmar, which each keep around 80 to
        200 dairy cattle. The commercial farmers typically feed their cows with roughage and
        different self-mixed concentrates, but can’t afford to purchase vitamins and minerals for their
        cattle. However, they have access to a local veterinarian to apply the necessary vaccinations
        – some of the commercial companies such as Silvery Pearl and WALCO provide veterinary
        services to smallholders/ medium-sized farmers. It is estimated that they typically obtain
        yields averaging around 9 litres per cow each day. The commercial farmers often supplement
        the milk produced from their own farms, by purchasing from medium-sized/ smallholder
        farmers through contract farming arrangements.
The main issue affecting all dairy farmers is a lack of productivity, which is caused primarily by the
poor quality of feed given to the cows. This leads to a combination of low yields when the cow is
lactating – average yields can be higher than 20 litres per cow per day in commercial farms in
developed countries; short lactation periods of around 6 to 7 months, and long intervals in the periods
between lactation of 14 to 18 months. This compares to more typical industry standards of lactation
periods of 10 to 11 months per year and intervals of one year – though there are considerable
variations for this depending on the breed.

4.1.3. Large commercial dairy farms and processing activities

The milk processors are split into the vertically integrated firms that own their own dairy farms (some
supplement their production by collecting milk from farmers), and those that rely on milk collected
from farmers under contract farming arrangements.
The main processed dairy products are:

         Condensed milk

         Pasteurized milk

         Yoghurt products

         Ice-cream
Products such as milk powder and UHT milk are produced in Myanmar, but are mostly imported.
While dairy products such as cheese and evaporated milk are also reliant on imports.
In practice there are not official/ enforced standards for milk production at present. Though WALCO
and Double Cow have obtained a certificate from the Food and Drug Agency as Myanmar moves
towards joining the ASEAN free trade zone and other processors are reportedly in the process of
obtaining certification. None of the government agencies have the capacity to carry out regular testing
of the quality of processed milk products.
The table below gives an indication of the size/ and processing activities of the largest dairy farms, in
practice none of them are currently big enough to support an investment of the size required by the
GAFSP PrSW/IFC investment criteria.

We held consultations with Myabuyin and WALCO so present a more detailed summary of their
activities below.
Table 4.3: Dairy processors
 Company        Activities
 Myabuyin       We consulted with Myabuyin via telephone as they are based in Mandalay.
                Myabuyin is the biggest condensed milk producer in Myanmar, and reportedly account for
                40% of the condensed milk sales in the country.
                They have around 300 employees and 20 branches across Myanmar. They are a locally
                owned company and currently have no partnership with a foreign company.
                Their processing plant produces around 10,000 litres of condensed milk per day, which they
                sell in the local market.
                They source their milk from local farmers through a contractual arrangement – they have
                around 1,200 local farmers under contract and in addition have a stock of 50,000 cattle.
                The company also has a sugar mill; it uses most of the product from that mill to produce its
                condensed milk.
 WALCO          Win Agro-Livestock Co., Ltd (WALCO) is a dairy producer based 44 miles from downtown
                Yangon. Dr. Khin Hlaing, Managing Director of WALCO, is also the Secretary of the Myanmar
                Dairy Association.
                The processing plant produces 2,000 litres per day, sourced through contracted farmrs.
                WALCO has 30 milking cows used for demonstration purposes only, but plants to add another
                60 cows to contribute to dairy production. WALCO, along with Double Cow are the only two
                FDA certified milk processors in Myanmar. They maintain high standards of quality through
                extensive testing upon collection and provide training to contracted farms. WALCO also has
                relationships with New Zealand veterinaries that assist in the AI process. The company
                employs around 50 people for processing and milk collection. They collect milk twice a day
                from seven suppliers, each of which have around 5-10 cows. Products include pasteurized
                milk, yoghurt and butter, sold to supermarkets, retail outlets, bakeries and hotels throughout
                Yangon.

4.1.4. Milk collectors

As described below a number of the main milk processors currently have no dairy farm, and so rely on
their contract farming arrangements/ the work of milk collectors to get access to their required milk
inputs. The milk collectors operate independently, but some of the milk processors employ directly
their own collectors. The informal contracts work based on long-standing relationships, which tend
to reduce the collectors’ risk of receiving low quality milk from farmers that has had water or other
substances added.
As mentioned above, the milk collectors are also typically responsible for milking the cows of both
smallholder and medium-sized dairy farmers. The collectors therefore play a critical role in the value
chain. At present the collectors lack training and awareness of appropriate dairy farming techniques.
They are reported to be a key source in the spread of disease because of the poor standard of hygiene

                                                                                                            17
standards that they follow. Furthermore, the collectors make use of quite rudimentary collection and
distribution technology; they collect the milk in plastic or metal bins and make use of motorbikes and
cycles to transport the milk to processors and retail outlets.

4.1.5. Imports

At the moment over 50% of dairy consumption is covered by imports. The main reason is that domestic
production is inefficient/ of low quality and so can’t compete on price with imports. Total official
imports are estimated to amount to $40m per annum, though in addition to this there is a large trade
in imports through unofficial channels. Thai-based diary processor Dutch Mill accounts for the largest
share of imported UHT, pasteurized milk and yoghurt.
The main dairy product imported into Myanmar is sweetened condensed milk. According to
Wageningen (2014), in 2010/11 around 18,000 MT was imported at an average import price of
US$0.973 per kg – this compares to the domestic wholesale price of between US$1.14 per kg and
US$2.70 per kg. Another important milk product is milk powder that is often repackaged or used by
domestic processors to make condensed milk.

4.1.6. Dairy consumption

Total dairy consumption in Myanmar is still very low. It is estimated that 600,000 MT of dairy products
are produced each year, which implies that around 10kg of milk and dairy products are consumed in
Myanmar each year per capita (the global average is over 100kg per year). However, it is expected
that as urbanisation continues dairy consumption will grow rapidly. For instance, Yoma predict that
dairy consumption will grow at similar levels to China (dairy sector has grown by a factor of 14 since
1998) and Vietnam as Myanmar’s economy grows over the coming years. Whilst available estimates
that demand will double within the next eight years.
At the moment most dairy consumption in Myanmar is in the form of condensed milk which is used
in tea and coffee. The other main products consumed are pasteurized milk, yoghurt and ice cream.
Most consumption is in the major cities: Yangon, Mandalay and Naypyidaw. Although the sector may
grow as a consequence of urbanization and increasing disposable income for consumers, until people
develop the culture/ taste for drinking milk on its own it is unlikely that per capita consumption levels
will increase towards the global average. It is thought that expanding the school milk programme
(which currently reaches around 3,500 children, compared to the 500,000 beneficiaries in Vietnam)
could, alongside providing immediate benefits in the form of improved nutrition for children, help to
develop consumers’ preference for milk in the longer-term.
In addition to the lack of preference for drinking milk, consumption is currently constrained by the
fact that the price of milk is too high for most consumers in Myanmar to afford. The high cost of milk
is driven mainly by the high costs of cattle feed. For example, one of the agribusinesses with which
we consulted explained that they had carried out investment in a UHT processing facility a number of
years ago, but they found that consumers could not afford to purchase UHT milk product (which retails
for approx. 1,500 Kyat or US$1.25 per litre). As a result their machinery currently lies idle.

4.2.    Investment opportunities in the dairy sector for GAFSP PrSW/IFC

Overall, our assessment of the dairy sector is that it is currently too small to yield a pipeline of
investment opportunities for GAFSP PrSW/IFC. We consulted with some of the largest dairy
agribusinesses in Myanmar and they are generally operating at a size that would make it infeasible to
support investments in a project size in excess of US$5m. This reflects the fact that the dairy sector
in Myanmar is currently too small to support large investment, given current demand for milk.
