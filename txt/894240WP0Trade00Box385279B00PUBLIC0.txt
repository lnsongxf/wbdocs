World Bank for the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF).

The Caribbean trade report is the result of collaborative efforts of a large team led by Calvin Zebaze Djiofack (LCSPE), and including Erwin H. R. Tiongson, Massimiliano
Cali, Jose Daniel Reyes, Claire Honore Hollweg, Maros Ivanic, Julie Saty Lohi, Mathias Thoenig, Thierry Mayer, Sashana Whyte, Tania Valeria Diaz Bazan, Dominique

The Caribbean Knowledge Series is an occasional series that presents World Bank knowledge in an accessible format. It is meant to assist knowledge sharing across
the region and trigger policy dialogue on topics relevant for the Caribbean.

This note was prepared to support the participatory policy dialogue in the context of the Caribbean Growth Forum (CGF). The CGF is an initiative facilitated by the Compete
Caribbean Program, the Inter-American Development Bank, the World Bank and the Caribbean Development Bank, with the support of the Department for Foreign Affairs,
Trade and Development of Canada, the United Kingdom’s Agency for International Development, CARICOM Secretariat, the University of the West Indies, the European
Union and Caribbean Export. It aims to facilitate a multi-stakeholder dialogue to identify practical solutions for the growth challenge in the Caribbean. To learn more about

workers, see Iacovone and Javorcick (2013) and Verhoogen (2008). On exporting and gender employment, see Korinek (2005).

and time between the relative position of women in society and the level of economic development (Duﬂo, 2012).
