THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 1,364,270,000

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in this year’s economy

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?

Underlying the indicators shown in this chapter for
                                                               STANDARDIZED COMPANY
China is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Limited Liability Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and             Paid-in minimum capital requirement: CNY 0
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available           City: Shanghai, Beijing
information on business entry in that economy.
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,            Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
along with the associated time and cost. These
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

                                                                                    complete
       Obtain a notice of pre-approval of the company name

       The applicant picks up the application for company name pre-approval
       from the local Administration of Industry and Commerce (AIC), or
       otherwise, downloads the form from AIC’s Web site. The applicant can
       be the representative designated by all the shareholders or the agent
       entrusted by all the shareholders. The completed application form shall
       be signed by all shareholders of the company. The application form
       together with the business licenses or other registration certificates (if
       the shareholders are companies or other eligible entities) and the
       photocopy of the identity card of the individual shareholders shall be
       filed with the AIC. Effective July 1, 2004, enterprise name registration
       must follow the amended State Administration of Industry and                  1 day           no charge
   1
       Commerce (SAIC) rules (that is, the new Enterprise Name Registration
       Administration Implementing Measures, or qi ye ming cheng deng ji
       guan li shi shi ban fa). According to the new registration rules, if the
       applicant goes directly to the AIC, a proposed company name is
       approved or rejected on the spot. This is newly regulated by Article 24
       of the aforementioned measures and is implemented in practice.
       However if the application is made through mail, fax, email, etc, the
       proposed company name will be approved or rejected within 15 days.

      legal person" with SAIC, the organization code certificate issued by
      the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau and registration
      for both state and local tax with the tax bureau

      Since July 2010, it has been possible to use the "parallel application and
      review" process in most districts of Shanghai. The entrepreneur can
      submit the documents for business license, certificate for quality and
      technology and state and local tax at the same time at one window. All
      the application forms can be downloaded from SAIC’s website. The
      agent at the window will scan all the documents and send them
      electronically to all relevant agencies. The business license is approved
      first and the two other agencies can give their approval immediately
      after. They are notified online once the business license has been
      approved. According to the Notice of the Ministry of Finance and the
      National Development and Reform Commission on Cancellation,
      Suspension and Exemption of Certain Administrative Charges issued on
      December 23, 2014 and effective on January 1, 2015, the registration
      fee for enterprise establishment has been cancelled since January 1,
      2015.

      1/ BUSINESS LICENSE:
      To obtain registration certification, the company must file a completed
      application form along with the following documents:
      • Notice of approval of company name
      • Lease or other proof of company office.
2     • Articles of association, executed by each shareholder                      11 days       no charge

      company’s legal representative
      • Other documents as required by the authorities

      According to the new administrative rules, application forms may be
      downloaded from the local government authorities’ Web sites.
      Statutory time limits were introduced for acceptance of application
      documents and for registration decision making, which differs
      according to the form of application. Documentation requirements for
      company registration were standardized. The Registry is now required
      to publicly display them.

      According to Article 52, if an application is filed (by letter, telegraph,
      telex, fax, email, or electronic data exchange), the Company Registry
      must, within 5 days of receiving the relevant application documents and
      materials, decide whether to accept the application. If the application
      documents and materials are incomplete or do not meet the statutory
      requirements, the Registry must inform the applicant, within 5 days, of
      all contents subject to supplementation and correction.

      According to Article 54, if the organ in charge of company registration
      must verify the application documents and materials, it shall decide

      whether to approve the registration within 15 days of acceptance. In
      other cases, the organ must decide whether to approve the registration

      registration, it shall issue a “notice on approval for establishment

      form with the Shanghai Organization Code Management Center (a
      branch of the Quality and Technology Supervision Bureau) along with
      the following documents:
      • Business license (original and one copy)
      • Identity card of the legal representative (one copy)

      The cost for Organization Code Certificate is exempted for micro or a
      small size companies. For other companies, the cost of CNY 120 shall
      apply, which includes a technical service fee of CNY 82, a production
      cost of IC Card of CNY 20 and a production fee for the original and
      duplicate copy of the certificate of CNY 10 and CNY 8, respectively.



      3/ REGISTRATION WITH LOCAL AND STATE TAXES:
      The tax registration procedures have been simplified since 2004 with
      the implementation of the Administration Measures of Tax Registration,
      issued by the State Taxation Bureau. Two separate taxation authorities
      still exist (the state taxation bureau and local taxation bureau). However,
      company founders are required to file tax registration only once, to
      either of these two authorities. The statutory time limit is 30 days from
      the date of receiving the registration application.

      The company must file the tax registration form and the initial tax
      reporting forms. Together with those forms, the company submits for
      review the following documents:
      • Business license certificate (original and one copy)
      • Organization Code Certificate (original and one copy)
      • Articles of Association and Shareholders' Agreement (one copy)

      * Register construction drawings at the Civil Defense Office

      Commercial warehouses do not need approval by the Civil
      Defense Office. However, the builder still needs to present the
      design of the warehouse for registration and filing. This needs to   10 days       no charge

      be prepared by an authorized supervision agency.

      Agency: Civil Defense Office



      * Hire an authorized supervision agency

      BuildCo must hire a supervision agency to supervise and ensure
      the quality and safety of the construction.

      There is no uniform price for hiring a supervisor. The cost should
      be calculated as follows:
      1. Designing step: if the budgetary estimate of the project design
      is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the cost is calculated as 0.44 %
      (1,279,322 x 0.44%= CNY 5,629) of the budgetary estimate of the
      project design.
      2. Building and repairing step: if the budgetary estimate of the
      project building and repairing is less than CNY 5,000,000.00, the
6     cost is calculated as 3.3% (1,279,322 x 3.3% = CNY 42,217.6) of       1 day      CNY 164,727
      the budgetary estimate. The new value is CNY 42,217.6 + CNY
      5,629 = CNY 47,846.6. Additionally builders need to pay CNY
      78,036.00 (CNY 60.00 per square meter) for designs to be
      presented to the People's Civil Defense office.

      These calculations are according to the Notice on the Standard
      of Industry-Directed Price for the Construction Supervision
      Agency Fees of Shanghai’ (Hu Jiang Jiang Xiezi [2001], No. 20,
      effective January 1, 2002).

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

      Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party
      is entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned 26 calendar days
      land, there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right”   (simultaneous          no cost

      and the “allocated land use right”. The difference is that the granted land
                                                                                  with procedure 3)
      use right is limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land
      use right is usually given for free with no time limit, but for specific
      purposes only. A private party also may transfer to another private party
      the granted land use right. The allocated land use right cannot be
      commercially transferable before being converted into granted land use

      right. In this case, the land is used for commercial purposes. Usually land
      for commercial use is owned by the State, and the relevant land use right
      is the State-owned land use right. As to the term of the land use right in
      this case the buyer, who will use the land for commercial purposes, will
      only get 40 years as the initial term (as maximum unless it extends the
      granted land use rights at the end of the 40 year period by paying to the
      State the additional land price) minus the period from the granting date
      from the State to the date of the transfer to ABC. If the land is zoned for
      industrial use or warehousing use rather than for commercial use, the
      maximum land tenure should be 50 years.

      Private ownership of land is not permitted in China; all land is subject to
      either State ownership or collective ownership. However, a private party
      is entitled to obtain the right to use the land. Regarding the State-owned
      land, there are two types of land use rights, the “granted land use right”
      and the “allocated land use right”. The difference is that the granted land
      use right is limited in time against payment, whereas the allocated land
      use right is usually given for free with no time limit, but for specific          7 days
      purposes only. A private party also may transfer to another private party (simultaneous             No cost

      In this case, the land is used for commercial purposes. Usually land for
      commercial use is owned by the State, and the relevant land use right is
      the State-owned land use right. As to the term of the land use right in
      this case the buyer, who will use the land for commercial purposes, will
      only get 40 years as the initial term (as maximum unless it extends the
      granted land use rights at the end of the 40 year period by paying to the

PAYING TAXES
Economies around the world have made paying taxes                 and exemptions. Many have lowered tax rates. Changes
faster, easier and less costly for businesses—such as by          have brought concrete results. Some economies
consolidating payments and filings of taxes, offering             simplifying tax payment and reducing rates have seen
electronic systems for filing and payment, establishing           tax revenue rise. What tax reforms has Doing Business

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                                             Bankruptcy law, the reorganization plan must be approved by the

score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 in the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
