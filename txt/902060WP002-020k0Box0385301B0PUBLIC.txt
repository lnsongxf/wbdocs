I.     INTRODUCTION

A.       International Comparison Program

    The International Comparison Program (ICP) started as a modest research project of the
University of Pennsylvania and the United Nations Statistical Office in the late 1960s. It is now a
worldwide statistical operation managed by the ICP Global Office (GO) located in the World Bank
in Washington. It collects detailed price and expenditure data with which to calculate purchasing
power parities (PPPs) for participating countries. The PPPs are used to produce internationally
comparable price and volume measures for gross domestic product (GDP) and its component
expenditures, such as private consumption, government consumption and investment. The price
measures reflect the differences in price levels between countries and the volume measures make it
possible to compare the output of countries and the welfare of their inhabitants in real terms. To
collect the price and expenditure data required to calculate PPPs, the ICP holds a round of surveys
every five or six years. The surveys cover the whole range of final goods and services comprising
GDP: consumer goods and services, government services and capital goods.

    The last round of surveys was in 2005. This was the largest round to date covering 146 countries.
These included countries from the five ICP geographical regions - Africa, Asia and the Pacific,
Commonwealth of Independent States, Latin America, and Western Asia - as well as the countries
that participate in the PPP program managed by the Statistical Office of the European Communities
(Eurostat) and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
Responsibility for the ICP within regions was shared between national coordinators (NCs) and
regional coordinators (RCs). NCs, usually the national statistical agencies of participating countries,
carried out data collection and data validation. RCs, usually a regional organization such as the
Asian Development Bank (ADB) for the Asia and Pacific region, provided methodological guidance
and coordinated data collection and data validation. They also put together and finalized the regional
comparisons as well as publishing the results of the comparisons. Responsibility for ensuring that
common methodology, standards and procedures were followed by regions rested with the GO. It
was also responsible for ensuring that the regional comparisons could be combined in a world
comparison and for combining them. The GO published final results for the world comparison in
July 2008. They included imputed PPPs and volume measures for 39 countries that did not
participate in the comparison. The next round of surveys is scheduled for 2011.

B.       Improving quality

    To improve the quality of the ICP data in the 2005 round, much effort went into harmonizing and
standardizing practices in countries and regional offices. RCs were brought together by the GO on a
regular basis to discuss methodology and processes. Effort went into ensuring countries used the
same methodology and compatible data collection procedures. NCs met on a regular basis with their
RC to ensure consistency. The ICP Handbook and the ICP Operational Manual were developed to


                                                                                                     5
ensure a common understanding and use of the methodology. A huge effort went into the preparation
of specifications for the products to be priced. Software was developed to ensure that the same rigid
data validation was applied.

     Efforts to improve the quality of ICP data and statistics will continue throughout the 2011 round.
To promote these efforts, the GO has had the ICP Quality Assurance Framework, or ICP-QAF,
drafted. The framework is structured to evaluate the quality of the 2011 round in terms of (1) ICP
processes in countries, regional offices, and the GO, and (2) ICP input data (prices and final
expenditures) and ICP output data (PPPs, price level indices and volume measures). The framework
is still a work-in-progress and some modification may be required, but successful application during
the 2011 round will mean it can be used to appraise the quality of rounds that follow.

C.       ICP Quality Assurance Framework

    ICP-QAF is derived from the IMF-DQAF – that is the Data Quality Assessment Framework that
has been developed by the International Monetary Fund. The IMF-DQAF brings together best
practices and internationally accepted concepts and definitions in statistics, including those of the
United Nations Fundamental Principles of Official Statistics and the General Data Dissemination
System of the IMF. It provides a structure for assessing data quality by comparing country statistical
practices with best practices. It focuses on the quality-related features of governance of statistical
systems, core statistical processes, and statistical products. It has been developed to introduce rigor,
structure, and a common language in the assessment of the quality of macroeconomic data.

                                                             responsibility as well as the authority
                                                             to an agency (agencies) for the
                                                             collection,       processing,      and
                                                             dissemination of the statistics.




                                                                                                       6
    The IMF-DQAF is organized in a cascading structure that progresses from the abstract and
general to the concrete and specific. It has five levels shown in the table above. The first level covers
six dimensions of quality: the prerequisites of quality (which, strictly speaking, are not dimensions
of quality), assurances of integrity, methodological soundness, accuracy and reliability,
serviceability, and accessibility. For each of these six dimensions, there are elements at the second
level and indicators at the third level. At the next level, the fourth level, there are focal issues that are
specific to the particular data sets being addressed. And finally, below focal issues at the fifth level,
there are key points that suggest quality features that it may be fruitful to consider in addressing the
focal issues. Key points are not meant to be exhaustive.

    The ICP-QAF has the same cascading structure, but consists of only four levels. Level 3, the
indicator level, has been dropped to avoid, what is in most cases, unnecessary repetition.

    The IMF-DQAF was developed with specific macroeconomic data sets, typically compiled by a
single institution in each country, in mind. The ICP does not conform to this model and has the
following three levels of operation:

   World level: The GO carries out the day-to-day work required to implement the ICP worldwide.
    The GO reports regularly to the ICP Executive Board with annual work programs and budgets
    requiring the approval of the Board. Important activities carried out by the GO and its external
    consultants are the development of ICP standards, the preparation of the framework to determine
    the goods and services to be priced, preparing the ICP Handbook and the ICP Operational
    Manual, producing the software for countries to edit and input price data, analyzing data
    collected for the ICP, organizing the price collection for world comparison and the price
    collections for dwelling services, government services and capital goods, aggregating the price
    and final expenditure data within and between regions and disseminating the results of the world
    comparison. The GO incorporates the Eurostat-OECD results directly into the world comparison
    by treating the Eurostat-OECD group of countries as a sixth ICP region. The GO also imputes
    PPP and volume measures for economies that do not participate in the benchmark comparison.

   Regional level: RCs coordinate ICP work in each of the five ICP geographical regions - Africa,
    Asia and the Pacific, Commonwealth of Independent States, Latin America, and Western Asia.
    The RCs are responsible for developing regional price lists, data collection, data validation of
    prices and final expenditures from NCs, and compilation and dissemination of the regional
    results.

   Country level: NCs are responsible for assembling the country’s ICP data - national final
    expenditures, prices for consumer products, equipment goods and construction, compensation of
    employees for selected occupations in government, actual and imputed rents, quantitative and
    qualitative data on the dwelling stock, population and exchange rates - in accordance with ICP
    requirements and transmitting them to the RC. This entails ensuring that statistical staff,
    particularly price collectors, are trained in the concepts underlying the ICP and the practical
    implications of collecting prices; that data are edited and entered into the ICP data base; and that
    editing queries from the RC are handled promptly. The NCs also attend the data validation
    workshops that are held in each of the regions to check the consistency of the data supplied
    within each region.




                                                                                                           7
    Any adaptation of the IMF-DQAF to the ICP has to recognize and accommodate the complex
data collection and compilation arrangements that apply to the Program. There are two possible
ways of doing this. One is to have an ICP-QAF for each level; the other is to have a generic ICP-
QAF applicable to all levels that can be made level specific as and when required. As the majority of
focal issues and key points are common to all levels, it has been decided to opt for the second
approach. The result is an ICP-QAF applicable to the three organizational levels but with their
divergences noted.



II.    PREREQUISITES OF QUALITY

    Although they themselves are not dimensions of quality, this group of “pointers-to-quality”
comprises institutional preconditions for the quality of statistics. Note that the focus is on the agency
or agencies concerned with the statistics specified. In the case of ICP statistics, these are the agencies
performing the functions of Global Office (GO), Regional Coordinator (RC), or National
Coordinator (NC).

A.         The legal and institutional environment is supportive of statistics

i.      The primary responsibility for collecting, processing, and disseminating ICP statistics is
clearly established.

            A formal provision assigns primary responsibility, as well as the authority, to an agency
             to perform the GO/RC/NC functions for the collection, processing, and dissemination of
             ICP statistics. Such a provision could be a resolution of the UN Statistical Commission, a
             memorandum of understanding, or a statistical law.

            Working arrangements are consistent with this assignment of responsibility.

            Given that more than one data producing agency is involved in producing ICP statistics,
             arrangements are in place to promote consistency of methods and results.

            Conflicts or potential conflicts between the formal authority to produce ICP statistics and
             other laws or provisions, such as an access to information law or the internal policies or
             processes of the GO/RC/NC agency, have been successfully resolved or reconciled with
             no major impairment to data production.

ii.    Arrangements or procedures exist to facilitate data sharing and coordination between the
agency (agencies) with the primary responsibility for compiling ICP statistics and other data
producing agencies.

            Procedures are in place to provide for the effective and timely flow of source data, such
             as price and national expenditure data, to the NC from other data producing agencies
             within the country, to the RC from the NCs, and to the GO from the RCs.




                                                                                                        8
          Contacts, through regular meetings and workshops as well as other means, are maintained
           with other data producing agencies to promote a proper understanding of data
           requirements, to avoid duplication of effort, and to take into account appropriate
           allocation of responsibilities.

iii.   The confidentiality of individual data is guaranteed and the guarantee is widely known.

          A law or other formal provision, such as the internal rules of the GO/RC/NC agency,
           clearly states that individual data, such as the prices observed at a specific outlet or the
           prices observed for a particular product, are to be treated as confidential and shall not be
           disclosed or used for purposes other than statistical purposes unless disclosure is agreed
           to in writing.

          In data collection activities, respondents are informed of their rights and obligations with
           regard to the provision of information, and they are informed that the information they
           provide will be used only for the purpose of producing statistics.

iv.    Procedures are in place to prevent disclosure of individual data.

          Rules and regulations to prevent disclosure of individual data include penalties against
           staff who disclose such data.

          Access to individual data is restricted to staff who require the data in the performance of
           their statistical duties.

          Special aggregation rules are used to prevent residual disclosure when aggregations of
           individual data are submitted (NCs and RCs) or disseminated (RCs and GO).

          Staff review all data prepared for submission (NCs and RCs) and dissemination (RCs and
           GO) for possible indirect disclosure of individual data.

          Where data beyond those in public releases are made available for purposes such as
           research, the confidentiality of the individual data is protected.

          Confidentiality of individual data is appropriately guarded during storage and during the
           process of the destruction of records.

          Steps are taken to secure the premises of the GO/RC/NC agency and its computer
           systems to prevent unauthorized access to individual data.

v.     A law or other formal provision provides for the reporting of information needed to compile
ICP statistics.

          The GO/RC/NC agency has the formal authority to collect data required to compile ICP
           statistics.

          Collection activity is consistent with the formal authority.



                                                                                                     9
vi.      Other mechanisms are in place to provide for adequate reporting of data for compiling ICP
statistics.

          The GO/RC/NC agency carefully considers practical issues, such as the availability of
           data and the options for collecting data, that may arise in compiling ICP statistics and
           periodically evaluates current and alternative approaches.

          The GO/RC/NC agency provides assistance in completing and submitting forms to those
           reporting data to it. For example, by providing a point of contact.

          The GO/RC/NC agency seeks to secure cooperation by creating goodwill. For example,
           by registering and dealing with emerging issues, indicating the purpose of the data
           collection, informing of measures to limit response burden, raising awareness of the
           importance of good quality statistics, and supplying data providers with data upon
           request.

B.      Resources are commensurate with the needs of the statistical program and measures
to ensure efficient use of resources are implemented.

          Salary levels are adequate for the nature of the work and consistent with those in
           comparable occupations and employment. International civil servants in the case of GO
           and RCs; national civil servants in the case of NCs.

ii.    Computing resources for compiling ICP statistics are adequate to perform required tasks.

          Overall, sufficient resources are allocated and best efforts are made to exploit the full
           potential of effective computing technology for compiling, submitting and disseminating
           ICP statistics.

          Software utilized for compiling and analyzing ICP statistics, such as the “Toolpack”
           system, is effective, periodically updated, and well adapted to perform existing and
           emerging tasks.

          Hardware available to GO/RC/NC staff is distributed adequately to facilitate the efficient
           collection and processing of data, and management of data bases.




                                                                                                   10
          Adequate protection is provided for computer resources, including the provision of
           emergency back-up systems for retrieval of ICP data in the event of natural disasters,
           accidents, and other unusual events.

iii.   Physical facilities and other resources are adequate to perform required tasks.

          Office building provides working facilities, such as lighting, heating, cooling, and space,
           which are adequate for the performance of required tasks.

          Office furniture and equipment, such as desks, chairs, filing cabinets, telephones, and
           related equipment, are adequate for the performance of required tasks.

iv.    Funding for compiling ICP statistics is adequate to perform required tasks.

          Funding is reasonably secure for the identified needs of the ICP both within the
           GO/RC/NC agency and for the global/regional/national program more generally.

          Budgeting practices provide clear information to financing authorities. For example,
           when reviewing priorities for improvements, cutbacks, or increase in certain elements of
           the program.

          The funding horizon is amenable to planning for statistical developments over the full
           cycle of an ICP round.

v.     Management ensures that resources are used efficiently.

          Periodic reviews of staff performance are conducted.

          Efficiencies are sought through (1) periodic reviews of work processes in which, among
           other things, the cost effectiveness of program design in relation to objectives is assessed;
           and (2) the adoption of consistent concepts, classifications and other methodologies
           across data sets.

          When necessary, the GO/RC/NC agency seeks outside expert assistance to evaluate
           statistical methodologies and compilation systems.

vi.   Costing and budgeting practices are in place and provide sufficient information to
management to make appropriate decisions.

          Resources used to compile ICP statistics are measured periodically and compared to other
           statistical programs.

          Budgeting procedures are used to help allocate resources.




                                                                                                     11
C.         Relevance

i.     Specific actions are taken to ensure that current ICP statistics meet needs of users.

           Users are consulted and kept informed on specific aspects of current ICP data - such as
            their usefulness in terms of detail, periodicity, and timeliness - through surveys,
            newsletters or seminars. Users’ feedback is actively sought through, for example, the
            provision of an e-mail address to contact.

ii.    Mechanisms are in place to identify new and emerging data requirements.

           A structured and periodic process of consultation takes place with key policy
            stakeholders and other principal users - such as academia, the press, and other private
            sector representatives - to review the usefulness of existing ICP statistics and to identify
            any emerging requirements that may need to be taken into account in the next ICP round.

           The GO/RC/NC agency regularly participates in statistical meetings and seminars
            organized by international and regional organizations and by professional organizations
            such as International Statistical Institute and International Association for Official
            Statistics.

           The GO/RC/NC agency carries out studies to help identify new and emerging data
            requirements that may need to be taken into account in the next ICP Round.

D.         Other quality management

i.     There is recognition throughout the GO/RC/NC agency that quality builds trust and thus is a
cornerstone of statistical work.

           Management is sensitive to all dimensions of data quality and promotes a shared concern
            for quality throughout the GO/RC/NC agency. For example, the mission statement
            emphasizes the importance of quality and managers are held accountable for achieving
            quality.

           Staff training programs emphasize the importance of quality and give staff an
            understanding as to how quality may be achieved.

           The GO/RC/NC agency provides an infrastructure for quality by recognizing trade-offs,
            economies of scale, and interrelations between data sets.

           The GO/RC/NC agency has implemented externally recognized processes or activities
            that focus on quality. For example, Total Quality Management, ISO 9000, quality
            initiatives of the UN sponsored Committee for the Coordination of Statistical Activities,
            and independent evaluations.

           Information is publicly available on the GO/RC/NC agency’s commitment to quality,
            including information about trade-offs affecting the statistical work program.



                                                                                                     12
ii.    Measures are in place for a systematic monitoring and review of quality.

            Monitoring processes are in place to inform managers on the quality achieved during the
             ICP round. For example, data gaps, editing rates and adherence to timetables.

            The GO/RC/NC agency has access to expert guidance on the quality of their data and on
             strategies for improving data quality.

            Periodic reviews are carried out to identify steps necessary to maintain or improve data
             quality in future ICP rounds.

iii.   When planning the ICP, quality issues, including implicit and explicit trade-offs among the
dimensions of quality, are considered.

            Quality issues, such as the following, are addressed explicitly and taken into account in
             the work program planning process:

              Quality improvements identified during ongoing monitoring and in periodic reviews.

              Feedback from users on quality standards and on new and emerging data
               requirements.

              Trade-offs among the dimensions of quality, such as between resource availability,
               timeliness, accuracy and reliability.



III.   ASSURANCES OF INTEGRITY

           This dimension relates to the adherence to the principle of objectivity in the collection,
       compilation, submission and dissemination of statistics. The dimension encompasses
       institutional arrangements that ensure professionalism in statistical policies and practices,
       transparency, and ethical standards. Again the focus is primarily on the agencies responsible
       for collecting, processing, submission and disseminating ICP statistics, namely: the agencies
       performing the functions of GO, RC or NC.

A.         Professionalism

i.     The terms or conditions under which ICP statistics are produced are in accordance with
professional independence.

            A law or other formal provision supports professional independence by:

              Addressing the general need for professional independence by the Global Manager
               (GM)/RC/NC and, in doing so, the importance of professional independence in
               carrying out statistical functions is clearly stated and recognized.




                                                                                                     13
            Prohibiting interference from others in the compilation, submission (NCs and RCs)
             and dissemination (RCs and GO) of ICP data and statistics.

            Ensuring that the choice, tenure, and reporting arrangements of the GM/RC/NC are
             supportive of the professional independence required for GM/RC/NC functions. For
             example, tenure is consistent with the timeframe of an ICP round; appointment and
             removal of the GM/RC/NC results from transparent processes with emphasis on
             professional qualifications and performance.

          If there is no law or formal provision to support professional independence:

            Traditions or cultures of professionalism are clearly recognized as essential to the
             credibility of statistical results. For example, others within the agency hosting the
             GM/RC/NC understand the importance of non-interference.

            The choice, tenure, and reporting arrangements of the GM/RC/NC are supportive of
             the professional independence required for GM/RC/NC functions.

ii.    Professionalism is actively promoted and supported within the GO/RC/NC agency.

          In the context of the general personnel policies and practices applying in the GO/RC/NC
           agency, recruitment and promotion are, as far as possible, based on relevant aptitude and
           expertise in ICP requirements. For example, expertise in project management and prices
           and national accounts subject matter.

          Formal training by internal and outside experts and on-the-job training in methodology
           and compilation methods is provided. This is includes participation in seminars, courses,
           and workshops to further knowledge of statistical practices and providing easy access to
           professional literature.

          Processes and activities in the workplace promote a culture of professionalism. For
           example, by professional accreditation of staff, peer review of statistical work,
           recognition of authors of methodological papers, organization of lectures and
           conferences, and the institutional support of professional bodies.

          Research and analysis, including rationale for the choice of methodologies, are
           encouraged and published subject to internal review and other processes to maintain the
           GO/RC/NC agency’s reputation for professionalism.

iii.     The choices of data sources and statistical techniques for the ICP are informed solely by
statistical considerations.

          The choice of source data for the ICP is based on measurement objectives and data
           requirements.




                                                                                                     14
iv.     Decisions about the submission (NCs and RCs) and dissemination (RCs and GO) of ICP data
are informed solely by statistical considerations.

           Decisions to submit and disseminate ICP data are based on statistical considerations
            solely.

           Decisions about the timing, media, and other aspects of submission and dissemination of
            ICP data are based solely on statistical considerations.

v.     The GO/RC/NC agency comments when ICP statistics are misinterpreted or misused.

           The GO/RC/NC agency seeks to prevent misinterpretation or misuse of ICP statistics by
            providing explanatory materials and briefings. To the media for example.

           There is a formal policy or well-established custom to deal with misinterpretations or
            misuse of ICP statistics.

           The GO/RC/NC agency:

             Monitors media coverage of ICP statistics (“clipping service”).

             Comments publicly and in a timely manner on erroneous interpretations or misuse of
              ICP statistics in the media and in other fora.

B.         Transparency

i.       Information is available to the public about the terms and conditions under which ICP
statistics are compiled and disseminated. This includes information on the obligation to compile and
disseminate ICP statistics, the confidentiality of individual data, and other key features.

               GO/RC/NC publications and websites reproduce material about the terms and
                conditions under which ICP statistics are compiled and disseminated. These terms
                and conditions may refer to the formal mandate to compile and disseminate ICP
                statistics, the confidentiality of individual data, such as the prices observed at a
                specific outlet or the prices observed for a particular product, and other key features.
                For example, the codes of conduct under which ICP statistics are compiled and
                disseminated, the approval process for data dissemination, the procedures to hire and
                remove the GM/RC/NC.

               In public speeches and other gatherings, the GO/RC/NC agency makes an active and
                ongoing effort to inform about the terms and conditions under which it operates.

               Statistical publications identify where more information about the GO/RC/NC agency
                and its products can be found.




                                                                                                     15
ii.     The public is made aware of pre-embargo access to ICP statistics prior to their release to the
public.

            Pre-embargo access arrangements to ICP statistics prior to release are made public in
             terms of who has access, and how long before the dissemination access is given.

iii.   Statistical products are clearly identified so that the public is aware of what the GO/RC/NC
agency takes responsibility for.

            Data released to the public are clearly identified as the GO/RC/NC agency’s product by
             name, logo, and insignia.

            In the case of joint publications, the part attributable to the GO/RC/NC agency is
             identified. For example, statistics are clearly distinguished from policy interpretation.

            The GO/RC/NC agency requests attribution when its statistics are used or reproduced.

iv.    Users of ICP statistics are made aware in advance of major changes in methodology, source
data, and statistical techniques.

            Advance notice is given to the public when major changes are introduced in
             methodology, sources, and statistical techniques employed for ICP statistics. For
             example, through articles in bulletins, briefings, or news releases.

C.         Ethical standards

i.     A clear set of ethical standards has been prepared.

            There are clear guidelines outlining correct behavior when the GO/RC/NC agency or its
             staff is confronted with potential conflict of interest situations. As appropriate, these
             guidelines may be the general guidelines applying to all staff in the hosting agency.

            There are clear guidelines that make the connection between ethics and staff work. For
             example, with respect to guarding against misuse and misrepresentation of ICP data and
             statistics.

            A strong culture for maintaining ethical standards discourages outside interference.

ii.    Staff is made aware of the ethical standards.

            Management acknowledges its status as a role model and is vigilant in following the
             standards.

            New staff is made aware of the standards when they join the GO/RC/NC agency.




                                                                                                    16
            Staff is reminded periodically of the standards. For example, in staff training,
             announcements to staff, or by requiring staff to periodically reaffirm ethical practices or
             adhere to conflict of interest policy.



IV.    METHODOLOGICAL SOUNDNESS

           This dimension covers the idea that the methodological basis for the production of
       statistics should be sound and that this can be attained by following internationally accepted
       standards, guidelines, or good practices. The dimension is necessarily data specific, reflecting
       different methodologies for different sets of data.

           The two principal data sets that countries are required to provide for the ICP are: a set of
       national annual purchasers’ prices for a selection of products chosen from a common basket
       of precisely-defined goods and services; and a set of final expenditures on GDP broken down
       according to a common classification. Both data sets cover the whole range of final goods
       and services included in GDP and both refer to the year of the comparison. Although
       countries have to provide other data, such as annual average exchange rates and the mid-year
       resident population for the reference year, this dimension is primarily concerned with prices
       and expenditures.

           The soundness of the methodological basis of the ICP is assessed in terms of the
       guidelines outlined in the ICP Handbook, which provides the theoretical and methodological
       background to guide data collection, data validation, the estimation of PPPs and real
       expenditures, and subsequent analysis. The GO is responsible for the development of the
       Handbook. It is compiled on the basis of internationally accepted theory and practices
       regarding PPPs and, following peer reviews by internationally recognized experts in price
       statistics and national accounts, is widely acknowledged to be so.

A.         Concepts and definitions

i.    Internationally accepted standards, guidelines, or good practices as detailed in the ICP
Handbook are followed in compiling ICP statistics.

            The ICP Handbook requirements are followed in compiling ICP statistics.

            Deviations from the Handbook requirements are explicitly agreed between the GO, RCs
             and NCs and are kept under review.

B.         Scope

i      The scope of ICP statistics covers all final expenditures included in GDP.

            The scope of the ICP statistics covers the basic headings comprising final expenditures
             on GDP as defined in the version of the UN System of National Accounts (SNA) on
             which the ICP round is based. ICP rounds are currently based on the 1993 SNA.



                                                                                                     17
            GDP estimates of countries participating in the round cover the full range of economic
             activities and transactions that are included in the SNA production boundary.

            Price collection arrangements ensure that national annual prices, consistent with the
             prices underlying expenditure on each of the basic headings, are available for countries
             participating in the round.

            Purchasing power parities and volume estimates for countries that do not participate in
             the round employ internationally accepted estimation techniques. (GO only)

C.         Classification/sectorization

i.     The classification and sectorization used in the compilation of ICP statistics are in broad
conformity with internationally recommended systems.

            The SNA is followed to classify (1) institutional units, (2) transactions and (3) other
             flows.

            The Classification of Final Expenditure on GDP, as specified in the ICP Handbook, is
             used for purposes of price collection and provision of expenditures.

            Deviations from the above classifications/sectorizations are kept under review.

D.         Basis for recording

i.     The valuation rules used for recording flows and stocks are in accordance with the SNA.

            With respect to the final expenditures on GDP compiled for ICP purposes:

              The general rule is that transactions are valued at the actual prices agreed by the
               transactors – that is at purchasers’ prices.

              Imputed rentals of owner occupiers are valued in accordance with the guidelines
               contained in the ICP Handbook.

              Household consumption of goods produced on own account is valued at basic prices.

              Income in kind is valued at purchasers’ prices if the employer has purchased the
               goods or services, or valued at producers’ prices if the goods or services have been
               produced by the enterprise itself.

              Individual consumption expenditure by non-profit institutions serving households is
               valued at cost (that is the sum of the costs of production including the consumption of
               fixed capital).

              Production of individual services by government is valued at cost.




                                                                                                     18
           Purchases of goods and services by government, which are passed on to households
            without any further processing by government, are valued at purchasers’ prices.

           Collective consumption expenditure by government is valued at cost.

           Gross fixed capital formation is valued at purchasers’ prices.

           Own-account production of fixed capital assets is valued at basic prices.

           Change in inventories is valued as the change in the physical quantities of inventories
            at the beginning and end of the year using, preferably, the average prices over the
            year, or prices prevailing in the middle of the year.

           Total imports and exports are valued on an f.o.b. basis.

           Transactions in foreign currency are converted using the mid-point exchange rate
            prevailing in the market at the moment they take place.

           Proper adjustments are made if a system of multiple official exchange rates exists.

           Deviations from the above are kept under review.

         With respect to the prices collected for ICP purposes:

           Prices collected are consistent with those underlying the final expenditures on GDP.

           These prices are collected as national annual prices. If they are not, then accepted
            procedures are used to adjust the prices collected to national annual prices.

           Product specifications include the price-determining characteristics that influence the
            product’s transaction price as well as the product’s technical parameters.

           Deviations from the above are kept them under review.

ii.   The timing rules used for recording flows are in accordance with the SNA.

         Transactions and flows are recorded on an accrual basis.

         Work-in-progress is recorded in the period it is produced.

         Government-related transactions are recorded on an accrual basis. In particular, (1) taxes
          and subsidies on products and (2) expenditures.

         National annual prices relate to the ICP reference year.

         Deviations from the above are kept under review.




                                                                                                  19
iii.   The grossing/netting procedures are in accordance with the SNA.

            Gross fixed capital formation consists of net acquisitions (acquisitions less disposals) of
             fixed assets.

            Valuables are measured as acquisitions less disposals.

            Transaction prices are measured net of discounts or rebates.

            Deviations from the above are kept under review.

E.         Aggregation (GO and RCs only)

i.      Compilation of basic heading PPPs recognizes the concept of representativity and produces
transitive basic heading PPPs.

            The Country-Product-Dummy method with Representativity (CPRD) or the Country-
             Dummy-Product method (CPD), which is an acceptable alternative, is used to estimate
             transitive basic heading PPPs within regions. It is also used between regions to obtain
             transitive basic heading PPPs at the world level.

ii.    Compilation of higher level PPPs avoids bias and produces transitive higher level PPPs.

            Compilation of higher level PPPs involves trade-offs among alternative methods such as
             losing additivity but avoiding the Gerschenkron effect. The method used is therefore
             clearly specified together with reasons for its selection.

            Compilation method produces unbiased transitive higher level PPPs that are invariant to
             the choice of country or numéraire currency.



V.     ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY

           This dimension covers the idea that statistical outputs sufficiently portray the reality of
       the economy. This dimension is also data specific, reflecting the sources used and their
       processing. It focuses on prices and final expenditures, the two principal data sets required
       for the ICP.

A.         Source data

i.     The data collection programs employed to compile the ICP statistics are adequate.

            The data sources of the data collection program are broadly sufficient to compile the ICP
             statistics.




                                                                                                     20
          The data sources are kept under continuous review to ensure that the data collection
           program is comprehensive.

          Information from other available sources supplements core compilation.

ii.   The price collection program is conducted such that adequate price data are available for
ICP purposes.

          The Structured Product Descriptions (SPDs) provide a sound basis for the generation of
           product specifications for price survey purposes.

          The GO/RC/NC agency provides adequate oversight of the global/regional/national price
           collection programs.

          Price recording forms are constructed according to sound design principles. For example,
           they are subject to pilot testing in the field. They are reviewed periodically to take
           account of changed circumstances, and proposed changes are pre-tested to ensure
           effectiveness.

          The price collection framework ensures that prices collected are suitable for the direct
           calculation of national annual prices or their estimation by acceptable procedures.

          The national annual prices are consistent with those underlying the final expenditures on
           GDP.

          Price data are collected by product using precise and detailed product specifications to
           ensure that comparable products are priced in each country.

          Price data collected are sufficiently detailed to enable adequate data verification.

          The price collection framework supports supplementary collections to allow the
           unscheduled ad hoc collection of data to support the main collections.

          GO only:

            The GO manages the price collections for items that are difficult-to-price items
             including housing services, equipment goods, construction and government services
             and, in doing so, provides specific direction to RCs and NCs.

            Adequate inter-regional validation is undertaken by the GO of the prices of difficult-
             to-price items collected by countries in the various regions.

            Adequate validation is undertaken of prices collected directly by the GO to ensure
             that national annual prices, consistent with those underlying the final expenditures on
             GDP, are available.




                                                                                                  21
            Selection of items to be included in the Core Product List - which is to be priced by
             all countries participating in the round - is based on objective criteria aimed at
             computing robust factors to link the regions in the world comparison.

            The GO provides specific direction to RCs on the selection of items from the Core
             Product List to be included in the regional list and on the subsequent selection of core
             items for pricing by countries in their regions.

            Adequate inter-regional validation is undertaken by the GO of core product prices
             collected by countries in the various regions.

            The GO ensures that the national annual prices for core products are consistent with
             those underlying the final expenditures on GDP.

iii.   GDP and the main expenditure aggregates are available for weighting purposes and to
generate volume estimates.

          GDP data, broken down into basic headings, are available for the reference year (NCs)
           and for all participating countries (RCs and GO). (These data are used as weights in
           compiling higher level PPPs and are deflated to generate internationally comparable
           volume estimates for basic headings and for the various for levels of aggregation up to
           and including GDP.)

          GDP data respect SNA guidelines as far as possible but may be deficient in minor
           respects. (“Minor” in this sense means that the deficiencies do not seriously affect the
           level of total GDP or the relative shares of household consumption, government
           consumption and capital formation.)

iv.     Ad hoc data collections are carried when needed to fill data gaps or to complement data
collected in the main surveys.

          Ad-hoc data collections are carried out, as necessary, to fill data gaps or to complement
           data already collected.

v.     ICP data collection programs are sufficiently open and versatile to allow for new
developments in sources.

          Periodic meetings are held with interested parties to identify new developments that need
           to be taken into account in price collections and national accounts compilations.

          The press and research papers are monitored for information on activities that need to be
           taken into account in ICP work.

          International standards, guidelines, and practices are monitored for changes that need to
           be taken into account in ICP work.

          The GO/RC/NC agencies consult with each other to ascertain changes in circumstances
           that may affect ICP statistics.


                                                                                                  22
vi.     ICP source data approximate the definitions, scope, classifications, and valuation, and time
of recording required.

             Pilot tests have been conducted to ensure that price data collected will allow compilation
              of estimates according to ICP guidelines.

             Final expenditures on GDP are consistent with the time of recording, reference periods,
              and valuation requirements of ICP statistics.

             Final expenditures on GDP are broken down by basic heading in line with the ICP
              classification.

vii.    The ICP data collection program provides adequate coverage of economic activities.

             The frequency of price collection is sufficient to approximate annual prices.

             The geographic spread of the price collection is sufficient to approximate national prices.

             If either or both of the above do not apply, accepted procedures are used to estimate
              national annual prices.

viii.   The ICP data collection program provides for the timely receipt of data.

             Data collection and processing timetables are adequate to meet timeliness and periodicity
              for the submission of ICP data (NCs and RCs) and the dissemination of ICP statistics
              (RCs and GO).

             The GO/RC/NC agencies employ rigorous follow-up procedures to ensure the timely
              receipt of source data.

B.          Assessment of source data

i.      Accuracy of country data is routinely assessed.

             Country final expenditure data are analyzed to ensure they are adequate, in terms of
              comprehensiveness, level of detail, and being up-to-date, for ICP purposes.

             Editing procedures - for example, the standard deviation of prices at the national level
              and the residuals from the CPD method at the regional level - are used to assess price
              variability and to identify outliers and other atypical differences in price data for
              individual countries. Extreme values are confirmed and records maintained on the
              confirmation.

             Country data are also analyzed to correct for underreporting or misreporting and, in
              particular, to check for (1) inter-country consistency and (2) consistency with other
              related source data.




                                                                                                       23
ii.    Accuracy of the information from administrative and other supplementary sources is
routinely assessed.

            Accuracy of administrative and other supplementary data used to verify the credibility of
             ICP statistics is routinely assessed.

C.         Statistical techniques

i.     ICP data compilation procedures are sound.

            Compilation procedures minimize processing errors such as coding, editing, and
             tabulation errors.

            Adjustments to source data are made only when it is clearly warranted. For example,
             validated outliers are not replaced or modified unless clearly required and then only after
             confirmation with the country concerned.

            Procedures for imputation and adjustment for non-response are soundly based.

ii.    Appropriate measures are taken to validate ICP source data.

            Sound estimation techniques are employed to adjust data for missing observations.

            Adjustments for under-coverage follow appropriate guidelines. Grossing-up factors are
             derived scientifically.

iii.   Appropriate techniques are used to ensure data used for weighting purposes are consistent
with ICP requirements.

            Statistical procedures used to adjust final expenditure data to meet ICP requirements
             follow a detailed, case-by-case, approach using specific sources that are most closely
             related to the estimated variables and pertinent to the reference period.

            Changes to data are only made with the concurrence of the country concerned.

iv.     Generally-accepted good-practice statistical techniques are used to compile national annual
prices.

            National annual prices are compiled in accordance with the guidelines for price collection
             and validation as set out in the ICP Handbook.

v.     Generally-accepted good-practice statistical techniques are used to compile the purchasing
power parities. (GO and RCs only.)

            Compilation of basic heading PPPs recognizes the concept of representativity and
             produces transitive basic heading PPPs.




                                                                                                     24
            Compilation of higher level PPPs avoids bias and produces transitive higher level PPPs
             that are invariant to the choice of country or numéraire currency.

D.         Assessment and validation of intermediate data and statistical outputs

i.     Intermediate results are validated against other independent data.

            Intermediate data used to compile national annual prices and national accounts
             expenditures for ICP purposes are checked against other independent data sources where
             available.

ii.   The discrepancies in intermediate data are routinely investigated and measures taken to
remove them.

            A systemic procedure, such as the Quaranta table or the Dikhanov table, exists to
             routinely assess the potential discrepancies in intermediate data.

            Appropriate adjustments are made to remove the discrepancies in consultation with the
             countries concerned.

iii.   Unusual or unexpected differences in PPPs among countries are investigated.

            Unusual or unexpected differences among PPPs, such as those arising from incorrect
             weights, are investigated.

            Comparisons with data from previous ICP rounds are used to check the credibility of the
             latest results.

E.         Revision studies

i.     Revision studies are undertaken on a regular basis.

            Studies are carried out to assess the initial estimates for the ICP round against revised or
             final estimates. They comprise (1) studies of scale (magnitude of revision and number of
             times series revised) and (2) studies of direction of revisions.

            Studies investigate the sources of errors, omissions, and fluctuations in the data and
             explain the methods of revising the data.

ii.    Measures are undertaken to incorporate the findings from revision studies in data
compilation.

            Findings from revision studies are used to define the optimal publication cycle that is
             largely driven by the availability of country data.

            Findings from revision studies are used to refine preliminary data and data collection
             programs for subsequent ICP rounds.



                                                                                                      25
            Adequate documentation on revisions is maintained and includes description of causes of
             revisions, methods used to incorporate new data sources, the consultations that took place
             between GO, RCs and NCs, and the way data are adjusted.



VI.    SERVICE ABILITY

           This dimension relates to the requirement that statistics are disseminated with an
       appropriate periodicity in a timely fashion, are consistent internally and with other major data
       sets, and follow a regular revision policy.

A.         Periodicity and timeliness

i.   The periodicity of ICP statistics follows understandings reached at the UN Statistical
Commission.

            ICP statistics are compiled every six years.

ii.  The timeliness of ICP statistics follows understandings reached at the UN Statistical
Commission.

            ICP statistics are disseminated two years after the reference year. This is comparable with
             the timeliness of the parallel Eurostat-OECD program.

B.         Consistency

i.     ICP statistics are internally consistent.

            Price data are consistent with the valuation basis of national accounts expenditure data. In
             other words, there is consistency within the value = volume x price framework.

ii.    ICP statistics are consistent over time.

            Detailed methodological notes identify and explain the main breaks and discontinuities in
             methods, source data and statistical techniques between ICP rounds. The causes for the
             breaks and discontinues are explained as are their potential impacts on ICP statistics.

            Unusual changes in economic trends are explained in the analytical text included in the
             publication and in the data base accessible to users.

iii.   ICP statistics from the latest round are consistent or reconcilable with those derived from
previous ICP rounds.

            Users are advised of the differences between the statistics from the latest ICP round and
             those derived from previous ICP rounds. The reasons for the differences are also
             explained.



                                                                                                      26
C.         Revision policy and practice

i.     The practice of revisions from initial estimates to final results follows a predictable pattern
of which users are informed.

            The revision cycle is predetermined and stable for the round. The revision cycle is made
             known to the public.

            The reasons underlying the cycle, such as the availability of national, regional and global
             data, are explained.

            Adequate documentation of revisions is included in ICP statistical publications and in the
             ICP data bases accessible to users.

            When revisions outside the regular cycle are called for, such as by the discovery of new
             errors in source data, they are made known to the public.

ii.    Users are informed about the preliminary nature of ICP data.

            Users are informed whenever ICP data are preliminary at the time of dissemination.

iii.   Users are informed about the revised nature of ICP data.

            Users are informed whenever ICP data are revised at the time of dissemination.

iv.    Users are informed of results and studies of the revisions to ICP statistics.

            Revisions are measured, assessed, and explained in ICP statistical publications and in the
             ICP data bases accessible to users.

            Analysis of differences between the revised and preliminary data is published for major
             aggregates to allow an assessment of the reliability of the preliminary data.



VII.   ACCESSIBILITY

           This dimension relates to the need for data and metadata to be presented in a clear and
       understandable manner on an easily available and impartial basis, that metadata are up-to-
       date and pertinent, and that a prompt and knowledgeable support service is available.

A.         Data accessibility

i.     The presentation of ICP statistics is commensurate with users’ needs.

            ICP statistics are published in a clear manner. Charts and tables are disseminated with the
             data to facilitate analysis.




                                                                                                         27
            ICP statistics are published at a sufficiently detailed level to meet users’ needs.

            Analysis of current reference year circumstances is included with dissemination.

ii.    ICP statistics are disseminated in formats to suit users’ needs.

            ICP statistics are disseminated in ways that facilitate re-dissemination in the media. For
             example, information releases.

            More comprehensive and/or detailed statistics are also disseminated in paper and/or
             electronic formats.

            Analytical series can be accessed, perhaps for a fee, through an electronic data base.

iii.   ICP statistics are released to a pre-announced schedule.

            A schedule announces in advance the dates ICP statistics are to be released.

            ICP statistics are released punctually, according to the pre-announced schedule.

iv.    ICP statistics are made available to all users at the same time.

            The public is informed of ICP statistics being released and of the procedures to access
             them. For example, from publications or through the internet.

            ICP statistics are made available to all interested users simultaneously.

            If the press is briefed in advance, embargos are imposed to prevent early public
             disclosure.

v.     ICP statistics not routinely disseminated are made available to users upon request.

            In addition to the ICP statistics routinely disseminated, other ICP statistics are made
             available upon request.

            Customized tabulations can be provided, perhaps for a fee, to meet specific requests.

            The availability of additional statistics and the procedures for obtaining them are made
             known.

B.         Metadata accessibility

i.    ICP metadata give adequate information about the meaning of the data and about the
methodology used to collect and process them.

            A comprehensive sources and methods document is published and updated regularly, and
             it includes the following:



                                                                                                      28
              Information on concepts, definitions, classifications, data sources, compilation
               methods, statistical techniques, and other relevant methodological aspects and
               procedures.

              Departures from internationally accepted standards, guidelines, or good practices.

              Information on data sources, such as price collection arrangements.

            The metadata are readily accessible through websites, statistical publications, etc. Their
             availability is cross-referenced in data releases. They are otherwise well publicized. In
             catalogs for example.

ii.    Different levels of metadata detail are made available to meet the requirements of ICP data
users.

            General use information about ICP statistics is available and made public. For example, a
             brochure on how to locate the data.

            More specialized information is available and made public. For example, in background
             papers and working documents.

C.         Assistance to users

i.     Adequate assistance is given to users of ICP statistics.

            Prompt and knowledgeable service and support are available to users of ICP statistics.

            ICP statistical releases identify contact points for enquiries by mail, telephone, facsimile,
             or by e-mail.

            Material to raise awareness on the use of ICP statistics is available. For example, for
             schools and for research.

            Access points for clients to obtain statistical information are well advertised.

            Assistance to users is monitored and reviewed periodically. For example, response time
             to e-mail requests.

ii.    Catalogs of ICP publications and other services are available to users.

            Catalogs of ICP publications, documents, and other services to users are available and
             updated regularly.

            The prices of the statistical products and services are clearly disclosed and assistance is
             provided in placing orders.




                                                                                                       29
