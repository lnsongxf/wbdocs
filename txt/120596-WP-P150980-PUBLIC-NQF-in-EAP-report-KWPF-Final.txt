1. Introduction
The World Bank’s East Asia-Pacific region received a trust fund from the Korean
government to promote skills development and job creation in the region including in
Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Japan, Korea, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar,
Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam over a period of three years, starting in June
2014. The three-year grant program has a broad objective to promote effective policies and
programs in skills development and job creation. More specifically, it aims to:

    1) Develop a knowledge base on skills supply, demand and systems by conducting
       analytical work with innovative methodological approaches;
    2) Provide a forum on National Competency Standards as well as National and Regional
       Qualifications Frameworks within ASEAN+3 countries; and
    3) Promote dissemination and learning exchanges on promising policies and programs in
       skills development and job creation within and beyond the East Asia-Pacific region,
       including examples of best practices.

Specifically, in Component (2) of the program (listed above) it was identified that there is a
need to take stock of the current country level progress and challenges with regard to
development of national competency standards and national qualifications frameworks
(NQF). Further, there is a need to understand the various types of standards currently being
used in different countries and their definitions, comparability, and the process and
stakeholders involved in the development of such standards. Finally, it is important to
evaluate to what extent they truly reflect the requirements of today and tomorrow’s labour
market demands.

Strengthening the understanding between the EAP countries regarding NQFs and quality
assurance systems will further enhance collaboration and possibilities for student and labour
mobility.

This synthesis report brings together research undertaken in 12 participating EAP countries
(Cambodia, China, Indonesia, Korea, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines,
Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam) who responded to a survey related to national
qualifications systems, including the barriers and issues facing implementation of quality
assurance strategies such as NQF development, existence and implementation. The
methodology for completing these surveys in included in Appendix 1. The people who
assisted in the completion of the surveys is included in Appendix 2. A glossary of terms
provided with the survey is included in Appendix 3.

The summaries of these surveys are included in Appendix 4. The surveys were completed in
late 2014 or early 2015 and reflect the status of each country’s TVET sector at that point in
time. The surveys focused on how and to what extent TVET provision is quality-assured
within each EAP country. In relation to training and educational services, quality assurance
was defined as “planned and systematic processes that provide confidence in educational
services provided by training providers under the remit of relevant authorities or bodies”
(Bateman, Keating and Vickers, 2009, p. 8).

                                                                Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                                          NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                                           	
                                                                                                                                  	




	
Quality assurance of education and training can focus on:

       •      The training product, through the accreditation (approval) of achievement standards
              (such as educational and/or competency standards as well as certification of a
              qualification);

       •      The education and training providers, through registration2 (approval) processes based
              upon their infrastructure, financial probity and health, staff qualifications and
              experience, management systems, delivery systems, and student support systems;

       •      The monitoring of provider processes and outcomes, including student learning and
              employment outcomes and student and user satisfaction levels;

       •      The control, supervision or monitoring of assessment, certification and graduation
              procedures and outcomes;

       •      Provider or system-wide evaluations of quality, including evaluations by external
              agencies; and

       •      The provision of public information on the performance of providers such as program
              and component completions, student and employer satisfaction rates, and sanctions or
              warnings (Bateman, Keating, Gillis, Dyson, Burke & Coles 2012, p. 8-9).

Not all countries implemented all of these processes consistently within their qualifications
system, which, in part, could be because for some countries TVET is not an integrated system
within the overall qualifications system. Within some countries, the line of separation is made
between initial vocational training and continuing education and training,3 and in others it
may be between formal, informal and non-formal learning and a seemingly endless mix of
delineations as to what is TVET, for example, skills/vocational/skills, training/skills, and
education/technical education. In some countries, TVET is considered unique to one ministry
(or mode of delivery) to the exclusion of other ministries or institutions that may be providing
what would be considered TVET programs.

Divisions within the broader TVET sector are often divided along the lines of the governing
or quality assuring authorities rather than any inherent difference in approach to TVET. In
many countries, TVET governance and quality assurance is spread across multiple agencies,
for example, Thailand and Indonesia.

The findings of the surveys of each participating EAP country (Cambodia, China, Indonesia,
Japan, Korea, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Mongolia, Myanmar, Philippines, Singapore, Thailand,
and Vietnam) are included in the following section. In some instances, country overviews
address only some of the sub-sectors of the TVET system, for example, Thailand and
Indonesia.

This synthesis report summarises the findings against the following key themes:

    1.   Overview of qualifications systems
    2.   National qualifications frameworks (NQFs)
    3.   Quality assurance of qualifications approval
    4.   Standards development
    5.   Quality assurance of providers
    6.   Educator/assessor requirements
    7.   Data collection
    8.   International linkages
    9.   Barriers and issues



2. Overview of Qualifications Systems
A national qualifications system can be defined as including all the structures and activities
that lead to the award of a qualification (Bjørnåvold & Coles 2010). Coles & Werquin (2006)
note that a “national qualifications system is a broad concept that includes all aspects of a
country’s activities resulting in the recognition of learning. These systems include the means
of developing and implementing policy on qualifications, institutional arrangements, skills
identification arrangements and processes for assessment, awarding and quality assurance”
(p. 38).

Qualification systems can be unified, for example, all provision is included within the one
system; or they could be segmented with the vocational education and training sector and
higher education being separate and distinct; or, it could be linked, which is where there is
different provision within and across the two main sectors while emphasis is placed on their
similarities (Tuck, 2007).

Generally speaking, most reviewed EAP countries had a segmented qualifications system, but
there were some countries working towards in some way linking the approaches in the
different sectors. Additionally, some EAP countries had a clear division between higher
education and a broad technical and vocational education and training (TVET) sector (e.g.
China, Mongolia).

Other countries also had segmented systems within the broader TVET sector, for example,
Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. This is in part due to two or more ministries
being involved in the regulation and implementation of the broader TVET sector (e.g.
ministries responsible for education or for labour/manpower/human resources). This
separation of TVET between ministries can sometimes result in a policy disconnect,
especially in relation to regulation, management and implementation.


                                                                                                 Page	6	of	68	
                                                                                                                                  	
                                                                Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                                          NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                                           	
                                                                                                                                  	




	
Nevertheless, there are examples of countries with segmented systems working towards
greater harmonisation, for example the Philippines has established a cross-sectoral national
coordinating committee for the managing and monitoring of its NQF.


3. National Qualifications Frameworks
Overview

Cedefop (2011, p. 82) defines a qualifications framework as:

              An instrument for the development and classification of qualifications (e.g. at national
              or sectoral level) according to a set of criteria (e.g. using descriptors) applicable to
              specified levels of learning outcomes.

Within the EAP countries, a number of countries have recently established a NQF or are
planning an NQF. This is in part due to the awareness of international trends, but it also
reflects the influence of other current regional initiatives such as establishment of the
ASEAN Qualifications Reference Framework.

Each EAP country is at different stages of planning or implementation of an NQF. In some
countries, the NQF is well established (e.g. Malaysia), and in others it is in the early stages of
implementation (e.g. Indonesia). In some instances, NQFs are documented but
implementation has been limited. For other countries there is no explicit or national
systematic intention to develop an NQF, although individuals or groups may be lobbying for
a national approach. The development of an NQF can be grouped according to the following
general categories4:

       1.     No intent
       2.     Desired but no progress made
       3.     Background planning underway
       4.     Initial development and design completed
       5.     Some structures and processes agreed and documented
       6.     Some structures and processes established and operational
       7.     Structures and processes established for 5 years
       8.     Review of structures and processes proposed or underway

The table below outlines the level of establishment of the NQFs in the region.

NQF Purposes

Coles et al (2014) notes that the main function of an NQF is ‘to act as a benchmark for the
level of learning recognised in the national qualifications system’ (p. 22). For EAP countries,
NQF documentation indicates that countries have developed qualifications frameworks for a
range of purposes. In some instances, the purpose of an NQF can be explicit or implicit, that
is, they are documented within an NQF policy statement or legislative document, or they are
documented in planning and consultation documents. A number of documented examples of
NQF purposes are noted below:

       •      For Cambodia, the aim of the Cambodian Qualifications Framework is to bring all
              recognised qualifications into a unified interconnected structure. Its main purposes
              include: facilitating the recognition of Cambodian qualifications and establishing
              links with regional qualifications, facilitating learner support and protection, as well
              as contributing to personal development of learners and the social and economic
              development of the country (See Cambodia Country Overview in Appendix 4).5
       •      For Malaysia, the Malaysian Qualifications Framework is an instrument that develops
              and classifies qualifications; it also provides for pathways by linking qualifications.6
       •      For Indonesia, the NQF is a ‘framework of competency qualifications levelling which
              corresponds, equalize[s] and incorporate[s] educational fields with work training
              fields and work experience in order to provide work competency recognition
              according to the work structure in various sectors.’7
       •      For the Philippines, the framework aims to support the development and maintenance
              of pathways and equivalencies, and to align the PQF with international qualifications
              frameworks for student and labour mobility purposes.8

NQF Structure

An analysis of various NQFs within the EAP region indicates that their structure varies.
Bateman & Coles (2013, p. 14 - 15) indicate that the variations can relate to:

    •   Coverage such as educational sectors and qualification types
    •   Purpose and vision of NQFs (e.g. reflective of the status quo, reforming, transparency,
        mobility, regional solidarity, national identity, coherence of education and training)
    •   Number of levels
    •   Number and types of domains for documenting level descriptors
    •   Volume measures, such as credit points
    •   Associated functions, such as improving quality assurance and validating non formal
        and informal learning, credit
    •   Level of regulation and governance

Of the participating EAP countries that have implemented or documented an NQF, the
majority of these core elements are clearly articulated. The table below summarises, for each
country that is proposing or has established an NQF or sectoral NQF, the key features of the
framework.

4. Quality Assurance of Qualifications Approval

Across the participating EAP countries, the quality assurance of qualifications generally rests
with either one or two ministries, for example, education and labour. The scope and level of
establishment of approval processes varied significantly across participating EAP countries.
Approval processes could be:

    •    In trial mode, generally supported by donor funding
    •    Not mandatory but perhaps required by particular cohorts of providers with particular
         target groups for qualifications to be recognised under the NQF.
    •    Mandatory for all qualifications to be recognised under the NQF.

In most participating countries the requirements for approval of qualifications are
documented in legislation, government regulations or procedures. All countries have
provider-approved qualifications, although some had national qualifications (e.g. Korea) or
were trialling the development of national qualification (e.g. Cambodia). In many instances,
the approval of provider qualifications was linked to provider approval to deliver the
qualification; but this was not always the case.

A number of countries noted the degree of effort to implement quality assurance of a vast
range of qualifications within the country, and indicated that it would take a significant
amount of capacity development of agency staff to be able to undertake this work. For some
countries, there is a lack of public register of approved qualifications.

5. Standards Development

Overview

Achievement standards in education and training are defined as a ‘statement approved and
formalised by a competent body, which defines the rules to follow in a given context or the
results to be achieved. A distinction can be made between competency, educational,
occupational, assessment, validation or certification standards:
    • ‘Competency standard refers to the knowledge, skills and/or competencies linked to
        practising a job
    • Educational standard refers to statements of learning objectives, content of curricula,
        entry requirements and resources required to meet learning objectives
    • Occupational standard refers to statements of activities and tasks related to a specific
        job and to its practise
    • Assessment standard refers to statements of learning outcomes to be assessed and
        methodology used
    • Validation standard refers to statements of level of achievement to be reached by the
        person assessed, and the methodology used
    • Certification standard refers to statements of rules applicable to obtaining a
        qualification (e.g. certificate or diploma) as well as the rights conferred’9

A number of countries noted that documenting unitised achievement standards is a relatively
new concept. In almost all instances the countries focused on competency or occupational
standards in the TVET sector. In addition, most countries that have addressed the
development of competency (or occupational standards) have done so through
implementation in the broader vocational education and training sector. In general, countries
used the terms competency standards and occupational standards interchangeably.

In some countries, there is some intent to apply the notion of competence and competency
standards to higher education programs (e.g. Philippines). For higher education, achievement
standards are not clearly articulated; for some countries unitisation of qualifications has not
yet occurred (e.g. Philippines) while for others, programme standards have been developed
(e.g. Malaysia).

Notion of Competence

Many definitions of competence exist in vocational and education literature. Hager (1993)
believes the approach to competence affects the specification of competencies and also the
approach to assessment. He indicates that there are three main approaches to defining
competence:

                                                               NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                      	
                                                                                                                         	




	
    •    Task-based or behaviourist approach which views competence as ‘discrete behaviours
         associated with the completion of particular tasks…in effect tasks become the
         competencies’ (p. 95)
    •    The conception of competence that concentrates on the ‘general personal attributes
         that are crucial to effective performance,’ which focuses on ‘general attributes that are
         taken to underlie competent performance of a wide range of specific tasks’ (p. 96)
    •    The conception of competence in terms of knowledge, abilities, skills and attitudes
         displayed in the context of a carefully chosen set of realistic occupational tasks which
         are of an appropriate level of generality’ (p. 97)

The participating EAP countries defined competence in various ways and three countries
included definitions of competence within the higher education or academic sector. The table
below summarises each country’s definition of competence.

Cambodia#        The skills standard ‘required for effective performance in the workplace. It goes beyond
                 specifying knowledge, skills and attitude requirements into defining the performance levels the
                 workers in a particular job must achieve’
China            -
Indonesia        Competence is the knowledge, skills and attitude to be applied in the workplace.

                 successfully. The National Competency Standards includes both cognitive and practical skills.
Lao PDR          Competence is the relevant knowledge, skills and attitude applied to the standards of the
                 performance expected in the workplace. Competence describes the job tasks within a specific
                 job role.
Malaysia         Based on the ILO definition; competence is noted as ‘an acquired and practised ability to
                 competently carry out a task or job’

Most countries are developing competency standards or occupational standards in the broader
vocation and training sector; although this may be part of a donor funded program (e.g.
Cambodia and Lao PDR) rather than as a system-wide initiative. In higher education this
initiative is less evident. In Malaysia, in the higher education and vocational sectors (not the
skills sector) program standards are developed to inform curriculum and training and
assessment development. These standards provide guidelines for different modes of study,
such as coursework, research and a combination of both.

Process for development

The development of standards follows similar processes in most countries. Countries are
documenting processes, either in formal directives or guidelines. In all instances the
development of standards in some way included industry involvement. The table below
outlines the development process for each of the participating EAP countries.

Participating EAP countries indicated that the competency standards were developed by
sourcing a range of information. In general, the main sources were:

    •   Workplace information, for example, functional analysis or job task analysis
    •   Research of other countries’ systems
    •   DACUM or committee processes
    •   Existing program design and qualifications
    •   Licensing requirements

Participating countries also indicated that competency standards were for the purposes of
curriculum development, program design, assessment design, completion rules for
qualifications, and development of training and assessment materials.

In some instances, countries indicated that the competency standards could be used by:

    •   Learners for development planning
    •   Education and training providers for designing curriculum and programs
    •   Employers for specifying job roles and recruitment, or for training
    •   Approving bodies (registration and accreditation)
    •   Curriculum bodies

Format

In general, the standards in the broader vocational education and training sector follow a
similar format. The format of the competency standards usually includes:

    •   Occupational background information
    •   Unit code and title
    •   Unit descriptor
    •   Unit of Competence
           o elements and performance criteria
           o variables and range statement
           o evidence guide.

Most participating countries organise the competencies into:
  • Core competencies, which are the skills and knowledge required within the technical
      area
  • Basic competencies, which are employability skills or generic skills.

In Malaysia, in the higher education and vocation sector (not the skills sector) program
standards follow a specific format, although over time there have been various iterations in
style and format. The program standards outline subjects (bodies of knowledge) and key
topics, credits allocated to each subject as well as formative and summative assessment
information. The standards also outline student entry requirements and benchmarks for
academic staff including qualifications and experience, ratio of part-time to full-time staff
and staff/student ratio.

Mongolia has a similar approach to the structure of competency standards with the inclusion
of: expected job skill, admission requirements, requirements for curriculum content, duration,
requirements for teachers, requirements for providers and learning conditions such as tools
and equipment.

Employability Skills
	
Of particular interest in the development of competency standards was how employability
skills were being addressed. The participating EAP countries were provided with a definition
of employability skills to assist in the completion of the survey. Employability skills are:

              the skills, knowledge and competencies that enhance a worker’s ability to secure and
              retain a job, progress at work and cope with change, secure another job if he/she so
              wishes or has been laid off and enter more easily into the labour market at different
              periods of the life cycle. Individuals are most employable when they have broad-
              based education and training, basic and portable high-level skills, including
              teamwork, problem solving, information and communications technology (ICT) and
              communication and language skills. This combination of skills enables them to adapt
              to changes in the world of work.11

In general, countries address employability skills or generic skills in various ways, including:

       •      Embedding them in achievement standards, for example, competency standards
              focusing on vocational skills and knowledge
       •      Describing them as achievement standards, for example, a competency standard
              focusing on the generic skills and knowledge
       •      Embedding them in curriculum design documents that support the achievement
              standards
       •      Embedding them in training and in training and assessment support materials

    •    Embedding them in National Qualifications Framework descriptors

Within each country, no one approach was exclusive of the other and many countries used a
mix of approaches. In some respects, there is a hierarchy of processes, for example, if a
country embeds employability skills within a NQF then other approaches were deployed such
as:

    1.   In achievement standards
    2.   As achievement standards
    3.   In curriculum design
    4.   In training

The table below provides an overview of the main application of generic competencies in
each participating EAP country.

Relationship to Qualifications and Curriculum
Most of the participating EAP countries that have utilised the development of competencies
have linked these directly to the determination of qualification outcomes, which in turn
broadly equates to an occupational role. In some instances, qualifications linked to
competencies are a relatively new concept. For example, in Indonesia although competency
standards have been developed for some time, they have only more recently been aligned to
qualifications.

However, countries are finding that the development of the competency standards is really
‘just the beginning’ as further assistance or linkages to program design are required to either
support providers or for providers to be able to demonstrate capacity to deliver training (and
assessment) against the competencies. This has culminated in development of national or
provider curriculum and development of program standards, for example, TESDA in the
Philippines     develops     Training     Regulations     which    define     the    minimum
requirements/information for qualifications.

6. Quality Assurance of Providers

Across the participating EAP countries, the quality assurance of providers12 generally rests
with either one or two ministries, for example, those responsible for education or for labour.
Provider approval processes varied significantly across participating EAP countries. Provider
approval processes could be:

       •      Not mandatory for specific cohorts of providers, but may be required by particular
              cohorts of providers with particular target groups
       •      Assumed for particular providers (e.g. government providers)

    •   Mandatory for all providers to be recognised under the NQF

In most participating countries the requirements for approval of providers are documented in
legislation, government decrees, and regulations or, in some instances, in quality criteria or
requirements. The focus on requirements includes: governance arrangements, finance,
facilities and equipment, and staffing.

Very few countries indicated that they had implemented strong monitoring of providers’
processes and outcomes (including outcomes of monitoring activities), and also very few had
public registers of providers accompanied by qualifications that they were approved to
deliver.



7. Educator/Assessor Requirements

The requirements for educators and/or assessors varied across the EAP countries as well as
variations within countries that occurred across sectors of the qualifications system. The
requirements for educators and assessors tended to be outlined in:

    •   Legislation (e.g. China, Mongolia, Korea)
    •   Quality standards (e.g. Singapore, Indonesia − assessors for competency certification)
    •   Regulation (e.g. Philippines − TVET trainers)
    •   Policies or guidelines (e.g. Malaysia, Philippines − TVET assessors).

In almost all countries the requirement for trainers and/or assessors included at least the level
of competence in the vocational content and skills as well as a qualification in teaching
pedagogy and in some instances workplace experience. In some cases, the vocational and
pedagogical requirements were combined into a specific qualification, as, for example in
Japan. For some countries (e.g. Cambodia, Myanmar and Laos) trainer/assessor requirements
are relatively new and not fully implemented. For other countries (e.g. China) national
examinations were the key requirement, and for some education teaching experience was
required to be involved in a competency based system (e.g. Laos). For other countries there
was a separation of different types of educators, for example, professional/general/on-site
teachers in Korea. In Vietnam the two ministries responsible for TVET require a bachelor
qualification in vocational content plus a certificate in teaching pedagogy.

There were very few countries that had national registers for trainers (Philippines being an
example of a national TVET register, and also in Thailand [OVEC]), and where assessment
was centrally controlled there was a register of qualified assessors (e.g. Philippines TVET
and the Indonesian competency certification system). In both the Philippines and Indonesian
competency certification systems there was a monitoring process for assessors.

8. Data Collection
The quality assurance of qualifications systems ‘depends to a large extent upon the
availability, validity, and reliability of data about the practice and outcomes’ as well as ‘the
generation and use of indicators of quality’.13 If data is made publicly available it can be
used to:

       •      Assure funders and investors of the probity, effectiveness and efficiency of
              expenditure;
       •      Assure stakeholders of the capacity and behaviour of providers;
       •      Assure stakeholders of the relevance and quality of the processes and products;
       •      Inform providers as a basis for improvements and innovations; and
       •      Assure national and international users of the relevance and quality of the product and
              system.14

An analysis of the country overviews provided by participating EAP countries indicates that
the range of data collected was not consistently applied across the education and training
sectors or, for some countries, within the vocational and training subsectors. The majority of
data collected related to context, input and output data, such as:

       •      Student background characteristics (e.g. in terms of ethnicity, age, gender, disabilities,
              prior qualifications);
       •      Student enrolment patterns;
       •      Proportion of funds supporting student learning, including those with disabilities, and
              supporting staff professional development/in-service training;
       •      Qualifications, experience and expertise of teaching staff;
       •      Retention and completion rates and patterns; and
       •      Graduate destinations.

However, the more complex data requiring more advanced collection and analysis were not
as frequently collected, such as:

       •      Recognition of prior learning/credit transfer arrangements and outcomes;
       •      Process for program design, accreditation and review; and
       •      Stakeholder satisfaction (e.g. employers, students) with the delivery and outcomes of
              the course.

In many countries that have less developed and coherent qualifications systems, the level of
data collection lacked scope and was limited to:

       •      Student characteristics, but limited in the level of detail (e.g. only name, gender and
              age);

       •      Provider characteristics, limited to physical infrastructure information and staffing
              ratios; and
       •      Enrolments, retentions and completions at program level as opposed to unit or
              subcomponent of a qualification.

Some countries collected additional data (e.g. Vietnam collects data on the level of
collaboration between enterprises and providers), but for many there is no national data
standard to facilitate a coherent collection of data.

The findings tend to indicate that refined data collection and using the data to inform
continuous improvement is more a strategy of an advanced qualifications system, and that for
others the focus for implementation is on more immediate quality assurance arrangements.



9. International Linkages

One of the key purposes cited by participating EAP countries that had an NQF was the
potential for linking to an international qualifications framework for student and labour
mobility purposes. Across the EAP countries a number of arrangements are evident. For the
ASEAN countries, international linkages are generally focused on the mutual recognition
agreements currently agreed to or being agreed upon. On an individual country basis, some
agreements or alignment activities have occurred (e.g. Malaysia with New Zealand) related to
comparability of specific qualification types.15 A number of participating EAP countries and
individual agencies noted that agreements or MOUs have been negotiated (e.g. China,
Indonesia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam).

In relation to cross border provision, not all countries had processes to address international
providers in place. Of those countries who had international providers within the country, the
same conditions applied or special processes applied. Only one country explicitly stated that
their providers could not provide training and assessment services outside the country (i.e.
Singapore). In terms of incoming individuals wanting qualifications assessed, not all
countries had a documented process for these instances, and stated that they tend to address
recognition requests on a case-by-case basis.



10.           Barriers and Obstacles
The country overviews provided by participating EAS countries, offered a wealth of
information in relation to barriers and obstacles to implementing NQFs or qualifications
systems. Some countries responded specifically in relation to TVET sector issues and other

countries responded in relation to the NQF or general concerns. A number of critical issues
were identified, such as:

    •    Connections and coordination between sectors;
    •    Finances;
    •    Capacity of quality assurance agency staff to support initiatives; and
    •    Capacity of providers to be able to provide quality training and assessment services.

The table below synthesises the issues and barriers identified by participating EAP countries.

Table 8: Issues and barriers
	
Theme                   Details
Connections with        Issues related to: lack of linkages across (and within) education and training sectors,
other education         including: program pathways, recognition or credit within and between sectors; lack of
sectors                 harmonising legislation or strategies
Progress for            Poor progress of implementation was seen as a consequence of other issues, such as:
implementation          quality assurance and NQFs containing unfamiliar concepts; number and variety of
                        providers to be quality-assured; time taken to develop competency standards and
                        curriculum; and time needed to embed strategies within the system.
Poor coordination       Issues were related to: lack of cooperation, coordination and communication between
                        sector ministries; inability to engage technical ministries in development of competency
                        standards; separate and disconnected TVET subsectors; lack of integration and
                        harmonization of requirements of quality assurance agencies.
Staff capacity within   Issues were related to: lack of capacity of staff to implement quality assurance
agencies                strategies, to develop or understand the potential of an NQF, and the inability to build a
                        critical mass of expertise
Financial support       Multiple countries commented on limited budget support for initiatives.
Perception of TVET      Concerns included the poor image of TVET, and the value of competency based
                        training not being well understood
Engagement with         Limited involvement of stakeholders (including industry/enterprises), which impacted
stakeholders            on relevance and flexibility of provision.
Responsiveness          Issues related to: TVET not being responsive to labour market needs, lack of data
                        management systems and annual reporting to inform the system, and duplication of
                        provision across ministries.
Capacity of providers   The quality of provision is affected by poor infrastructure and equipment, out-dated
                        curriculum, unqualified staff, an inability to shift from classroom delivery to
                        competency-based training, and traditional testing for entry excluding access to certain
                        cohorts.

11.      Conclusion

The review has revealed that there is significant variance in the level of quality assurance of
qualifications and providers, although all countries are focused on the importance of quality
assurance in terms of improving recognition and level of trust of country qualifications. It is
clear that establishing NQFs is really just the start of the quality assurance work and the
greatest effort is spent on the implementation and embedding processes. Very few of the

Appendix 1: Methodology
Research for this project was undertaken with 13 participating countries based on a survey
developed and provided to EAS countries through the Australian Government East Asia
Summit TVET Quality Assurance Framework, which began in 2012. This survey culminated
in a country overview shared to all countries through this project.

For this project the survey was refined and expanded to include questions pertaining to
competency standards development, competence, employability skills, and data collection. In
a number of instances some countries built on and updated the existing country overview
provided during the East Asia Summit project.

The survey included a series of questions pertaining to:

    1. Qualifications system overview
    2. National qualifications framework
    3. Quality assurance mechanisms:
    4. Approval of qualifications
    5. Approval of providers
    6. Relationship of standards to qualifications
    7. Educator/assessor requirements
    8. Transnational and cross border linkages
    9. Data collection
    10. Issues and barriers

For some countries additional support was provided through a face-to-face interview to assist
in the completion or update of the country overview. All countries were provided with a
finalised country overview for confirmation. From this overview, a summarised country
overview has been provided in Appendix 4.

Employability skills                      Employability skills are ‘the skills, knowledge and competencies that enhance a
                                          worker’s ability to secure and retain a job, progress at work and cope with change,
                                          secure another job if he/she so wishes or has been laid off and enter more easily into
                                          the labour market at different periods of the life cycle. Individuals are most
                                          employable when they have broad-based education and training, basic and portable
                                          high-level skills, including teamwork, problem solving, information and
                                          communications technology (ICT) and communication and language skills. This
                                          combination of skills enables them to adapt to changes in the world of work’.21
Learning outcomes                         Learning outcomes are clear statements of what a learner can be expected to know,
                                          understand and/or do as a result of a learning experience.
Level descriptor                          A general statement that summarises the learning outcomes appropriate to a specific
                                          level in a qualifications framework. Level descriptors are usually grouped in domains
                                          of learning.
National                                  An instrument for the development and classification of qualifications according to a
Qualifications                            set of criteria or criteria for levels of learning achieved. This set of criteria may be
Framework                                 implicit in the qualifications descriptors themselves or made explicit in the form of a
                                          set of level descriptors. The scope of frameworks may be comprehensive of all
                                          learning achievement and pathways or may be confined to a particular sector, for
                                          example initial education, adult education and training or an occupational area. Some
                                          frameworks may have more design elements and a tighter structure than others; some
                                          may have a legal basis whereas others represent a consensus of views of social
                                          partners. 22
Program                                   The arrangements made for the teaching and learning of a body of knowledge, set of
                                          skills and of wider competences. A learning program can lead to a qualification.
Provider                                  An organisation that plans and delivers education/training and assessment services that
                                          often leads to the award of qualifications or components of qualifications.
Qualification                             Qualification is a formal certificate issued by an official agency, in recognition that an
                                          individual has been assessed as achieving learning outcomes or competencies to the
                                          standard specified for the qualification title, usually a type of certificate, diploma or
                                          degree. Learning and assessment for a qualification can take place through workplace
                                          experience and/or a program of study. A qualification confers official recognition of
                                          value in the labour market and in further education and training. 23
Qualifications                            Instrument for development and classification of qualifications (at national or sectoral
Framework                                 levels) according to a set of criteria (such as using descriptors) applicable to specified
                                          levels of learning outcomes.24
Qualifications                            Q Qualifications system includes all aspects of a country's activity that result in the
system                                    recognition of learning. These systems include the means of developing and
                                          operationalising national or regional policy on qualifications, institutional
                                          arrangements, quality assurance processes, assessment and awarding processes, skills
                                          recognition and other mechanisms that link education and training to the labour market
                                          and civil society. Qualifications systems may be more or less integrated and coherent.
                                          One feature of a qualifications system may be an explicit framework of qualifications.
                                          25

Quality assurance                         Quality assurance is a component of quality management and is ‘focused on providing
                                          confidence that quality requirements will be fulfilled’.26
                                          In relation to education and training services, quality assurance refers to planned and
                                          systematic processes that provide confidence in the design, delivery and award of
                                          qualifications within an education and training system. Quality assurance ensures

Registering agency                        Registering agencies are those competent bodies responsible for approving education
                                          and training providers, e.g. national qualifications agencies, official review boards or
                                          other nationally approved bodies or agencies. Registering agencies function within a
                                          quality assurance system.
Registration of                           Registration processes include formal acknowledgement by a registering agency that a
providers                                 provider meets relevant standards. Under NQFs it is usual for a provider to be
                                          registered in order to deliver and assess accredited programs and issue awards.
                                          Some agencies differentiate between the two processes, e.g.:
                                          • Formal acknowledgement that the provider meets key generic standards
                                          • Formal acknowledgement that the provider meets specific standards related to the

Appendix 4: Country Overview Summaries

Cambodia32
Education System

The education system in Cambodia embraces formal and non-formal education. The formal pre-
tertiary education structure, under the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport (MoEYS), consists of
three years of pre-school education, six years of primary school, three years of lower-secondary
school, and three years of upper secondary school.

The formal Higher Education sector consists of one year of pre-university (foundation year), two
years of Associate Degree, with an additional two years for a four-year Bachelor Degree, two years of
Master Degree and three years of Doctoral Degree. The Directorate General of Higher Education of
MoEYS is the regulatory entity for state universities and also oversees the registration of private
universities.

The Directorate General of TVET of the Ministry of Labour and Vocational Training (MoLVT)
manages the national TVET system. The National Training Board (NTB), with representation from all
14 ministries with training institutions, is responsible for policy direction and coordination. The
formal TVET System comprises of 38 TVET institutions. There are 23 Provincial Training Centres, 8
Polytechnics/Institutes, 1 specialised Institute, namely Secondary School of Japan Vocational Centre,
and six other institutions which offer community based short courses to improve family income.

The courses currently offered by MoLVT are the short courses in basic skills (3–5 months’ duration),
the certificate courses at 3 levels, requiring entry point at grade 9 or skills bridging, Higher Diploma
Programmes of 2 years requiring Grade 12 or completion of the 3 Certificate levels, Bachelor
Programmes of 4 years requiring Grade 12 or 2 years after completion of Higher Diploma levels, and
Master Programmes of 2 years after completion of Bachelor Degree.

Cambodia Qualifications Framework (CQF)

The CQF is the national instrument that develops and classifies qualifications based on a set of criteria
that is agreed nationally for specified levels of learning achieved. CQF encompass all levels of
education and Training in Cambodia. There are eight levels of qualifications and each level is
differentiated by the general characteristics that include minimum entrance requirement, typical
duration, programme characteristic, cumulative duration in full-time equivalent, type of subsequent
education and learning outcomes. The framework has a credit system so that the volume learning may
be recorded and students may receive credit for all qualifications. At this stage there is no legislation
being developed for an agency to monitor and manage the CQF.

Quality Assurance Strategies

Accreditation of Qualifications
The National Training Board (NTB) is the accrediting body for qualifications for TVET sector. The
NTB is supported by Directorate General of Technical and Vocational Education and Training
(DGTVET). The NTB is made up of the ministers from the 14 line ministries.

Accreditation processes through the NTB are in the trial stage through a donor-funded project. There
are no quality standards or criteria related to the performance of the accrediting agency or related to
the accreditation of qualifications.

At the moment there is no public register of national qualifications (or qualifications developed
internally and not accredited).

Currently the DGTVET through a donor-funded project has developed competency standards
(clustering into qualifications), curriculum, learner workbooks (includes some theory assessment) and
assessment materials (for the practical assessment) for Level 2 to Level 4 qualifications for electrical,
plumbing, masonry and carpentry.

Assessment
It is proposed that the NTB will be the awarding body responsible for the issuance of national TVET
qualifications. National TVET qualifications endorsed by NTB will be based on competency
standards. Certificates (and/or statements will include a list of competencies achieved).

It is proposed that registered TVET providers will be able to undertake training and assessment
services, and there will be established 10 assessment centres for the purposes of assessing current
competence (RPL) and qualifications.

Beyond the assessment developed in the learner workbook and the competency assessment package,
there is no clear guidance as to how the consistency of assessment judgments will be moderated or
reviewed.

Relationship to Standards
Competency standards will form the basis of qualifications in TVET. There are no quality standards
for the development of competency standards, although the Competency Strategy outlines the process.
The development process includes: Industry Advisory Group, Industry expert worker and a Technical
Working Group.

The Industry Advisory Group’s role is to advise on critical job roles that needs skill development,
validate the list of competencies to be developed and endorse the competency standards and
qualification completion rules. The Technical Working Group facilitates in conducting a functional
and job task analysis to identify competencies that need to be developed. These lists of proposed
competencies are reviewed and endorsed by the Industry Advisory Group. The Technical Working
Group then drafts the competencies. These draft competencies are then taken to informed and skilled
experts in the field for comment and then final drafts are endorsed by the IAG. The IAG then submit
the competencies and qualification completion rules to the Sub Committee of the NTB for checking to
ensure that they meet the requirements of the CQF and then they are passed to the NTB for approval.

Included in this process is the endorsement and approval of competency based curriculum; these are
programme standards. These programme standards include advice in relation to course design.
Competency standards development is informed by functional and job task analysis, expert advice
from industry/employers, experts in the field, and expert trainers/assessors.

Registration of Providers
In TVET, currently the registering bodies are separated by sectors. There are currently 14 line
ministries who manage the training and assessment services across the relevant industry sectors.
There are 292 providers of training and assessment registered with GDTVET, of which 39 are
government owned institutions.

Currently there are no quality standards developed that address the role of regulators. There is no
body responsible for the monitoring of these regulators (e.g. ministries).

NTB, supported by DGTVET, MLVT, will register all providers of TVET. The standards or
requirements that need to be met for the registration of providers are being developed in the ongoing
ADB funded project, strengthening Technical and Vocational Education and Training (STVET).
These criteria have been developed.

In the case of TVET, the registration standards for TVET providers focus on six criteria –
Management and Governance, Resources, Staff and Teaching Staff, Trainee and Student, Curriculum
and Teaching/Learning, Research and Development. These criteria have been developed. The
supporting documents related to these criteria are being developed to assist the training providers.
Currently those registered with DGTVET are required to complete an application form to be
registered.

Each of the 39 government institutes will monitor themselves against the six criteria. It is envisaged
that this process will be eventually implemented across all registered providers. A detailed monitoring
and evaluation system will be put in place. For TVET, there is a register of providers, but the registers
are incomplete. The providers will have to undertake quality audits, annual self-assessment as well as
prepared annual performance reports.

Educator/Assessor Requirements
The ADB STVET Project is developing an integrated learning services system for the upgrading of
technical and vocational education and training (TVET), including teacher training, skills standards,
testing and assessment, development of curriculum and training materials, plus institutional
management and upgrading. The Competency Standards for TVET Teachers, which are being
finalised, will be used as a tool for identifying the minimum standards of TVET teachers.

For the education sector, teachers, trainers and lecturers are trained at the National Institute of
Education for upper secondary school and universities. Teachers, trainers, educators, lecturer
requirements in both sectors are noted in legislation.

China (People’s Republic of)33
Overview

Chinese Education system is divided into four levels – preschool education, primary education, secondary
education, and higher education. Compulsory education in China is nine years. Vocational school
education in China includes three levels – primary, secondary and higher. Primary and secondary
vocational school educations are carried out respectively by primary and secondary vocational schools (at
junior and senior secondary level respectively). The higher vocational school education is, in accordance
with the actual needs and conditions, undertaken by higher vocational schools or by common institutions
of higher learning. Other schools may, in accordance with the overall planning by the education
administrative department, implement vocational school education at corresponding levels.

National/TVET Qualifications Framework

Currently China does not have a national qualifications framework. The qualification system is mainly
composed of two systems – educational qualification system and occupational qualification system.
Ministry of Education is in charge of the educational qualification system, and Ministry of Human
Resource and Social Security is in charge of the occupational standards system.

TVET Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation of Qualifications
The national occupational standards are released by Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security
with reference to the Technical Note on Establishing National Occupational Standards. Each set of
occupational standards is created by a working team of five to ten experts who are familiar with the
standard establishment methodology and those with theoretical and industrial experience. There are
currently 1,100 occupational standards.

The occupation-specific standards are an important reference for curriculum development, occupational
activities, prerequisite training, and hiring decisions. The standards cover four core areas: Overview,
Basic Requirements, Job Requirements and Percentage of Gravity (a measure composition of technical
requirements versus theoretical knowledge for each level of occupational qualification).

The standards are expected to be updated every three to five years. Both industry representatives and
trainer providers are recruited into a standards updating committee. However, in reality the update does
not take place as frequently due to capacity constraints and some of the standards do not reflect the most
up-to-date market trends.

Registration of Providers/Awarding Bodies
The National Occupational Testing system consists of the national Occupational Testing Authority
(OSTA) and the regional/industrial Occupational Testing Centres. The Ministry of Human Resource and
Social Security is in charge of the comprehensive management of the OSTA. OSTA’s main
responsibilities include: developing plans, policies and standards; examining and approving the
vocational skill accreditation bodies of related industries; organizing, coordinating and guiding
occupational skills’ testing; and, issuing qualification certificates.

Occupational skills testing stations implement the occupational skills testing process. Occupational skills
testing stations should meet 4 standards related to facilities, testing instruments, assessors, and
management.

Organisations or individuals could apply for occupational testing at local occupational skills testing
stations or centres. The Rules for National Occupational Qualification Examination Management
(Tentative) provides detailed guidelines on carrying out the occupational qualification examinations.
The certificates granted after passing the skills tests are recognised more by state-owned enterprises
than by the private sector.

Registration of Training Providers
There are various types of public training providers in China. The Ministry of Education manages and
oversees technical schools (“zhong zhuan”) and the Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security
manages and oversees vocational schools (“ji xiao”). Vocational schools in China offer training to
students and provide services to the general public. Public employment training centers receive public
financial allowance and are subject to the management and monitoring of Ministry of Human Resources
and Social Security. There are also private vocational training agencies.

Any organization with the intent to become an educational provider is required to provide an application
to governments at different levels. The organisation should meet the 4 requirements related to
governance, teachers, facilities and equipment, and funds.

Educator Requirements
The requirements for educators are governed by the Teachers Law of the People’s Republic of China,
which stipulates that ‘the State shall institute a system of qualifications for teachers’.

The requirements for educators are listed in Article 11 of the law and include records of formal schooling
at various levels. Citizens, without the records of formal schooling for teachers’ qualifications as
stipulated in the law, must pass the national teachers’ qualification examinations. The national teachers’
qualifications examination system is prescribed by the State Council.

Overview

The National Education System includes basic education, secondary education and higher education. In
addition, there are distinctions between formal and non-formal education, as well as education run by
public and private providers.

The vocational training sector includes programs conducted under the Directorate Courses and Trainings,
Ministry of Education and Culture (MoEC) or those conducted under the Directorate General of
Directorate General Training and Productivity, Ministry of Manpower (MoM). Various other technical
ministries and industries also undertake training to meet their specific needs, either through their own
training agencies or through private providers.

The following overview of quality assurance relates specifically to the skills training sector under the
remit of the Ministry of Manpower and related agencies.

Indonesia National Qualifications Framework

A national qualifications framework was confirmed under presidential decree in 2012. The Indonesian
Qualification Framework (IQF) provides nine qualification levels. The framework has a strong focus on
equivalency and recognizing all pathways to obtaining qualifications and it promotes recognition of prior
learning. An agency responsible for governing and monitoring the implementation of IQF has not been
established.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation (Approval) of qualifications – Ministry of Manpower
The Ministry of Manpower is responsible for the management and coordination of competency standards
development. The Ministry devolves the responsibility for the development of the standards and
qualifications to the relevant technical Ministries (18 Ministries), but maintains oversight of the process.

Competency standards have been developed since 1996, but they have only recently been advanced
enough to be packaged into national qualifications. Both the Ministry of Manpower and the relevant
technical Ministry maintain the competencies. In each technical ministry there is a competency standards
committee who has one function, to monitor compliance with the standards of competence with industry
needs.

The Ministry of Manpower has developed a range of guidelines related to the development and review of
competency standards. The competency standards development process includes:

       •      Establishment of a standards committee (made up of ministry representatives)
       •      Establishment of two working groups (drafting team made up of industry representatives) and
              verification team (made up of government and industry representatives)

The Ministry of Manpower has set-up the framework of competency based training design and
implementation (and for curriculum), and facilitating the implementation (MoM Regulation Number
8/2014). Based on the framework, the individual providers develop curriculum. How far the individual

providers are able to do competency based training will be accredited by Training Provider Accreditation
Authority, established by Ministry of Manpower as an independent body.

Registration (Approval) of training providers −
Lembaga Akreditasi Lembaga Pelatihan Kerja (LA-LPK)
The LA-LPK is the registering body for the vocational institutions (Training Provider Accreditation
Authority). The main functions of LA-LPK are: deciding national policy and establishing standards for
training provider accreditation; establishing LA-LPK representative (Accreditation Committee) at each
province in Indonesia; conducting training provider accreditation and surveillance across Indonesia by
empowering accreditation committee; conducting assessor accreditation training and licensing them as a
partner of LA-LPK; promoting awareness of accreditation, both for private training provider and training
institution owned by government; building cooperation with national and international institution for
standardization; and, harmonizing accreditation across south east ASEAN and internationally.

Vocational institutions include:

    •   LPKs (Lembaga Pelatihan Kerja) – which is a generic term for private training institutions
    •   BLKs (Balai Latihan Kerja) – which are government owned vocational institutions (national
        or provincial)
    •   BLKLNs (Balai Latihan Kerja Luar Negeri) which are generally privately run institutions for
        those student intending for overseas work

There are 34 provinces out of which there are accreditation committees (KAs) in 30 provinces, but the
final decisions are all made by the Accreditation Committee (LA).

The registration requirements and processes are regulated through legislation and a series of ministerial
regulations. The roles and responsibilities of the LA-LPK are outlined in the regulations.
LA-LPK is responsible for the monitoring of training providers.

Training providers can apply to an LA or the Accreditation Committee. An assessment team is allocated
to review evidence submitted and also arrange a site visit. The assessment team during approval process
review 8 quality standards for training providers. It is not mandatory to be accredited (approved) to be a
LPK, but it is mandatory to be accredited (approved) to be a BLKLN. Both BLKs and LPKs must be
registered at labour affair at local government office in regency or city by submitting a legal status of
institution. Labor affair of Local government office will release a letter of approval and valid for 2 years.

Educator Requirements
Instructors are the responsibility of the training providers. There is no register of instructors. The
standards required by instructors include competence relevant to the technical task and teaching
pedagogy, assessing competency from LSP (BNSP requirements), and 12 years minimum service in a
high school.

There is a task force unit under MOM to monitor and develop the instructor competencies, including
content and methodology of teaching/facilitating. Most instructors do not have certificate of methodology
even though they are competence in content of subject.

Registration (Approval) of assessment providers – Baden Nasional Sertifikasi Profesi (BNSP)
BNSP is an independent body responsible to the President who has the authority as a certification
authority in charge of implementing the certification of personnel and professional competence for
labour. BNSP is the registering/licensing body of assessment providers (LSP= Professional Certification
Body). The licensing/registration of an LSP is legislated by Law 13/2003, Government Decree 23/2004,
and Government Decree 31/2006.

BNSP is the awarding body and approves assessment provider/certification bodies (LSP). The conditions

and criteria include BNSP Guidelines 201 & 202 which are traceable to ISO 17024/2003. There are
quality standards or requirements apart from BNSP Guidelines, that is:
    • Specific quality standard to be benchmarked in assessment, including the standard on quality of
         product or services
    • Specific standard quality of workplace or simulated workplace assessment venue/centre

Support documents that assist assessment providers (LSPs) to adhere to quality standards include: BNSP
Guidelines to manage the LSP organization, assessment and surveillance. The process for registration
includes application and review by a team of licensing assessors. BNSP manages and monitors
registration of providers or awarding bodies by assessment (audit), surveillance and witnesses. BNSP
undertakes an annual audit. LSP also report to BNSP every six months all assessment activity (i.e.,
completions at cluster or qualification level).

Assessment
The assessors (licensed by LSP and registered with BNSP) undertake the assessments of competencies.
Assessments are third party assessments, although an MOU has been signed with senior secondary
vocational schools (SMKs) for first party assessments (internal assessment undertaken by another
assessor who was not the trainer).

BNSP has a range of strategies in place to promote the consistency of assessor judgments. However, there
are not yet consensus or statistical moderation strategies in place either internally or externally. BNSP
provide LSPs with unique numbered parchments (certificates) for issuance by the LSP. Data of
completions are sent to BNSP on a six-monthly cycle; however, completions of competencies are kept at
LSP level.

Assessor Requirements
Minimum requirements for assessors are outlined in BNSP legislation and guidelines. Assessors are to
have assessment competencies (such as planning and organizing assessments, developing assessment
tools, and assessing competencies) and are to come from industry and hold the relevant competencies
(although an industry expert can be used in the assessment process). BNSP monitors and manages
recognition/approval of assessors. BNSP undertakes surveillance of the assessors to maintain their
competences. There is a proficiency test (standardized paper based test) undertaken each year and every 3
years assessors go through a recognition of current competency process to be re-recognized.

Japan35

Overview of the Education and Training System

Education in Japan follows a 6-3-3-4 tier system, comprising six years of compulsory elementary
education, three years of junior high school (lower secondary) education, three years of high school
(upper secondary) education (meaning that secondary education is constituted of six years), four years of
higher education and two years of graduate studies (Master’s Degree), which is optional. Technical,
Vocational Education and Training (TVET) is provided in TVET institutions as well as in high schools
(upper secondary) education and higher education.

The TVET sub-sector in the Japanese school system is made up of: (a) Colleges of Technology; (b)
Specialised Training Colleges (upper secondary course and general course); and, (c) Miscellaneous
Schools.

A broader classification of TVET institutions in Japan consists of (1) Public Vocational and Training
Centers, (2) Schools, and (3) Private Organisations. While TVET programs in Higher Education and
Post-secondary institutions are under the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology
(MEXT), polytechnic universities, colleges and centre are under the supervision of Ministry of Labour,
Health and Welfare (MHLW). There are some vocational training institutions under other Ministries. In
addition, there are affiliated professional schools with other Ministries such as Policy Academy, College
of Meteorology and Training Centres for Diplomas. The affiliated professional schools are supervised by
the National Institution for Academic and Degrees and University Evaluation (NIAD-UE).

Training provided by private organisations also plays an important role in Japan; and is mainly divided
into three parts: (1) Training in Corporations; (2) Training/courses for occupational licenses; and,
(3) other skill development programs. A key feature of the education and training system in Japan is the
On-the-job-training (OJT) and Off-the-job-training (OffJT) conducted within private enterprises.

National Qualifications Framework

In 2011, the Cabinet Office in Japan (CAO) set up a technical task force to discuss the development of
Japanese version of NVQ (National Vocational Framework) based on UK’s NQF by 2020 (CAO, 2015).
The prototype of Japanese version of NVQ (JQF) is called “Kyaria Dani Seido” and has seven levels
from entry level to professional level. There is no national qualifications framework.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications
The Minister of Education, Culture, Sports, Sciences and Technology (MEXT) manages and monitors the
accreditation processes. In addition to NIAD-UE, the MEXT has certified 12 accrediting agencies. NIAD-
UE conducts certified evaluation and accreditation (CEA). The NIAD-UE is responsible for accrediting
qualifications. In terms of TVET institutions, the CEA is only applied to colleges of technologies.
Specialised training colleges, miscellaneous schools, polytechnic centres, and affiliated professional
schools are not listed under the coverage. However, NIAD-UE as an accrediting agency plays a role of
awarding body for these TVET institutions. NIAD-UE examines the candidates of graduation after these
TVET institutions apply for approval of offering the certifications.

                                                          NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                   	
                                                                                                                  	




	

The implementing body of the national qualifications or provider specific qualifications is divided into
following three: (1) governments; (2) local governments and public organisation; and, (3) legally
appointed organisations. There is no systematic legislation for the occupational licenses, but each national
and official license body has their own rules and regulations.

It is stated in the School Education Law that every university, junior college, and college of technology is
obliged to conduct self-assessment and publish its results; no applicable unit is legally determined. Each
institution conducts self-assessment at the institutional level and, where needed, at the academic unit
level.

Relationship to Standards
The Vocational Ability Development Measures (VADM) is a system to assess the occupational skills and
ability standards developed by MLHW. The Vocational Ability Development Measures is a national
standard, and this strategy covers polytechnic institutions under MLHW, but not for other education
levels and other TVET institutions.

There is Vocational Capability Evaluation Standards (VCES) called “Syokugyo Nouryoku Hyoka Kijun”.
The VCES, which have been developed by the MHLW and the Japan Vocational Ability Development
Association (JVADA), organises knowledge and skills which are needed in labour market, and sets up the
framework of categorising examples of tasks and duties into four levels from entry level to manager level
by sector, occupation, and duty. The occupational standards contain competencies needed for tasks by
industry, occupation and duty.

Registration (Approval) of Education and Training Providers/Awarding Bodies
The registration of miscellaneous schools is under local governments. Public miscellaneous schools are
under the prefectural board of education and private ones are under the prefectural governor.

The registration of TVET providers is under either the jurisdiction of MEXT or NIAD-UE. School
institutions such as colleges of technology, specialised training colleges are under MEXT, while
polytechnic centres and affiliated professional schools link with NIAD-UE. The process of registering a
TVET provider includes an evaluation of an application, and an investigation undertaken by the Council
for University Chartering and School Corporation subcommittees.

In terms of polytechnic centres, NIAD-UE investigates provider’s programs to ensure that they are
equivalent to the standards of university’s bachelor, master’s or doctoral programs based on University
Establishment Standards. The Council for University Chartering and School Corporation monitors
through written reports, interviews, or site-visits whether the university conducts education and research
as planned until the year in which it produces its first graduates.

Educator Requirements
The minimum requirement to become instructors in the public ordinary vocational training is to obtain
Vocational Training Instructor’s License for a particular type of course/subject. Acquisition of this license
is not necessary to become instructors in public advanced vocational training.

Teachers who teach vocational subjects in lower secondary schools are required to obtain Regular
Certificate of lower secondary schools for these particular subjects. Likewise, teachers, who teach
vocational subjects mainly in upper secondary schools with SC, are required to obtain a Regular
Certificate of upper secondary schools for these particular subjects. In Japan, people are commonly
qualified as teachers by completing the teacher training curriculum at colleges and universities, and
receive teacher certificates from the prefectural board of education.

The minimum requirements to be a faculty member of a higher education institution are specified by the
standards for establishment of each type of institution. Miscellaneous schools can set the requirements of
their teachers in their own ways. Article 8 of the Ordinance of the Ministry of Education No. 31 of 1956

only states that teachers in miscellaneous schools are to have specialised knowledge and skills in the
subjects they teach, and always endeavour to improve these knowledge and skills.

Minimum requirements for teachers in each course of specialised training colleges are set by the
standards for establishment of these colleges specified in from Articles 18 to 20 of the Ordinance of the
Ministry of Education No. 2 of 1976. In addition, there are private entities, including the Association for
Technical and Career Education, which issue teacher certificates to ensure the quality of teachers in
specialised training colleges (Association for Technical and Career Education, 2015).

Korea36
Overview of Education System

Korea’s educational system operates on a 6-3-3-4 structure, with vocational education introduced at the
upper-secondary level. At this level, the vocational high school curriculum includes vocational/technical
education in technology, agriculture, commerce, maritime, housework, etc.

At the post-secondary level, vocational colleges provide the nation with mid-level technicians and
professionals. In regards to the TVET system, in addition to this vocational education, vocational training
is also offered under the governance of the MoEL via training institutes in both the private and public
sectors or training centres housed in respective companies. For vocational education, the MoE plans and
executes financial policies. Finance for vocational training can be divided into public and private
funding. Public funds are derived from MoEL, related ministries and municipal governments. Private
funds stem from the budgets of skills development projects from Employment Insurance paid by business
owners.

National Qualifications Framework

Framework overview
Since 2013, the development of the KQF system has become one of the top policy priorities as a means of
providing various pathways to youth to obtain qualifications and by acknowledging abilities rather than
degrees when hiring or promoting workers. As a part of efforts, in 2013, the MoE and MoEL together
established “Planning for the NQF system” which articulates that the KQF will be based on the National
Competency Standards (NCS). The MoEL is now responsible for the development of the NCS, learning
outcome based qualifications. The KQF covers the TVET sector and engineering major in higher
education primarily.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation of qualifications
National qualifications include National Technical Qualifications (NTQ) and National Qualifications of
Non-Technical Categories (NQNTC). Provider specific qualifications are the registered private
qualifications and the nationally recognised private qualifications. Presently, both national/private
qualifications and NCS-based qualifications co-exist, although the Korean government is trying to move
towards NCS-based qualifications. All qualifications are registered, except for NCS-based qualifications,
and the list can be viewed at http://www.pqi.or.kr/inf/qul/infQulList.do.

Standards
The NCS defines what graduates are expected to know, understand, and be able to do as a result of
learning for each occupational type at a certain level. The NCS has eight levels based on four
classifications. The four classifications are Major Group (24), Minor Group (77), Broad Group (227) and
Detailed Occupation (857). The NCS also has a volume measure at a unit. Based on the number of units,
the duration of training time can be calculated. The qualifications are also unitised and modularised.

The NCS address 20 industry categories. By early 2015, the NCS have been developed for more than 800
occupations, and for each occupation, about 10 competency units have been developed.

HRD Korea is responsible for developing the NCS in collaboration with Sector Councils in their relative
sectors. MoEL is responsible for operating the NCS and overseeing its application in the labour market.
Nine government ministries are also responsible for operating the NCS in 20 industry categories in their
respective areas. The government agency, Korea Research Institute for Vocational Education and Training
(KRIVET), is developing an NCS-based curriculum. This modularised curriculum will be used by
training institutes, Meister high schools, and vocational colleges. Accrediting agencies for qualifications
will use the NCS to issue a qualification.

Registration (Approval) of Training Providers
There are two types of training institutes: one is funded by students’ tuition and fees and the other is
funded by the MoEL. The process for registration includes:

    •   A training institute consults with the MoEL before registering. Then, the institute registers via
        HRD-Net that is managed by HRD Korea. The public register of providers exists at HRD-Net.
    •   Next, the provincial and local offices of the MoEL review the registered training institute in order
        to decide whether or not it is eligible to receive government funds.
    •   If the registered training institute is approved, it becomes accredited and receives training funds
        from the MoEL and is placed under rigorous monitoring by HRD Korea and KRIVET. HRD
        Korea monitors the provider by conducting surveys and interviews with individuals and groups.
        KRIVET monitors them by collecting client feedback on facilities, equipment, instructors,
        curricula, and the employment outcomes of graduates, etc. The outcome reports are conducted
        annually by these two agencies: the monitoring report conducted by HRD Korea is an internal
        report, and the report conducted by KRIVET is disclosed publicly via online, HRD-Net.

Educator Requirements
TVET teachers are classified into cluster training teachers (professional teachers, general teachers) and
on-site training teachers. TVET teachers’ qualifications are subscribed in “the Act on Vocational
Competency Development of Workers”, and they should pass both a theory and practice test, as well as a
final interview, to be accredited. Endorsed by the MoEL, HRD Korea approves TVET teachers during
the accrediting process. Only the teachers of the government-substitute training programs are required to
register via HRD-Net, and the MoEL is responsible for managing and monitoring this register of teachers.

Lao PDR37
Overview of Education System

Since 2009/2010, Lao PDR has started to reform its schooling system from 11 year schooling to a 12 year
structure comprising five years of primary, four years of lower secondary, and three years of upper
secondary schooling. The national education system has four components38: early childhood, general
education (primary to upper secondary), Vocational Education at three levels (first, middle and high
level); and, Higher Education. There are two main TVET subsectors.
     1. TVET is managed through the Ministry of Education and Sports (Department of Technical,
         Vocational Education and Training). The technical and vocational education comprises:
         • Skilled workers training divided into 4 levels
         • Vocational education: 1–3 years for lower secondary school leavers, graduate as Certificate
              for Vocational Education
         • Technical and Vocational Education: 2–3 years for regular course and 1–2 years for
              continuing study, graduate as Technician or Vocational Diploma
         • Technical and vocational education: 2–3 years for regular course and 1–2 years for
              continuing study graduate as High Technician or Vocational Diploma
         • Bachelor level: ≤1.5 Y for continuing study
     2. The Skills Development sector is managed through the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare.
         The structure of skills development consists of: basic skill level, and skills levels 1–4

National Qualification Framework

There is no national qualifications framework (NQF) which relates all levels of education, training and
qualifications and identifies the pathways between them. A NQF is in the initial stages with the most
recent draft proposing an 8-level structure.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation of Qualification

Approval
There is no unified qualification accreditation system. In 2001 and 2004, the department of Higher,
Technical and Vocational Education developed the curriculum standards from certificate level to master
degree, including a credit based system. Recently, the TVE department and the department of higher
education have initiated the revision of its education and training system.

Under TVET law, the MOES is to approve and promulgate (as well as abolish) national curricula.
Vocational qualifications are accredited against the Vocational Qualification Framework (of which there
are 5 levels – basic, semi-skilled, skilled, technician, high technician). The curriculum standard for each
trade is determined in specific regulations.

There are no quality standards or criteria to apply, no defined process for accreditation, nor any national
qualifications. There is no accrediting agency to manage and monitor accreditation processes. At this
stage there is no monitoring of quality and currency of qualifications.

For public providers, a list of qualifications is available on the TVET department website.

Assessment
A current donor funded project has developed a knowledge and practical item bank for priority areas.
Currently providers develop their own assessment tools and undertake their own assessment. It is
proposed that the assessment will be separated from training.

Under TVET law (No 42/National Assembly 2013) TVET institutions issue the certificate/diploma. The
law notes that diploma and higher level shall be registered for control in the relevant ministry and that
certificates and lower attestation shall be registered for control in concerned offices at provincial and
Vientiane levels.

Providers established/registered by the Ministry of Education and Sport issue the qualification, but the
provider is to provide the details and certificates to the Ministry for the formal seal to be added before
being provided to the graduate.

Competency Standards
A donor funded project has developed competency standards for four Occupation sectors, and draft
regulations that outline the process for development. Developers of the competency standards are to be a
tripartite body composed of representatives from the labour group, training providers and employers of
the specified industry.

There is no curriculum body that develops curriculum or training materials/assessment tools. However a
donor funded project has developed curriculum and training materials (and some standardized assessment
tools) for the identified occupational areas.

For government providers the Vocational Education Institute develops curriculum. For private providers
there is no such facility and they are required to develop their own curriculum.

Quality Assurance Approach – Provider
The Educational Quality Assurance Centre (EQAC) is commissioned with the quality assurance of
basic education, TVET and higher education and to develop testing and evaluation. It also has
responsibility for the development of the proposed NQF. EQAC are trialing a monitoring quality
assurance process utilising an external assessment process against the quality standards. The Centre
has selected 87 assessors (auditors) of which 30 external assessors have been trained.

The quality assurance manual of the education sector was recently developed and approved by the
minister of education in April 2011. The quality assurance mechanisms were established in all 22
TVET institutions under the MOE. The TVET quality standard consists of 10 components and 32
indicators. 39

Under TVET law (No 42/National Assembly 2013) the following quality assurance mechanisms have
been outlined:

       •      Self-assessment to be conducted once a year
       •      Internal assessment to be conducted by Department of Inspection
       •      External assessment to be conducted every 5 years by an international and independent
              agency.

Registration of Providers/ Awarding Bodies and Education Providers
The broader TVET sector includes:

       •      The Department of Non-Formal Education (DNFE) is in charge of providing non-formal
              education focusing on literacy, but also provides some basic vocational education skills.
       •      The Technical and Vocational Education Department (TVED), which supervises 22 TVET
              institutions under MOE
       •      The Department of Skills Development (DSD) of the Ministry of Labour and Social Welfare,
              which has one division in charge of skills development and skills assessment through four
              training centres
       •      High Education Department (DHE) supervises all universities and higher education
              institutions
              (4 universities under MOE).
       •      The Department of Private Education Administration (DPEA) supervises all private TVET
              and High Educations.
       •      Education and training providers of the other public sector under various line ministries.

The TVED responsibilities include:40 (1) to supervise for the registration of all public TVET colleges
and schools all over the countries including TVET in the line ministries, (2) to approve all TVET
curriculum including private TVET institutions, (3) to supervise the pre- and in-service training of
TVET teachers/ instructors to serve all TVET institutions, including technical teachers for secondary
education and instructors for the basic vocational training in non-formal education.

The PM decree on TVET and Skills Development 2010, Article 58 indicates that the MOE supervises
all kind of TVET management and inspection, while the MOLSW (Department of Skills
Development and Employment) is responsible for registration, management and monitoring the skills
development of both public and private institutions.41

Under TVET law (No 42/National Assembly 2013) there are 4 types of TVET institutions: training
centre, schools, colleges and institutes. Under this law, providers are to meet standards set by the
MOES.

Under the new TVET law in early 2014, all registration of TVET providers is being moved under the
Department of TVET, MOES. This includes public and private providers.

Educator Requirements
TVET teachers are under the Department of TVET, and there are two types – practical teachers in
workshops and theory teachers. There are two standards for TVET trainers/assessors:

       •      Those developed by GIZ – for theory teachers and trained by university
       •      Those developed ADB – for practical trainers and trained by Vocational Education Institute.
              There are four levels of training/assessing qualifications for vocational trainers.

Malaysia42
Overview

The Malaysian education system encompasses: pre-tertiary education (pre-school to secondary
education) under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and tertiary or higher education
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE). The Department of Skills
Development, Ministry of Human Resource is responsible for Skills sector. The legislative base for
tertiary education (higher education, TVET and Skills sectors) is:
     1. Universities and University Colleges Act 1971
     2. The Private Higher Educational Institution Act 1996 (PHEI Act 1996)
     3. Education Act 550 1996
     4. National Skills Development Act 2006 (NASDA Act 2006)
     5. Malaysian Qualifications Agency Act 2007

National Qualifications Framework

The Malaysia Qualifications Framework (MQF) was officially published in 2007. The MQF enables
individuals to progress in higher education through transfer of credits and recognition of prior
learning, acquired from formal, non-formal and informal learning. The MQF is an 8-level framework,
has a credit point system, and includes program profiles for disciplines and qualifications.

The quality documents that are developed comprised of rules and regulations that need to be complied
by HEPs. The documents are:

       1.     Malaysian Qualifications Framework (MQF)
       2.     Code of Practice for Program Accreditation (COPPA)
       3.     Code of Practice for Institutional Audit (COPIA)
       4.     Programme Standards (PS)
       5.     Guidelines to Good Practices (GGP)
       6.     National Occupational Skill Standard (NOSS)
       7.     Code of Practice for Skills Programme Accreditation

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation of Qualifications
For TVET & Higher Education qualifications, the Malaysian Qualifications Agency (MQA) is the
only accrediting body as stated in the MQA Act 2007. Programme of studies that are accredited by
MQA will be registered in the Malaysian Qualification Register (MQR).

There are professional bodies that recognise their own specific fields, such as the Engineering
Accreditation Council (EAC) and Malaysian Medical Council (MMC).

For Skills qualifications, the Department of Skills Development, Ministry of Human Resource (DSD,
MOHR) accredits programmes. The accreditation process for skills programmes is based on NASDA
Act 2006.

                                                        NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                 	
                                                                                                                	




	
The DSD, MOHR uses National Occupational Skills Standard (NOSS) to accredit programmes. At the
moment there are no specific National TVET qualifications; however, qualifications are guided by
National Occupational Skills Standards (NOSS).

Monitoring of quality and currency of qualifications includes:

    •   For technical and vocational programmes conducted by Polytechnics and Community
        Colleges will be monitored by MQA through a maintenance audit once in every five years.
    •   For skills programmes the DSD MOHR audit and star-rate once in every two years.

Assessment
Higher education and technical and vocational providers are the awarding bodies. For skills
programmes based on NOSS standards, the Department of Skills Development, Ministry of Human
Resources is the main awarding body. Assessments are undertaken by individual providers.

For programmes accredited through MQA, assessments are internally developed and subject to
COPPA and to some extent COPIA which requires student assessment processes to have external
scrutiny (enhanced standard).

For those programmes accredited through DSD (MOHR), there are assessment test banks which
providers must use (this initiative is still in progress and assessment banks do not address all industry
sectors of the NOSS). Portfolio or practical assessments are developed by the individual providers.
NOSS qualifications are subject to internal and external verification processes.

To ensure consistency of assessor judgements in relation to student assessment:

    •   For technical and vocational programmes and skills programmes, quality and currency of
        qualifications are monitored through accreditation, maintenance audit, Institutional Audit,
        rating and continuous quality improvement.
    •   For MQA accredited programmes, the evaluations undertaken by the panel of assessors are
        based on quality assurance documents and MQA established Accreditation Committees to
        ensure consistent judgement. These committees are comprised of subject experts from various
        fields.

Relationship to Standards

Standards are used for programme development for the higher education, technical and vocational
education and skills education sectors.

For higher education and technical vocational education programmes approved by the MQA,
educational standards are developed (referred to as programme standards) to inform curriculum and
training and assessment material development. Assessment of students’ performance is subjected to
the quality assurance as set out in COPPA and contextualised by discipline through the Programme
Standards at programme level by COPIA when checking the policies and systems on student
assessment at institutional level. External examiners are especially mandatory for bachelor and above
programmes.

For skills programmes approved by DSD, MOHR, the development of ‘occupational skills standards’
are developed at a national level. Individual standards include:

    •   Competency profile chart
    •   Competency profiles including work activities (job tasks) and performance criteria


                                                                                                    Page	48	of	68

    •   Curriculum of competencies unit (COCU).

The competency profiles are the competency specifications supported by the COCU which includes
required knowledge and skills, training hours, delivery mode and assessment criteria.

Registration of Training Providers
The registration of higher education providers and technical and vocational providers is under the
jurisdiction of Ministry of Education, whilst the registration of skills providers is under the
jurisdiction of Ministry of Human Resource. Both ministries have developed their own standards and
requirements for registration of TVET/Skills Programmes Providers.

Monitoring strategies are employed by both ministries and TVET provider outcomes are reported
through programme accreditation reports and maintenance audit reports.

There is a register for higher education and TVET and for skills providers maintained by the Ministry
of Education and DSD, Ministry of Human Resource.

Educator/Assessor Requirements
There are minimum requirements for teachers stated in the MQA quality assurance documents. In
general, teachers’ qualifications should be at least one level higher than the program intended to be
taught (experience is not mandatory).

According to DSD, MOHR quality assurance documents, teachers should have qualifications
appropriate to the program intended to be taught. The DSD requires assessors to have at least a
Malaysian Skills Certificate one level higher than that they are assessing and the Vocational Training
Officer qualification (which is a 3-month program with 6-month internship). Trainers and assessors
have different standards, with the trainer standards being less stringent.

Education System Overview

The education system in Mongolia consists of the following levels: pre-school, secondary (combining
primary, lower secondary and upper secondary), and TVET and tertiary education. After completing
nine years of basic education, students can either continue to upper secondary education or enter
TVET schools. After completing twelve years of secondary schooling, students who wish to continue
with further studies may enter tertiary institutions or TVET schools.

TVET schools were administered by the Ministry of Education until 2012 and now are under the
Ministry of Labour. There are four types of institutions that offer TVET programs: (a) vocational
training and production centres (VTPC) (40 of them); (b) independent (technical) colleges (9); (c)
branches of higher education institutes (7); and (c) branches of universities (15).

VTPC and technical colleges enrol students who graduated from 9th grade of secondary schooling
(completion of basic education). They are expected to study two and a half years and receive both
vocational education certificate along with secondary education completion certificate.

Vocational programs operating within branches of universities and institutes enrol only graduates of
12th grade of secondary schooling (high school graduates). They are expected to study only one year
for getting vocational education or occupational certificate or 2–3 years for vocational education
diploma.

Non-formal vocational training programs are short-term programs (up to three months). These are
administered by the Ministry of Labour. After completion of training the participants receive a
vocational/skills or competency certificate. In addition, on-the-job training is administered by
employers.

National Qualifications Framework
	
Mongolia does not have a national qualification framework (NQF). A few years ago, a six-level
TVET qualification framework was proposed under the Millennium Challenge Account Mongolia-
TVET project (2007–2012). However, the government has not proceeded with establishing the
framework.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms
	
Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications
There is no accrediting or assessment agency for qualifications in Mongolia. In tertiary education, the
MEDS defines the general rules for issuing qualifications by education institutions. Based on the
general rules, each institution develops their own rules on issuing qualifications.

The tertiary education and TVET sector quality assurance system includes three main modes:

    1) Institutional or program level accreditation: the Mongolian National Council of Education
       Accreditation (MNCEA) has accredited 65 HEIs, 4 TVET schools, 174 higher education
       programs, and 8 TVET programs. MNCEA has established a two-step process for quality
       assurance: self-assessment by institutions and on-site assessment by external assessors.
    2) Attestation: Every HEI should go through the attestation process once every five years,
       managed by the external expert team appointed by the Ministry of Education. The criteria for
       attestation include several aspects, such as legal environment, academic program organisation,
       teaching, students, learning environment, ICT, and research activities.
    3) Licensing: Licensing is a special permission that the Ministry of Education or Ministry of
       Labour gives to those applying to establish a new educational institution.

Furthermore, there are three government agencies in charge of collecting data related to education for
quality assurance: National Statistical Committee, MEDS, and Ministry of Labour (only in charge of
TVET).

Relationship to Standards

Standards in Higher Education
The 2002 Education Law stipulated that higher education program standards approved by the
Mongolian Agency for Standardization and Metrology (MASM) should be used as mandatory
national standards for all HEIs. MASM is the government agency which registers and keeps the
standards.

These standards approved by MASM include sample course lists for the program applied, list of
common competencies to be acquired by the graduates, knowledge and skills related to profession to
be obtained by graduates and evaluation criteria and qualification criteria for teaching staff. Each
program standard is initially drafted by a team composed of representatives from university professors
and specialists-practitioners in the related field, and approved by the MASM. The Ministry of
Education and Science (MEDS) reviews the standards and works closely with MASM in the approval
process. At MASM level, there is a committee to review and approve the standards. A representative
from MEDS has to work in this committee.

Standards in the TVET sector
The Law on TVET (Article 10) (2009) stipulates that vocational education and training standards
should define the requirements of knowledge and skills for learning content (learning content consists
of the three: general core, professional core and specialised core), requirements for evaluation,
learning conditions and teacher qualifications. Standards are to be approved by the MASM according
to the Law on Standardization and Metrology. A sample standard of TVET program was approved by
Resolution No A/163 dated on 18 July 2014 of the Minister of Labour. This sample standard includes
expected job skills of graduates, admission requirements, requirements for curriculum content and its
assessment, teacher qualifications and requirement for institutions and learning conditions, such as
tools and equipment.

Quality Assurance of Standards
The State Professional Inspection Agency (SPIA) under the government cabinet is in charge of
overseeing the implementation of standards in all fields of economy and social sectors, including
education sectors. This agency has the Department in charge of overseeing educational institutions
which is in charge of quality assurance of standards and competency framework.

Curriculum Development
Article 8.4 of the Higher Education Law states that programs and their curriculum should be
developed for each major field of study and they should be endorsed by the Ministry of Education and


                                                                                                  Page	51	of	68

                                                        NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                 	
                                                                                                                	




	
approved by rectors of higher education institutions. The curriculum includes general and professional
core content, and the specialisation core as content. Decree No A/370 (2014) required that at
institutional level there should be a Program Committee for each major field of study in charge of
designing and implementing programs. In addition, each program should have a study plan or
curriculum.

The TVET curriculum is supposed to be in accordance with relevant industrial and educational
standards involving employers, experts, teachers and methodological experts. Approval is required
from the Ministry of Labour. MOL has the Department of TVET Policy and regional methodological
centres in 5 provinces. The regional methodological centres play a key role in curriculum
development.

According to the Article 9 of the Law on TVET, the curriculum content is divided into three parts:
general core, professional core and specialised core. Since 2010, competency-based curriculum
development process is underway. Faculties of TVET schools were trained in designing competence-
based curriculum under Millennium Challenge Account (MCA) TVET project.

Registration (Approval) of Education and Training Providers/Awarding Bodies
The Education Law sets the rules for awarding a license for establishing a new higher education
institution. The Law on Licensing of entities in Mongolia is applied to this process along with
education related legislations and rules. According to this Education Law statement, the following
documents should be submitted to the Ministry of Education for establishing a higher education
training provider or institution: curriculum; detailed information about teaching staff, their
qualification; school building, equipment, textbooks; financial sources and capacity to run the school;
list of real estate or building to be provided by owners; and land license.

The joint Ministerial Order No 386 by the Ministry of Education and Science (MEDS) and Ministry
of Labor (MOL) in 2013 sets rules for establishing a new TVET school. According to this joint
Ministerial order, the following quality requirements apply:

    •   Each program to be offered at the TVET schools should describe the proposed curriculum
        describing competencies for students. Each program should identify the hours allocated for
        contact hours and internships. Curriculum should be developed according to the rules for
        competency based curriculum and in partnership with industry.
    •   Criteria for teaching staff are as follows: highly qualified, industrial experience, and trained in
        pedagogical methodology program
    •   Learning condition should meet the requirements for infrastructure, safety and hygiene.
    •   Proper lab equipment and condition.

The educational institutions are monitored by respective Ministries. The quality assurance modes are
mentioned above.

Educator Requirements
For tertiary education faculties and lecturers, the main requirement is a Master’s degree in the field of
teaching as stated in the Article 13 of the Law on Higher Education. An additional requirement is that
they should have been taught in pedagogical methodology of teaching.

In addition, the Ministers of Education and Science order No 139 in 2003 identifies the key general
requirement for tertiary education faculty: (a) general or communication skills; (b) creative skills; (c)
professional skills as educators; and, (d) research skills.

For TVET and higher education sectors, there is no official approval or licensing for teachers. There
is no centralised register.

Overview
The National Education Law, 30 September 2014, aims to implement a system of national education
that links formal education, non-formal education and personal education.

Early childhood education will be implemented by parents, villages and appropriate departments and
organisations. Pre-school education will be implemented from age 3 to age 5. Formal education will
include: basic education, technical and vocational education, and higher education.

Technical and Vocational Education is divided into the following:

     • Basic level technical and vocational education that can be attended by those who have completed
       primary school.
     • Middle level technical and vocational education that can be attended by those who have
       completed middle school
     • Diploma level technical and vocational education that can be attended by those who have
       completed high school
     • Non-formal education and vocational education for improving ability regardless of educational
       level, gender, or age, offered in schools opened by government or private organisations that meet
       the criteria.

The relevant ministries shall establish the curriculum, period of study, kind of degree or certificate to
be awarded for each of the levels of education.

National Qualifications Framework
The planned NQF will cover all sectors, from Basic Education through to TVET and Higher
Education.
It proposed that the framework will be 8 levels.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications

Approval
The National Skills Standards Authority (NSSA) has the authority under the Employment and Skills
Development Law (ESD) to accredit TVET qualifications from levels 1–4. Accrediting agencies for
some professions (e.g. engineering) exist as do international agencies such as City and Guilds.
Accreditation of qualifications is legislated only under the ESD, for TVET levels 1–4. There are
quality standards for accrediting agencies being developed under the ESD for TVET, levels 1–4.

The NSSA for TVET levels 1–4 is responsible for managing and monitoring accreditation processes.
Different Ministries (e.g. Science and Technology, Education) have their own accreditation and
monitoring arrangements. There are no national qualifications, but there are provider specific
qualifications, that is, by institution. There is no public register of qualifications. The quality and

currency of qualifications is monitored by Ministry officials visiting institutions for discussion with
high level management.

Assessment
Assessment for recognition of qualifications includes, for TVET under NSSA, assessors from the
industry sector committees. Consistency of judgements is managed by NSSA using a “trial test” to
validate test instruments and consult with employers. In TVET the NSSA issues skills qualifications
levels 1–4.

Relationship to Standards
Occupational and/or competency standards relate to specific tasks. The format design includes type of
competencies (basic, industrial and technical or functional), unit code, unit title, competency
elements, performance criteria, essential or underpinning knowledge, range and context etc.

In 2007, the NSSA developed 173 standards across a number of industry sectors and occupations.
In addition, international standards apply for specific industries where there are employment
requirements, such as maritime and the International welder association.

The process for development of competency standards includes:

    • Standards that were copied and adapted from other countries with minimal consultation with
      industry are now being reviewed and refined with industry. Under the ESD Law, the standards
      should be developed by sectoral committees.
    • The 173 developed in 2007 were approved by cabinet, but there is no public access. Out of
      173, six occupations have been modified and tested for the fast track.

The NSSA is responsible for development of standards, following enactment of the ESD Law in 2013.
The occupational standard from NSSA is currently used for testing and used as a reference for the
curriculum development requested by training centres, both private and public.

Registration (Approval) of Training and Providers
At present there are no registering bodies. In terms of managing and monitoring registration of
providers or awarding bodies, for TVET this will likely be the NSSA. The establishment of quality
standards for providers is in process.

Educator/Assessor Requirements
The minimum requirements for assessors in TVET have been set in a testing/assessment pilot
conducted by the NSSA with support from GIZ. The bodies responsible for monitoring and managing
trainers and assessors are (a) NSSA for TVET (Ministry of Labour, Employment and Social Security)
– in process, and (b) Department of TVET (Ministry of Science and Technology). There is no register
of teachers, trainers, educators, lecturers, assessors.

Overview

The Philippine education system consists of both formal and non-formal education. Formal education
is a sequential progression of academic schooling at three levels—elementary (grade school);
secondary (high school) and tertiary (college). In terms of structure, however, it is categorised either
as basic (preschool, elementary and high school) or tertiary (post-secondary: technical/vocational,
college and graduate).

Since 1992, the Philippine education system has been tri-focalised into basic, technical/vocational and
higher education governed by three agencies, namely the Department of Education (DepEd) for basic
education, the Technical Education and Skills Development Authority (TESDA) for technical
education and skills training, and the Commission on Higher Education (CHED) for higher education.
The focus on this overview is on the quality assurance arrangements of TESDA.

National Qualifications Framework

The Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF) is a national policy that aims to define educational
qualifications and set the standards for qualification outcomes within the Philippine education system.
The Philippine Qualifications Framework (PQF) covers all sectors of education: basic, TVET and
tertiary education. The PQF is an 8-level framework. The PQF National Coordinating Committee
(PQF-NCC) is responsible for managing and monitoring the NQF.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications

Approval
The TESDA Board approves and monitors qualifications. The development of qualifications is
facilitated by the TESDA Secretariat either sub-contracting it to an Industry Association/Industry
Working Group or to technical experts. The developed qualification goes through a series of
consultations before it is submitted to the TESDA Board for approval/promulgation. The TESDA
Board promulgates the Training Regulations which defines the minimum requirements/information on
qualifications: the competency standards, training standards, trainer qualifications, facilities, tools and
equipment. The competency assessment and certification recognise qualification as evidenced in the
issuance of national certificate/ and or certificate of competency. All qualifications promulgated can
be accessed at the TESDA Website at www.tesda.gov.ph. TESDA promulgated qualifications are
periodically reviewed/updated every three (3) years.

Assessment
Assessments are undertaken by Accredited Competency Assessors who are individuals authorised by
TESDA to assess competencies of a candidate for national certification in an Accredited Competency
Assessment Centre – an establishment officially authorised by TESDA to manage the assessment
activities of candidates for national certification including the provision of support services.

Two assessments processes are in place:

    1. Institutional administered assessment is undertaken for a TESDA registered program to
       ascertain if the student has gained the necessary competencies before being declared a
       graduate of a given qualification.
    2. The student-graduate must take the mandatory National Assessment administered by a
       TESDA Accredited Competency Assessor for qualifications covered by TESDA-promulgated
       Training Regulations. Passing the National Assessment enables the student-graduate to be a
       National Certificate holder for the promulgated qualification.

For TESDA Accredited Competency Assessors, calibration and moderation exercises are managed by
TESDA to achieve validity and reliability of competency assessment results.

Relationship to Standards
Competency standards are industry based standards and are developed and packaged into what are
called Training Regulations (TRs). The standards are based on notion of competence. The
competency standards describe the specific tasks based on a broad occupation functions and roles
through a process called functional analysis. The development Training Regulations follows a quality
assurance system where industry technical experts provide specification of industry requirements in
terms of knowledge, skills and attitude. The technical expert panels are composed of representatives
from industry, academe and labour. The system relies heavily on stakeholder consultation at different
stages.

TVET institutions/training providers are to develop their own curriculum as part of the requirements
of program registration.

Registration (Approval) of Training/Assessment Providers
The TESDA is the registering body responsible for registering (quality-assuring) and monitoring the
TVET programs of public and private TVET providers in their areas of jurisdiction before they are
offered to the public. The major steps in the registration of a provider include review of application
and conduct of site inspection by the TESDA team and submission of the inspection report. The
registered programs of the TVET providers are subjected to periodic compliance audits by the
concerned TESDA Provincial and Regional Offices one year after registration and every two years
thereafter. There are 9 criteria for evaluating TVET providers for program delivery.

TESDA-accredited assessment centres are required to satisfy the following:

    • Physical structure – related to physical infrastructure and equipment
    • Administration – equipment and staff.

Assessment providers are monitored through:

    •   Compliance audit conducted a year after the program has been issued Certificate of Program
        Registration and every two years thereafter; or unscheduled compliance investigation.
    •   Evaluation of programs based on certification rates and employment rates of graduates
        reckoned against the national standards.

Educator/Assessor requirements
1. Each qualification (Training Regulation) promulgated by the TESDA Board contains the trainer
   qualification requirements. As a general rule, all TVET trainers must possess the appropriate
   National TVET Trainer Certificate (NTTC) Level which requires the following: a relevant
   national vocational certificate; training pedagogy certification; and, industry experience.


                                                                                                  Page	57	of	68	
                                                                                                                                  	
                                                                Promoting	Skills	Development	and	Job	Creation	in	East	Asia	Project	
                                                                          NQF	and	Competency	Standards:	A	synthesis	report	
                                                           	
                                                                                                                                  	




	
   Additional requirements for TESDA-accredited assessor relate to: employment history and
   assistance at assessment for new assessors, and attendance at moderation and performance
   evaluation for recertification.
2. TESDA monitors and manages recognition/approval of trainers and of its assessors, including a
   register of trainers/assessors.


Singapore46
Overview

The Singapore education system under the Ministry of Education (MOE) covers pre-school, primary,
secondary, post-secondary, and university level education. The MOE also delivers continuing
education and training (CET) through the Institute of Technical Education (ITE), and polytechnics.
Each of the formal education institutions (i.e. 5 autonomous universities, 5 polytechnics and ITE) has
an Act that spells out the establishment and functions of the institutions etc., including the powers to
award qualifications (Source: http://www.moe.gov.sg/).

For the private education sector, the Council for Private Education (CPE) oversees and regulates
private education institutions (PEIs), under the Private Education Act. The Enhanced Registration
Framework (ERF), as set out under the Private Education Act and the Private Education Regulations,
spells out the mandatory registration requirements and legislative obligations which all private
education institutions, must meet, including registration, corporate governance, quality of provisions,
and enhanced information transparency. (Source: http://www.cpe.gov.sg)

The Singapore Workforce Skills Qualifications (WSQ) is a national credentialing system, based on
national standards developed by the Singapore Workforce Development Agency (WDA) in
collaboration with various industries comprising industry sectoral frameworks. WSQ trains, develops,
assesses and recognises individuals for the key competencies that companies look for in potential
employees. It is designed to be a practical, accessible and affordable launching pad for individuals to
take charge of their own careers and advancement. It is also a business tool for employers to access
and maintain a skilled workforce as it enhances their competitive edge and advances their businesses.
The Singapore Workforce Development Agency Act spells out the establishment and functions of the
WDA, including the powers to award qualifications. WDA is also supported by the Skills
Development Levy Act that requires employers to pay a skills development levy and the
establishment of Skills Development Fund (SDF). (Source: http://www.wda.gov.sg)

National Qualifications Framework

There is no national qualifications framework; however, the WSQ is a sectoral skills qualifications
framework for the continuing education and training of the workforce. There are about 34 industry
WSQ frameworks developed to date. Each WSQ framework is developed in consultation with
industry stakeholders.

Industry players, training institutions and unions work together in the Industry Skills and Training
Councils (ISTC) to identify the skills required in the industry and to develop the industry-specific

WSQ. The ISTC also reviews the learning outcomes to ensure the framework remains current and
relevant.

The WSQ system has 6 levels of qualifications – certificate, higher certificate, advanced certificate,
diploma, specialist diploma, and graduate diploma/graduate certificate. Each WSQ level and
qualification has its level descriptors described in learning outcomes. The WSQ credits system
includes a measure of the relative magnitude of the learning effort expressed as Recommended
Learning Hours (RLH). The RLH is defined as the number of hours which a typical trainee is
expected to undergo, on average, in order to accomplish the specified learning outcomes of a
competency unit, regardless of the methods of training and assessment adopted (i.e. directed learning).
The WSQ credits system adopts a currency of 1 credit = 10 RLH. The credits of a qualification are the
sum of credits of the requisite competency units leading to the qualification.

WDA establishes a set of rules and parameters governing the design of qualifications, such as the
volume of learning required, mix of core and elective competency units, and, naming and coding
rules.

Assessing and recognising qualifications from other economies is not actively or proactively
undertaken by WDA. Focus of WDA is to upskill the local workforce. The various Ministries and
government agencies in Singapore have their own evaluation criteria when determining how to assess
and recognise overseas qualification.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications

Approval
The design, development and implementation of the WSQ frameworks are facilitated by WDA, in
consultation with the industry. Industry players, training institutions and unions work together in the
Industry Skills and Training Councils (ISTC) to identify the skills required in the industry and to
develop the industry-specific WSQ. The ISTC also reviews the learning outcomes to ensure the
framework remains current and relevant. For WSQ qualifications, WDA approves training
organisation to be their Approved Training Organisation (ATO) first before they are allowed to
deliver the WSQ training.

Only organisations /institutions that have legislative Acts are empowered to award qualifications.
Each of the polytechnics, ITE, IHLs and WDA do not accredit qualifications. They award
qualifications within the powers of their respective Acts.

Assessment
The Singapore Examinations and Assessment Board (SEAB) was established on 1st April 2004 as a
statutory board, to develop and conduct national examinations in Singapore, and to provide other
examination and assessment services and products, locally as well as overseas. SEAB collaborates
with MOE on all national examinations from Primary School Leaving Exam, GCE (N), (O) and (A)
level Exams. Students who passed these exams will be issued the corresponding certificate by the
MOE.

Each of the polytechnics, ITE, IHLs and WDA has their own examination/assessment requirements.
Students/learners who passed these exams/assessments will be issued the corresponding certificate by
the respective institutions.

Relationship to Standards
Only WDA and ITE use competency standards in their curriculum design and development. The
competency standards list the skills, knowledge and attitudes needed to perform a job task and
describe the acceptable levels of performance. WDA competency standards are developed and
validated by industry for their uses. WSQ Approved Training Organisations (ATOs) use the
competency standards in design, development, training and assessment of WSQ training programmes;
whereas ITE competency standards are developed for and validated by industry, but only used within
the ITE setting.

For each WSQ framework, an Industry Skills and Training Council drives the development and
validation of skills standards, assessment strategies and training curriculum for the industry. Each
council is represented by key industry partners, including employers, industry associations, training
organisations and unions.

WDA oversees the quality of WSQ competency frameworks, competency maps, standards, courses,
and assessment plans. There are guidelines and templates for the development of these standards.
Competency standards can be accessed at https://www.skillsconnect.gov.sg/web/guest/home.
WSQ ATOs design and develop the WSQ training programmes based on the competency standards.
Only when there is a critical need for ensuring consistency in quality and speed to implementing the
training, will WDA develop national curriculum for industry use. All WSQ courseware require
WDA’s accreditation before implementation.

Registration (Approval) of Education and Training Providers/Awarding Bodies
Any training organisation that wishes to offer WSQ courses must meet the organisation accreditation
criteria established by the Singapore WDA. Upon approval as a WSQ ATO, ATOs can proceed to
submit a course to WDA for accreditation before implementation. Every ATO is expected to maintain
and upkeep the standard of delivery in training and assessment. WDA will periodically validate the
WSQ internal quality assurance system and capability of ATO under the Continuous Improvement

Thailand47
Overview

The formal education qualification system of Thailand is divided into three parts: Basic Education
(primary and secondary education); Technical and Vocational Education; and, Higher Education. The
system also includes professional qualifications system which is focused on assessing competencies
of individuals in accordance with the developed occupational standards.

National Qualifications Framework

The Thailand NQF was approved by the Cabinet in January 2013, and implementation was approved
by the Cabinet in November 2014. The NQF covers all education sectors (secondary education,
TVET, higher education) as well as skills standards qualifications, and professional qualifications. It
is a nine level framework and includes a volume measure. The Office of the Education Council (OEC)
is responsible for providing national information, coordinating, managing and monitoring the NQF.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

There are three key bodies responsible for quality assurance of broader TVET in Thailand: Office of
the Vocational Education (OVEC) (Ministry of Education); Department of Skills Development
(Ministry of Labour); and, Thailand Professional Qualifications Institute.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms – OVEC
Technical and Vocational Education (TVE) includes three levels of TVE plus short-course vocational
training (Certificate of Vocational Education (1–3), Diploma of Technical Education (1–2) and
Bachelor’s degree of Technology (1–2)). A TVET qualifications framework outlines the learning
outcomes of each level of qualification and includes a credit based system.

OVEC is responsible for: formulating national TVET policies and issues; establishing national TVET
qualifications framework; monitoring and evaluation TVET quality standards and qualifications;
organising and implementing Internal Quality Assurance System for TVET; and, supervising 421
public TVET colleges. OVEC is also responsible for TVE national curriculum qualification,
including monitoring and evaluation. TVE institutions in both public and private sector use the same
structures of TVE curriculum. The Office of Private Education is responsible for TVE in private TVE
institutions. The Office of Educational Services areas are delegated power to oversee private TVE
institutions in each area.

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications: OVEC
According to the legislation, every educational qualification must be endorsed by Ministry of
Education and accredited by Civil Service. Quality standards or criteria apply to accreditation include
requirements stated in Vocational Educational Qualification Framework. Quality and currency of
qualifications are monitored through Internal Quality Assurance System and External Quality
Assurance System which is organised by a public agency under the Prime Minister Office, every five
years.

Assessment for recognition of qualifications is organised at the Ministry of Education, and students
are required to take two national tests – a written test related to core or generic competencies and a
theory and practical assessment in each specialised field. Each institution is authorised to issue the
qualifications of Ministry of Education.

For OVEC, the Bureau of Vocational Education Standards takes care of quality and standards through
monitoring and evaluation. Standards once developed are endorsed by MOE, and accredited by the
Civil Service Commission. The Bureau of Vocational Education Standards of OVEC develops
national TVET curriculum structures, criteria, and other related standards as well as developing some
specific curriculum required at a national level. Most providers develop curriculum and submit for
approval.

Registration (Approval) of Training Providers/Awarding Bodies – OVEC
OVEC approves and supervises institutions according to standards set. Although registration is not
legislated, the process involves a working committee from central authority, OVEC visiting the
providers to ensure standards are met, and approval sought by Vocational Education Commission.
Providers need to meet quality standards, including Internal Quality Standards and External Quality
Standards. OVEC are responsible for TVET providers through the system of Internal Quality
Standards, and the Office of National Education Accreditation and Quality Assessment, Prime
Minister Office is responsible for External Quality Assessment and Accreditation of
institutions/providers.

Educator Requirements – OVEC
There are minimum requirements for teachers, trainers, educators, and lecturers. For OVEC, teacher
qualifications are organised and controlled by Teacher Council. The Teacher Council monitors and
manages the teacher standards system. There is a register of teachers/trainers/educators. Requirements
are in the Education Act, Ministry of Education Administration Law, and Vocational Education Law.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms – DSD
DSD is responsible for development of National Occupational Skill Standards, and provides
occupational skill training and testing. Occupational Skill Testing System is divided into three types:
1) skill testing for national skill standards qualifications; 2) skill testing for working oversea
qualifications; and, 3) skill testing for working in specific industrial or service sector qualifications.
Incentives for industries to provide training for the trainers also provided. DSD supervises the Skill
Development Institutes located in every region of Thailand.

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications – DSD
The National Committee for Promotion of Skill Standards is responsible for development, approval
and accreditation of National Occupational Skill Standards (NOSS), identification of promotion
strategies, establishment of training and testing centres, and encouraging the industries to use workers
who have occupational skill standards qualification.

The Skill Standard Testing Committee organises the assessment process. Assessment is organised by
each DSD centre for each program. Strategies to ensure consistency of judgements have not been
implemented for DSD system. Skill Development Institutes issue certificates or qualifications after an
individual passes a test.

In terms of curriculum, curriculum can be developed at a national level through DSD, but also
individual providers can develop their own curriculum. It is a mix of both.

Registration (Approval) of Training Providers/Awarding Bodies – DSD
DSD approves and supervises institutions. There is no legislation or regulation for this. Providers are
established and authorised to provide training and testing, and awarding certificates. Quality standards
or criteria that apply to approving providers are focused on quality of trainers, involvement of
industries, and facilities in the training and testing centres. DSD has responsibility in supervision and
monitoring their centres.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms –TPQI
The TPQI is a public organisation under the supervision of the Prime Minister, established under a
Royal Decree in 2011. TPQI is responsible for developing the national professional qualifications
system, including the professional qualifications framework, supporting the industry in developing
occupational standards, registering and monitoring organisations responsible for assessing
competencies of individuals in accordance with the developed occupational standards.

Accreditation (Approval) of Qualifications –TPQI
Accreditation processes are legislated through the role of the TPQI. TPQI accredits professional
qualifications and occupational standards. TPQI supports industrial and business sectors in developing
the occupational standards. Occupational standards and qualifications are endorsed at the TPQI’s
Board of management meetings. TPQI is responsible for the maintenance of the occupational
standards as well as professional qualifications, including reviewing and updating.

Assessment centres that are accredited by TPQI undertake assessments of candidates. Assessors are
provided with assessment guidelines and their assessment decision will be checked by the assessment
auditing committee. Assessment centres use TPQI common assessment tools that have been
developed by the industrial and business sectors. TPQI awards professional qualifications to
individuals.

Assessment Providers – TPQI
TPQI accredits assessment centres for the assessment of competencies and issuance of qualifications
under its remit. Centres must meet the requirements of ISO/IEC 17024:2012 related to Personnel
Certification Bodies)/Certification Bodies for Persons. Assessment centres undertake assessments of
competence on TPQI’s behalf.

Assessor Requirements –TPQI
Assessors must have at least 5 years of experiences in the field and are trained by TPQI in ISO 17024
(organisation auditing) and in assessment materials. Additional requirements for assessors will be
developed according to occupational standards which industrial and business sectors are in charge of.
Assessors are trained by TPQI in ISO 17024 and then they assess according to given assessment
guidelines. Assessment decisions made by assessors will be checked by the assessment auditing
committee.

Overview of Education and Training System

School education takes 12 years for students from 6 to 18 years of age. After graduation from lower
secondary school, students can go into three pathways. First, students can go to upper secondary
school and study there for three years and take a national exit examination from high school (if they
do not have problems with their learning achievement). Second, students who cannot go to upper
secondary school will continue their learning at the continuous education centre and may sit for a
national examination to get a certificate of high school program graduation by the end of three years
of learning. Students who do not want to join the previous program can go to technical and vocational
education and training (TVET) institutions.

TVET institutions in Vietnam are divided into two:

       •      Vocational training under the administration of the Ministry of Labor, Invalids and Social
              Affairs (MOLISA); classified into three types according to credentials they offer (vocational
              training centre, middle vocational school and higher vocational colleges). Vocational training
              centres offer vocational training courses from some days up to less than 1 year and are
              eligible to offer elementary vocational certificate, while intermediate vocational schools offer
              vocational training courses of at least from 1 to 2 years leading to vocational intermediate
              qualification. Vocational training colleges admit high school graduates to train them from 2 to
              3 years and offer upper-intermediate qualification. The last two types of vocational training
              institutions can offer both short course and long course.
       •      Technical and vocational education (TVE) under the Ministry of Education and Training
              (MOET). TVE institutions can offer courses from 1 to 3 years according to students’ entry
              qualifications. Students who hold a vocational certificate (one-year course) have to be trained
              at least one year more and can gain an intermediate diploma. Graduates from lower secondary
              schools need to take three-year courses leading to the diploma. Two-year courses are for
              graduates from high school and lead to a diploma.

The TVET system has recently changed due to a new TVET law endorsed by the Parliament
November 2014 (validated 01 July 2015). Therefore, there will be no separate vocational training
under MOLISA or a subsystem under MOET, but there will be one college type, one secondary
school type and one centre for TVET oversight. Information in this overview pertains to pre
November 2014 law.

NQF Development in Vietnam

A NQF proposal is due to be completed by the end of 2014. The single framework will cover the
higher education sector and the vocational training sector. The structure of the proposed framework
includes 8 levels and will include 3 levels of certificates, diploma, advanced diploma, bachelor,
masters and doctorate qualification levels. It is anticipated that the governance of the framework will
be with an established board.

Quality Assurance Mechanisms

Quality Assurance of Qualifications
For education institutions, MOET provides national curriculum which are similar to programme
standards. These standards include an introduction, general objectives of qualification, learning
outcomes, subject or knowledge required to be learnt, duration, assessment advice, requirements of
the teachers, and equipment, facilities and textbook advice. These programme standards are developed
through a committee process. The committee is initiated through the MOET and incorporates those
teaching in the area, experts and 1 or 2 industry expert representatives. From these programme
standards individual education institutions are to develop their own detailed curriculum within an
internal quality management system. MOET may inspect quality of education programmes at site
inspections. MOET has a website register of providers, but does not have a register of qualifications
that providers offer.

For vocational institutions, MOLISA is responsible for developing national curriculum. This
curriculum is similar to that developed by MOET in terms of structure, but includes a great deal more
detail. The curriculum development process is more closely aligned to occupational and functional
analysis process. MOLISA convenes meetings and workshops with TVET institutes, companies and
university experts to identify job tasks to develop into curriculum. The curriculum includes essential
knowledge and skills, learning outcomes, assessment guide and criteria (including performance
criteria), duration and module (subject) detail. The curriculum may be informed by national skills
standards if they are developed in that particular field; however, it is more than likely that the
curriculum has been developed before the competencies. MOLISA has a register of providers
registered although not what qualifications are offered by these providers. MOLISA also has a register
of curriculum summaries.

Both sectors cover similar qualifications across similar occupations, skills and knowledge. In both
sectors there are common subjects (generic subjects) that all students must undertake in each
qualification. These subjects include IT, foreign language, physical education, politics, law and
national defence/security. These subjects are taught at all qualifications levels; however, subject
complexity and duration vary across the qualification levels.

Relationship to Standards
MOLISA is responsible for defining principles, procedures for developing and issuing national skills
standards for each occupation; responsibilities in relevant offices and organisations for developing
and issuing national vocational skills standards for each occupation. MOLISA has oversees the
development of national occupational skills standards undertaken through the line ministries for
qualifications up to level 5.

National skills standards consist of regulations on performance level, requirements of essential
knowledge, skills and attitudes to perform the tasks of one occupation. Government bodies organise
and coordinate with relevant offices and trade associations to develop and issue national skills
standards under regulations of vocational training law and the above regulation.

National skills standards are based on a job role, equated to a qualification, and describe specific
tasks. National skills standards are based on the notion of competence, are developed in a consistent
format including occupation description, list of tasks, performance criteria, assessment criteria and
performance                                                                               conditions.

task analysis, drafting using 30 independent experts, appraisal committee of at least 1/3 industry
representation, and ministerial endorsement.

MOLISA has a register of all national skills standards that have been developed on its website.
Generic competencies have not been developed to be included in qualifications; they are all
vocationally specific tasks.

Assessment
For education institutions (MOET), all institutions are responsible for issuing their own qualifications
and retaining student outcomes data. However, each institution submits a graduation report to MOET
for limited data retention.

For vocational training institutions, certificates related to curriculum programs are issued by the
institution and are the responsibility of the principal. However, for certificates issued related to
national occupational skills standards the certification process is the responsibility of MOLISA, and
issued by MOLISA. For national occupational skills standards, MOLISA develops the test item bank
and also the practical test for testing centres to use.

Quality Assurance of Providers
There are two accreditation organisations: one under General Department of Vocational Training
(MOLISA), the other is Department of Testing and Accreditation, MOET. The two ministries have
issued their own documents related to accreditation standards focused on quality assurance.

MOLISA has issued the Decision No 1&2/2008/QĐ-BLĐTBXH dated 17 January 2008, on
regulation of the system of criteria, standards of accreditation for vocational training schools and
vocational training colleges. MOET has promulgated the decision No 65/2007/QĐ-BGDĐT dated 17
January 2007 on regulation of standards of quality evaluation of university.

All providers of education and training must register at the state administrative authority of education
and training in local or central level according to qualifications they are going to offer.
All providers are monitored to a certain extent by state administrative authorities of education and
training independent of the central government. MOET and MOLISA have regulations to mandate all
TVET and higher education institutions to self-assessment (internal evaluation).

An accreditation body can be established by the Government, private organisation or individuals
under permission of Minister of Education and Training.

GDVET/MOLISA is responsible for skills testing. Testing centres are generally established within a
TVET institution and are responsible for national occupation skills standards testing. MOLISA
licences these centres. There has been limited update of competency testing at this stage.

Educator Requirements
For TVET institutions (MOLISA) and for education institutions (MOET) the requirements are that
vocational and training educators require a bachelor within the field of teaching plus a pedagogical
certificate. There are no specific requirements for assessors in TVET. There are no registers of
teachers retained or national oversight/agency in either sector.
