                                           Introduction


     Sexual violence has grave physical and psychological consequences, including injuries, poor reproductive
     health, mental health and psychosocial problems, and associated dysfunction. In communities affected by
     armed conflict, women may be exposed to both violent conflict and violence in the home and the neighbor-
     hood, and consequences can be compounded when sexual violence by armed groups results in rejection from
     families and communities.

     Much remains unknown about how to prevent violence against women and how to treat its various mental
     health and psychosocial effects. This applies to all forms of violence, including sexual violence resulting from
     armed conflict, by other community members and intimate partner violence in places where gender inequity
     is pervasive and where social norms and barriers to justice sustain violence against women. In areas where
     survivors of sexual violence are also faced with extreme poverty and bear the burden of social stigma, there
     is currently little information on effective interventions for alleviating psychological symptoms, increasing
     social capital and improving economic status.

     The International Rescue Committee (IRC) implements programming to respond to violence in the Demo-
     cratic Republic of Congo (DRC) and is committed to growing the evidence-base about what programs are
     the most effective, why they work, and for whom. Eastern Congo is still embroiled in conflict with armed
     groups committing high rates of sexual violence and survivors often facing significant stigma within their own
     families and the wider community. IRC also observes increases in reported incidents of violence perpetrated
     by civilians and that minors constitute a substantial percentage of the survivors seeking services.

     The overall objective of the evaluation is to identify effective and scalable interventions for the response to
     sexual violence in areas affected by armed conflict by evaluating innovative approaches to socio-economic
     programs. The project in DRC will evaluate the impact of both a savings and loans association and a mental
     health intervention on improving the mental, social, physical and economic functioning of survivors of sexual
     violence. This evaluation offers a significant contribution to the field of gender-based violence programming.

     Background and significance of the evaluation

     The Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has become synonymous with sexual violence by armed
     groups within the last 2 decades. Reportedly, tens of thousands of women and girls have been raped, sexually
     assaulted, attacked and abducted in Eastern Provinces including North and South Kivu, targeted by armed
     groups with unparalleled levels of brutality. Renewed hostilities between armed groups led to a spike in vio-
     lence in late 2008 with fighting taking place in both North and South Kivu. The breakdown of the security
     system in the region, combined with societal attitudes toward women and the absence of a functioning ju-
     dicial system, have created conditions in which violence against women and girls persists with alarming fre-
     quency after periods of active fighting have ended.

     Access to services in North and South Kivu—both emergency and longer term care—remains a major chal-
     lenge. Limited services as well as the potential stigma of seeking services mean that many survivors have
     never received adequate care. Results of a preliminary study by the IRC and Johns Hopkins University found
     many survivors have substantially reduced ability to function, including reduced ability to perform basic tasks
     and activities related to earning, self care, caring for family, and contributing to their communities. These



60
survivors also describe high rates of mental health and social problems including mood disorders, anxiety,
withdrawal, and stigmatization and rejection by family and community. The rates of mental problems and
dysfunction are significantly higher than those found in other violence-affected populations in other parts of
Africa and elsewhere.

With IRC’s training and support, case managers from local NGOs have been providing psychosocial ser-
vices to these survivors and preliminary study results show that psychosocial care is associated with increased
functioning and decreased mental health symptoms. However, case managers report the need for more skills
to address the large number of clients and their multiple needs. In other areas, community-based programs
have been providing social support and advocating for women at village level; however, they have no viable
options for referring clients who have more severe symptoms and need to higher level care. Across commu-
nities and services, IRC has also seen the great need for increased access to economic resources for women
who have been sexually assaulted because of their reduced function and frequent alienation from family and
community.

While social and economic development in conflict affected areas like DRC relies on populations who are
ready and able to work, the psychological effects of conflict may mean that a percentage of the population
living in these low-resource areas are less able to engage in economic opportunities even when they are avail-
able. However, there is little data on the best strategy to deal with this. One approach is to treat mental health
problems in order to reduce symptoms and improve functioning with the hope that people will then seek
out and take advantage of opportunities. Another option is to provide new ways to encourage participation
in economic activities as a way of addressing both mental health issues and dysfunction and thereby con-
solidating continued participation. A third option is to combine the two approaches: first providing a mental
health intervention and then providing new economic opportunities. Currently, it is not known which of
these approaches is the most effective, since little is known about how improvements in mental health impact
economic development, and conversely, how economic programs impact mental health.

IRC GBV Programming

IRC is introducing two new and innovative programs for survivors of sexual violence in South Kivu who have
high symptoms of distress and who are having difficulty with daily functioning:

    1.	 Economic Program: The Village Savings and Loan Associations (VSLA) model was developed to
        provide a system of community savings for people who cannot access banks or microfinance institu-
        tions. Self-selected groups of 15-25 members form independent associations where each member
        saves and contributes to a common pool of money. Members can apply for loans from the pool and
        pay back with interest. At the end of a cycle (usually about 1 year), group members cash out and
        receive their savings plus interest earned. IRC has implemented VSLA in several programs and have
        found the results promising. A model based on trust among the members, IRC sees VSLA as an im-
        portant tool with which to promote solidarity and social cohesion amongst women and contribute
        to the social reintegration of survivors This evaluation will investigate its potential for providing
        socio-economic support and improving the mental health and functioning of survivors of sexual
        violence, which has not been done previously.

    2.	 Mental Health Program: Group Cognitive Processing Therapy (CPT), a structured group therapy
        that research has shown to be effective used to assist trauma survivors and can improve a variety
        of symptoms related to depression, anxiety and posttraumatic stress disorder, will be adapted to
        fit the cultural context. Local Psychosocial Assistants (PSAs) will be trained by expert US-based
        CPT trainers and will provide the therapy to groups of 6-8 women. The PSAs will be provided with
        direct supervision and assistance with problem solving as issues arise, with remote supervision and


                                                                                 Study of Effectiveness of a Social-Economic
                                                                    Intervention for Sexual Violence Survivors in Eastern DRC
                                                                                                                                61
              quality assurance provided by the US-based CPT trainers. This evaluation will investigate the fea-
              sibility and impact of implementing CPT by local counselors for improving the mental health and
              functionality of survivors of sexual violence.

     Impact Evaluation

     The central evaluation questions include:

         1.	 What is the impact of a mental health intervention on social, psychological, physical and eco-
             nomic functioning?
         2.	 What is the impact of a socio-economic intervention on social, psychological, physical and eco-
             nomic functioning?
         3.	 What is the combined impact of a mental health intervention followed by a socio-economic pro-
             gram on social, psychological, physical and economic functioning?

     Based on these questions, the evaluation has the following objective and aims:

     Study Objective: To identify cost effective and scalable interventions that demonstrate improvements in the
     psychological, social, physical and economic functioning of survivors of sexual violence living in Eastern
     DRC.

     Specific Aims:

         1.	 What is the impact of IRC’s mental health intervention (Cognitive Processing Therapy- CPT) on
             social, psychological, and economic functioning?
         2.	 What is the impact of IRC’s socio-economic intervention (Voluntary Savings and Loans Associa-
             tions – VSLA) on social, psychological, and economic functioning?

     Exploratory Aims:

         1.	 What is the sequential impact of IRC’s mental health intervention followed by a socio-economic
             program on social, psychological, and economic functioning?
         2.	 Does improving mental health prior to implementing an economic program improve the uptake
             and utilization of the economic program?

     Evaluation hypotheses

     The proposed research project is based on the hypothesis that participation by survivors of sexual violence
     with high levels of psychological symptoms and functional impairment in VSLA groups or in CPT groups
     will lead to an increase in psychological, social, physical and economic functioning compared to similar wom-
     en (controls) who did not participate in these interventions.

     The specific hypotheses of the evaluation are:

     VSLA Study

         1)	 Women participating in the VSLA will have increased household assets and consumption compared
             to control.
         2)	 Women participating in the VSLA will report improved social support compared to control.
         3)	 Women participating in VSLA who report improved social support and increased assets will report
             decreased psychological symptoms compared to control.



62
Mental Health Study

    4)	 Women participating in the CPT intervention will report improved social support compared to
        control.
    5)	 Women participating in the CPT intervention will report decreased psychological symptoms com-
        pared to control.
    6)	 Women participating in the VSLA program after first having participated in the CPT intervention
        will have increased household assets and consumption compared to women who only participated
        in CPT or in the control condition.

Both Studies

    7)	 Women participating in the mental health intervention and/or the VSLA program will have an in-
        crease in their functionality, as assessed through measures of daily functioning, compared to control
        women.

Program and Evaluation Strategy
The study will be two parallel randomized impact evaluations to investigate the impacts of the different inter-
vention strategies.

The first study will focus on the impact of the VSLA compared to a wait-control sample. The VSLA impact
evaluation study will be conducted in communities served by 9 IRC’s CBO partners.

The second study will focus on the impact of the mental health intervention followed by the VSLA program
compared to a wait-control sample. This study will be conducted in communities served by 3 of IRC’s NGO
partners currently providing psychosocial support. The design of this second study will allow us to look at
the independent impact of the CPT intervention and to explore the effect of receiving the CPT intervention
on the rates of retention in VSLA and the impact of the VSLA program.

Phase 1: Formative Research

During the first phase, qualitative research will be conducted among 3 major language groups (Swahili, Mashi,
Kifuliro) in South Kivu, to learn how the psychological and social problems resulting from sexual violence
vary in their presentation and impacts. This information will be used to refine existing measures from a previ-
ous study and design a suitable instrument for use across these populations to assess these problems and their
effects on functioning. Once developed, this assessment tool will be validated in 2 communities among 2 dif-
ferent language groups and cut-off scores determined for identifying women with high rates of mental health
problems and functional impairment. This cut-off score will be used to determine eligibility for both studies,
along with the more general criteria of being exposed to sexual violence and being over age 18. Exclusion
criteria will include very low functioning (cut off determined during phase 1), high suicidality, and substance
dependence. Participation in all phases of the studies will be completely voluntary.

Phase 2: Training, Recruitment and Program Implementation

VSLA Study

In 9 areas with community based organizations, trained interviewers will work with CBOs to identify com-
munities most affected by GBV and violence.  Within these communities, the CBO management committee
and members of other local NGOs who work with survivors of GBV will assist IRC in identifying women to
be screened for eligibility into the study.  These women will also be asked to identify other women who have


                                                                               Study of Effectiveness of a Social-Economic
                                                                  Intervention for Sexual Violence Survivors in Eastern DRC
                                                                                                                              63
     similar problems, using a snowball sampling method to identify eligible women.

     The women who meet criteria in the screening will be invited to an introductory meeting in which the VSLA
     methodology will be described and they will be encouraged to return to a second meeting along with 2-3
     friends they would be interested in joining a group with. At the end of the meeting, participants would be
     asked to go out and form into groups of 15-25 women interested in being a part of VSLA. A third meeting
     would be held with all the potential groups, and at this time groups would submit their membership lists as
     an application. IRC staff will review all of the applications and select those groups that contain approximately
     6-8 women who meet the study eligibility.  These applications will then be randomized into treatment and
     wait-list control conditions.  The aim in each community is to have eight VSLA groups—4 treatment groups
     and 4 waitlist control. All of the groups will be formed at the same time, but the control groups will not re-
     ceive VSLA training until year 2, when the intervention group has completed the program.

     As per standard practice, the selected groups will meet on a weekly basis during the first several months to
     learn about the process through 7 IRC led modules, make decisions as to how they want to implement the
     savings program, and select a management committee to assist with the running of the program and start the
     savings activities.  The next period (approximately months 3-12) will cover the actual running of the savings
     and loans program, when members save money on a weekly basis and apply for loans.  The first round of the
     program is complete when the share-out is provided, typically starting in months 9-11.  The waitlist control
     applications will then be invited to participate in the VSLA program, with the training being provided by
     women from the initial VSLA groups.

     Mental Health followed by VSLA Study

     Training for the adapted mental health intervention will be done at the beginning of Phase 2. There are 16
     psychosocial assistants (PSAs) working with the 3 collaborating NGOs. Each PSA provides services at a
     designed office that serves several villages. The 16 PSAs will be randomized to either receive training in the
     CPT intervention or to continue providing treatment as usual. At the end of the study, if CPT is found to be
     effective, the control PSAs will receive training in order to be able to provide it to the control participants.

     •	   Recruitment for participation in the study will be the same whether the PSA is an intervention or control
          service provider. A variety of methods will be used to identify eligible participants including:

     •	   PSAs will review their old beneficiary files and identify women who did not significantly improve from
          their usual services and who may still be in need of additional services and these women will be invited
          to be screened for the study;

     •	   PSAs will invite current beneficiaries to be a part of this new activity and these women will be invited to
          be screened for the study;

     The community educators (CEs) that are paired with each PSA will adopt a community education messaging
     for a period of time, focusing it more on symptoms that survivors might be experiencing that are indicative
     of higher distress. The messaging will include an invitation to be screened for possible eligibility into the
     program. Care will be taken to not mobilize more women than the PSAs can accommodate to mitigate any
     negative effects on the NGOs reputation.

     In the 8 locations designated to receive the adapted mental health intervention, the PSAs will put eligible
     women into 3 groups of up to 8 women. The women will be grouped by where they live to minimize the
     distance they have to travel for the weekly sessions. The treatment will include two introductory individual
     meetings followed by 12 regular weekly meetings. The total treatment will last approximately 4 months,
     followed by a maintenance period during which PSA will meet with study participants as requested by the



64
participant. During this time period, the PSAs in the CPT and control communities will monitor any ser-
vices used by the study participants. This maintenance period will allow us to evaluate whether there is any
post-intervention sustenance of any initial reduction in symptoms and improvement in functioning.

After the maintenance period is complete, the CPT participants will be invited to participate in a VSLA pro-
gram. Similar to the VSLA study described above, the women will be invited to an introductory meeting in
which the VSLA methodology will be described and they will be encouraged to return to a second meeting
along with other community members who they would like to join their VSLA group. At the end of the sec-
ond meeting, the women will be asked to submit their membership lists, each including 15-25 women, as an
application. IRC staff will review all of the applications and select those groups that contain approximately
6-8 women of the treatment participants. As per standard practice, the selected groups will meet on a weekly
basis during the first several months to learn about the process through 7 IRC led modules, make decisions as
to how they want to implement the savings program, and select a management committee to assist with the
running of the program. The next period (approximately months 3-12) will cover the actual running of the
savings and loans program, when people give money on a weekly basis and apply for loans. The program is
complete when the pay-out is provided, typically starting in months 9-11.

The PSAs who did not originally receive the adapted mental health training and who provided services to the
waitlist control condition will be provided with the training once the maintenance data has been reviewed.
After receiving the training, any control study women who still want services will be invited to participate in
the group therapy.

Data Collection
There are 4 designated data collection points:

    1)	 Baseline Quantitative Assessment – prior to initiation of any of the intervention strategies. If we
        assume that approximately 75% of the women assessed will meet eligibility criteria and will agree
        to participate in the study, we will assess approximately 500 women within the 16 PSAs areas and
        480 women in the 9 VSLA locations. This will allow us to meet our goal of 360 study women in the
        VSLA program (40 women per location; 180 intervention; 180 control) and 380 study women in
        the mental health program (24 women per PSA; 180 intervention; 180 control).
    2)	 Qualitative Post-program – after approximately 10-11 months, following the pay-out period for the
        VSLA program and the end of the treatment period for the mental health treatment, a brief qualita-
        tive assessment will be done to identify any unexpected outcomes. The study questionnaire will
        then be amended to include questions related to these unexpected outcomes.
    3)	 First Mental Health Quantitative Follow up – approximately 1 month following completion of the
        CPT intervention, all intervention and control participants will be assessed with the amended as-
        sessment tool, to allow for investigation of immediate intervention effects.
    4)	 First VSLA Quantitative Follow up – approximately 2-4 weeks after the pay-out period is complete,
        all women who were eligible and originally agreed to participate in the VSLA programming will be
        assessed with the amended assessment tool.
    5)	 Second Mental Health Quantitative Follow up – after the 6-7 month maintenance period is com-
        plete, and before the VSLA program is initiated in the CPT communities, all intervention and con-
        trol participants will again be assessed with the amended assessment tool to allow for investigation
        of longer term treatment effects.

    6)	 Second VSLA Quantitative Follow up – approximately 8-10 months after the first round of VSLA


                                                                               Study of Effectiveness of a Social-Economic
                                                                  Intervention for Sexual Violence Survivors in Eastern DRC
                                                                                                                              65
               groups are completed, a final assessment will be conducted of all study participants to investigate
               longer term maintenance of the VSLA program.

          7)	 Third Mental Health Quantitative Follow up - approximately 2-4 weeks after the pay-out period is
              complete for the VSLA program in the CPT communities, all women who were eligible and origi-
              nally agreed to participate in the VSLA programming will be assessed with the amended assessment
              tool. This will allow us to explore the impact of the combined CPT and VSLA program.

     Outcomes and measures

     The primary outcomes of interest include the psychological, social, physical and economic functioning of the
     women involved in the programs. To assess these domains, the study will use the assessment tool developed
     in phase 1 to assess mental health and functioning. The function assessment will cover both social and eco-
     nomic functioning, including indicators of social capital, social cohesion, and income/consumption. The
     measures will be developed to capture outcomes at the level of the individual, family and community. Assess-
     ments will be conducted at baseline and at regular intervals described above.

     Primary Outcomes

     •	   Psychological Well-Being
     •	   Physical and Social Functioning
     •	   Economic functioning

     Secondary Outcomes

     •	   Family Functioning
     •	   Cost effectiveness

     Monitoring
     Over the course of the implementation of both the VSLA and mental health program, IRC will systematically
     monitor the outputs and outcomes of each program. We will monitor progress of the project on two levels:
     individual-level and group-level.

          1.	 VSLA Program: IRC staff will make regular monitoring visits to each VSLA group. During these
              visit they will collect the following quantitative data for monitoring purposes: attendance rate, drop-
              out rate, accumulated value of savings, number and value of current loans, and the value of cash
              not in circulation. This data will be inputted and analyzed in the standard VSLA Monitoring Infor-
              mation System. The frequency of monitoring visits will be determined by the phase of the VSLA.
              During the intensive phase, groups will be monitored on a weekly basis at every meeting. After a
              period of approximately 4 months, each group will be evaluated and, if successful, will progress to
              the development phase where monitoring visits will be reduced to every 2-3 weeks. Four months
              after this, another evaluation will take place and the group will progress to the maturity phase. Dur-
              ing this 4-month phase, groups may only be monitored 3-4 times before the end of the cycle.

          2.	 Mental Health Program: The CPT therapy groups will meet weekly. Following each session, the
              PSAs will fill out a monitoring form for each group participant as well a form summarizing what
              was covered during the group session and any challenges that may have arisen. These forms will be
              reviewed weekly with an IRC supervisor who will in turn review each group, and each client, with a
              Mental Health technical advisor and US-based trainers.



66
The control PSAs will maintain monitoring forms for all control participants indicating if/when a participant
came to see them and what services were provided. IRC supervisors will contact control PSAs monthly to
review monitoring procedures and ensure forms are being filled out.

During the maintenance period, when the CPT program is complete, the CPT PSAs will fill out the standard
monitoring form (same one used by control PSAs) any time a study participant visits them for additional
services. The control PSAs will continue to fill out the monitoring forms on control study participants during
this period as well.

We understand that sometimes there can be disagreements at home when you brought home credits and the share
out. We would like to ask you about how you and your partner resolve disputes. It can be difficult to talk about what
happens when your partner gets angry. I would like to remind you that your responses to all questions are completely
voluntary and if you feel uncomfortable we can simply skip this question and move on. Everything you tell me is
confidential and no one else will know what you have said.

Nous comprenons que, parfois, il peut y avoir des désaccords à la maison quand vous avez apporté chez vous
des crédits et l’argent après le partage des fonds. Nous tenons à vous demander comment vous et votre parte-
naire résolvez les désaccords. Il peut être difficile de parler de ce qui arrive quand votre partenaire se met en
colère. Je tiens à vous rappeler que vos réponses à toutes les questions sont tout à fait volontaires et si vous
vous sentez mal à l’aise, nous pouvons tout simplement sauter cette question et passer à autre chose. Tout ce
que vous me dites restera confidentiel et personne ne saura ce que vous avez dit.
