This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2016 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2016 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the eco nomy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

STARTING A BUSINESS
What are the details?

Côte d'Ivoire is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                Legal form: Société à Responsabilité Limitée
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through           (SARL) - Limited Liability Company

       A Memorandum of Understanding was signed on February 23, 2013
       between the chamber of notaries and the one-stop shop reducing
       notary fees to a fix forfeit of 120,000 CFA for SARL with a minimum
       capital of XOF 1,000,000. For a SARL registering with a higher capital, a
       different percentage will apply depending on the amount. For example,
       for an SARL with a share capital between XOF 3 million and XOF 9
   1   million, the fees are 3% of the share capital.                               2 days         XOF 120,000

      The dossier required to obtain a building permit includes the
      following documents:
      • Block plan (scale,1/500, 1/200, 1/100)
      • Execution plan (scale 1/50)
      • Summary of technical specifications
      • Summary of cost estimates
      • Proof of property ownership
      • Written approval from the Minister of Urban Planning

      Six copies of the dossier must be sent to the Building Permit
      Commission. The Commission is comprised of the Construction
      Minister, a representative of the Municipality, a representative of
      the Civil Protection Department, a representative from the
      Hygiene Department, and a representative from the Order of
10    Architects. The building permit is obtained within 3 months on         30 days      XOF 60,000

      If the total surface is less than 120 sq.m. and the estimated cost
      of construction is less than FCFA 30 million, there is no need to
      have the architectural plans designed by an architect, both
      conditions must be met. However, for any building with a total
      surface of more than 120 sq.m. or the estimate cost of
      construction is higher than FCFA 30 million, the plans must be
      drawn by an architect.

      The client hires a licensed electrical contractor. He/she must then inform
      the CIE on the choice of contractor - as well as the supplier for the
      material for the external works. The CIE may be informed by courrier, but

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                          As Mirage will not be able to settle its current liabilities with its available assets,
                           it will file a declaration of cessation of payments (article 25 of the Uniform Act

                           operating, Mirage will try to obtain the opening of reorganization proceedings
             liquidation    and avoid liquidation. Under article 27, a composition proposal is a proposal
               (after an         lodged no later than 15 days following the declaration of cessation of
Proceeding

           reorganization) company. According to our information, Mirage will not reach an agreement
                            with its creditors, so the composition proposal will not succeed and the court
                            will convert the proceedings to liquidation some months after the lodging of
                           the proposal (article 33 of the Uniform Act). A reorganization proceeding that
                          is later converted into liquidation is the most likely proceeding in Côte d'Ivoire.

                                     According to our estimations, the reorganization attempt will fail and the
                                     proceedings will probably be converted to liquidation. The hotel will stop

                                   Mirage will file a declaration of cessation of payments to obtain the opening of
                                   reorganization proceedings. The declaration has to be done 30 days following
                                   the cessation of payments. The competent court will then declare cessation of

                                    will fail, so the proceedings will be converted to liquidation. According to our

                                                 converted to liquidation takes approximately 26 months.

                                   According to our estimations, a reorganization attempt that is later converted
                                   into liquidation costs approximately XOF 18,000,000 (18% of the value of the

Doing Business 2017 presents the data for the labor
market regulation indicators in an annex. The report
does not present rankings of economies on these
indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance
to frontier score or ranking on the ease of doing
business. Detailed data collected on labor market
regulation are available on the Doing Business website
(http://www.doingbusiness.org). The data on labor
market regulation are based on a detailed questionnaire
on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2017 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
