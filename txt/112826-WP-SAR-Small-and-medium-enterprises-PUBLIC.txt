                                      through innovative products and services that
                                     support small and medium enterprises in frontier

IFC’s four-pronged approach to increase access to finance focuses on:


  1.	 Increasing Outreach to Micro-Enterprises: IFC advises Utkarsh Micro Finance, an investee-client and a registered
      microfinance non-banking financial company working in the low income states of Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in India, to
      develop loan products for micro-enterprises. Utkarsh specifically serves customers that do not qualify for traditional
      microfinance. IFC helps Utkarsh develop policies, systems, and pilot projects in two cities of Uttar Pradesh. Through
      this, IFC estimates that Utkarsh will have the capacity to finance up to 20,000 micro-enterprises in three years.



 2.	 Strengthening Reach, Promoting Innovation: IFC builds the capacity of commercial banks to develop tailored
     products and incorporate stronger risk management to expand operations to small and medium enterprises. IFC
     supports Bangladesh’s BRAC Bank to increase its business performance by using evaluation tools and sustainability
     reporting in small and medium enterprise finance. IFC engages with the bank’s staff and senior managers to
     strengthen evidence-based decision-making using these tools. IFC also supports National Development Bank in Sri
     Lanka to strengthen lending to small firms, with an additional sub-component on agricultural lending.


  3.	   Non-Financial Services to Foster Growth: In addition to finance, small firms need business advice, skills, networking,
        and market opportunities to grow. IFC focuses on non-financial services and provides thought leadership to develop
        operational tools in this area. Since 2008, ICICI Bank, India’s largest private sector bank, using IFC’s SME Toolkit online
        platform to provide non-financial services and information to smaller enterprises. As of March 2013, more than 520,000
        SMEs use the business directory feature making it an exciting business-to-business platform. In Sri Lanka, IFC supports
        National Development Bank to establish centers that facilitate banks’ direct engagement with their small and medium
        enterprise clients and provide them with tools, training, and business information to improve productivity. National
        Development Bank has opened five small business centers and is in the process of opening four more.

  4.	 Developing Credit Bureaus and Collateral Registries to Increase Transparency: IFC has partnered with the
      Indian government’s central collateral registry, Central Registry of Securitisation Asset Reconstruction and Security
      Interest, to expand its ambit to include movables which will address the lack of collateral needed to access credit for
      small businesses that have few immovable assets. IFC will leverage its global experience with credit bureaus to grow
      the use of credit information for small and medium enterprises in South Asia. This will include supporting existing
      credit bureaus to increase use of non-traditional credit information (such as utility bills) to develop a comprehensive
      credit picture for small firms.

Through its private sector clients, IFC enhances the ability of small and medium businesses to access markets and integrate
them into value chains. IFC also facilitates their increased access to energy/power, and basic infrastructure.


        1.	 Facilitating Access to Value Chains for Small Firms: In South Asia, and globally, large firms often rely on
            a network of small businesses in their supply and distribution chains. Improving operational efficiencies and
            deepening integration within the value chain are key drivers of growth. On the other hand, small businesses
            struggle to access business information, training, and opportunities to grow their operations and remain
            competitive. Since 2007, IFC has worked with investee client Dialog Axiata Telecom in Sri Lanka, which
            relies on a network of 55,000 retailers and distributors across the country. Nearly 8,000 micro and small
            retailers have been trained on business management in local languages to improve their business skills. For
            Dialog, these trainings have resulted in more than $2.6 million of increased revenue from these retailers.


        2.	 Building Management Skills of Small and Medium-sized Entrepreneurs: IFC focuses on addressing
            managerial skills gap through its proprietary training and information tools such as Business Edge™ and
            the SME Toolkit. These tools, adapted to local markets and languages, train small and medium enterprises
            on business management skills. So far, IFC through its accredited training partner firms, has trained 16,000
            entrepreneurs in South Asia with these tools. Another approach to build management capacity has been to
            work at the sector level in India, where IFC has partnered with the National Institute for Entrepreneurship
            and Small Business Development, a training arm of India’s Ministry of Micro, Small and Medium Enterprise
            to deliver a country-wide trainer capacity building program.


        3.	 Increasing Access to Electricity: Lack of access to electricity is the main constraint faced by both formal
            and informal micro, small, and medium enterprises. Unreliable or no electricity hampers operations and
            increases the cost of doing business. IFC has launched Lighting Asia/India Program, aimed at providing
            safe, clean, and affordable off-grid lighting to two million people living in rural India by 2015. The program is
            developing private off-grid lighting market in India across the entire value chain: manufacturing, distribution,
            supply chain management, and access to finance. IFC also facilitates better access to basic infrastructure
            through public-private partnerships.
