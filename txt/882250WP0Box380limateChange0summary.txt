This document, on the use of ICTs for Climate Change Adaptation in Africa,
is the summary of the full sector study which was carried out by a team
from the International Institute for Development led by Heather Creech,
and comprising Ben Akoh and Jo-Ellen Parry, with assistance from Livia
Bizikova, Daniella Echeverria, Philip Gass, Ann Hammille and Julie Karami.
The full report is available at www.eTransformAfrica.org. This document
forms chapter three of the publication edited by Enock Yonazi, Tim Kelly,
Naomi Halewood and Colin Blackman (2012) “eTransform Africa:
The Transformational Use of ICTs in Africa.”

Funding for the publication came from the AfDB Korean Trust Fund,

  adaptaTion
    in Africa
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have
the potential to transform business and government in Africa,
driving entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth.
A new flagship report – eTransform Africa – produced
by the World Bank and the African Development Bank,
with the support of the African Union, identifies best
practice in the use of ICTs in key sectors of the African
economy. Under the theme “Transformation-Ready”,
the growing contribution of ICTs to Agriculture, Climate
Change Adaptation, Education, Financial Services,
Government Services and Health is explored. In addition,
the report highlights the role of ICTs in enhancing African
regional trade and integration as well as the need to build
a competitive ICT industry to promote innovation, job
creation and the export potential of African companies.

Recommendations for government
and development partners

Recommendation                         1
Use a systematic framework to structure thinking

A systematic framework, such as that            the water and agriculture sectors,
illustrated in Figure 1, is fundamental         on weather prospects and water
to structuring the approach to the role         hazards, land management and
of ICTs in adapting to climate change.          adaptive capacity of farmers and
Such a framework should focus on:               pastoralists.

   ICTs that contribute to improvements       mate change, the framework should
   in health, food, nutrition and other       focus on:

        water resources management, the           ery of disaster and emergency relief.



     Recommendation                      2
     Build capacity for integrating ICTs into national strategic
     adaptation plans

     Building the capacity for integrating      policy makers and planners from
     ICTs into adaptation policy develop-       those working on ICTs and telecom-

     Recommendation                      3
     Involve the private sector more extensively in planning
     and implementation

Recommendation                            5
Develop open data policies across Africa

Access to data is a fundamental re-              across Africa, with a view to making
quirement for adaptation planning.               environmental and meteorological data
Model policy frameworks and guid-                open to all interests (public, academic,

Recommendation                            6
Invest in tools and infrastructure
