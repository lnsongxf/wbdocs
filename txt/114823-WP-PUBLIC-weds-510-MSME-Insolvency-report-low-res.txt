 BOX 2.1: The Impact of MSMEs on Employment13
 Formal MSMEs employ more than one-third of the world’s labour force.i In Canada, for example, small
 businesses employ 7.7 million employees, comprising 69.7 percent of the total private sector labour
 force and account for 78 percent of all private jobs created in Canada.ii In the European Union, 9.4
 million jobs were created in the MSME sector in 27 European Union countries between 2002 and 2008.iii
 From a regional perspective, East Asia and the Pacific have the highest ratio of MSME employment
 to total employment, driven largely by China, where formal MSMEs account for 80 percent of total
 employment.iv The OECD countries report that MSMEs with fewer than 250 employees account for two-

    BOX 3.1: “The Importance of Insolvency Law”39
    Insolvency regimes that are responsive to the needs of MSMEs are particularly important. Insolvency
    law is broadly recognized as an essential tool in a well-functioning economic framework.i A balance of
    mechanisms that allow for timely and effective liquidation, but also for a “fresh start” for entrepreneurs
    and rehabilitation of viable businesses tends to enhance creditor recoveries and confidence. In turn,
    they can stimulate greater volumes of lending,ii at longer maturity periods,iii at lower costiv and lower
    levels of collateral.v Such mechanisms can also offer an effective framework for the creation of new
    business activity.vi Credible restructuring schemes can ensure that businesses with viable going-forward
    business plans can survive, in turn preserving jobs, supply contracts, customer goodwill, and economic
    stability more generally.vii From a macro financial perspective, effective insolvency laws enable financial
    institutions to resolve problem assets more efficaciously, thereby freeing up provisioning resources,
    strengthening investors’ perception of financial sector stability, pro tanto improving banks’ ability to
    lend, and thus particularly benefitting small and medium enterprises in many economies where such
    businesses are particularly dependent on bank funding.viii The World Bank has observed that effective
    insolvency systems enhance predictability and thus lender confidence in loan recovery on default, which
    encourages more lending and leads to financial inclusion for more businesses.
    Of significance for MSMEs globally are both the formal legal rules and informal societal rules and practice
    norms that affect entrepreneurs, including the design of bankruptcy laws, the structure of capital markets,
    and the perception of stigma related to personal responsibility.ix Cost-effective insolvency proceedings can
    encourage inefficient firms to exit, encourage greater entrepreneurial activity and new firm creation, and
    can result in greater returns to creditors.x Timely resolution of financial distress can reduce uncertainty for
    entrepreneurs, creditors and management, and improve asset value and transparency.xi A well-functioning
    MSME insolvency regime can heighten the salience of the downside risk of a venture, in turn increasing
    the number and variety of people pursuing entrepreneurial activities.xii It can benefit lenders because of
    the certainty in recovery rules, in turn increasing confidence in lending.
    The efforts of organizations such as UNCITRAL and the World Bank have contributed significantly to
    creating model insolvency legislation, best practice guidance, and to helping governments implement
    reforms.xiii The effectiveness of insolvency laws nevertheless varies among countries around the world.
    xiv
        According to a survey on debt enforcement in 88 countries, referenced by a World Bank Research
    Paper, bankruptcy procedures are time-consuming, costly and inefficient in being able to preserve the
    business as a going concern; in only 36 percent of countries is the business preserved as a going concern;
    and an average of 48 percent of the business’s value is lost in debt enforcement.xv The World Bank Group
    Doing Business report for 2014 found that among 38 selected indicators/measures of the regulatory and
    institutional environment, the secured creditor recovery rate in distress scenarios was the single most
    valuable measure.xvi
    The World Bank also examined MSMEs that had defaulted on bank loans and found that differences in
    the level of creditor rights in bankruptcy in the different jurisdictions had an impact on lending terms,
    particularly those used by bank creditors; and that legislative reform regarding liquidation led to a
    decrease in interest rates, although reorganization reform had the opposite effect.xvii Moreover, a research
    study for the International Monetary Fund reports that six years since the global financial crisis, the
    problems of high levels of corporate debt and nonperforming loans (“NPLs”) persist in several European
    countries.xviii It found that SMEs in general are more leveraged and reliant on bank financing than large
    firms and have significantly higher non-performing loan (“NPL”) ratios. It also found that given the
    large number of SMEs, their small size and heavy reliance on collateral, SME loan restructuring is more
    costly and riskier for large firms than for banks, and current frameworks are ill-suited for SMEs, both in
    the ways they limit restructuring options and how they prevent speedy liquidation and exit.xi

       In many countries, the insolvency system is infrequently used, and in the cases where it is used, cases
       are often limited to value-destructive piecemeal liquidation or even to no-asset cases. This tendency
       generates a negative reputation for the insolvency system, which is perceived by the market as an
       inefficient tool, to be avoided at all costs. A country with a non-functional market exit system sees its
       credit affected and its economy grows—if at all—at a rate under its potential. The legislator needs to
       break the vicious circle by active measures that modernize the system and by creating incentives for
       market stakeholders to start using insolvency as a tool to heal sick but viable businesses, not as an
       ineffective way to bury dead ones. In the field of MSMEs, where often individuals—and families—
       are involved, the legislator must often consider social problems, such as reputational damage or the
       involvement of the entire household in the entrepreneurial project. These circumstances act as an
       additional barrier to the use of the system.
       The absence of a rescue culture and the aforementioned social constraints requires a double system
       of sanctions and incentives to ensure the use of the system at adequate levels, as illustrated by the
       incentives discussed above. Yet, experience shows that incentives are often not enough. More drastic
       measures have to be implemented in the form of sanctions and compensation for damages when certain
       circumstances accrue. In this section, these sanctions are analyzed in some detail, with particular regard
       to wrongful trading/duty to file rules, which serve the double purpose of ensuring an early filing of
       insolvency and protecting creditors from a management of the business that undermines their legitimate
       expectations to the benefit of shareholders.
       The problems, however, do not only lie with the lack of use of the insolvency system. If and when
       the lack of rescue culture, the social stigma, and poor market perception are overcome, problems may
       nonetheless arise concerning the manner in which debtors utilize the MSME insolvency regime.

 BOX 3.3: “MSME Obligations at Times Approaching Insolvency”52

 When insolvency is imminent, debtors should have greater regard to the interests of creditors and should
 attempt to address the distress situation. Yet, at that time, small entity debtors may be very reluctant to
 access the insolvency system, concerned about stigma, about losing their business, which is likely their
 only source of income, and being overly optimistic about the business’ prospects. Debtors may also be
 prone to adopt more high-risk strategies, attempting to avoid at all costs losing their business or the
 business’ assets. They may be inclined to collaborate with related persons or powerful creditors, hide
 or dispose of assets. The problem is particularly acute where debtors use the corporate form for their
 MSMEs. Incorporated MSME managers, who are likely to also be the business owners, may consider
 that they are safe from the outcomes of insolvency as they are protected by limited liability. Small
 debtors are also likely to be less concerned about returning to the managerial labour market and thus
 more prone to act self-servingly. Unincorporated MSMEs may take excessive risks if they consider that
 they will be released from liabilities through an insolvency discharge.
 A regime that focuses on the period of imminent insolvency is particularly important for encouraging
 action at an early stage and for facilitating rescues of viable businesses, aspects that are critical to the
 procedural framework contemplated for MSME insolvencies. Therefore, a regime for pre-insolvency
 obligations can complement the procedural framework and enhance it. It can provide an educational
 tool for MSMEs with regard to the proper means for addressing the situation of financial distress and
 the proper use of the module options.
 A regime that addresses the obligations of debtors at times approaching insolvency can respond to such
 concerns as debtor moral hazard. It can deter irresponsible behaviour at times of financial distress and
 provide guidance to debtors with regard to the appropriate actions they should take.

     best outcomes.

      BOX 3.4: “Creditor Passivity and Reckless Behaviour”53
      Limited resources in MSME insolvencies lead to very limited expectations for unsecured creditors
      regarding any substantial distribution in respect of their claims. Thus, unsecured creditors often have
      little incentive to incur further costs (e.g., travel costs, communication costs, investment of time) with
      regard to the insolvent debtor by participating actively in negotiations or proceedings. Overall, it is
      rational for a creditor not to participate unless it has a special interest in the result of the proceedings
      – most notably because it is personally connected to the debtor (by family ties, or as an employee), or
      where it appears that some value may be recoverable.
      Secured creditors, on the other hand, are interested in the enforcement of their security, which usually
      occurs through sale of the debtor’s assets. This interest may result in the liquidation and winding up
      of the debtor’s business. This type of enforcement often does not require any court proceedings or
      supervision; it could as well be done using out of court auctions or transactions. Aiming at saving the
      cost and delay of court hearings, it is rational for secured creditors to argue in favour of quick out–of-
      court auctions.

 BOX 3.5: “Addressing Information Gaps”54
 One of the main obstacles to the proper implementation of a MSME system, and a major contributing
 cause of debtor misbehaviour is the absence of adequate information in the MSME insolvency process.
 An effective MSME insolvency system would work substantially better if the debtor provides the
 necessary information and is willing and available to collaborate throughout the entire procedure. In
 some cases, and in some jurisdictions, however, particularly in the less developed economies, the very
 existence of the information cannot be taken for granted.

The informal nature of many MSMEs, particularly
in developing countries, further complicates             The issues arising when records are not kept up
recordkeeping. The legal obligations imposed on          or kept at all are most problematic in relation to
informal enterprises are often less stringent than       financial information, as discussed in Box 3.6.


 BOX 3.6: “Financial Information in MSME Insolvency”55
 Financial information is a key element in the mechanics of a market economy. Without proper, reliable,
 comparable financial statements, stakeholders cannot make investment decisions and the ex post control
 of the behaviour of market agents is not possible. This risk exists for all market participants, including
 –and in no less degree—MSMEs.
 Experience shows that information problems are more important the smaller the business is. Especially
 in developing economies, the level of informality is high: sometimes entrepreneurs and small entities do
 not have a legal duty to file proper accounts, or the duty is only rarely enforced; owners and managers
 have little or no knowledge of account drafting; and public training courses and awareness campaigns
 are very scarce. MSMEs conduct their activity “the way it’s always been”, with, at best, home-based
 accounting practices. This situation is incompatible with the proper development of the MSME sector,
 and, hence, of the economy of a given jurisdiction. An adequate level of formality and, more precisely,
 sufficient financial information, are key to a workable system to tackle MSME insolvency. Without
 it, access to finance is limited, risk seems higher, and therefore the price of financing is also more
 expensive. In case of financial difficulties, out of court agreements are hindered, many insolvency tools
 are useless (liability of directors, avoidance actions, etc.), and there are perverse incentives to destroy
 value by owners of distressed MSMEs. The entire system to tackle business distress might be thwarted.
 Even in those countries where there is a proper system of debt discharge, the fresh start of the debtor
 is hampered by the impossibility of making a proper assessment of the discharge test, given the lack of
 information, at least in those systems where the discharge is based on an ad hoc analysis of the debtor’s
 behaviour.

      particularly arises at the inception of the business life and, even more intensely, when the business suffers
      liquidity tensions and financial distress. The rescue of viable MSMEs may only happen if the business
      receives financing. Otherwise, the activity comes to a stop and piece-meal liquidation is the only real
      alternative. In most jurisdictions, but particularly where the market still needs development, the absence
      of a rescue culture and the stigma associated with it, the lack of an enabling legal framework, the lack
      of real possibilities to lower the risk of lending for small debtors (e.g., no assets free for collateral,
      limited ability to offer personal guarantees), and the passivity of creditors, thwart the continuation of
      the business activity, frustrating chances of business recovery and value preservation. In this light, the
      legal and institutional frameworks of a country need to provide the mechanisms to ensure that troubled
      but viable businesses are able to access financing with a view to trading out of their difficulties. Possible
      mechanisms to enhance access to finance at times of distress, with reference to relevant key stages of
      MSME insolvency and with particular consideration of the specific problems encountered in the MSME
      context, are discussed below. The position of the debtor that went through the insolvency process and
      how the financing framework can enhance the concept of “fresh start” and encouragement of new
      businesses is also discussed.
      It should be stressed, however, that there does not appear to be a single effective strategy for financing of
      MSMEs in distress, given the size and range of such businesses. The universal features to consider when
      designing the framework must be efficiency and affordability. Implementation should be left to national
      variations, based on different socio-economic contexts and variety of legal traditions.


     Most traditional insolvency systems do not consider      Overlaps between Business Insolvency and
     the possibility of super-priority for fresh funds, or    Personal Insolvency Regimes in the Case of
     provisions that encourage access to finance for          MSMEs

     BOX 4.1: “One Size or Strategy for MSME Insolvency Will Not Fit All”65
     The public policy in many jurisdictions is to encourage the formation and growth of MSMEs, yet that
     policy does not necessarily align with treatment during financial distress. Insolvency processes in many
     countries are too expensive and unwieldy for MSMEs. As noted previously, the broad range of definitions
     for MSMEs in various jurisdictions is highly problematic for the types of issues facing MSMEs. One
     size does not fit all.
     Often, on MSME insolvency, there are few or no assets to realize. Liquidation is the most prevalent
     outcome, which can result in loss of value to creditors and debtors. Insolvency regimes not designed to
     address MSME failure can fail to distinguish viable businesses from non-viable ones.
     As noted [in the previous chapter], the owners of small businesses usually need to secure business loans
     with their personal assets or personal guarantees, creating a convergence and blurring of distinctions
     between personal and business liability in practice, a factor not accounted for in most insolvency law
     regimes globally. Researchers have observed that while the personal guarantee of a firm’s owner might
     encourage a level of financial discipline, in countries without a personal bankruptcy framework, a
     single business failure can doom an owner to a lifetime of outstanding debt;i effectively preventing such
     individuals from re-entering the market as experienced.ii Evidence suggests that exactly the opposite
     approach better serves standard public policy objectives. One study that compared self-employment in
     15 countries in Europe and North America from 1990-2005 found that the more forgiving the personal
     bankruptcy laws, measured particularly in reference to the time a bankrupt individual has to wait to be
     discharged from pre-bankruptcy debts, combined with ready access to limited liability protections, the
     more entrepreneurial activity was enhanced.iii
     The failure to recognize this convergence of personal and business debt means that debtors may have
     access to effective liquidation or rehabilitation schemes only if they fit within very specific criteria. For
     example, in Canada, there is a highly streamlined mechanism for MSME businesses under Division II
     consumer proposal provisions of the BIA, which are accessible to self-employed individuals and sole
     proprietors whose debts are less than 250,000 CAD (USD 185,435), excluding a mortgage or hypothec
     on the individual’s principal residence, if 50 percent or more of their debts are business-related.iv But
     these mechanisms are not available where the individual has incorporated the business.
     Nor are insolvency regimes only relevant to one end of the MSME lifecycle. Access to credit is
     particularly important for MSMEs. The global MSME lending volume is estimated to be 10 trillion
     USD, of which 70 percent is in high-income OECD countries.v On average, small and medium enterprise
     loans constitute 13 percent of gross domestic product (“GDP”) in developed countries and 3 percent in
     developing countries.vi In a survey of 130,000 firms in 135 countries, the World Bank Group found that
     there is unmet demand for bank loans and lines of credit in developing regions, particularly Africa.vii The
     survey found that while almost 60 percent of businesses require a loan at some point, just over a third
     of businesses have a loan or line of credit. The survey results revealed that well-designed insolvency
     laws are a factor in accessing credit, directly related to creditor confidence in the ability to recover.viii In
     turn, access to credit can assist with fostering entrepreneurship and the creation of new business activity.
