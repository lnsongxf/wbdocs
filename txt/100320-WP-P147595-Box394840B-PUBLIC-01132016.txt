This work would not have been possible without the numerous contributions from all
the agricultural specialists who have participated in conducting Agricultural Risk
Assessments during the last four years, of whom there are too many to list. The team
would also like to extend its special appreciation to the stakeholders of agricultural
supply chains in Africa, Latin America, and Eastern Europe who actively engaged in
the development of sector risk assessments in those regions, bringing a great sense of
realism to this experience. Their active participation obliged the team to be realistic
and practical.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In the agricultural sector, risks are inherent and ubiquitous, posing potentially serious
consequences for stakeholders and consumers. Risks disrupt supply chains, causing
extensive ﬁnancial and economic losses. Agricultural risks are also the principal cause
of transient food insecurity, creating a poverty trap for millions of households across
the developing world that enforces a vicious cycle of shock and recovery. Climate
change is exacerbating this cycle by shifting the frequency and intensity of weather-
related risks and increasing uncertainty.

Eﬀective agricultural risk management (ARM) is crucial to increasing economic
growth, improving food security, and reducing poverty. Although levels of risk vary
within and between countries, lower-income and highly agriculture-dependent coun-
tries are more vulnerable to agriculture-related risks. In these countries, there is an
urgent need to better assess risks, understand the interconnections between diﬀerent
types of risk, and improve agricultural risk management strategies.

AGRICULTURAL SECTOR RISK ASSESSMENT:
AN INTEGRATED APPROACH
The World Bank’s conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from an integrated
perspective. The framework views agricultural sector risk assessment (ASRA) as a tool
to help decision makers understand risk exposure and to provide the basis for develop-
ing appropriate risk management solutions. ASRA is a consultative, time-bound pro-
cess that provides an orderly way to analyze, identify, and prioritize risks. The process
facilitates risk management policy and program design by providing a framework and
tools for decision making. The ASRA’s target audience includes country-level stake-
holders involved in selected agricultural commodity systems, development agency
decision makers, and developing country policy makers.

This report provides methodological guidance for conducting an ASRA. The guid-
ance is based on the World Bank’s Agriculture Risk Management Team’s experience
assisting governments in conducting sector and key commodity supply chain risk
assessments in more than 20 countries.

INTRODUCTION

OVERVIEW
This document provides methodological guidance for conducting an ASRA. It is pri-
marily designed for use by development practitioners working in the agricultural sec-
tor in developing countries. Besides presenting the conceptual underpinnings of
agricultural risk management, the document oﬀers practical guidance on the com-
plexities of developing a holistic ASRA upon which an integrated risk management
strategy can be designed. Rather than presenting a methodological blueprint, this
document outlines a practical approach that can be adapted to the particular circum-
stances of developing economies.

The conceptual framework and step-by-step illustrations presented in this methodo-
logical guidance are based on nearly a decade of experience of the World Bank’s
Agriculture Risk Management Team in assisting developing economies in conducting
sector and key commodity supply chain risk assessments. Whereas other institutions
and academic reports oﬀer insights into the development of tools to assess agricultural
risks, the guidance herein provides a practical, stepwise approach to conducting
ASRAs, incorporating the lessons learned from assisting countries in incorporating
risk management practices into mid-term development strategies. This approach was
developed and reﬁned over time based on experience, but each speciﬁc assessment
needs to be adapted to account for a country’s unique combination of risks, institu-
tional arrangements, and ﬁscal constraints.

The World Bank’s conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from an integrated
perspective. The framework views risk assessment as a decision support tool for
designing strategies to manage risks in agriculture. The ASRA’s primary objective is
to assist developing countries and stakeholders to better comprehend the complexity
of ARM and to develop appropriate solutions to mitigate, transfer, and cope with
agricultural risks.

Despite notable progress in this ﬁeld, much remains to be done to mainstream ARM into
development planning and investment decisions. The mainstreaming of ARM and

AGRICULTURAL RISK MANAGEMENT
CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
This conceptual framework for ARM looks at risk from a holistic perspective and
views the ASRA process as a decision support tool for designing integrated ARM strat-
egies. The primary objective is to help decision makers understand the risk exposure
of agricultural sector stakeholders and to provide the basis for developing appropriate
solutions to mitigate, transfer, and cope with agricultural risks.

An expanding range of experience across several countries and agricultural commod-
ities has extended and reﬁned the ARMT’s understanding of agricultural risks, their
impacts, and their transmission across the sector as well as the eﬃcacy of diﬀerent
strategies to manage risks. Distilling the experience and lessons learned in more than
20 countries, the World Bank developed the conceptual framework presented herein
for assessing agricultural risks with an emphasis on practical application.

This methodology for assessing agricultural risks is based on a decade of lessons
learned by the World Bank’s ARMT, which has conducted numerous sector risk assess-
ments in Niger, Honduras, Belize, Grenada, Paraguay, Ghana, Rwanda, Malawi,
Kenya, Senegal, Tanzania, and Mozambique. Likewise, valuable lessons were learned
from risk assessments for speciﬁc agricultural supply chains in Ghana (cocoa), Kenya
(horticulture), Mozambique (cotton), Vietnam (coﬀee), Guyana (rice), Haiti (coﬀee),
and Uganda (dairy and coﬀee), among others. (See appendix B for a complete list of
risk assessments completed by the World Bank.)

THE CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK FOR ARM
A holistic perspective needs to (i) engage all stakeholders who are aﬀected by agricul-
tural risks and who take actions to manage them; (ii) consider the full range of risks;
(iii) analyze diﬀerent strategies to manage risk; and (iv) understand the diﬀerent steps
in the risk management process (as summarized in ﬁgure 2.1). An ASRA typically
involves prioritizing the major risks aﬀecting various stakeholders. The risk prioritiza-
tion subsequently informs identiﬁcation of speciﬁc risk management interventions and
strategies to be implemented in the short to medium term.

OPERATIONAL APPROACH:
HOW TO CONDUCT AN ASRA
Whereas the previous chapters explained the context, justiﬁcation, and conceptual
framework for conducting an ASRA, the remainder of the document focuses on the
operational steps to apply the framework in practice. As mentioned earlier, rather than
presenting a methodological blueprint, this document outlines a practical approach
that can be adapted to the particular circumstances of developing economies. The
ASRA may be tailored to take into account the sector’s structure and institutional
dynamics, including factors such as supply chains, institutions, ﬁscal constraints, and

ment solutions identiﬁed in a particular country will not necessarily ﬁt the context of
another country, however similar they may appear.

WHAT IS THE OPERATIONAL
APPROACH?
A great deal of literature exists on the subject of risk management. No less extensive
are variations in the understanding and use of terminology. For the purpose of these
guidelines, the ASRA is considered the process of identifying and prioritizing the
major risks that explain agricultural gross domestic product (GDP) volatility. Once
those risks are identiﬁed and assessed, the following issue is determining how stake-
holders manage those risks. This process involves identifying optimal risk management
solutions to be incorporated into sector risk management strategies led by the public
sector.

Risk analysis using a holistic framework can be very complex and can involve sev-
eral stakeholder groups. Stakeholder participation is encouraged through a process
of facilitation. Given the complexities of agricultural production, processing, and
commercialization, there is no shortage of risks and potential solutions to manage
them. Moreover, eﬀective risk management generally requires close cooperation

The ﬁrst step of the ASRA process is to gather background information on the
agricultural sector, collect relevant data for risk analysis, and conduct a desk-level anal-
ysis before doing ﬁeldwork. The objectives of this step are the following:
     » Understand the context by analyzing current and past agricultural policies and
        strategies.
     » Understand the dynamics of the political economy, when possible.
     » Identify the structure of the agricultural sector and the role it plays within the
        broader economy (for example, size of sector, share in trade, labor in agricul-

        rates.
     » Identify and predict likely impacts from climate change related to projected
        changes in weather and temperature.

By conducting this background analysis before the ﬁeldwork, the team can identify in
advance the sector’s risk landscape and its disaggregation by commodity and by region.
This exercise allows the team to become familiar with the country context, the broader
economy, and more particularly, the agricultural sector. The ﬁndings of the background

STEP 2: RISK QUANTIFICATION
The task of quantifying losses caused by diﬀerent risk events is a key step in the ASRA
process, but it is not easy. Financial losses attributed to agricultural risks are caused by
a variety of shocks related to production, market, or enabling environment factors.
The impacts of some risks can be complicated to quantify in monetary terms, whereas
others cannot be quantiﬁed at all. Assigning proxy values can provide an estimate of
the magnitude of ﬁnancial losses to allow comparison of risks, paving the way for the
prioritization of major risks.

Various approaches exist to quantifying risk. The World Bank’s ARMT relies primar-
ily on time series analysis to assess production risks; variations from the historical mean
to assess market risks; and qualitative analysis to assess enabling environment risks.
Chapter 5 focuses on how to quantify ﬁnancial losses using time series analysis when a
complete set of time series data is available. The chapter also discusses methods for
quantifying losses under poor data scenarios.


RATIONALE
Quantifying losses associated with a risk event enables comparison or risk ranking as
an intermediate step in the risk prioritization process. Loss quantiﬁcation provides an
order of magnitude of the indicative losses in terms of agricultural GDP, which helps
to justify investment in risk management solutions that reduce the impact of external
shocks and strengthen resilience. In fact, losses are a key piece of information for any
cost-beneﬁt analysis for investing in agricultural resilience.

Ideally, if data availability permits, the quantiﬁcation of losses for each commodity
under study should be done as part of the deskwork phase before the ﬁeld visits. The
ﬁndings are very useful for determining the magnitude of loss, its causes, the stake-
holders aﬀected, and stakeholders’ capacity to manage. Calculating loss estimates
before the ﬁeld visit makes the ﬁeldwork much more eﬃcient and helps facilitate dis-
cussions with stakeholders.

STEP 3: FIELDWORK
For illustrative purposes, one can imagine deskwork as a “top-down” approach, which
means that the starting points are the sector statistics, programs, and assessment of
value chains risks and commodities. The ﬁeldwork, by contrast, can be considered the
“bottom-up” side of the exercise, where the team seeks to have direct one-to-one dis-
cussions about risks with key stakeholders of major agricultural supply chains.

PURPOSE
The purpose of ﬁeldwork is not just to corroborate the ﬁndings of the desk assessment,
but to help the team identify the story line. The team seeks to (i) corroborate the time
line of events; (ii) test the causality of risks identiﬁed; (iii) test whether the losses can be
validated against what happened in reality; and (iv) assess stakeholders’ capacity to
manage risks. Box 6.1 shows an example of the line of enquiry that needs to be dis-
cussed by team members as part of the background research and prior to arriving in
country for the ASRA ﬁeldwork.

FIELDWORK ACTIVITIES
Fieldwork consists of a limited number of activities, but these require remaining in the
ﬁeld for at least two weeks to conduct interviews with key stakeholders of main supply
chains. Organizing the timing and logistics of the visit is particularly important when
the assessment is done in a large country with diﬃcult access to remote areas and lim-
ited overnight accommodations. It is advised to plan the trip logistics well in advance,
including details of appointments, transportation, and interviews. Having a consultant
with local knowledge who can assist with making arrangements prior to the arrival of
the risk assessment team has proven to be an indispensable element.

The main activities typically covered during the ﬁeldwork include the following:
   (i) Data mining. This is a valuable opportunity to ﬁll gaps in the information needed.
       Some pieces of information exist only in hard copy and only by visiting institu-
       tions can the team access them. For example, commodity boards’ annual reports
       have valuable information about supply chain dynamics reported on an annual
       basis, including causes for drops in volume and logistics and market issues.

discussed with team members prior to a ﬁeld assessment.                             FOR AN ASRA IN TANZANIA
Prior to starting the ﬁeldwork, the team leader should
assign responsibilities for speciﬁc commodities and regions
to each team member based on spatial considerations. A
team of four specialists can plan four diﬀerent routes to
meet the relevant stakeholders related to a commodity.
Supply chains are typically located in spatial clusters and
team members should be able to cover the interviews by
following a well-planed route. Other commodities, such as
many food crops (maize, cassava), are virtually every-
where. Depending on country circumstances, the team
will agree on how to share responsibilities to cover all
commodities and their stakeholders.

For instance, analyzing risk to livestock activities can take
three dimensions: (i) farmers’ focus groups can be used to
evaluate systems in which livestock (ruminants) are per-
manently a part of a rural household’s production system
and food security; (ii) for more extensive cattle production
systems, particularly common in Sub-Saharan Africa, the

STEP 4: RISK PRIORITIZATION
As a result of the background research and ﬁeldwork, the team has already under-
taken a prioritization exercise for each commodity that shows the ranking of each
identiﬁed risk in terms of (i) the frequency in which risk events occur; (ii) the severity
of the impact (intensity); and (iii) stakeholders’ capacity to manage the identiﬁed risk
events.

VARIABLES FOR RISK PRIORITIZATION
Categorizing risk in terms of frequency and intensity can be confusing without the use
of consistent deﬁnitions or guidelines shared with the team. Again, no magic recipes
or standardized procedures exist for establishing these categories, but prior discussion
with team members helps to harmonize an approach. As a general rule of thumb
based on experience, table 7.1 provides some guidance on how to categorize risks
based on probability of event (frequency) and severity of impact (intensity or capacity
to produce losses).

Apart from the frequency of events and the severity of impact, a third variable will
ultimately determine the ranking of risk: stakeholders’ capacity to manage the identi-
ﬁed risk (see ﬁgure 7.1). For example, if the team ﬁnds that stakeholders already have
high capacity to manage a particular identiﬁed risk, this particular risk will not be
ranked among the most important. As mentioned earlier, the capacity to manage each
identiﬁed risk is assessed mainly during stakeholder interviews, but also by using sec-
ondary information collected during the background work prior to the ﬁeld visit.
Chapter 9 addresses the concept of vulnerability and capacity to manage risk in
greater depth.

PRIORITIZATION MATRIX
The use of a prioritization matrix helps enormously in categorizing risks in terms of
frequency and intensity. If team members use this table in a standardized manner,
results can be shared and discussed among stakeholders and team members in an easy-
to-understand fashion, and corrections can be made accordingly and quickly. (Recall

STEP 5: PRIORITIZATION OF RISK
MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS
In this step the team and stakeholders identify a short list of solutions that they agree
will make up the optimal strategy for managing risk in the agricultural sector. As
deﬁned in chapter 2, risk management strategies (solutions) fall into three categories:
risk mitigation, risk transfer, and risk coping. The long list of solutions, categorized
into these three types of strategies, provides the starting point for this step (ﬁgure 8.1).

LONG LIST OF SOLUTIONS
If the line of enquiry was followed during the ﬁeld visit, the team has identiﬁed a list
of potential solutions that are meant to contribute to the management of identiﬁed
risk. Once the sector risk prioritization matrix is complete (recall table 7.3), the team
analyzes the long list of potential solutions for the prioritized risks in the matrix and
divides those potential solutions into the three categories of risk strategies. The initial
long list is often not exhaustive and might not provide concrete next steps, but it does
provide a menu of options from which to choose. Table 8.1 shows the long list pre-
pared for an ASRA in Tanzania.

In conducting Paraguay’s ASRA, the team came up with more detailed long list of solu-
tions organized by subsectors, because a huge gap exists between family agriculture and
commercial agriculture, such that Paraguay is considered to have a dual agricultural
system. The team adapted the methodology to devote special attention to family agri-
culture, the subsector with the vast majority of poor small producers, for whom the
government identiﬁed separate policies, including separate risk management strategies.

CHAPTER NINE
UNDERSTANDING VULNERABILITY TO RISK
As vulnerability is used to prioritize risks and to design and target risk management
interventions, assessing vulnerability is an important part of the ASRA. The concept
of vulnerability can be applied at diﬀerent levels (that is, farmer, household, commu-
nity) and over various areas (that is, farm, district, province, region), which can lead to
confusion. For the purpose of these guidelines, vulnerability is deﬁned as the capac-
ity of stakeholders to manage agricultural risk and recover from exter-
nal shocks. The capacity to manage risk is assessed during the background work
prior to the ﬁeld visit and during the ﬁeld visit through stakeholder interviews.

Using the methodology outlined in previous chapters provides the team with a good
overview of the risks with the biggest impacts on the agricultural sector and the overall
economy. Depending on the size of the sector, the magnitude of the impacts, and the
variability of their incidence across regions, however, the assessment of aggregate
losses can sometimes mask the distribution and scope of impacts on speciﬁc groups of
stakeholders. The vulnerability assessment is therefore an important tool for more fully
analyzing the distributional impacts of risks and developing more eﬃcient risk man-
agement mechanisms.

STAKEHOLDERS’ RISK PROFILE
ASSESSMENT
Understanding risk proﬁles entails analyzing the roles of diﬀerent stakeholders across
the agricultural sector, including the three principal groups (producers, commercial
sector stakeholders, and the public sector) but also subgroups, and understanding their
risk management capacities. For example:
     » Who is involved in the value chain analyzed (diﬀerent stakeholders, segments of
       population, gender, and so on)?
     » How does the identiﬁed risk aﬀect diﬀerent stakeholders (for example, farm-
       ers vs. processors vs. traders and exporters; consumers vs. producers; regional

TOWARD A RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGY
Whereas the ASRA steps detailed in the preceding chapters can be standardized to
some extent, the incorporation of risk solutions into government policies and plans is
a highly country-speciﬁc process that cannot be standardized. Each country has its
own decision-making process that takes place in a unique political economy. Chapter
10 discusses diﬀerent approaches for how the risk solutions identiﬁed in the ASRA can
be developed into action plans incorporated into stakeholders’ strategies to reduce
agricultural risks.

ACTIONS AND STAKEHOLDERS
Eﬀective risk management typically requires a combination of measures, some
designed to remove underlying constraints and others designed to address risk directly.
Resource availability will often determine what is possible. Whatever the case, inte-
grated risk management programs are more eﬀective than stand-alone programs.
Translating the risk management strategy (whether mitigation, transfer, or coping) into
concrete action requires the use of several kinds of implementation instruments. These
instruments fall into three categories: agricultural investments, TA, and policy support.
Some examples of risk management measures are highlighted in table 10.1.

Risk management activities involve action by either individual or multiple stakehold-
ers. Examples of activities that involve action by a single stakeholder include a farmer
adopting agricultural practices to manage weather, pest, or disease risk or a trader
using a back-to-back trading strategy or hedging to manage price risk. Other risk man-
agement strategies necessitate collaboration between two or more actors in the supply
chain. These include sharing market information to manage price risk or establishing
better contractual relationships and information sharing to manage counterparty risk.

The private sector can play an important role in managing the types of risk that can be
handled through market tools such as insurance and futures markets. Futures contracts
can be used to hedge price risk, for example. Besides private sector stakeholders, actions
by public institutions, which potentially beneﬁt many private actors, may be critical for
successful risk management. These include strategies such as developing early warning

FINAL CONSIDERATIONS
Agricultural risk management is an issue of development eﬀectiveness, not just a mat-
ter of kindness to farmers. The increasing presence of risk in the agricultural sector
may not just exacerbate volatility, but may also become a major impediment to devel-
opment, economic growth, and poverty reduction agendas. The nature and impor-
tance of risk issues aﬀecting economic growth and poverty reduction vary from
country to country. So, too, do stark diﬀerences exist in a country’s capacity to manage
agricultural risks. Disparities in risk vulnerability in the agricultural sector tend to be
greater in lower-income countries, and, within countries, greater among poor than
more aﬄuent stakeholders along agricultural supply chains. Thus the need to tailor
each ASRA to suit the particular realities of developing countries, as one size does not
ﬁt all. These guidelines should be considered a practical approach rather than a rigid
“bulletproof ” methodology.

THE OPERATIONAL EXPERIENCE
The World Bank has gained notable experience in integrating agricultural risk issues
into country work and lending over the last decade. Attention to agricultural risk issues
in Country Assistance Strategies (CAS) has also increased during the same period.
Likewise, ASRAs’ ﬁndings have informed various lending operations at the project
level, either as stand-alone projects or as components of a larger intervention to
increase sector productivity and resilience (box 11.1).

Much work still needs to be done to establish an enabling environment that will foster
country-led, country-speciﬁc strategies for mainstreaming agricultural management
risk measures into agricultural policies and investments. The opportunities for improv-
ing the development impact through risk mainstreaming include making development
interventions more responsive to country risk conditions and commitments; making
these interventions more strategic; and improving the alignment of policies, processes,
and resources to support such interventions.

APPENDIX A
GLOSSARY OF TERMS
Agricultural risk: Agricultural risk is a combination of the likelihood of the occur-
rence of a hazardous event or exposure(s) and the severity of losses that can be caused
by the event or exposure(s). The three main attributes of risk are event hazard, uncer-
tainty, and losses.

Climate change: Climate change refers to a statistically signiﬁcant variation in
either the mean state of the climate or its variability, persisting for an extended period
(typically decades or longer). Climate change may be due to natural internal processes
or external forces or to persistent anthropogenic changes in the composition of the
atmosphere or in land use. In its Article 1, the Framework Convention on Climate
Change (UNFCCC) deﬁnes climate change as a change of climate which is attributed
directly or indirectly to human activity that alters the composition of the global atmos-
phere and that is in addition to natural climate variability observed over comparable
time periods.

Climate: Climate in a narrow sense is usually deﬁned as the average weather, or more
rigorously, as the statistical description in terms of the mean and variability of relevant
quantities over a period of time ranging from months to thousands or millions of
years. The classic period is 30 years, as deﬁned by the World Meteorological Organiza-
tion (WMO). These quantities are most often surface variables such as temperature,
precipitation, and wind. Climate in a wider sense is the state, including a statistical
description, of the climate system.

Constraints: These are conditions that lead to suboptimal performance. For
example, low yields (symptom) might be caused by lack of access to inputs or poor
technology.

Enabling environment risk: Sudden changes in the given scenarios where busi-
nesses take place that can lead to ﬁnancial losses among agricultural stakeholders
(for example, unexpected changes in government or business regulations, the mac-
roeconomic environment, political risks, conﬂict, trade restrictions, logistics, and
corruption).

DATA REQUIREMENTS FOR AGRICULTURAL
SECTOR RISK ASSESSMENTS
Access to disaggregated, reliable, good-quality time series (preferably 20–30 years) data is
a precondition for conducting an agricultural sector risk assessment. It is preferable that
all statistics and data be provided at the disaggregated departmental or provincial level.
      1. Agricultural structure of the country:
          • Composition of agricultural GDP, highlighting major commodities and percent
             share of diﬀerent commodities (crop, livestock, ﬁsheries, and so on) in agri-
             cultural GDP;
          • Time series data on acreage, production, yield of major commodities (crops and live-
             stock) that account for more than 80 percent of the country’s agricultural
             GDP;

             son and major crop type, planting dates and harvest.
      2. Crop production data: The following data are needed, broken down by
          crop season, summer and winter, and disaggregated by region or province.
          These data should be provided for those 7–10 agricultural commodities
          (including livestock and crops) that account for more than 80 percent of the
          country’s agricultural GDP:
          • Commodity production: Total volume of commodity produced (MT);
          • Commodity acreage: Total acreage under the commodity in question (sown and
             harvested areas);

GUIDELINES FOR FOCUS GROUP
DISCUSSIONS WITH FARMERS
Basics. A focus group comprises people who have attributes in common and who are
able to provide information and opinions about the topic or subject that is the focus of
discussion. Focus groups may be homogeneous or heterogeneous depending on the
purpose of the focus group meeting (for example, to identify a pattern, a homogeneous
group is more appropriate, whereas to ascertain perceptions of risks aﬀecting a whole
supply chain, a heterogeneous group is more appropriate).

Although the Ministry of Agriculture counterparts select the focus groups for an
ASRA, the assessment team should
    » Be careful that no signiﬁcant power diﬀerentials exist among group members,
      as this often results in inﬂuential people (often men, or better-oﬀ individuals)
      dominating the discussion.
    » Aim to cover a mixed sample of representative farming entities covering
      (i) small and (ii) medium farmers.5 Within this continuum, considerable diﬀer-
      entiation may still exist within groups and should be accounted for. For example
      some small farmers (possibly in diﬀerent regions) may have low input use (for
      example, limited inputs, family labor) versus high input use (for example, higher
      input use, hired labor). The level of commercialization may also vary among
      medium and large enterprises and regions in the country.
    » Keep the size of the focus group manageable. A focus group is most eﬀective
      with 10–15 participants.

All three ﬁeld teams will conduct as many farmer focus group discussions as possible:
on the major cash crop, on all food crops, and one more cash crop at the discretion of
the ﬁeld team member.


5
    Large-scale farmers will be interviewed separately (key informant interviews).

APPENDIX E
EXAMPLE OF RAINFALL ANALYSIS AND
CROP PRODUCTION IN GHANA
Whenever data and time allow, it is useful to conduct an analysis of the relationship
between rainfall and agricultural yields for main crops and for various regions. An
example of such analysis is hereby shown for Ghana.

BACKGROUND
An analysis of rainfall data provides useful information on the level and distribution
of rainfall by region and the impact of various rainfall characteristics on crop yields.

Ghana has 99 weather stations located throughout the country, although some regions
have a higher density than do others. Analysis was based on daily rainfall data from
1981 to 2010. Figure E.1 shows the distribution of the weather stations (orange dots).

As the weather stations do not have information on the region to which they belong,
distance from the centroid of each region (i) was calculated for each station (j) using the
Euclidean distance formula:

                                         (x            ) +( y − y )
                                                       2             2
                                Dist =        i   xj        i    j


Where:

  Dist = Euclidean distance
    xi = longitude from region i’s centroid
    xj = longitude from station j
    yi = latitude from region i’s centroid
    yj = latitude from station j

Each station was assigned to the region whose distance to the centroid was the small-
est. Reference marks for the centroids of each region are indicated by the blue dots in
ﬁgure E.1.

GUIDELINES FOR CONSULTANTS

PRIOR TO MISSION
In the ARMT’s experience, team members on missions who are unprepared spend
time in stakeholder meetings trying to understand the structure of the sector and sup-
ply chains instead of focusing on the risks to the sector. This is not the purpose of the
mission! Consultants should therefore:
     » Read up on ARMT’s previous work and the methodology applied in risk assess-
       ments.
     » Read the preparatory work already conducted by ARMT on the country (in
       Dropbox).
     » Prepare background notes on relevant crops of livestock (see table F.1).

During mission: Make sure you take notes! ARMT’s experience is that it is useful
to start writing during the mission while thoughts are still fresh and to get a better sense
of where the information gaps are before leaving the country. ARMT understands
that this is not always feasible given the workload during missions, but you are strongly
encouraged to think through what you have and what information you need to support
the risk story that emerges for your commodities. It is so much more diﬃcult to get the
information once out of the country, and in ARMT’s experience, this signiﬁcantly
delays production of these reports. Additionally, you will need this information for
your stakeholder presentation.

Post mission (approximately two staﬀ weeks depending on the number of com-
modities): Please ensure timely submission of your inputs! The lead author depends on your
work to do his or her job, and the ARMT will spend additional time on the report once
it is received. After that, it is reviewed in the World Bank before it is sent to the client.
Hence, the process is long and it is important to avoid delays. Guidelines on writing
follow.

Writing for ARMT: Because every country is diﬀerent, the risk story will vary
between countries and commodities, so no ﬁxed format exists for ARMT’s reports.
Nevertheless, certain standards are needed to ensure quality work. Additionally, in
ARMT’s experience, substandard deliverables from team members (including poor

SAMPLE TERMS OF REFERENCE
FOR CONSULTANTS

BACKGROUND
Risks are inherent, ubiquitous, and varied in agricultural systems, perhaps more so
than in any other area of economic endeavor. They enforce poverty traps and pose
serious consequences for all stakeholders. The apparent increase in the frequency of
commodity price spikes and crop failures, added to concerns over climate change and
food security, have increased global interest in ARM. The prevalence and complexity
of the multiple risks facing agricultural systems and the failure to address them on an
ex ante and integrated basis continue to leave countries and their agricultural supply
chains at risk. The realization of these risks leads to a perpetual cycle of “shock-
recovery-shock,” which endangers the sustainability of ongoing initiatives and remains
a major impediment to the development of most agricultural sectors.

With the objective of mainstreaming agricultural risk management into national sec-
tor development strategic planning and promoting more resilient and sustainable agri-
cultural systems, the World Bank’s Agriculture Risk Management Team provides TA
that helps clients evaluate agricultural risks and put in place requisite systems for
improved risk management. ARMT’s ARM framework looks comprehensively at the
risks to the agricultural sector and comprises (i) risk assessment and prioritization; (ii)
stakeholders’ assessments; (iii) analysis of risk management strategies; and (iv) screen-
ing of potential risk management instruments.

This activity has the potential to inform agricultural development strategies and invest-
ment plans as well as the agricultural development programs of development partners
or donors. By quantifying risk and providing an evidence-based prioritization of risk
management interventions, it can facilitate objective policy and programming dia-
logue and help focus design and delivery of TA activities. In the end, however, integra-
tion of risk management practices into development strategies will reduce the
short- and medium-term volatility in the agricultural sector and improve resilience in
the longer term, thus reducing vulnerabilities among agricultural sector stakeholders

PRIORITIZATION OF RISK
MANAGEMENT MEASURES IN
NIGER—A FILTERING APPROACH
Many risk management measures are complementary in nature and will contribute to
improved risk management in the short, medium, and long term. In a resource-con-
strained environment, however, decision makers are compelled to ﬁnd the quickest,
cheapest, and most eﬀective measures among a myriad of possibilities. Ideally, a
detailed, objective, and exhaustive cost-beneﬁt analysis will help in selecting the most
appropriate intervention options. But conducting a cost-beneﬁt analysis of a multitude
of options can be costly and time consuming. As such, using decision ﬁlters to evaluate
and prioritize among a list of potential interventions can help in making rational
resource allocation decisions in lieu of a detailed cost-beneﬁt analysis. The Agriculture
Risk Management Team conducted a ﬁltering exercise in Niger to prioritize risk man-
agement interventions using some simple criteria as ﬁlters (see table K.2).
     » Relative beneﬁts: The most beneﬁcial interventions were those that reduced
       the hazards, exposures, and losses associated with the various identiﬁed risks.
       Further, if the intervention could lead to additional beneﬁts (for example, yield
       or eﬃciency improvements or cost reduction), it was rated highly. Table K.1,
       taken from the 2013 “Niger Agricultural Sector Risk Assessment” (World Bank
       2013c), shows the “relative beneﬁts” ﬁlter in actions.
     » Relative cost: Without detailed assessments, it may be diﬃcult to estimate
       the cost of some interventions. ARMT’s experience is that the “relative cost”
       of interventions can be assessed more readily. For example, the cost involved in
       a large-scale irrigation project is usually much higher than the cost involved in
       setting up a system for seed distribution.
     » Scalability: Owing to a required prerequisite some interventions may ben-
       eﬁt a small group of stakeholders, but other interventions may have much
       greater potential to be scaled-up and beneﬁt a much larger group of stake-
       holders.
