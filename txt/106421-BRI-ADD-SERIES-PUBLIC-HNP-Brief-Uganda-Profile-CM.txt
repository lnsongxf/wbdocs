  KEY MESSAGES:
         Measures of child marriage are high in Uganda. The share of women ages 18-22 who married
          as children is 36.5 percent, but it has declined over time. The share of girls marrying very
          early, before the age of 15, has also declined.
         Child marriage is associated with lower wealth, lower education levels, and higher labor force
          participation. These are however only correlations, not necessarily causal effects.
