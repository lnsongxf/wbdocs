1	   Nutrition-specific interventions and programs address the immediate determinants of fetal and child nutrition and development-
     adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding, caregiving and parenting practices, and low burden of infectious diseases. Examples
     include: adolescent, preconception, and maternal health and nutrition; maternal dietary or micronutrient supplementation;
     promotion of optimum breastfeeding; complementary feeding and responsive feeding practices and stimulation; dietary
     supplementation; diversification and micronutrient supplementation or fortification for children; treatment of severe acute
     malnutrition; disease prevention and management; nutrition in emergencies. Nutrition-sensitive interventions and programs
     address the underlying determinants of fetal and child nutrition and development-food security; adequate caregiving resources
     at the maternal, household and community levels; and access to health services and a safe and hygienic environment-and
     incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Nutrition-sensitive programs can serve as delivery platforms for nutrition-specific
     interventions, potentially increasing their scale, coverage, and effectiveness. Examples include: agriculture and food security;
     social safety nets; early child development; maternal mental health; women’s empowerment; child protection; schooling; water,
     sanitation, and hygiene; health and family planning services.

      3	 Adequate care is defined as mother’s hand washing practices, and whether household is smoke free. For children zero to 23
         months of age it also includes immediate breastfeeding after birth, and age appropriate breastfeeding at the time of survey. For
         children six to eight month of age the additional component of the child receiving complementary feedings is also included
      4	 Adequate food is based on mother’s fruit and vegetable consumption. For children zero to five months of age it also includes
         exclusive breast feeding.
      5	 Access to adequate health is defined by mother having had at least four prenatal checkups, the birth was assisted by a skilled
         professional, the child was seen at a post-natal checkup, and the child’s immunizations are up to date. For children 7 to 35 months
         of age the additional condition of having received vitamin A supplementation is added.

   adequate food and nutrient intake, feeding, caregiving and parenting practices, and low burden of infectious diseases. Examples
   include: adolescent, preconception, and maternal health and nutrition; maternal dietary or micronutrient supplementation;
   promotion of optimum breastfeeding; complementary feeding and responsive feeding practices and stimulation; dietary
   supplementation; diversification and micronutrient supplementation or fortification for children; treatment of severe acute
   malnutrition; disease prevention and management; nutrition in emergencies. Nutrition-sensitive interventions and programs
   address the underlying determinants of fetal and child nutrition and development— food security; adequate caregiving resources
   at the maternal, household and community levels; and access to health services and a safe and hygienic environment—and
   incorporate specific nutrition goals and actions. Nutrition-sensitive programs can serve as delivery platforms for nutrition-specific
   interventions, potentially increasing their scale, coverage, and effectiveness. Examples include: agriculture and food security;
   social safety nets; early child development; maternal mental health; women’s empowerment; child protection; schooling; water,
   sanitation, and hygiene; health and family planning services.

higher stunting rate at the district level. Districts with
higher stunting rates receive slightly higher transfers

since the formula used to allocate grants to the districts
(DAU) takes into account the district’s poverty level as
well as other human development indicators.

Methodological
Framework
The conceptual framework summarized in Figure 5                            clusters: (a) inadequate household food security, (b)
views malnutrition as the consequence of a variety                         inadequate care and feeding practices, (c) unhealthy
of interlinked and interrelated events. The causes                         household environment, and (d) inadequate health
of malnutrition are classified into three hierarchical                     services. The basic causes of malnutrition summarize
categories: the immediate causes, the underlying                           the social, cultural, economic and political context
causes, and the basic causes of malnutrition. In any                       and the prevailing inequalities in the distribution

     of determinants of nutrition. In an effort to get more direct evidence on the presence of synergies, the
     following econometric specification (model B) can also be estimated
                          444

     where HAZi is the Height-for-Age Z-scores for the                          access (A=0) to cluster A, the expected height-for-age
     child i, and Ai denotes access to the four adequacies,                     for when the child does not have adequate access to
     for each child i. Namely, A1 is 1 when the household                       any of the four clusters is: 24
     is adequate in food and is 0 otherwise; A2 is 1
     when the household is adequate in environment                                E ( HAZi | A1 = 1, A2 = 0, A4 = 0, A4 = 0 ) = α
     and is 0 otherwise; A3 is 1 when the household is
     adequate in health and equals 0 otherwise; and, A4                         The coefficients βj yield estimates of the increase in

     otherwise. These binary variables are constructed                          access to adequate levels in one of the clusters only
     without any consideration to whether the child                             (or net of the potential gain in HAZ of having access
     has access to adequate levels in the other three                           to an adequate level in one or more of the other
     clusters. It is also important to keep in mind that                        clusters). That is:
     there are no additional control variables used in
     the regression because the objective here is simply                          E ( HAZi | A1 = 1, A2 = 0, A3 = 0, A4 = 0 ) = α + β1
     to compare mean values in HAZ among children in
                                                                                  E ( HAZi | A1 = 0, A2 = 1, A3 = 0, A4 = 0 ) = α + β2

     the extent to which they have access to one or more                          E ( HAZi | A1 = 0, A2 = 0, A3 = 1, A4 = 0 ) = α + β3

     In this specification the constant term α provides                         Specifically, the coefficient β1 yields an estimate
     an estimate of the mean value of HAZ scores for                            of the increase in the mean HAZ score of children

     on having adequate access (A=1) or inadequate                              (A4= 0). The coefficients β2 , β3 and β4 have analogous

    However, if some interaction terms are grouped together, such as including an indicator variable of whether or not the child is
    adequate in any three clusters, instead of including separately all four 3-way interaction terms, γjkm, then the correspondence
    between the coefficients in model A and B no longer holds.

Appendix E: An Analysis of Synergies using SUSENAS 2007
and 2013

For the following components (Food, Care, Health, and Environment) of adequacy, the individual dummies
are collapsed at district level. Then the threshold is set at median value of all districts. District adequacy
dummy equals 1 if mean of that particular district is above the median.

DISTRICT ADEQUACY DUMMY           DEFINITION
                                  Children who are:
                                  1.	 Under 6 months: are exclusively breastfed
                                  2.	 Between 6-23 months: are breastfed or formula-fed and having a Dietary
                                      Diversity Score (DDS)* of 4 or greater (see below for DDS definition)
                                  3.	 Between 24-59 months: having a DDS of 3 and above
Adequate in: Food
                                  However, the downside of this measure is: this measure only uses total
                                  consumption data, instead of calories intake (because SUSENAS 2007 and 2013
                                  do not provide such data).

                                  *See below for definition of Dietary Diversity Score
                                  Children who are:
                                  1.	 Under 6 months: are exclusively breastfed
                                  2.	 Above 6 months up to 59 months: are continued breastfed up to 24 months

                                  Adequate care excludes requirement for complementary feedings (solid/soft food)
                                  in this definition since the consumption of food data is HH consumption data and
Adequate in: Care                 hence assuming all HH member gets the same amount of consumption. This will
                                  then overestimate the number of children who are adequate in food and in care
                                  (as food consumption is part of each definition).

                                  In the end, all children will be assumed to have consumed solid food in the HH
                                  since there must have been some food eaten in the household by someone.
                                  Therefore, there will be no variation in the indicator.
                                  Children under 59 months who get complete vaccination* as required schedule
                                  and their births were assisted by health professionals.

                                DDS is a measure of the nutritional quality of the food consumed. In SUSENAS
                                2007 and 2013, we can only use total HH consumption as a proxy of DDS—
                                because SUSENAS in these years do not have information on HH calories
                                intake.

Dietary Diversity Score (DDS)   First off, the HH food consumption during the past week is grouped into: (1)
                                grains, roots and tubers; (2) legumes and nuts; (3) dairy products; (4) flesh
