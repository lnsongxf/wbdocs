Box 1. Sustainable Development Goals and Requirements for Global Indicators

Main Ideas
The Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are a new, post-2015 development framework, following the
Millennium Development Goals and building on the international agreement at the Rio+20 conference in 2012.
The SDGs aim to support a balanced economic, social, and environmental development agenda (table B1.1).

The need for developing a standard measurement system and the limitations of the current Rural Accessibility
Index (RAI) methodology are crucial to the current SDG discussion. Several proposed SDGs and targets are di-
rectly or indirectly relevant to rural accessibility and transport. For instance, Goal 2 aims to âend hunger, achieve
food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture,â and one of the targets (2.3) is to
âdouble the agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producersâ¦through secure and equal ac-
cess to... productive resources and inputs.â This clearly requires improved rural road access. The Partnership on
Sustainable Low Carbon Transport,a in working with the SDG Open Working Group, indicates the importance of
universal access to sustainable transport for rural populations and includes the RAI as one of the key indicators.b

Although it is not yet finalized, the RAI is proposed in the current draft indicator framework for the SDGs, as
indicator 9.1.1, under Target 9.1 âDevelop quality, reliable, sustainable and resilient infrastructure, includ-
ing regional and trans-border infrastructure, to support economic development and human well-being,
with a focus on affordable and equitable access for all.âc The inclusion of the RAI in the SDG indicators
underscores the importance of having a globally available and cross-country/regionally comparable measure
of transport access.

8   Measuring Rural Access: Using New Technologies




    Box 1. Sustainable Development Goals and Requirements for Globalâ¦                                                  (continued)


    As with several proposed indicators, as a global SDG indicator, the RAI suffers from a current lack of baseline
    data and reliable schedule for data updates. Establishing the RAI as a global indicator will require a methodol-
    ogy that is reliable, yet relatively simple and inexpensive to roll out across a broad country set. In addition to the
    issues discussed so far, two more factors are important to scale the eventual RAI output as a global indicator:
    frequency of updates and temporal tolerance of the data.

    Frequency of Update
    The development and updates of the indicator will rely on the underlying data sets, including population,
    road network, and road quality, which are often not updated on an annual basis. Road network data are fairly
    constant in the short to medium term. In addition, large road projects normally take three to five years. Thus,
    adding 50 or 100 km of new roads to the existing networkâwhich normally amounts to more than 10,000 km in
    a medium to large countryâdoes not have a large impact on the existing network data.

    Time variation may matter more for road quality data. Although some countries update data frequentlyânor-
    mally, once every two to three yearsâthis is not the case for other countries. For their operational purposes,
    however, many road agencies update their road quality data at least every four to five years. Thus, the developed
    indicator is not expected to be updated annually. When this program is rolled out globally, the team foresees a
    maximum duration of updates between two and five years in each country, depending on data availability.

    In developing countries, data on secondary, tertiary, and feeder roads (usually unpaved and the largest propor-
    tion of the road network) tend to be particularly limited. One reason is that while responsibility for primary or
    national roads is maintained at the national level, responsibility for rural roads is often devolved to the level of
    the district or municipality. Data on the roads under the national agency are collected in more detail and more
    regularly, and the roads are often in relatively good condition. However, the RAI is influenced more by the rural
    roads under devolved administrations, of which the monitoring and data capacity is often limited. Because of
    this multi-year update process, the expected RAI will not be available for all countries in any one year. Such a
    pattern is seen in many World Development Indicators, and is generally considered acceptable by the World
    Bankâs Development Research Group for global indicators.

    Temporal Tolerance of Data Sets
    Because of the lack of annual availability of the underlying data sets, several or all of the data sets may not be
    matched by year. For instance, road quality data might be available only for 2013 in a particular country, while some
    of the population data are only available for 2010 or 2015. Some judgment is needed at the country level to mitigate
    the impact of using different data sources in different years. A rule of thumb is that a more stable data set should
    be used with more flexibility. For instance, a national rural roads program could dramatically improve the quality of
    roads in a certain locality in a relatively short term, while population data are fairly stable over five years. In such a
    case, the road quality data would be considered as an anchor, with the closest or adjusted population data applied.

    aâ The Partnership on Sustainable Low Carbon Transport (SLoCaT) is a multi-stakeholder partnership of more than 80 organizations

    including United Nations organizations, multilateral and bilateral development organizations, nongovernmental organizations and
    foundations, academia, and the business sector, which promotes the integration of sustainable transport in global policies on sus-
    tainable development and climate change.
    bâ See SLoCaT (2014). The Results Framework not only includes the traditional RAI measure (2 km from an all-season road), but also

    proposes to measure the proportion of rural population living within a 30 minute walk of formal or informal transport services, call-
    ing for the use of geographic information system data.
    câ In preparation for the 47th session of the United Nations Statistical Commission, the SDG Indicator working group prepared a

    discussion document, including a draft SDG indicator framework. In this document, the RAI, and specifically the âshare of the rural
    population who live within 2 km of an all-season road,â is included under Goal 9.

     A previously conducted pilot, undertaken by the World Bankâs Agriculture Global Practice, utilized geographic
     information system data to estimate the share of the rural population living within four hours of an urban center
     in Kazakhstan (map B2.1). This is a useful benchmark to facilitate more commercialized agriculture and is sup-
     ported by empirical evidence from the country.

     Access to markets is critical for farmers and agribusinesses, with the availability of infrastructure, such as roads
     and transport services, as a fundamental enabling factor for farmers to reach urban markets. The growth in
     demand for food in urban markets around the world is providing increased opportunities for commercial small-
     holders, and agricultural productivity needs to increase to supply these growth centers. Agricultural production
     and yields are found to be positively correlated with proximity to urban centers.

     Agricultural production is highly correlated with proximity to urban markets, as measured by travel time.
     Maximum productivity was found to be reached between three and four hours of travel time to an urban mar-
     ket. Within four hours travel time, producers achieved 45 percent of their production potential, but at eight
     hours they were only achieving 5 percent of their production potential in Mozambique (Dorosh et al. 2010). In
     Madagascar, rice yields hold up well between 0.9 and 3.4 hours of travel to a major city, but then start to fall
     precipitously, so that by 8.9 hours farmer yields are reduced by 45 percent (Stifel and Minten 2008). In Peru, farm
     labor productivity and rural income increased when journey times to the nearest city from rural areas dropped
     from nine hours to just under four hours (Webb 2013).

   Box 3. Accessibility Measurement in Nepal

   The Government of Nepal uses an âaccessibility indexâ to measure peopleâs accessibility and address pov-
   erty and social exclusion. In Nepal, about 23 million people, or 82 percent of the total population, are es-
   timated to live in rural areas (United Nations 2014). The calculation of accessibility is based on an analysis
   of population distribution, the extent of the all-weather road network, and calculations of the walk-time to
   access the road network. Because of the highly mountainous topology in the Hills area, the time band is
   targeted at four hours. In the Terai area, accessibility is measured by the population within two hours of a
   qualified road.

   Based on the governmentâs definition, which is different from the RAI in the current work, it is estimated that
   accessibility has been improved from 78 percent in 2007 to 86 percent in 2013 (table B3.1). However, it cannot
   be overemphasized that the definitions are different. In addition, the share of the road network for which the
   Department of Roads is responsible has been expanded considerably, from an operational strategic road net-
   work of 5,030 km in 2007 to a proposed extent of about 10,000 km. Thus, regardless of actual improvements
   of the road network, âaccessibilityâ will increase. Yet, all the indications are that peopleâs accessibility differs
   greatly across the country, and people have better access in the Terai region (map B3.1).

Box 4. Market Access and Crop Productivity in Tanzania

Although its relative importance may have declined in many economies, agriculture is still key to stimulate sus-
tainable economic growth and reduce poverty in many African countries. Access to input and output markets
is a challenge for many farmers. Guo, Koo, and Wood (2009) combine various spatial data, such as land cover,
road network, and land slope, and estimate transport costs to markets in Tanzania (map B4.1). Given the fact
that most fertilizer is imported from abroad, farm-gate prices are calculated using estimated transport costs
from the ports (map B4.2). For maize, farm-gate output prices are also calculated (map B4.3). It is clear that
farm-gate prices of maize are inversely proportional to transport costs to market.

     Box 5. Road Mapping with High-Resolution Satellite Imagery

     High-resolution satellite imagery has the potential to establish road inventory and condition data, although
     costs may vary, depending on the availability and quality of the satellite imagery and size of the areas to be
     covered.a This method is advantageous because it can be applied anywhere on the globe, even where actual
     data collection is difficult on the ground because of geographic or security reasons.

     In Nigeria there was a pilot study to examine the technical feasibility of satellite mapping of the road network
     and conditions. The study focused on Kano State, an arid and semi-desert area in the northern part of the
     country (map B5.1). With a variety of satellite imagery, including SpotMaps derived from Spot 6/7 at 1.5 meter
     resolution, 1 meter optical imagery originally collected to support a polio vaccination program, and Pleiades

   The study clearly demonstrates the feasibility to identify road inventory and structures, such as bridges and
   culverts, if the quality of high-resolution satellite imagery is sufficient (photo B5.2). Road conditions can also be
   predicted through examining the edge condition of a road, uniformity of road color, and extent of road wind-

     Box 6. Collecting Road Data with Drones

     Drones have been shown to be able to provide valuable data on road quality. According to a recent study by
     the Department of Transportation in the United States, the latest drone technology can identify road surface
     distress with 93 percent accuracy (photo B6.1). Of course, the level of achievable accuracy depends on various
     factors, such as imaging technology, cruising speed and coverage (which differ significantly between fixed wing
     and rotary systems), and geoprocessing software (Brooks et al. 2014).

     The opportunity to use drone technology has been explored in developing countries. In the Philippines,
     for example, a World Bankâsupported Rural Development Program utilized drones, in conjunction with
     OpenStreetMap to generate information about road segments and help prioritize work for unmapped roads
     (photo B6.2).

     As technical applicability is rapidly expanding, it is becoming increasingly important to clarify institutional
     issues, such as licensing, intellectual property, and standards. Many developing countries have not yet estab-
     lished the regulations and requirements for overseeing the use of drones in their airspace, raising the potential
     for safety concerns. With those institutional issues solved, the potential value of drone technology may increase
     rapidly as a tool to collect precise data remotely.

     Box 8. Roughness Index and Other Road Condition Measurements

     There are several measurements to assess road condition. Different measurements have different advantages
     and disadvantages. Some are more consistent and objective than others. Since road condition is measured by
     different factors, for instance, not only road surface but also the condition of structures (such as bridges), com-
     prehensiveness and aggregation are also issues.

     The International Roughness Index (IRI) is among the most commonly used measurements. It is normally closely
     related to pavement strength, which is traditionally measured by pavement structural number. The structural
     number depends on parameters representing the strength of pavement materials and layers and drainage
     characteristics. It is fundamental data used for road planning and maintenance.

     Theoretically, all these measurements should be consistent with one another. In practice, however, there can be
     some discrepancy. In Mozambique, there has been concern about road deterioration in recent years, although
                                                               the official road network is generally well maintained.

     Box 9. âNaiveâ Modeling Approach

     Although a variety of new cost-effective technologies are available, a significant challenge may still exist in
     collecting georeferenced road condition data in developing countries. Smartphone applications, such as
     Roadroid and RoadLab, are cost-effective for collecting roughness data quickly. Drone and satellite imagery
     technologies also have potential. It cannot be overemphasized that technology is always evolving and costs
     could be reduced dramatically.

     For rough calculation purposes or at a highly aggregated level, it is possible to establish a statistical model to
     predict the Rural Access Index (RAI) with only general statistics of demographics and road network characteris-
     tics (but not georeferenced road data). The RAI differs from location to location. But there are some common
     determinants of the index, partly because of the way it is defined and partly because of the general patterns of
     human settlement and road network developments.

Box 9. âNaiveâ Modeling Approach                              (continued)


With subnational RAI estimates in eight countries, the RAI is regressed on a set of demographic and road char-
acteristics at the subnational level:

        ln RAIic = Î²0 + Î²1 ln RdDenic + Î²2 ln Qualityic + Î²3 ln PopDenic + Î²4 ln PopConcic + Î²5 ln Urbanic + vc + Îµic

where RAI is the rural access measured at district i of country c. It is determined by road density, RdDen, and the
share of good roads in the total road length in rural areas, denoted by Quality. Only rural areas are considered
in the data. The RAI is also considered to be related to rural population density (PopDen). It is commonly ex-
pected that the RAI would be higher where population density is high, although it depends on the population
distribution between near-road and far-road areas, which is expected to be captured by population concentra-
tion along the road network, PopConc. This is defined by the share of people who live within 2 kilometers of
the road network in the total rural population. Urban is the usual urbanization rate, which is the share of urban
population in the total population.

The results suggest that rural access is related to road density and road condition (table B9.1). The measured
RAI is also affected by the population distribution patterns, more specifically, by the share of people living along
the road network, not general population density. The model explains nearly 90 percent of the variation of RAI.
Of course, this merely shows correlation, not causality. But for prediction purposes, rough estimates can be
computed based on the model with the above-mentioned variables.

     Box AII.1. Techniques to Disaggregate Population

     Areal weighting assumes that the population is uniformly distributed within each administrative unit. The pop-
     ulation assigned to a grid cell is simply the total population of the administrative unit divided by the number of
     cells in the administrative unit. Every grid cell of an administrative unit has therefore the same population value.
     This method was used to construct the Gridded Population of the World (GPW) database, versions 2 and 3.

     Pycnophylactic interpolation starts with the areal weighted method, but smoothes the population values
     using the weighted average of nearest neighbors, while preserving the summation of population data to the
     original population per areal unit. Pycnophylactic interpolation was used to generate GPW version 1.

     Dasymetric modeling involves using ancillary dataâoften this may include satellite derived land cover dataâ
     to redistribute populations within administrative units. Weightings are attributed to the different land cover
     classes and the population is redistributed accordingly. For example, the Global Rural Urban Mapping Project
     uses a similar approach to GPW, but incorporates urban-rural extents and their corresponding populations in
     the spatial reallocation of census counts.

     Smart interpolation, a more sophisticated modeling approach, involves modeling the finescale distribution of
     populations using a range of satellite and other ancillary data. For example, an accessibility surface developed
     from road networks and populated places can be used to redistribute people, as was done in the construction
     of the Unite Nations Environment Programme database. The LandScan data set is another example of smart
     interpolation, where various ancillary data such as roads, slope, land cover, and nighttime lights are used to
     determine the probability of population occurrence in cells.

are paved, and the rest are mostly earth roads.

Classification and Standards
The Roads and Highways Department is responsible for
the major road and bridge network of Bangladesh. It
currently supervises just over 21,302 km, 8,000 of which
are national and regional highways and the rest district
roads. The remaining subdistrict, union, and village roads
are under the management of the Local Government
Engineering Department (LGED), comprising more than
300,000 km.

Data Issues and Assumptions
Road location and quality data for the Roads and
Highways Department and LGED maintained roads
were obtained from LGED. Road location data are avail-
able for about 269,000 km, with extremely dense cov-
erage across the country. Road quality is in principle

     available for most of the paved road network with the
     International Roughness Index (IRI). However, there are
     several duplicated data entries and contradictory infor-
     mation in the currently available data. Most of the dupli-
     cations were corrected, but road condition information
     may still be incorrect. The corrected data are being clari-
     fied with LGED.

     For unpaved roads, there is no quality data. There are
     more than 135,000 km of unpaved roads in the available
     georeferenced road data (c.f., 220,000 km of unpaved
     roads according to the government road statistics).
     These roads are not taken into account in the RAI calcu-
     lation. Notably, however, since density of the road net-
     work with roughness data is already high, a significant
     portion of the countryâs land area is covered regardless
     of the unpaved road network.

     Using a distribution based on WorldPop (2010 edition),
     urban areas are excluded based on 1995 University

of land, which is near the regional average, and com-
pares favorably with some of the neighboring coun-
tries (9.8 in Tanzania) and less so with others (70 in
Uganda). Generally, the length and coverage of the of-
ficial road network is sufficient to provide basic regional
and national connectivity. Still, only about 11,200 km or
6.9 percent of the total roads are paved. Paved roads are
mostly in good or fair condition. But road maintenance
remains a challenge in many areas, with 25 percent of
secondary roads and 40 percent of tertiary roads in
poor condition.

Classification and Standards
According to the Kenya Roads Act of 2007, there are
three national institutions: the Kenya National Highways
Authority is responsible for international and national
trunk roads, as well as the primary roads (Classes A, B, and
C, respectively); Kenya Rural Roads Authority is respon-
sible for secondary and minor roads (Classes D and E)
and other roads; and the Kenya Urban Roads Authority is
responsible for urban roads. Kenyaâs 2010 constitutional
devolution delineates roads as either national or county.
While the national government is responsible for Class A,
70   Measuring Rural Access: Using New Technologies




     The last available road condition data are from 2009.
     As per this data, about 18,094 km of roads or about
     11.2 percent of total roads are considered in excellent or
     good condition, 52,026 km or 32.3 percent in fair condi-
     tion, and the rest in poor or very bad condition.

     Data Issues and Assumptions
     Using a distribution based on WorldPop (2010 edition),
     urban areas are excluded based on 1995 University of
     Columbia (CIESIN) urban area imagery, and the rural
     population in 2010 is calculated at 30.3 million. While
     RAI can be calculated at the more granular district level,
     it is estimated at the county level, which is informative
     enough in the case of Kenya. Current district boundaries
     are still in flux.

     Estimated Rural Access Index
     The national RAI is estimated at 56.8 percent, leaving
     about 13.4 million rural residents unconnected to roads
     in good or reasonably fair condition.

     The RAI was found to be generally high around Nairobi
     and Lake Victoria, where populations are concentrated.       large urban areas, such as Mombasa and Nairobi (88

     Data Issues and Assumptions
     Using the IRI and SCI, 18,296 km of roads are considered
     to be in good or fair condition. There are about 2,700 km
     of roads for which no quality data are available. These are
     likely to be the segments that were not passable during
     the last road quality survey. Their road condition is as-

     urban areas are excluded based on 1995 University of

     Estimated Rural Access Index
     The national RAI is estimated at 20.4 percent, leaving
     about 15.0 million rural residents unconnected to the

Classification and Standards
According to the Zambia Public Roads Act No. 12 of
2002, the RDA is responsible for ensuring that the core
road network is kept in maintainable condition. The CRN
is composed of the trunk, main, district, urban, and pri-
mary feeder roads. Trunk roads function as international
highways, of which the total length is about 3,100 km.
Main roads connect district centers to the trunk road
network, and amount to about 3,700 km. Most of them
are paved and kept in good or fair condition. District
roads connect district centers within the country (about
13,000 km). More than three-quarters are unpaved and
