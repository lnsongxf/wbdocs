     Public(Private Partnerships Focus on Sustainable Agriculture in Vietnam9

     The PublicTPrivate Task Force on Sustainable Agriculture in Vietnam was formed in May 2010
     at the World Economic Forum on East Asia in Ho Chi Minh City. CoTchaired by the Minister
     of Agriculture and Rural Development, the task force comprises 17 global and four local
     companies, two provincial governments, a na^onal research ins^tute, two interna^onal
     organiza^ons, and Uve NGOs. The mul^Tstakeholder partnership focuses on Uve crops
     (coee, corn, soybean, tea, and fruits and vegetables) deUned as strategic priori^es in
     Vietnam’s na^onal plan, and has mobilized working groups and pilots for each. In November
     2011, the Government of Vietnam ra^Ued adop^on of the World Economic Forum’s New
     Vision for Agriculture (NVA) framework into the country’s 10Tyear na^onal agriculture
     strategy, integra^ng a new dimension of environmental sustainability into Vietnam’s
     longTterm aspira^ons.

     "Government and business share the same goal: we both want to see strong and sustainable
     growth in Vietnam’s agriculture sector," said Cao Duc Phat, Minister of Agriculture and Rural
     Development. "We have iden6'ed a number of ways in which we can work together more
     eec6vely towards that goal."

     "Growing Asian demand for food means we must increase both produc6on and quality to
     meet that growth while opera6ng within the constraints of climate change. If companies
     combine eorts with the government and each other, we can operate more eec6vely along
     the full value chain," said Frans Muller, Member of the Management Board, METRO Group
     and CoTChair, World Economic Forum on East Asia.10

     The government has placed a high priority on industrializa^on and moderniza^on of rural
     agriculture, seng a target of 3.5 percent annual growth in the sector un^l 2020. Private
     sector investment is seen as cri^cal to achieving that target. Par^cipa^ng companies include
     Archer Daniels Midland (ADM), Bunge, Cargill, Dupont, METRO Group, Monsanto, Nestlé,
     PepsiCo, Swiss Re, Syngenta, Unilever, and Yara Interna^onal.

   MicroEnsure’s Entrance into Zambia’s Rural Microinsurance Market11

   In 2014, MicroEnsure – a large global microinsurance company – began serving the Zambian
   market with its FarmerShield life and weather insurance product in partnership with NWK
   Agriservices. NWK is an agribusiness that operates a co2on outTgrower program that
   engages 100,000 smallholder farmers and has diversiUed into input distribu^on and
   commodity storage and trading. Faced with famer loyalty and sideTselling problems, NWK
   partnered with MicroEnsure to oLer weather index and life insurance to its farmers. The
   companies planned to build weather sta^ons across Zambia to record weather events, but
   faced with high construc^on and opera^on costs, decided to use satellite imaging to monitor
   regional weather. Prior to its Urst season of opera^on in 2013T2014, 6,610 farmers signed
   up for weather index insurance, covering 7,600 hectares.

   This par^cular weather index product was designed so that beneUts payouts were modeled
   on the impact of various clima^c events, such as drought or .oods, on co2on yields. Data
   was collected at a local level and beneUts were automa^cally paid out if the weather event
   crossed the predetermined level of severity.

   In 2014, weather events triggered $42,000 of payouts, thus demonstra^ng the value of the
   product in its Urst season. Further, the FarmerShield life insurance product covered 25,165
   farmers’ lives who paid a total of $5,536 for coverage. The net loss ra^o for this product
   was 48 percent, which is a posi^ve outcome for a life microinsurance product. It a2racted
   even further demand from farmers to cover addi^onal lives in their households. As a result
   of this coverage, farmers valued both the weather index and life insurance products and
   appreciated both direct (for example, claim payouts) and indirect (for example, integra6on
   into the value chain) beneUts of the insurance products. NWK no^ced a posi^ve impact on
   its business with increased deliveries and reduced sideTselling (pending 'nal conclusions of
   this pilot study and the products are expected to be sustainable and proUtable for the
   insurers and reinsurers. From the ini^al product with NWK Agriservices, MicroEnsure is
   diversifying its product oLerings to rural Zambians, which is vital for the development of
   rural Zambian Unancial markets.

RESOURCES AND TIMING
FIs cannot simply jump into the Urst phase of
the product development process. Before
beginning Phase 1, each FI should hold a
workshop with its board and senior managers
to discuss the ra^onale for agricultural lending.
During this workshop, management should
discuss the levels of market demand for the
new product, the government policies related
to the sector, the ins^tu^onal environment,
and ins^tu^onal skills and capabili^es. This
preliminary step should take no more than a
few days provided suCcient background inforT
ma^on is available.

    Vietnamese Banks Work to Expand Rural Lending

    In 2013, IFC inves^gated Unancing opportuni^es to farmers and agricultural enterprises.
    The team iden^Ued three regions in Vietnam (Red River Delta, Central highlands, and
    Mekong Delta), which have signiUcant poten^al for agricultural produc^on. A-er analyzing
    the principal crops, total area planted, and produc^on volume, the team narrowed down
    the regions, and conducted detailed value chain analyses in two regions: the Central HighT
    lands and Mekong Delta. IFC Team visited several districts in each region and interviewed
    farmers producing diLerent crops and other value chain players by size (small, medium, and
    large). The team inves^gated both perennial crops (tea, coee, rubber, pepper, and cashew)
    as well as seasonal crops (rice, maize, and vegetables). It also studied livestock (Ca	le, pigs,
    and poultry).

    The team found that the percentage of land used for agricultural, and the diversity of crops,
    were key indicators of the agricultural Unance poten^al in the region. In the Central High
    Lands, the use of land for agriculture was between 15 and 38 percent. In rela^on to the
    poten^al demand for loans, there were approximately 450,000 farmers in the region, of
    which 86 percent owned less than 2 hectares. Nonetheless 10 to 15 percent of small farmers
    rented addi^onal land for produc^on, which showed the strong demand that existed for
    their products.

    With these Ugures, together with a preliminary analysis of the private sector, the team
    concluded that the value chain actors in the Dak Lak region of the Central Highlands oLered
    more opportuni^es to diversify the loan por1olio. This would help banks be2er mi^gate
    agricultural and market risks.

Target Client EvaluaCon for Farmers in Vietnam

As part of an agricultural lending market research eLort, IFC evaluated in Vietnam the risk
levels of farmers in some promising agricultural regions to understand the produc^on cycle,
distribu^on channels, and main challenges faced by them. The team asked farmers to deUne
the criteria used to classify small, medium, and large farmers in the surrounding area, and
es^mate the percentage of farmers that would fall under each category. Finally, the team
asked farmers to select nine farmers to be interviewed, three farmers per each category (small,
medium, and large). They asked about employment numbers and inves^gated whether the
farmers planted any addi^onal crops besides coLee on their farms (see table 4).

The team found that large farmers operated on average 10 HA of land or more (owned or
rented), medium size farmers operated on 2 to 9 HA, and small farmers operated on 1 HA
or less. The next step in the evalua^on consisted of looking at the balance sheets of each
farmer. The team evaluated assets – including a breakdown of current assets (for example,
working capital and inventory) and Uxed assets (for example, irriga6on systems, equipment
and house) – as well as liabili^es and equity. The team also constructed simple income
statements to see how much each farmer made and when they received payment for their
goods (see table 5).

The diLerences are important when comparing yearly income because there is a very
healthy income mix of onTfarm and oLTfarm income, par^cularly for large and mediumTsized
farmers. The large farmer with 20 HA of coLee and 3.5 HA of pepper generates a total net
income of $121,220. This farmer also has an oLTfarm income of $26,300 from an agricultural
inputs store, coLee trading, and interest rates from small loans made to local farmers.

On the other side, the small farmer only has income from coLee and a secondary income
from fruits. His yearly net income is approximately $3,770 from both ac^vi^es. The small
farmer needs to work as an agricultural worker to complement his farm income to cover all
family expenses.

Next, the team evaluated the Unancial demand of each farmer type and inves^gated what
aspects of a loan were a2rac^ve to each prospec^ve client (see table 6).

In the communi^es visited, farmers es^mated that 5 percent of the total farming popula^on
were large farmers who had more than 10 HA of land; 25 percent were medium farmers
with 2 to 9 HA of land; and, 70 percent were small farmers with 1 HA of land or less. In the
hypothe^cal case that the bank would target 30 percent of the total number of large and
medium farmers in the region, the team es^mated they could reach 1,300 large and 6,000
medium farmers. The por1olio growth poten^al in 3T5 years for lowTrisk farmers (large and
medium farmers) could reach $15.6 million and $39 million respec^vely. This preliminary
calcula^on shows promising business opportuni^es for the bank in the region.

    Risk Level EvaluaCon of Farmers in Vietnam

    To determine risk levels of farmers in the evalua^on above, the team studied the results of
    the evalua^on and summarized the Undings in a table that clustered farmers by risk proUle.
    Table 7 displays farmer risk proUles in the Central Highlands. Poultry and egg producers in
    the region produced good volumes, generated strong cash .ows, and had monthly incomes
    enabling them to pay monthly installments. These producers had good technical skill levels
    and secure access to markets. The coLee and pepper farmers had diversiUed produc^on
    and mul^ple incomes throughout the year. Both crops had strong demand in interna^onal
    markets and prices were trending upward. These farmers applied good agricultural prac^ces.
    Finally, the team found that rubber producers were the riskiest, par^cularly because of the
    excessive specializa^on and lack of alterna^ve crops. Addi^onally, producers in the region
    had a limited number of interested buyers. Even though rubber trees can generate income
    during eight months of the year once in full produc^on, it takes seven years for rubber trees
    to reach full produc^on capacity.

   Business Case and ProjecCons for a Financial InsCtuCon in Indonesia

   from an Indonesian bank decided to focus on Unancing egg, poultry, and dairy producers to

   decided to wait before focusing on vegetables and corn, which are very dynamic sectors
   but which generate more seasonal incomes. To gain management buy in, the team
   presented informa^on explaining the market poten^al and then described the risks associT

one loan disbursed per month per LO during the Urst Uve months of the pilot; two loans
disbursed per month per LO from months six to 12; and, three loans disbursed per month
per LO from months 13 to 18. The table below shows projected produc^vity per LO at the

Phase 4 Featured PracCcal Example: Pilo^ng challenges at an East Asian FI.


   East Asia Bank Faces Challenges when PiloCng Agricultural Lending

   IFC worked with a bank in East Asia that was rolling out an agricultural lending pilot. The
   bank piloted the product over the course of one year, using three agricultural lending
   oCcers. These oCcers were able to disburse a total of 67 loans represen^ng about
   $450,000. The bank experienced a wide variability in disbursements of loans each month,
   but learned a lot about their target clients through the process. For the next year of the
   pilot process, the bank plans that each loan oCcer will disburse an average of three to four
   loans per month totaling about $11,000. A-er the ini^al 24 months, the ideal loan oCcer
   will manage a por1olio of about 100 outstanding loans worth $300,000. During the last year
   of the pilot, this total should climb to 160 loans worth $480,000. The bank plans to achieve
   a nonTperforming loan rate of less than 3 percent a-er two years and less than 4 percent
   a-er the third year. There will be two specialized agricultural loan oCcers per branch for
   the rollout phase.

   Overall, the bank has found that the pilot implementa^on process was slower than originally
   planned, preven^ng the team from mee^ng original targets. The pilot team encountered
   the following key challenges:

       •   Limited analy^cal skills of loans oCcers, which slowed their learning process and
           produc^vity

       •   InsuCcient and unstructured marke^ng ac^vi^es

       •   Lack of monitoring and followTup a-er marke^ng mee^ngs with farmer associa^ons

       •   Ini^al low quality and accuracy of data collected, which required mul^ple visits to
           the clients to clean and clarify the data

       •   Inadequate availability of vehicles to visit farmers and clients in rural areas slowed
           down marke^ng ac^vi^es.

   As a result of these challenges, the bank decided to standardize and document the processes
   for preTselec^on of clients to reduce loan processing ^mes. It also updated its recommended
   proUle for hiring agricultural loans oCcers, ensuring that they do have agricultural
   backgrounds and stronger analy^cal skills. The bank is implemen^ng a structured marke^ng
   plan that will be used during the rollout phase.

    CollaboraCon between Banks, Rice Mills, and Rice Farmers in the Mekong Delta Region

    Rice processors, in the Mekong Delta region of Vietnam, are engaged with farmers to
    diLering degrees. Some processors have built shortTterm rela^onships based on price
    opportuni^es, while others provide more integral support to farmers by supplying cer^Ued
    seeds and fer^lizers, and then purchasing all the produc^on via contract farming. FIs have
    mul^ple advantages when working with such players. This guide encourages FIs to iden^fy
    and select value chain players for costTeLec^ve collabora^on.

    In the Mekong Delta the team interviewed two large processors who trade more than
    200,000 tons of rice per year. These are local companies, using diLerent strategies to
    collaborate with farmers. The Urst one uses contract farming and preTUnances seeds and
    fer^lizer to farmers specializing in Jasmine rice for export, while the second company
    produces tradi^onal rice for the domes^c market (see table 13).

The two large rice processing plants Unance a signiUcant number of farmers T 6,000 and 500
respec^vely T with an outstanding por1olio of approximately $36 million and $250,000.
Both companies are interested in collabora^ng with FIs to provide addi^onal Unancing to
farmers. The Urst company could Unance 1,000 addi^onal farmers with a bank’s support,
while the second company could add 500 addi^onal farmers. Given the diLerent strategies
these companies employ to interact with local farmers, they approach addi^onal Unancing
opportuni^es in diLerent ways. The Urst company is interested in preselec^ng farmers. It
will help the bank organize the groups to market the products, provide technical supervision
to farmers, and later, support the bank with reten^on and collec^on of loans. The other
rice processor is more interested in geng a loan from the bank to onTlend those funds to
the farmers, assuming 100 percent of the risks. In fact, this company does not want the
bank to lend directly to its farmers.

With these two strategies in mind, local FIs could approach each company and structure
appropriate models to suit their needs. These two rice producers are examples of the types
of Urms FIs should seek out when building agricultural lending por1olios. FIs new to
agricultural lending can adapt and adjust their strategies to accommodate this type of
partnership.

Phase 5 Featured PracCcal Example: Introduc^on of agricultural lending at a Cambodian FI.


     Cambodian Financial InsCtuCon Develops Agricultural Lending21

     A Unancial ins^tu^on partnered with the World Bank’s Agriculture Finance Support Facility
     to develop agricultural lending skills, design new loan products to respond to farmers with
     larger Unancing needs, and enhance service delivery to reach remote rural popula^ons.

     The FI established an agricultural lending unit at the beginning of the project within its credit
     department. It was faced with the challenge of Unding quality loan staL that understood
     agriculture. The FI decided to Ull key posi^ons in the unit with internally recruited personnel
     specialized in product development and lending, who were subsequently trained in
     agriculture. The ins^tu^on also decided to use exis^ng lending staL, many of whom had
     already been lending to agricultural clients, but lacked agricultural exper^se. To address
     this, the FI appointed two permanent trainers within the unit to train and coach lending
     staL at the branch level during the product pilot stage on how to lend to agricultural clients.
     Another eight trainers coached staL during the rollout stage. Also, an agricultural expert
     was recruited to provide sector exper^se and manage the FI’s rela^onship with agricultural
     value chain partners. The new unit directed and managed the expansion of agricultural
     lending, taking responsibility for product design, staL training, and development and
     implementa^on of agricultural lending guidelines, policies, and procedures.

     Previously, the FI had                   Figure 14 – Growth of the FI's Agricultural

     growing demand for larger
     loans among farmers not served by other Unancial ins^tu^ons in Cambodia. With the launch
     of the new product, the average agricultural loan was approximately $6,000, compared to
     the average microloan of $1,300. The new loan provides .exible repayment terms in line
     with farmers’ seasonal cash in.ows. Interest on the new loan product is on average 0.10
     percent lower than microloans. The product was piloted gradually in 14 branches in various

   parts of Cambodia and the na^onwide rollout is now taking place. Loans are disbursed by
   specialized credit oCcers trained on the new cash .owTbased lending methodology. As of
   October 2014, the new loans amounted to $11.6 million (equivalent to 4 percent of the FI’s
   total loan porolio).

   As in similar markets, Cambodian FIs have a limited presence in rural areas since the low
   popula^on density does not jus^fy the cost of running a branch network. Hence, the FI
   needed to Und a costTeLec^ve means of reaching rural clients. To achieve this, the FI took
   advantage of Cambodia’s high mobile phone penetra^on to launch a pilot mobile banking
   service with mobile tellers—the FI’s Ueld oCce employees who visit rural clients to facilitate
   Unancial transac^ons. Currently, such transac^ons are limited to deposits, withdrawals, new
   savings accounts, and account balance conUrma^on. However, the bank plans to include
   other services, including loan applica^ons. The transac^ons are completed using 3GT
   equipped smartphones. Clients receive an SMS conUrming comple^on of the transac^on.

introducing agricultural lending in the FI. It should be used to summarize results of the
industry and compe^tor assessment, market demand, and organiza^onal readiness.

The project team should Ull in the ins^tu^onal diagnos^c as it goes through the relevant steps in
Phases 1 and 2, adding addi^onal informa^on as the project proceeds. This template should be
used only as a guide. It is best to include as much informa^on as possible, so the project team
