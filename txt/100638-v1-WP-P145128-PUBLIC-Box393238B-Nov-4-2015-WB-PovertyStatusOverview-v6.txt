AFGHANISTAN’S POVERTY CHALLENGE: STRONG
GROWTH; PERSISTENT POVERTY
STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH IN AFGHANISTAN DURING THE PRE-TRANSITION
PERIOD (2007-08 TO 2011-12) HAS NOT REDUCED POVERTY. Afghanistan’s per
capita GDP grew at an average annual rate of 6.9 percent during that period. In
contrast, in 2007-08, 36 percent of Afghans were poor, and four years later, still, more
than one in three Afghans did not have the buying power to satisfy their basic food and
non-food needs.

Economic growth in Afghanistan, therefore, is not in and of itself enough to reduce
poverty. To achieve poverty reduction, economic growth needs to be far more
inclusive for everyone, regardless of their circumstances.

PATTERNS OF GROWTH CONTRIBUTED TO WIDENING INEQUALITY. Average
per capita consumption grew at an annual rate of 1.2 percent between 2007-08 and
2011-12, but this did not benefit everyone equally, and inequality increased. While
the poorest 20 percent of the population saw a 2 percent decline in real per capita
expenditure, the richest 20 percent experienced a nine percent increase. Widening
inequalities are reflected in an increase of the Gini index, which moved from 29.7 in
2007-08 to 31.6 percent in 2011-12.


PROFILE OF AFGHANISTAN’S POOR: RURAL,
AGRICULTURAL, UNDEREMPLOYED, AND HIGHLY
VULNERABLE
Although it is not possible to determine if the same individuals who were poor in
2007-08 were still poor in 2011-12, the data shows that the characteristics of the
poor did not change.

POVERTY IN AFGHANISTAN STRONGLY CORRELATES TO WHERE PEOPLE
LIVE. Four out of every five poor people live in rural areas. The mountainous
East, Northeast, and West-Central regions—where almost half of the inhabitants
are poor—have the lowest per capita consumption and highest likelihood
of poverty.

LACK OF EDUCATION, LIVELIHOOD, AND LACK OF ACCESS TO BASIC SERVICES
CLEARLY CONTRIBUTE TO AFGHAN POVERTY. Poor people tend to be illiterate
(75.6 percent), and often lack opportunities to educate their children. Poor people
face higher unemployment1 (8 percent) or are underemployed (41 percent), and
when they are employed, they are more likely to have a vulnerable and informal
job (84.3 percent), most likely in agriculture (43.6 percent). Poor people are much
less likely to have access to basic services such as electricity (63.8 percent), safe
drinking water (40.3 percent), and sanitation (2.8 percent).

	In Afghanistan, as in most developing countries, labor is the most critical asset for poor households. For individuals living in
1

 poorer households, being engaged in some sort of income generating activity is a necessity to make ends meet. Poverty,
 together with the widespread availability of poor quality jobs in the informal sector make open unemployment a typically
 rare phenomenon. The relatively low level of open unemployment is counterbalanced by the severity of underemployment.

POVERTY IN AFGHANISTAN IS CLOSELY INTERTWINED WITH NATURAL AND
MANMADE RISKS. The poor in Afghanistan are not only more likely to suffer from
shocks, but also less equipped to deal with their consequences. Approximately
84 percent of Afghan households experienced at least one economic shock in
2011-12, and 53 percent suffered from three or more. Due to mountainous terrain,
poor connectivity and greater reliance on subsistence and rain-fed agriculture, the
poorest regions in the East, Northeast and West-Central are particularly exposed
and vulnerable to shocks, especially natural hazards. Poor households are more
likely to deal with risks using harmful coping mechanisms that may be necessary in
the short term, but that can have greater long-term negative impacts, reducing the
likelihood of escaping from poverty2.


INTERNATIONAL SPENDING: AN EFFECTIVE
DRIVER OF GROWTH, BUT GAINS NOT
DISTRIBUTED EQUALLY
Although International spending on military and civilian assistance has contributed
to economic growth, the gains have not benefitted Afghanistan’s employment
sectors and regions equally, nor have they reached the poorest.

INTERNATIONAL SPENDING CONTRIBUTED TO GROWTH AND JOB CREATION
IN THE SERVICE SECTOR. However, while service sector growth contributed
to creating good quality jobs, especially in government, health, and education
services, 80 percent of new jobs were in informal day labor arrangements. Due
to a lack of education, the poor could not compete for these jobs, and moved
from vulnerable employment in agriculture to vulnerable employment in the
service sector.

On the other hand, AID DID NOT CONTRIBUTE TO RAISING PR ODUCTI VIT Y
O F T HE AGRICULTURE SECTOR, where most of the poor find employment.
While losing its GDP primacy, the continued importance of agriculture in
the Afghan economy contributed to economic growth volatility due to the
sector’s high reliance on rain-fed production and vulnerability to weather-
related shocks.




	Lacking proper means to cope with risk, poor households face extremely unfavorable trade-offs when hit by a shock and
2

 may resort to “harmful” coping mechanisms, which includes things like selling livestock or assets that may affect future
 productivity and livelihood, or increasing use of child labor leading to intergenerational poverty, or reducing consumption
 and going hungry affecting health, human capital accumulation and future labor productivity.

INTERNATIONAL SPENDING BENEFITED HIGH-CONFLICT AREAS THE
MOST, leaving behind the poorest West-Central, Northeast and East regions3. In the
rest of the country, a thriving service sector created new and less vulnerable jobs,
but “lagging” regions remained reliant on vulnerable employment in agriculture.
Greater incidence of, and vulnerability to, natural hazards contributed to widening
inequality between the poorest regions and the rest of the country.


BEYOND CONSUMPTION: PROGRESS BELIES A
WIDENING GAP IN ACCESS TO EDUCATION AND
BASIC SERVICES
While consumption-based poverty in Afghanistan stagnated, overall country HUMAN
DEVELOPMENT OUTCOMES IMPROVED. Enabled by international aid-supported
public investment, from 2007-08 to 2011-12, literacy rates for the population aged
15 and above grew by five percent, youth literacy by 8 percent, and primary school
enrollment by 6 percent annually. Access to electricity, safe drinking water, and
improved sanitation all improved, growing annually by approximately 14 percent
each. While these achievements have been significant, it is important to note that
- at its pre-transition pace of progress - it will take the country from 20 to 25 years
to achieve the same level of adult literacy of other low-income or conflict-affected
countries. Further, it would take Afghanistan from 11 to 15 years to achieve the same
level of youth literacy, and from 12 to 23 years to achieve the same level of primary-
school enrollment as countries with a similar profile.


	Aid increased in non-lagging regions by 79 percent over the period compared to only 31 percent in lagging regions.

AFGHANISTAN IS STILL A LONG WAY FROM CLOSING THE WIDENING GAP
BETWEEN POOR AND BETTER OFF AFGHANS. Between 2007-08 and 2011-12, the
gap in education between poor and non-poor Afghans widened. Children in poor
households have significantly lower school enrollment rates than their counterparts
in non-poor households. While urban areas and non-lagging regions saw significant
improvement in school enrollment, education outcomes stagnated in rural areas
and in lagging regions, mostly due to negative impact of shocks and conflict on
girls’ enrollment.

The gap in access to basic services between the poor and non-poor also widened,
except in the case of access to electricity, mostly due to the expansion in the use
of solar and battery sources. Expanded service delivery to rural areas reduced
the urban-rural services access gap, but differences between the poorest East,
Northeast and West-Central regions and the rest of the country widened, possibly
reflecting differences in international aid allocation.

LESSONS LEARNED
While economic growth is necessary to reduce poverty, the poor must actually benefit from
that growth. Poverty reduction hinges on the ability of the poorest to earn a good living;
accumulate, control, and protect assets; and access quality services and opportunities. For
Afghanistan, this means:

 1)	 STRENGTHENING AGRICULTURE to sustain growth as aid dwindles, and for
     accelerating poverty reduction. As 75.6 percent of poor aged 15 and above are illiterate,
     they cannot take advantage of better employment opportunities requiring high skills,
     so poverty reduction should benefit the most from growth in sectors like agriculture
     where the poor concentrate.

 2)	INVESTING IN HUMAN DEVELOPMENT to support economic growth, improve
    welfare, reduce poverty, and bridge gaps in these areas between Afghanistan and
    other countries in the region. While continuing to expand supply of education, health
    and basic services, the country should devote greater attention to improving access
    and quality in underserved areas and among traditionally under-served groups such
    as girls and the poor.

 3)	MANAGING AND MITIGATING RISK. Geography (exposure to natural hazards),
    economic structure, and high incidence of poverty (households’ limited ability to
    cope with shocks) require coordinated assistance to prevent and mitigate risks, and to
    help people cope with the impact of shocks. In particular, greater attention should be
    devoted to the development of an efficient system of safety nets to promote poverty
    reduction, and to complement and improve the effectiveness of investments in human
    development and agriculture.
