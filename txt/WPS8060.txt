Introduction

Maternal and child mortality rates have reduced significantly in Sub-Saharan Africa between 1990 and
2015. It is estimated that the under-five mortality rate reduced by 52 percent and maternal mortality
rate by 49 percent (United Nations 2015). However, both mortality rates in the region remain about
twice as high as the corresponding world averages, and the ambitious targets set by the Millennium
Development Goals have not been achieved. Further reducing these rates has remained in the heart of
the post-2015 international development agenda and new targets were set to be achieved by 2030 by
the Sustainable Development Goals.1 In an attempt to further improve maternal and child survival, a
focus has been put on increasing coverage rates of antenatal care, skilled-attended delivery and
postnatal care of both mothers and children.

This study evaluates the impact of an intervention that incentivized users of health services with in-kind
conditional transfers. In particular, the intervention endowed women with gifts for receiving timely
antenatal and postnatal care, as well as for delivering in health facilities. The objective of the demand-
side incentives strategy was to increase use of these targeted services in order to diagnose and treat
preventable threats to maternal and neonatal health. The intervention was introduced in the context of
the Community Performance-Based Financing (CPBF) program, an extension to the national
Performance-Based Financing (PBF) program at the health facility level.

The evaluation relies on an experimental design in which funding for the implementation of the
demand-side incentives was given to health centers in randomly selected sectors (sub-districts).
Facilities received this funding for a period of about two and a half years. The analysis relies on a
baseline household survey conducted prior to the launch of the program and a follow-up survey of
households and health centers conducted about nine months after last funds were transferred to the
facilities.

The results show that demand-side in-kind incentives can effectively increase utilization of targeted
services. They caused an increase of 7.7 percentage points in the rate of women who initiated antenatal
care within the first 4 months of their pregnancy and an increase of 8.6 percentage points in the rate of
women who received postnatal care in the ten days following delivery. No significant impact was found
on the rate of women who delivered in a health facility attended by a skilled health provider. However,
the rate of in-facility skilled-assisted deliveries sharply increased across the board and reached 95
percent at the time of the follow-up survey.

These results are consistent with previous studies of schemes that conditioned demand-side transfers
on health service utilization.2 Banerjee, Duflo et al. (2010) report results of a clustered randomized
controlled study in rural India in which provision of lentils and metal plates to families whose children
got immunized significantly increased rates of full immunization. They conclude that the small incentives
had a large impact and were more cost effective than improving the reliability of the availability of the
immunization services. Other studies have evaluated the impacts of financial incentives. For example,
Thornton (2008) finds that even small monetary incentives can double the share of individuals who learn
results of HIV tests in Malawi. A cluster of studies evaluate the impacts of multi-sectoral social

protection programs in Latin America that included incentives for preventative health services (e.g.
Gertler and Boyce 2001; Fernald Gertler and Neufeld 2008; Barham 2011; Barham and Maluccio 2011).
Overall, these programs are found to be effective in increasing coverage of preventative health services
and some studies even found positive impacts on the health status of beneficiaries.

This study contributes to this literature by evaluating a large-scale government-implemented program in
Sub-Saharan Africa that endowed conditional in-kind transfers. Unlike the programs in Latin America,
the policy intervention was not part of a bigger social protection program and was primarily
implemented by health centers that procured and distributed the gifts. Unlike the experiments studied
by Thornton (2008), which also took place in Sub-Saharan Africa, and Banerjee, Duflo et al. (2010), which
also provided in-kind transfers, the CPBF scheme is a large-scale multi-year program. Evaluating the
impacts of a program run by the government on a large scale, rather than by a research team or an
NGO, is of value by itself as it might be implemented differently. For example, health centers
experienced frequent stock outs of the gifts. That might have not occurred under a more controlled
small-scale implementation of such a program.



Background and the Intervention

Since the devastating 1994 genocide, Rwanda has experienced impressive improvements in health
outcomes and utilization rates of health services. According to the Rwanda Demographic and Health
Surveys, the infant mortality rate has decreased from 107 to 32 per 1,000 live births between 2000 and
2015 (NISR, MOH and ICF International 2012; 2015). Under-five mortality has decreased from 196 to 50
per 1,000 live births during the same period. The increase of in the share of births occurring in health
facilities from 27 percent to 91 percent illustrates the increase in utilization of health services.

During the past two decades, the health sector in the country went through major reforms such as
decentralization and the scaling up of the community-based health insurance program. One of the policy
interventions that has been shown to contribute to improvements in maternal and child health
indicators is the national Performance-Based Financing (PBF) scheme. In this pay-for-performance
scheme, health facilities receive financial incentives for the use and quality of selected health services.
evaluations of the program have concluded that it has significantly increased the health outcomes of
children, quality of prenatal care and coverage of health services such as institutional deliveries,
preventative care visits by children and voluntary counseling and testing for HIV by couples (Basinga,
Gertler et al. 2012, Gertler and Vermeersch 2012 and de Walque, Gertler et al. 2015).

The CPBF program was designed with the objective of further expanding coverage of maternal and child
health services and improving the quality of monitoring data collected at the village level. The program
tries to achieve these objectives through expansion of performance-based payments to additional
agents in the health system. A focus has been put on services whose coverage was not impacted by the
PBF at the health facility level. The primary component of the program is performance payments to
cooperatives of community health workers. The payments were given for timely completion and
submission of reports on health indicators at the community level and for utilization of targeted health
services by the communities the cooperatives serve.


                                                    3
This study evaluates the impacts of another component of the program, demand-side incentives. Health
centers received funding to endow women with gifts for meeting the following eligibility criteria:
initiation of antenatal care within the first four months of a pregnancy, delivery in a health facility, and
initiation of postnatal care within ten days of delivery.3 Table 1 summarizes the eligibility criteria and the
monetary values set as ceilings for each service. Gifts of a value of up to 5 USD were to be endowed for
timely antenatal care and values of 6.67 and 3.33 USD were set for in-facility delivery and timely
postnatal care respectively.4 The facilities were provided with suggested content for the incentive
packages. Women who received these in-kind transfers during a pregnancy were not eligible to receive
them again for a duration of three years.

The program launched in October 2010 and facilities received last funding for the gifts in February 2013.
When the program was launched, procurement of the gifts was done centrally by the Ministry of Health
but procurement responsibility was shifted to the individual health centers. There were frequent reports
of stock-outs of the gifts and many women who fulfilled eligibility criteria did not receive the gifts.



Experimental Setup and Data

The demand-side in-kind transfers program was randomly introduced at the sector level.5 For the impact
evaluation of the CPBF, 19 districts were selected in four provinces (excluding the province of the capital
city Kigali). These were the 18 districts participating in the impact evaluation of the PBF program in
2006-2008 and an additional district that was added to increase the statistical power of the study. The
demand-side intervention was piloted in 30 sectors, and those were excluded from the study sample.
Additional sectors were excluded if they did not contain a public or non-for-profit faith-based health
center.6 Sectors were blocked by district and poverty ranking, as defined by a social protection program
(Vision Umurenge Program), and then randomized into 4 study arms.

In all study-arms, community health worker cooperatives were paid conditional on the completion of
quarterly reports. In two of the study arms, cooperatives were also paid for the utilization of targeted
services (pay-for indicators). Two study arms were selected for the implementation of the demand-side
incentives, one with pay-for-indicators and one without. Forty-eight sectors were assigned to the pay-
for-reports intervention only and 50 sectors were assigned to each of the three other groups. This
analysis focuses only on the impact of the demand-side transfer and compares the two study arms that
implemented this program with the two that did not. Therefore, for the remainder of the paper, the

  Health centers are the main first point of contact between the population and the health care system. These
facilities provide both outpatient and inpatient care such as deliveries. At the tier above the health centers are the
district hospitals followed by provincial hospitals and at the top tier are the country’s five referral hospitals.
4
  To benchmark the gift values, it is estimated from household consumption data that in 2010 about 81 percent of
the population lived on less than 3.10USD a day and 60 percent lived on less than 1.90USD a day
(iresearch.worldbank.org/PovcalNet).
5
  Rwanda’s five provinces are divided into 30 districts, further divided into 416 sectors that are in turn divided into
2,150 cells encompassing the country’s 14,837 villages.
6
  A sector typically contains a single public or non-for-profit faith-based health center with the catchment area of
the health center corresponding to the boundary of the sector. However, there are some sectors that do not
contain a health center and others have more than one.

treatment group is defined as the 100 sectors that implemented the demand-side incentives and the
control group is defined as the 98 sectors that did not (see Figure 1).

A baseline survey was fielded from February to May 2010 to measure outcomes prior to the launch of
the program and to establish internal validity of the experimental design. For a household level survey,
twelve households with a woman aged 15-49 with a recent pregnancy or birth were selected from the
catchment area of each of the 198 health centers. First, three cells (groups of villages) were randomly
selected and four villages within each cell were randomly selected.7 In each village, a field supervisor
consulted the village leader and/or community health workers in order to identify the household with
the most recent birth in each village. This resulted in a sample of 2,376 households.

A follow-up survey took place from November 2013 to June 2014.8 The survey teams returned to the
same villages sampled for the baseline and identified the households with the most recent birth or
pregnancy following the same procedure as in the baseline survey.9 Interviews were completed with
2,343 households. A rate of above 98.5% of successful interviews was achieved in all study arms. The
follow-up survey also collected data on the 198 health centers whose catchment areas include the
selected villages.

The primary outcomes for this analysis were constructed using data from interviews with the women
who were pregnant shortly before the survey. A detailed questionnaire was administered to gather
information on the care given to these women throughout their most recent pregnancy, delivery and
post-partum. The analysis therefore relies on self-reported measures of service utilization.

The follow-up survey was fielded about nine months after the last funds for procurement of gifts were
disbursed to the health centers. The survey was designed to not only evaluate the demand-side scheme
but to collect data on the overall CPBF program. The termination of transfers to the health centers was
unexpected and was not announced. As we will report below, almost all health centers in the treatment
group reported they were still providing gifts as a policy although facing stock outs. Ideally, the data
would have been collected while the program was still fully implemented.

To assess how the delayed data collection might affect the impact estimates and how the impact might
have changed since implementation started, we complement the analysis conducted with the CPBF
impact evaluation data with analysis of the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey data collected from
November 2014 to April 2015. The nationally representative survey collected detailed retrospective data
on births in the five years preceding the survey. Timing of antenatal and postnatal care is reported by
women for their most recent pregnancy. While the RDHS provides data on which district each survey
cluster (enumeration area) is, we are uncertain about the exact sector. The GPS coordinates of clusters
are randomly displaced to ensure confidentiality. Rural clusters are displaced up to five kilometers and
urban clusters are displaced up to 2 kilometers.10 Out of the 492 RDHS clusters, 304 are in the 19

  During the fieldwork, the survey team learned that some villages, in five of the sectors, were served by health
facilities different from the health center selected for the sample. In these cases, additional households in the
villages covered by the selected cooperatives were added to the sample.
8
  The duration of the follow-up survey was longer because in addition to a sample of women with recent
pregnancies, the women interviewed in the baseline were tracked even if they relocated outside their baseline
village.

  In 32 villages, the same woman was interviewed both at baseline and follow-up surveys.

districts covered by the CPBF impact evaluation and 221 are recorded to be misplaced in one of the
impact evaluation sectors. Of these 221 clusters, 109 are misplaced in treatment sectors and 112 in
control sectors.



Descriptive Statistics

    i.      Sample Characteristics and Balance

Table 2 presents summary statistics of the baseline sample of women with recent pregnancies by
treatment. It reports means of women’s characteristics and care provided during the most recent
pregnancy. It also reports the p-value of t-tests assessing the similarity between treatment and control
groups. The results confirm that the randomization achieved balance of observed characteristics
between the two groups.

About 19 percent of the sample is from the South Province, 25 percent from the North, 28 percent from
the West and 28 percent in the East. Households consisted of an average of five members and were
located at an average distance of about 4.3 kilometers from the health center serving their village. The
average age of the sample of women with recent pregnancy was 28.2 and 91 percent of them were
married. Seventeen percent of the women have never attended school, 69 percent attended at least
some primary school and the rest have attended at least some secondary or higher level education.
Ninety percent were covered by Mutuelle, the community-based health insurance program.

The average number of births given by women in the sample is three and the women had on average 2.7
living children. Forty percent of the women reported ever using any modern method of family planning.
Almost all women have received at least one antenatal consultation during their most recent pregnancy
but only 63% initiated antenatal care within the first four months of the pregnancy and 37 percent
received four or more consultations. Seventy-nine percent have delivered in a health facility, attended
by a skilled health provider. Thirty-eight percent have reported receiving postnatal care within the ten
days following the birth.

Some health centers endowed women with gifts even prior to the implementation of the intervention
evaluated in this analysis. These health centers chose this type of conditional transfer as a strategy to
increase coverage of services for which they were rewarded through the PBF scheme at the health
facility level. About 5 percent reported receiving gifts for attending antenatal consultations, 4 percent
for in-facility delivery and less than 2 percent for postnatal care. The values of these transfers are
estimated to be less than a third of the values suggested for the CPBF in-kind transfers for each of the
services.

The sampling strategy might have resulted in an unrepresentative sample of women with recent
pregnancies. Because the selection of women was done with the aid of village leaders and community
health workers, it could be that women in the sample are more likely to use health services relative to
the overall population of pregnant women. A comparison of the sample to that of the nationally
representative sample of the RDHS 2010, however, reveals that the baseline rates of utilization of
maternal health services are similar in both surveys. The comparison was done with the subsample of


                                                     6
women who gave birth in the two years preceding the survey in the four provinces covered by our study
(excluding the province of the capital city Kigali). The rates of women who received at least one
antenatal consultation, initiated antenatal care within the first four months of their pregnancy and
delivered in a health facility attended by a skilled health provider are identical at 98, 63 and 79 percent
respectively. The rate of women who completed at least the suggested number of four antenatal
consultations is 37 percent in our sample relative to 36 percent in the RDHS. The rate of women who
reported receiving postnatal care within ten days after delivery, however, is much higher in our sample
at 38 percent relative to 18 percent.

    ii.     Time Trends

Between the time of the baseline and the follow-up surveys there has been an overall increase in
coverage of the targeted health services independently of the demand-side conditional transfers. These
trends can be best portrayed by comparing service utilization by the control group at baseline and
follow-up. As presented in figure 2, the percentage of women who received their first antenatal
consultation during the first four months of their pregnancy increased from 61.2 percent to 77 percent
and that of women who received four or more consultations has risen from 37.2 to 43.4 percent. The
rate of women who gave birth in health facilities increased from 78.4 to 94.6 percent.

Unlike the other rates, that of women who reported receiving postnatal care has decreased between
the baseline and follow-up surveys. It is 39 percent in the baseline and 17 percent in the follow up.
Given the discrepancy between our baseline survey and the RDHS 2010, we cannot conclude that there
was an actual decrease in timely postnatal care initiation. According to the RDHS report there has been
an increase in the rate of women who received postnatal care within the first six days after delivery
from 18.5 percent in 2010 to 43.8 percent in 2015. It is important to note, though, that the way women
were asked about postnatal care was different in the two surveys. The RDHS specifically asks about care
provided immediately after delivery and those who report receiving such care are not asked about the
timing of follow-up checks. The CBPF impact evaluation survey asks more generally about care after
births as the program’s goal was to have women come back to the health centers after being
discharged.


     iii.      Program Implementation
Information on the program implementation was collected through the health centers and household
surveys. As mentioned before, the last funding for the in-kind transfers was provided to health centers
in February 2013. However, it was not announced that the program will terminate and some health
centers still had available gifts (or resources for gifts) with which to endow the women who met the
eligibility criteria. At the time of the follow-up survey, about 90 percent of the health centers’ in-charges
in the treatment group reported that their facility usually provides women gifts if they meet each of the
three targeted eligibility criteria. Among the control group, the percentages of health centers that
reported providing gifts for timely ANC, delivery and timely PNC is 12, 16 and 9 percent respectively. It is
important to remember that the health centers have the autonomy to independently implement such
programs.

Although almost all health centers in the treatment group reported usually giving the gifts, most of them
also reported experiencing stock outs of the gifts. Only 19 percent of the health centers reported not
experiencing stock outs in the six months preceding the survey. Forty-nine percent reported

                                                      7
experiencing stock outs sometimes while 18 and 15 percent reported experiencing them frequently and
very frequently respectively. When asked about the reason for the stock outs, 69 percent of the facilities
mentioned lack of PBF funds as the main reason. Thirty percent stated issues with procurement or the
suppliers as the main reason.

Out of the 956 women in the treatment arm who report receiving antenatal care in the first four months
of their pregnancy, only 19 percent reported also receiving gifts. Twelve percent reported receiving a
gift after delivering in a health facility and 7 percent reported receiving the in-kind transfers after
receiving postnatal care within ten days after delivery. For each of these criteria, about 3 percent of the
eligible women did not receive the gifts but were promised to receive them at a later stage. The rates of
women meeting the eligibility criteria in the control group and receiving gifts from the health facilities
where they received care are, 11, 4, and 1 percent for timely antenatal care, in-facility delivery and
timely postnatal care, respectively. In all cases, the differences between the groups are statistically
significant at the 1 percent level.

The follow-up survey also collected data on the women who were interviewed in the baseline survey.
While these data are not used in the analysis presented in this paper, they enable us to calculate the
rate of gift receipt for the different program implementation years, as more than half of the baseline
sample had additional births since the baseline survey. The rates are highest for 2011 and gradually
decrease in 2012 and 2013. For timely antenatal consultation, the rate of eligible women who received
gifts is above 30 percent. It is important to keep in mind, however, that the estimate for 2011 is noisy, as
few women had births two years in a row. In addition, the reporting of gifts received two years prior to
the survey might be lower because of recall issues.




Results

    i.      Analysis of the CPBF Impact Evaluation Data

Given the random allocation of the intervention and the balance between treatment and control groups,
the effect of the in-kind transfers can be estimated by simply regressing outcomes from the follow-up
survey on an indicator for being from a treatment sector. Taking into account the sampling strategy,
standard errors are clustered at the sector level. Table 3 presents regression results of this simple
specification. The demand-side intervention has increased the rate of women receiving first antenatal
consultation within the first four months of their pregnancy by about 7.7 percentage points from 73.1
percent among the control group to 80.8 percent among the treatment group. The effect is statistically
significant at the 1% level. The rate of women who received postnatal care within ten days after delivery
has increased by 8.6 percentage points from 12.2 percent among the control group to 20.8 percent
among the treatment group. Also this effect is significant at the 1% level. No statistically significant
impact is detected on in-facility deliveries. The rate of such deliveries is 95 percent in the control group
and 94 percent in the treatment group.

Timely antenatal and postnatal care, as well as in-facility deliveries, were directly incentivized by the
program. Table 3 shows also results of the impact of the intervention on related but non-targeted
outcomes. Although it increased the rate of women who commenced their antenatal care early, the

                                                      8
analysis does not show a statistically significant increase in the rate of women who received any
antenatal care or that of women who received four or more consultations. It is important to stress,
though, that the rate of women receiving any antenatal care is practically universal. The impact
parameter for four or more ANC visits is positive with a p-value of 0.146. With respect to receiving any
postnatal care, however, the program is associated with an increase of nine percentage points. The
effect is significant at the 1% level.

Table A1 in the appendix presents results of a different model specification in which controls are added
to the regressions. Those are women’s characteristics (age, marital status, education, and birth order),
household characteristics (education of the head of the household and number of household members),
an indicator for the household being more than four kilometers away from the health center and district
dummies. About 10 percent of the sample is lost for having missing information for at least one of the
controls. However, the estimated treatment coefficients are almost identical in both magnitude and
their statistical significance.

The results presented in Table 3 are from an analysis conducted without using sample weights. While
they represent an unbiased estimate of the impacts given the experimental design, the impacts might
not be representative given the sampling strategy. Table A2 in the appendix presents results for the
same regression specifications as in Table 3 but with weighting observations according to the number of
households per sector. The weighting causes negligible changes in the estimated parameters.



     ii.      Analysis of the Rwanda Demographic and Health Survey 2014-15 Data

Unlike the CPBF impact evaluation survey that interviewed women with the most recent birth in each
visited village, the RDHS 2014-15 collected detailed information on pregnancies in the five years
preceding the survey. Since the RDHS cluster locations are reported with error, we are uncertain about
the sector to which each cluster belongs and therefore about exposure to treatment. In our regressions,
we use two classifications of exposure to the demand-side in-kind transfer program. In the first, we
regress the outcome indicators on a binary variable for the location of the cluster being misplaced in the
area of a treatment sector. For a second approach, we calculated the probabilities that each cluster is in
a treatment sector. Using the displacement distances as radiuses, we draw a circle around each
misplaced cluster and calculate what percentage of the circle covers a treated sector. We then regress
the outcome indicators on treatment probability. The sample sizes for these regressions are larger as we
can include all 304 cluster in the 19 districts and not only the 221 clusters misplaced within the study
sectors. In both approaches we interact treatment (either the binary variable or treatment probabilities)
with year of birth. We control for the age of the woman at the time of birth, her marital status,
education level, birth rank, an indicator for a rural DHS cluster and district dummies. The RDHS sample
weights are used and standard errors are clustered according to the DHS cluster.11

The results of this analysis should be taken as suggestive only. First, the treatment coefficients represent
underestimates of the actual impacts. Under the assumption that the intervention has a non-negative

11
  Clustering standard errors at the sector level results in negligible difference in results, as the majority of clusters
do not have other clusters displaced in the same sector.



                                                            9
impact, having some treatment clusters classified as control clusters (or with treatment probability
smaller than one) will increase coverage rates in the control group. Similarly, coverage rates in the
treatment group will be lowered by having control clusters classified as treatment ones. As a result, the
estimated difference between the groups will be smaller than the actual difference. Second, detailed
information was only provided on the last pregnancy of each respondent. Therefore, the data are not
representative by year of birth.

Figure 3 presents the annual impact coefficients of the in-kind transfers on timely antenatal care. We
restrict the sample to births after June 2011 to assure women were exposed to the intervention for the
entire duration of their pregnancy. The left frame shows the results of the regression using the binary
treatment indicator and the right frame the results when using treatment probabilities. The annual
treatment coefficients are plotted with the 95 percent confidence intervals. In both specifications, the
treatment coefficients reduce with the duration of implementation and the 2011 treatment coefficient
is statistically significant. The treatment coefficients for 2012 are significant at the 10 percent level in
the specification using the binary treatment indicator and at the 5 percent level in the other
specification. For all other years, we cannot reject the coefficients equaling zero and they are estimated
to be negative for 2014 and 2015. These results suggest that the estimated impact found in our primary
analysis might have been larger if the follow-up survey was fielded earlier when health centers were
more likely to have stocks of gifts to reward eligible women.

As in the analysis using the CPBF impact evaluation data, we do not find any impact on in-facility
deliveries and we do not present the results for brevity. As for postnatal care, we are unable to
construct a measure comparable to the one we are using in our primary analysis with the RDHS data.
The goal of the program was to bring women back to the health centers after they were discharged
following their deliveries. For women who received postpartum care immediately after delivery, the
RDHS now collects data on the timing of additional postnatal consultations. More than 50 percent of the
women recorded to receive postnatal care are reported to receive it within one hour after delivery.
Using the timing of care according to the RDHS will imply rate of 45 percent of postnatal within ten days
after delivery in comparison to 17 percent in the impact evaluation data. For comparison, rates of timely
antenatal care are 77 percent in both data sets.



Discussion

We find that conditional demand-side in-kind transfers can be effective in increasing uptake of health
services. The scheme that was introduced as part of the Rwanda Community Performance-Based
Financing program caused a fairly substantial increase in the rate of women who received timely
antenatal and postnatal care. We are able to assign a causal impact of the demand-side transfers even
though there were other interventions or factors that increased maternal health service utilization as
portrayed by the increase in health service utilization by the control group.

The demand-side incentives improved indicators that were not impacted by incentivizing health
providers through the Performance-Based Financing scheme at the health center. However, we cannot
compare the effectiveness of incentivizing health providers versus only incentivizing users of the health
care system as the demand-side transfers were introduced on top of the countrywide facility-level PBF

                                                     10
scheme. It could be that there were synergies between the incentives to the facilities and the users. It is
noteworthy though that we find a difference in outcomes between the treatment and control groups
although some health centers could independently endow women with gifts in order to increase their
performance with respect to incentivized indicators. As the number of countries in Sub-Saharan Africa
that are introducing or scaling up pay-for-performance schemes to incentivize health providers is rapidly
increasing (World Bank 2015), this study shows that incentivizing users can enhance the impact of these
schemes on service utilization.

Although the results are consistent with previous studies of schemes that incentivize health service
utilization with conditional transfers, they are remarkable considering that most eligible women
reported not receiving the transfers.12 It is possible that women went to the health centers with the
expectation to receive the gifts and only learned about the lack of gifts while already receiving the
services. Although funding provided to health centers to procure the gifts stopped, the program itself
was not announced to be terminated, so both health providers and users could have been under the
impression that the program was ongoing. Our analysis of the RDHS 2014-15 data suggests that the
estimated impact might have been larger if the health centers were not experiencing stock outs.




12
  This is partially due to the timing of the follow-up survey months after the last funding was transferred to the
health centers.
