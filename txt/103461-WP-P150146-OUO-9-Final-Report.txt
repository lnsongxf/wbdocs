     Executive Summary


1.      This report aims at providing key recommendations toward the use of
innovative designs in small infrastructure in Romania. The overall aim is to compare
Romanian and international practices in design, construction, and maintenance of roads,
water and wastewater infrastructure, and social infrastructure. The objective is to assess
how innovative designs and technologies can contribute to better quality, cost efficient,
and sustainable infrastructure projects.
2.       In this endeavor, this Report includes a complete assessment of the current
designs and technologies deployed for a set of public infrastructure investments in
Romania. In addition, it presents a set of global best practices potentially recommended
for the Romanian context.
3.        This Report also includes an assessment of non-technical issues with direct
impact on design, construction, and maintenance practices. While innovative and
efficient design contribute to the delivery of better infrastructure, it is not sufficient. All
the aspects related to planning, project preparation, procurement, construction and post-
implementation need to ensure that the overall project delivery environment supports
efficiency and cost-effectiveness through the entire project lifecycle. Findings and
recommendations are aligned with the report on “Improved Prioriti zation Criteria for
PNDL Projects,” submitted in December 2014 as part of the same Bank technical
assistance for the Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration (MRDPA).
At the same time, this report informs the thinking on selection criteria for instruments like
the National Local Development Program (PNDL), with the hope that selection procedures
will facilitate the adoption of improved designs and technologies.
4.       This Report provides a complete overview of the current key issues related to
project design in Romania. It also serves as basis for further fieldwork in the final phase of
the current assignment; this will help disseminate best practices and collect further
feedback from beneficiaries, designers, and decision makers on how to make Romanian
infrastructure more efficient and cost-effective.


Cross-cutting aspects
5.      Infrastructure strategies and projects should be correlated in space and time.
The local strategies should take into consideration the strategic projects identified by the
higher-level development strategies (national, regional, and county). Investment projects
should be territorially integrated at local level in order to maximize their effects and
reduce inefficiencies. This report, along with the dedicated Component 1 report on
“Coordination of Strategies and Programs for EU and State -Funded Investments in
Romania’s Infrastructure,” makes specific recommendations on aligning infrastructure
strategies and projects.
6.       Stronger planning, improved implementation, and enhanced admin istrative
capacity are needed to ensure the best use of the available resources. In Romania, there
is a clear capacity gap across sectors and levels (from national to county and local levels),
which affects the quality of projects.




                                                                                                  1
7.      In the planning process, stakeholders should look for modern, efficient, and
sustainable infrastructure to be reliable, green, safe, and smart . This report considers
that these are the main pillars (families of characteristics) desired and researched in the
design of new infrastructure, which respond to current requirements and concerns:
    •   Reliable infrastructure is available and durable, i.e. demonstrates high quality and
        low maintenance of the infrastructure components. The concept is closely related
        to lifetime engineering and involves the project optimization, with particular
        attention to maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishments.
    •   Green infrastructure features energy efficient and environmentally friendly
        designs. The concept can be applied to the design, building, and operation,
        including materials, techniques, and management for all the inputs, processes and
        outputs.
    •   Safe infrastructure minimizes accident risks for users and operators/workers. It
        also implies that, in case of an accident, the infrastructure is designed to minimize
        consequential effects.
    •   Smart infrastructure communicates with users, operators, and with other
        infrastructure. Modern infrastructure is more and more connected with the real
        and virtual world through direct information sent to users about its real time
        conditions, to operators about maintenance status, energy consumption, etc., and
        adapt itself to the conditions of use.
8.       When possible, award criteria should move from the current focus on the
“lowest bid” to the “most economically advantageous tender” (ME AT) criterion. This
way the competition between enterprises will focus on technical aspects, not only
financial considerations, leading to an improvement in technical quality and reducing the
risk of designers/contractors/other service providers cutting corners to stay within a very
limited budget. In addition, this measure will force enterprises to do their own research
for design and building technologies that are more effective and possibly cheaper.
9.       To improve efficiency and transparency, it is recommended that Romania
adopts and implements international standard FIDIC contracts – adapted to the current
legislation. It is also recommended that alternative procurement forms such as design and
build, and/or build and maintenance be explored.
10.     It is mandatory to align technical standards in force with European standards,
respecting climate change, traffic modifications, and other new concepts like
environmentally friendly. This alignment legally exists, but the issue is the emphasis in
implementation, and lack of attention to environmental dimensions, which lead to old
standards with outdated content, but also to conflictual existing standards or even specific
fields which have no current standards in force.
11.     Specialists certified as technical verifiers, different and independent from the
specialists who design the projects, should verify project designs, as required by current
law. The beneficiaries should be the ones contracting technical verifiers and hold them
accountable directly. One way to do this is by requiring professional insurance in the
bidding documents. As such, designers who make mistakes can face actual penalties (as
opposed to the current system whereby they are not accountable for the quality of their
work).




                                                                                                2
12.     The warranty period is mentioned in the bidding technical specifications, usually
for a minimum of two years for most of the construction works. This should be regulated
and established in national regulations by taking into consideration the road technical
class, traffic loads, type of road structure, type of water distribution system,
characteristics of wastewater plant, and other factors. By adopting such a measure, the
constructor will have a higher responsibility in building correctly and according to the
standards in force. Of course, authorities then need to ensure that the road is properly
used and, for instance, weight limits are strictly followed. Interview data suggest that this
is not the case currently, which leads to significant repairs needed during the warranty
period.


Road infrastructure
13.     Road classification in Romania should switch to a functional basis. The technical
classes and the maintenance classes should relate to the functional classification via
design speed and traffic volume. Functional classes provide for continuity of the road
design features and help both the road administrations and the road users structure the
network.
14.      More efficient road maintenance is needed. Road maintenance standards in
Romania are time-interval, quantity- and equipment-based (e.g., paving every 7 years;
specific equipment for snow clearance; etc.), not road-condition based. Standards are not
only outdated, but also very costly and not life cycle cost-effective.
15.      Maintenance through performance-based contracts should be considered.
Under such framework, the Road Administration specifies the maintenance standards and
the contractor has the freedom to choose the methods and means to bring the road to
that standard and to maintain it at the required level. The contractor is required to have a
quality assurance system to monitor the quality of its works and to report on it regularly.
The Client verifies these quality reports with spot checks and pays the contractor a
monthly lump sum. If the required service level is not met, sanctions are imposed if the
shortfalls are not corrected within specified deadlines.
16.     Road safety standards have evolved considerably in recent years and should be
continuously improved. In Romania, while national roads and expressways do follow
European standards in this respect, county and communal roads have only recently been
required to include safety consideration in their designs. Starting with January 1, 2015, the
Road Safety Audit is mandatory on all types of roads, in order to increase the safety of the
road infrastructure.
17.     New solutions should be analyzed to improve road construction. At present, the
international focus is on improving mechanization in road superstructure works and on
introducing new and advanced technologies with greater economic efficiency, in order to
ensure rational use of resources. Increasing traffic volumes, increased axle load, and
increased tire pressure on the European road network have led to the need for stronger
and more durable infrastructure, while also ensuring reduced downtime due to traffic
maintenance and rehabilitation. For this, at the European level the following trends may
be observed:




                                                                                                3
    •   Large scale use of polymer modified bitumen and additives;
    •   Recycling both asphalt mixtures and cement concrete road. Recycling makes its
        presence felt increasingly in the construction and rehabilitation of roads, helping
        optimize the use of natural resources, the introduction into the market of
        unsuitable materials called “waste,” and contributing to the development of
        performant materials with high durability;
    •   In terms of cement concrete road, the new worldwide trend is the use of precast
        cement concrete pavements, continuous armed pavements, and cement concrete
        road rehabilitation for roads with asphalt mixtures as wearing layer;
    •   Recently, cold recycling raised high interest for construction and maintenance
        using various technologies such as foamed bitumen, bitumen emulsion or cement,
        with beneficial effects in terms of reducing emissions and energy consumption.
    •   Technologies that reduce the temperature of mixing and placing asphalt mixtures
        - the concept of low-temperature asphalt ("warm mix" or “cold mix”);
    •   The road network occupies a large area with a high potential for energy
        production. Thus, currently, new technologies for the use of this energy through
        various systems are developed – e.g., piezoelectric, sewer pipe networks that
        absorb heat during the summer, which will be returned to fight icing during
        winter.
    •   Use of photo-catalytic pavement blocks, especially in urban areas. They are made
        of materials designed to minimize air pollution. Laboratory testing showed higher
        effectiveness in reducing the NOx concentration in air, these pavement blocks
        being increasingly used in Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and France.
18.     In case of local roads, such as currently unpaved communal or rural roads, the
existing gravel can be used provided it has the appropriate features of a subbase layer,
or can be otherwise treated to become a sub-layer capable to withstand traffic and
environments loads. This requires the use of additional materials such as hydraulic
binders (both cement and hydraulic road binders), bitumen emulsions, foamed bitumen or
environmentally-friendly enzymes, all of them with the role of securing a layer capable to
withstand higher vertical loads than the current gravel layer. These new, innovative
methods can yield thinner road structures which are able to withstand similar loads as
regular road structures.
19.     Traffic and environmental impact studies should be required when starting a
design project, just as geotechnical and topographic studies are required currently. This
way, the solutions of new construction, modernization, or rehabilitation will have better
technical support.
20.     In terms of regional specificities, data on the percentage of unpaved roads in
each county show that the South, West, and Center of Romania are particularly in need
of investments . On average, in 2012, 34,000 km of county and communal roads were
made of dirt or gravel and required modernization, at a cost of around EUR 8.1 billion. An
additional 21,000 km of county and communal roads only had surface treatment and
required rehabilitation. This makes the choice of designs and technologies even more
important, in line with needs, opportunities, and capacity in each locality/county/region.
The project selection criteria proposed under Component 2 of this technical assistance




                                                                                              4
take into account investment needs, the current quality of road segments proposed for
modernization, the number of beneficiaries, traffic levels, etc.


Water and wastewater infrastructure
21.      Romania still has one of the least developed water and wastewater
infrastructure systems in Europe. As pointed out in the Component 2 report on
“Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects,” d ata from the National Institute of
Statistics show that some regions are especially deficient in this respect – namely, the East
and South of the country, which also include some of the poorest counties in Romania.
This also implies that people have limited resources to dedicate to paying for water and
wastewater services that had not previously used or paid for (i.e., particularly in poor rural
areas, the average willingness to pay for drinking water and sanitation services is very
low). Similarly, the resources of subnational governments in these regions to subsidize
costs are low or often nonexistent. It follows that the choice of designs and technologies is
vital with respect to minimizing post-implementation costs such that consumers can
actually afford to connect to the newly offered services and generate sufficient revenues
to cover operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses.
22.      The following recommendations take into account the facts presented above,
promoting the use of improved and cost-effective design solutions. For one, the
efficiency of pumps must be improved. There is room for roughly 30% increase in energy
efficiency of water and wastewater pumping systems. At the same time, the use of a
system of pumping stations with separation of the solids should be generalized, which
may lead to additional energy savings of about 20%.
23.      The use of Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA) should be
generalized . In order to increase energy efficiency of water and wastewater systems and
improve their maintenance, the use of SCADA provides the ability to reduce the operating
costs significantly. Since systems have a considerable range in terms of size and scope and
their implementation costs may be high, system size and functionalities must be designed
to ensure cost efficiency.
24.     Water quality must be monitored on a continuous basis, because problems will
only be detected with regular sampling. Sampling and analyses should be undertaken at
the well, at the intake, where water exits the waterworks, and throughout the distribution
system. At the same time, the location of the monitoring points must ensure a certain
representativeness (distance to WWTP, flows, hydro-morphological characteristics).
25.     Each consumer should have a water meter. All potable water systems have a
certain quantity of water that is not paid for. A well-run utility will keep the level in the
low teens and the meter readings form the basis for payment for water.
26.       High-quality products in water distribution systems are required, since the
equipment is installed underground, beneath the overlying pavement. Many water
utilities have learned the hard way that substandard equipment might save money when
purchased, but is much more expensive in the long term.
27.    The necessity to develop decentralized treatment for wastewater is very high.
These systems are often very cost effective and not only for rural areas. Inside of an




                                                                                                 5
agglomeration, decentralized systems are relevant when the density of population is not
very high and/or when the pollution is not sufficiently concentrated.
28.     Sludge disposal is a key concern. While Romania is still considering the use of
wastewater sludge in agriculture, other Western European countries are moving towards
incineration as a prime disposal process. The disposal of sludge to agricultural land
requires sludge (without so-called “Red-List substances”), which is prohibited in cert ain
nitrate sensitive regions and requires considerable storage areas because there is only a
narrow window of time when soil and crop conditions are amenable to receive sludge. In
order to improve environmental impacts of the treatment plants, the use of sludge
incinerators that provide smaller amounts of sludge up to 60% is recommended.
29.     Non-conventional waters as supply side solutions should be considered. In a
context of climate change, safe water reuse is an important aspect for industry (cooling
towers), artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture, and in the rehabilitation of natural
ecosystems.


Social infrastructure
30.      The provision of adequate social infrastructure is fundamental to ensuring
people are safe, healthy, and productive in their community. All public buildings, such as
those that are part of social infrastructure, must comply in order to be accessible and
easily to be used by disabled people.
31.      There is room for enhancing energy efficiency for social infrastructure. While the
law stipulates that by 2020 the national indicative target of reducing energy consumption
is 19%, few initiatives to ensure more energy efficient design, construction, and operation
of social infrastructure have been implemented. Efficient heating systems, efficient
isolation, new sources of energy including solar panels, etc. need incentives, both
monetary and legal, to become standard practice.
32.     There are many building materials typically considered ‘green’; these should be
adopted and used on a much wider scale than today. These include lumber from forests
that have been certified to a third-party forest standard, rapidly renewable plant materials
like bamboo and straw, dimension stone, recycled stone, recycled metal, and other
products that are non-toxic, reusable, renewable, and/or recyclable.
33.      The structural rehabilitation solution will be established based on the state of
degradation of the building (seismic risk category), the structural system (frames, walls,
mixed), the building materials used (reinforced concrete, steel, masonry, wood, etc.)
and the Importance-exposure class. The report sets out several technical solutions for the
rehabilitation of social infrastructure buildings.

1   Introduction


34.      The Government of Romania (GOR) has requested the World Bank to support its
efforts to harmonize public investments financed by the European Union and from the
state budget. The objectives of this work are to encourage synergies, deliver stronger
impact, and promote Romania's sustainable and inclusive development. This engagement
is a follow-up to the World Bank’s Regional Development Program in Romania,
implemented between November 2012 and March 2014, and continues to be based on
the January 2012 Memorandum of Understanding on Partnership and Support in the
Implementation of EU Structural and Cohesion Funds in Romania and Modernization of
Public Administration. This work includes the following four sub-activities:

(1) Component 1 – Assistance with the coordination of strategies and plans for EU and
    state-funded investments in infrastructure;
    1. Inception Report;
    2. Intermediate and Final Report on Harmonization of Strategies and Plans for Local
       Infrastructure Development;
    3. Intermediate and Final Report on Prioritization Strategy and Selection Criteria.
(2) Component 2 – Advisory services related to the existing portfolio of investment
    projects in the MRDPA, including their optimal prioritization and preparation of
    potential EU-funded investments for the 2014-2020 programming period;
    1. Inception Report;
    2. Intermediate and Final Report on Prioritization Criteria;

         Sector.




                                                                                          7
35.        This Final Report corresponds to the third component mentioned above ( in
italics ) – i.e., support for the implementation of innovative designs in order to deliver
more cost-effective projects. The overall aim is to compare Romanian and international
practices in design, construction, and maintenance of roads, water and wastewater
infrastructure, and social infrastructure. The aim is to assess how innovative designs and
technologies can contribute to better quality, cost efficient, and sustainable infrastructure
projects.

36.      In this endeavor, this Final Report includes a complete assessment of the current
designs and technologies deployed for a set of public infrastructure investments in
Romania. In addition, it presents a set of global best practices potentially recommended
for the Romanian context.

37.     This Final Report also includes an assessment of non-technical issues with direct
impact on design, construction, and maintenance practices. Indeed, issues related to
standard costs, procurement processes, and the planning capacity of public authorities
influence many design outcomes in Romania.

38.      This Final Report provides a complete overview of the current key is sues related
to project design in Romania. It also serves as basis for further fieldwork in the final phase
of the current assignment; this will help disseminate best practices and collect further
feedback from beneficiaries, designers, and decision makers on how to make Romanian
infrastructure more efficient and cost-effective. The report is organized as follows:

       Chapter 1 presents an introduction on the report, with the main components of
        the work done by World Bank. It gives an overview of the entire material.

       Chapter 2 provides an overview of infrastructure planning, describes the policy
        context in which projects identified and implemented in Romania, and covers
        strategy formulation processes. Both statutory and non-statutory plans are
        considered.

       Chapter 3 presents an overview of the legal framework for the preparatory
        stages of infrastructure design, but also the funding opportunities for different
        types of infrastructure works. The section presents different types of stages
        specified in Romanian law, along with an ideal framework for the preparatory
        phases.

       Chapter 4 reviews the main technical regulations in Romania and their
        correlation with EU regulations, but also gives an overview of the key technical
        elements considered in the design of road, water and wastewater, and social
        infrastructure. It presents the state of practice in Romania and its evolution over
        time, and draws some comparisons with international best practices. It also
        features a series of effective and innovative technical solutions, which have been
        successfully used at international level and proposed for implementation in our
        country.




                                                                                                 8
   Chapter 5 presents general aspects of the public procurement process . It covers
    the legal framework, the main problems at the national level, but also
    recommendations on contract type in light of international best practices.

   Chapter 6 presents the actors involved in the infrastructure construction
    process, along with their responsibilities. It also covers the preparatory steps,
    materials, constructions techniques and safety, personnel and equipment, and
    verification and control for the infrastructure building process. Moreover, it
    describes a series of technologies used internationally, with potential good
    impacts on the investments in Romania.

   Chapter 7 presents key aspects on infrastructure maintenance. It briefly
    describes the Romanian system for quality assurance in construction, the post-
    implementation policies, and asset management for different types of
    infrastructure works. It also presents new technologies for improved maintenance
    of public investments in the country.

   Chapter 8 summarizes the main aspects raised and described under the report.
    It features proposed improvements for the specific strategies and actions for
    investments in Romania, together with a series of technical solutions and effective
    and innovative established international technologies which are suited for
    implementation in Romania as well.




                                                                                          9
2     Well-planned infrastructure


2.1    General aspects

39.     The planning system in Romania contains statutory plans and non -statutory
ones . Both types define sectoral investment priorities: transport, social, economic,
environment, etc. The quality, complexity, and relevance of these documents vary greatly,
as explained in what follows.

40.      There are multiple types of statutory plans, depending on the applicable
territorial level. The statutory plan for the local administration units’ level is the General
Urban Plan (PUG), a development plan type combined with zoning regulation, which is
valid for 10 years. For their part, counties have the County Land Use Plan (PATJ) with its
specific sections: transport, water and wastewater, land use, etc. Both plans have a
methodological framework and an approval procedure established by MRDPA through
Law no. 350/2001 on spatial and urban planning.

41.      Localities and counties also have non-statutory plans, development strategies or
plans, usually designed for an EU programming period (7 years). They cover different
sectors to support community development (economy, transport and environmental
infrastructure, social services, good governance, etc.). From the content point of view, the
strategies encompass chapters like the analysis of the existing situation, SWOT
assessment, vision and strategic development objectives, policies, programs and the list of
priority projects that respond to identified problems.

                            Figure 1. Planning levels in Romania




42.     There is no legal methodological framework for strategy formulation . However,
different guidelines are available, especially the ones elaborated at the EU level. Examples
include: the Reference Framework for Sustainable Cities (http://app.rfsc.eu/); good




                                                                                                 10
practices and guides on Local Action Plans on the URBACT platform
(http://urbact.eu/urbact-local-groups); the guides and methodologies elaborated under
the project Platform for sustainable and integrated urban development by the Romanian
MRDPA (http://www.dezvoltareurbanaintegrata.ro/ghiduri-si-metodologii). The local and
county councils, following Law no. 215/2001 on local public authorities, approve these
plans. These authorities usually subcontract most statutory and non-statutory plans to
private or public organizations, such as consulting firms, universities, and research
entities. Because of the current gaps in the methodological framework, the quality of the
strategies depends on the terms of references and the expertise of the contractor.

43.      The planning activity has become more important for local administrations after
2007, since most EU programmes required (or gave priority to) projects to be included in
a local or sectorial strategy to be eligible for financing . For example, it was mandatory for
water and wastewater infrastructure projects financed through the 2007-2013
Environment Operational Programme (POS MEDIU) to be part of a regional master plan
for water and wastewater. Moreover, cities applying for urban development financing
under Axis 1 of the ROP were required to include proposed projects into an Integrated
Urban Development Plan (PIDU), aimed at promoting functional and territorial integration
into a defined area of intervention. At the same time, some county and local development
strategies received EU funding in the drafting process through the 2007-2013
Administrative Capacity Development OP (PO DCA). Currently, approximately 42% of the
territorial-administrative units in Romania have outdated General Urban Plans. The same
situation occurs in the case of County Land Use Plans, with some of them over 15 years
old. In this context, the Romanian Government has issued a decision in 2012 to prolong
the validity of these Plans until December 2015.

44.     The General Transport Master Plan is the reference document for the national-
level transport strategy . It will establish investment priorities for the 2014-2030
timeframe, thereby covering at least the next two programming periods, with a focus on
central and comprehensive TEN-T road, rail, water and air transportation axis.
Furthermore, each of the eight development regions have drafted Regional Development
Plans for 2014-2020 programming period, coordinated by the respective Regional
Development Agencies (RDAs). These include a list of investment priorities for county
roads’ rehabilitation and modernization, as approved by th e Regional Development
Councils (representatives of the component county councils and of municipalities/
towns/communes). These priorities have been established in a participatory fashion, with
the consultation of all counties in each region, under the supervision of MRDPA, and
according to two main criteria:
    • The road is to ensure the connection of regional centers and of a critical mass of
        citizens to the TEN-T network, as defined in the General Transport Master Plan;
    • The road should promote inter-county mobility and be implemented based on a
        partnership among stakeholders involved.

45.      While priority strategic projects included in the General Transport Master Plan
are going mainly to be financed through the 2014-2020 Large Infrastructure OP, those
identified by the Regional Development Plans will receive ROP funding. Finally, we




                                                                                                 11
should mention that both the General Transport Master Plan and the Regional
Development Plans still need to be approved (as of end of May 2015) and are under
consultation with the different categories of stakeholders.

46.      There are also counties that have elaborated their own transport master plans
or strategies for county and local roads, such as Iași or Timiș. However, local investment
priorities for road development are generally identified by local integrated development
strategy.


2.2   Main problems related to the preparation and implementation of strategies in Romania

47.      Most county and local strategies do not fully reflect community needs and are
instead designed to fit the requirements of various funding programs and shaped to
justify the selection of a list of projects previously agreed. At the same time, planning
documents at different levels are not integrated. The investment priorities established at
national or regional level do not correspond with the one emphasized by the local
strategies.

48.     There is poor correlation between strategic planning documents and spatial/
land-use documents . Some of the investment priorities cannot be implemented because
they are inconsistent with urban regulations or with environmental requirements.
However, some of the strategies have to undertake an environmental assessment,
according to GD 1076/2004, in order to ensure consistency with environmental
requirements, especially if they have a project portfolio that could influence the
environment. In practice, not all strategies go through this process (e.g., regional
development plans).

49.      Ownership and engagement over the programming documents is weak . This is
the result of a superficial participative approach in the elaboration of strategies and of a
lack of stakeholder consensus on investment priorities.

50.      The influence of political cycles over the programming process and strategy
implementation is strong . In general, each elected legal representative has the tendency
to impose an agenda and to abandon the previously established priorities for the
community, affecting the credibility of the planning process in general and potentially
contributing to the problem of the ever-growing portfolio of projects that are started and
left unfinished.

51.     The lack of implementation and monitoring tools is also problematic . Once
elaborated, the implementation of the strategies is not assessed by local authorities or by
other stakeholders. In fact, such documents often lack a set of objective monitoring and
evaluation indicators.




                                                                                               12
52.       The lack of investment prioritization can also be observed . As noted above and in
other components related to this broader technical assistance, 1 this has led to extensive
lists of priority projects that overcome the existing and future financial resources that the
community can access for their preparation and implementation. To make matters worse,
most local authorities do not have the necessary financial and human resources to
prepare and implement the projects.

53.      Multi-annual financing and the correlation between investment priorities and
budgets are needed . Although the county or local councils approve strategies, these
documents do not typically contain a financing need assessment for the entire
programming period or the potential financing sources for each of the proposed projects,
and/or there is no specific allocation in the local budget for the priority projects identified
in the strategy.

54.     A stronger “partnership culture” among stakeholders in general is needed . So
far, most PPP alternatives for the implementation of strategic projects are completely
ignored, while the only focus is on EU-funded programmes, with limited resources made
available to innovative schemes.

55.     Not all planning documents are properly elaborated. The lack of standard
framework or terms-of-references for the contractors, together with limited financial
resources for the elaboration of local strategies and the lack of experience at the level of
beneficiary, lead to low quality and potentially useless planning documents.

56.     In recent years, Romania went through major changes with respect to the
structures in charge of the coordination of structural funds . The funding rules, guidelines,
and procurement legislation have suffered numerous modifications. This lack of
predictability translates into poorly designed projects, delays in the assessment of
projects, and long periods for processing the reimbursements applications. 2


2.3       Organization of Local Authorities

2.3.1      Administration of County Roads

57.     Modern administration and management of roads should be organized around
four actors: owner, administrator, manager, and supplier(s) . The functions of these
actors are defined as follows:
      •    The Owner is responsible for funding, policy, and the legal and regulatory
           frameworks (e.g., the design and maintenance standards). For the county roads,
           the owner is the Romanian State represented by Ministry of Regional
           Development and Public Administration.

the same technical assistance with the MRDPA

  For an extensive assessment of such issues and others, see the two reports under “ROP 2.0: MA-IB
Collaboration and Support for Beneficiaries of the Regional Operational Programme 2014 -2020” (World
Bank, 2013)




                                                                                                   13
    •   The Administrator is the agent of the road owner responsible to ensure that
        performance of the transport system meets the aims of the owner. For the county
        roads, the administrator is the County Council.
    •   The Manager specifies the activities chosen by the Administrator to be carried
        out, and supervises and monitors their execution. In most counties in Romania,
        the manager is the Technical Department of the County; there is a trend toward
        contracting management with an outside firm.
    •   The Suppliers deliver services and works, selected and supervised by the
        Manager. Desirably, the supplier is a private contractor procured competitively.
        Currently, in most counties in Romania, the county’s own construction company
        performs such functions without competition. Annex 1 shows the roadworks
        contractors owned by County Councils.

58.     In Romania, these actors and their responsibilities are not defined clearly, which
results in high transaction costs and inefficiency . Incidences of micromanagement and
non-transparent political interference in project selection and priorities are common.
Deficient public consultation and ad-hoc planning activities make the decision-making
process non-transparent.

59.     Another key factor causing inefficiencies and slowing down decision -making is
the lack of indemnity insurance for professional staff. Staff is reluctant to make decisions
for fear of errors - which are very common (e.g., data errors, design errors due to poor
quality of data or design, etc.) - when they are personally liable for such errors, and, in
spite of the fact that they could insure for professional liability, they hardly ever do this.
One could also mention in this context the low motivation of public servants resulting
from: low salaries, poor work conditions, unattractive personal development packages,
frequent management changes, lack of internal performance assessment procedures and
monitoring, etc.

60.     The organization of maintenance at the local level was assessed through
interviews . These took place at the level of several counties with the entities in charge of
the infrastructure maintenance and at the commune level with the mayor and/or other
local administration officials.

61.     The organization and the functions of the entity in charge of the maintenance of
the county roads may be different from one county to another . In some places, the
Direction of the Public Domain (DAD) is in charge; in other places, this responsibility for
maintaining county roads belongs to the former technical Department of the County
Roads and Bridges. In some cases, the DAD has no technical means, thus it subcontracts
the maintenance works. In other counties, the entity in charge owns and operates
different technical means and equipment, and is working through a multiannual contract
for the maintenance of the County Roads. Competences of such entities differ
considerably. In most counties, such entities are only in charge with the maintenance of
the county roads, but sometimes their mandate also includes the communal roads (DC).
At least in some counties, the entity in charge (at the county level) provides technical




                                                                                                 14
assistance to the commune with respect to maintaining the road network that is under
the responsibility of the commune.

62.       At the county level, the technical direction is usually in charge of :
      •   gathering information and preparing annual and monthly jobs (investment,
          repairs, maintenance), according to the list approved by the Ministry of Transport;
      •   organizing the bidding procedures for the execution of the road works program
          included in the County Council’s Program;
      •   providing site supervision and being responsible for all road works financed by the
          County Council and supporting local councils in this respect, for their work of
          supervising progress and checking the volume, quality, and value of works
          executed by builders as reported in construction documents necessary to put
          roads into operation;
      •   organizing and participating in partial and final acceptance of the work, providing
          the secretariat of the committee, and pursuing measures agreed during the
          reception stage;
      •   ensuring checks and managing projects for roads, bridges, and artwork by
          ensuring that they meet customer requirements and ensuring proper execution of
          works;
      •   permanent liaison between the customer (County Council), designers, builders,
          and the State Construction Inspectorate in order to carry out contracts;
      •   working with Local Councils to administer local roads efficiently;
      •   evaluating bids for road works and preparing the necessary documents for
          negotiations between the County Council and contractors/designers;
      •   updating technical-economic documentation based on normative acts in force and
          preparing the necessary documents for approval by the County Council;
      •   verifying technologies, quality of work performed and materials, and making
          proposals to stop work when necessary, requesting, if necessary, quality
          assurance department collaboration;
      •   participating as members of the tender committees for the selection of roads and
          bridges construction or design companies;
      •   preparing and organizing the reception of road infrastructure works at the request
          of local councils;
      •   providing technical assistance and supervision of works approved by Rural
          Development Programs for road infrastructure at the request of local councils;
      •   preparing and submitting to the Ministry of Transport reports on the state of the
          road pavement works;
      •   carrying out specific responsibilities for quality management;
      •   fulfilling other duties assigned by the County Council, the President, the Vice
          President, and the Technical Directorate leadership.

63.   The organization of road maintenance at the communal level is very similar
around the country . One of the Deputy Mayors is usually in charge of maintenance of




                                                                                                15
roads. For this purpose, under the responsibility of the commune, the Deputy Mayor can
ask for assistance from persons who receive ‘social help’ based on the respective
provisions of the law. The commune can employ inhabitants with no income and pay
them for all working time (the compensation for one month is equivalent to 72 hours of
unskilled work). Unskilled persons are therefore employed for cleaning the ditches,
culverts and pipes, cutting grass along the roads, and other simple road maintenance
works such as filling potholes, earthworks, etc.

64.     Several communes have own quarries that provide materials (stones, ballast,
and/or sand). Most of the time the quality of aggregates is standard and they are used for
typical structural works on streets and communal roads. In some cases, when basic
materials are not of good quality, the commune may order other materials through a
concession agreement and, in return for the exploitation of the gravel quarry, a
Contractor may allow the commune to use some equipment for maintenance purpose.

65.    The communes also sometimes mobilize individual residents, either with their
equipment or as workers . Such mobilization is mostly used for winter maintenance,
important repairs, annual campaigns of road repairing, or for clearing off the snow from
the communal roads or village streets during winter.


2.3.2   Administration of water and wastewater system

66.     After a period of more than four decades of centralized management, Romania
has decided to return to the principle of local autonomy through decentralization,
transferring some responsibilities to local public administrations. The regionalization
process for the water and wastewater system started in 2001. This process was shaped by
four main constraints:
    • European integration issues and the need to comply with environmental
        standards;
    •   economic reasons – consisting of scale economies resulting from an operating
        system with a large number of consumers;
    •   solidarity – while big cities are self-sustainable, small communities cannot afford
        to prepare, implement, and sustain investment projects;
    •   viability –cost-benefit analysis do not justify investments in small communities,
        some without the necessary experience or with historical debts.
In this context, regionalization is the key element for improving the quality and cost
efficiency of the water and wastewater system, with the fulfillment of environmental
requirements.

67.     Nowadays, the management delegation of the water and wastewater services is
the operational and institutional basis of the system . They ensure a balanced
relationship between public authorities and regional operators, focusing on implementing
the investment plans and improving the efficiency of the system to ensure an efficient and
sustainable management, especially in what concerns the tariff policy, the reporting and
control processes, and the financial and asset management.




                                                                                              16
68.   The institutional architecture of the regionalization process in the water and
wastewater sector comprises two main actors:
    • Intercommunity Development Associations (ADI) – with the status of a non-profit
      association, consist of urban and rural administrative units in a county (no private
      party participation is allowed). This structure allows local authorities to have
      ownership in the water and wastewater regional operator, and to monitor and
      supervise investments into the network extension and rehabilitation. The ADI
      takes over most of the competences that local authorities have in the field of
      public services and it represents the interest of all members. The association
      provides services exclusively to its members (territorial administrative units that
      have agreed to join a particular ADI).
    • Regional Operator –has to be 100% publicly owned, licensed by the National
      Regulatory Authority of Public Community Services (ANRSC), and has to
      demonstrate it has the capacity to operate in a sustainable way by having a
      sufficient initial capital. If necessary, the Regional Operator can delegate part of its
      competences to other operators. The entire profit has to be reinvested in the
      network.

69.      A public service delegation contract has to be signed between the ADI and the
Regional Operator. The ADI has to elaborate a common strategy for the development of
water and wastewater infrastructure in its area, together with an investment plan and a
tariff policy targeting long-term price alignment. In the end, the ADI is expected to be the
entity responsible for the implementation of the County Master Plan for Water and
Wastewater. These documents are the basis for accessing EU funding from 2014-2020
Large Infrastructure OP (LI OP); they are similar to the ones used for the programming
period 2007-2014 (for the Environment OP).

70.     The administrative units that are not part of a county/regional ADI can establish
their own operators for water and wastewater services, use the existing ones, or
delegate the service to a private company . In any case, these operators also have to be
authorized by ANRSC. Considering they are not part of an ADI, these administrative units
cannot request LI OP for their investment projects, but they would be able to apply for
funding from PNDR and PNDL. Annex 2 shows the ADI and Regional Operators by County.

71.      The Romanian water and wastewater system is confronting a series of problems
and constraints affecting the quality of services delivered to citizens . Some of these
include:
    •   an inadequate institutional system;
    •   the unclear role and competences of different authorities involved in managing
        community public services;
    •   the inefficient management of operational, personnel, and maintenance costs;
    •   the lack of experienced personnel for the preparation and implementation of
        major infrastructure projects;




                                                                                                 17
    •   the huge investment needs for the extension and rehabilitation of the network in
        the rural areas;
    •   in some areas, there is a reduced level of household connection to the network,
        but also a large volume of unpaid water consumption, caused by network losses
        and low fare collection (in the context of a tough shift in mentality regarding the
        need to pay for water/sanitation services); the cost recovery is an important
        aspect, first of all as this is a requirement of the WFD, and second as it has an
        impact on the sustainability of the investments;
    •   inadequate operating and maintenance systems, etc.


2.3.3   Administration of social infrastructure

72.     According to Law no. 196/2006 on decentralization, local public administration
authorities have exclusive competencies over a wide range of social infrastructure
assets. They cover:
    • the administration of the public and private domain of the commune or city;
    • the administration of the cultural institutions of local interest;
    •   the administration of public medical units of local interest;
    •   primary social assistance services for the protection of children and for the
        elderly; and
    •   primary and specialized social assistance services for the victims of family
        violence.

73.      Local public authorities from communes and cities share competencies with the
public authorities from the central level in areas related to social infrastructure that
require both a national and local approach. These areas include building social housing
and housing for young people; public pre-university education (except for the education
of students with special needs); medical and social assistance services for individuals with
social problems; and primary social assistance services for persons with disabilities.

74.       County-level public administration authorities also share competencies with
central public authorities in the area of social infrastructure. These include: state
education for students with special needs; medical and social assistance services for
individuals with social problems; primary and specialized social assistance services for the
protection of children; and specialized social assistance services for persons with
disabilities.

75.     For education infrastructure, Law no. 1/2011 (The National Education Law) is the
main document that establishes the roles and administration of such assets. The land
and buildings of early education units and of the preparatory, primary, and secondary
education units (including any other units by levels of education, as established by the
state) belong to the local public domain and are administered by the local councils. The
other components that constitute the material basis of the units are in their ownership




                                                                                               18
and are administered by the executive boards, as required by law. 3 Concerning the state
schools for students with special needs and educational assistance county centers, the
land and buildings in which they operate are part of the county public domain (Bucharest
municipality included) and are administered by the county council through the
administration councils of the respective education units. The other components from the
material basis of these units are their property and are managed by their respective
administration councils. As for the palaces for children, clubs for students, and sports
clubs, they are part of the public domain and are managed by the Ministry of Education
through county school inspectorates and through the executive boards of these units.
Such facilities (including land and buildings) can be transferred from the public domain of
the state to the public domain of the territorial-administrative units where they operate,
at the request of the county/local council and by Government decision.

76.     The pre-school education system is facing a major deficit in terms of
infrastructure. According to the Partnership Agreement signed by Romania with EU for
2014-2020, the percentage of kindergartens coverage in the rural areas is only 7.44% of
the number registered at the national level in the school year 2012-2013. PNDR mentions
that from 295 nursery units in 2011 only 1% were placed in rural areas, but 45.5% of
children aged 0 to 4 years were registered in rural areas. There is still limited availability,
inconsistent quality and affordability of early preschool education due to the very low
investments in both infrastructure and institutional development. In 2013, a new legal
framework was adopted for the organization and the functions of nurseries, which
requires new investments in institutional development.

77.     Similarly, there is limited availability of informal alternative education such as
School-after-school or Second-Chance for students at risk of early leaving. Because of
chronic under-funding and the lack of incentives, there are limited opportunities for early
leavers to re-enter the educational system. This is particularly an issue among the Roma
communities, where only 6% of women and 12% of men graduate from high school.

78.     Since 2009 there could be seen a progressive closing of school of arts and trades,
based on the restructuring of the Initial Vocational Education and Training (IVET) due to
low enrolment and poor infrastructure. This has happened especially in agricultural high
schools, where there has been a decrease by over 80% in the last 15 years. The remaining
IVET schools are considered unattractive due to the inadequate quality of facilities,
equipment and staff.

79.     Much of the education infrastructure continues to be outdated and unattractive
and constrains the effectiveness of existing policies. Of particular concern are the rural
schools and isolated schools in disadvantaged areas. These have poor sanitary conditions
(a third of rural schools do not meet the requirements of sanitary authorities). They also
lack a proper water supply (almost half of rural primary schools), are not connected to
sewerage with consequent risks to health (a fifth of rural schools), and are inadequately
heated (more than half of the schools in rural areas, and more than one third in urban
areas, with the most serious situation recorded in primary schools). The availability of

                                                                                                  19
specialized facilities and teaching equipment for disadvantaged students, including those
with special educational needs, is poor.

80.     According to the National Strategy for Regional Development, the continuous
changes that have taken place in the process of restructuring the education system in
Romania, together with the Education Law of 2011, led to the reorganization of the
education units network. The main change was done at the level of pre-school education
(kindergartens). They have been assigned to the accredited/authorized schools with legal
personality. This has led to a vertical organization of the education system, with a single
management and a higher number of preschoolers and students per school unit. There
has been an important decrease in the number of schools in rural areas due to the
merging of the education units, based on the drop in the number of students. In what
concerns professional schools, they faced a decrease in number, due to the Education
Law, which imposed that the technical and professional education be done by
technological high schools.

81.      Law no. 95/2006 on the health system reform sets the legal, institutional, and
policy framework of the Romanian health system. 4 According to this, public health units
in Romania are:
    •   Hospitals (regional, county, local), ambulatory and emergency care services –
        subordinated to the Public Health Ministry, county or local councils;
    •   Units of medical-social assistance (dispensary/ policlinics), sanatorium,
        preventorium and health centers – subordinated to the local public
        administration.

82.      The current hospital network is formed of local/municipal, county and
university hospitals, but the specification of the hospital estate is inconsistent with the
delivery of a modern and efficient health service. In general, hospital infrastructure is
known to be deficient. Some services are provided in buildings more than 100 years old,
which are widely dispersed and cannot accommodate standards applicable to modern
hospital settings (e.g., building blocks dispersed at kilometers away from each other
impeding prompt multidisciplinary diagnosis/treatment of severe urgent cases, deficient
circuits within hospitals, insufficiently equipped, etc.).




4
  Law no. 95/2006 mainly regulates the following aspects: public health assistance principles, the
authorities of the public health system, public health control, medical assistance, pharmaceutical
assistance, implementation and financing of national health programs, family medicine, primary
medical assistance, first aid and emergency medical assistance, county ambulance services, mobile
emergency, resuscitation and extrication services, community medical assistance, human organs,
tissues and cells donations and transplants, organization, functioning and financing of hospitals,
health insurances, medical services covered from the National Fund for health insurances, the
organization of health insurances houses, medical services suppliers, voluntary health insurances
companies, profession of physician, dentist, pharmacist, the Romanian Colleges of Physicians,
Dentists, Pharmacists, medicines (fabrication, import, labeling, prospectus, classification,
distribution, publicity, public information).




                                                                                                     20
83.     One of the challenges regarding health infrastructure, underlined in the
Partnership Agreement, is the underdeveloped and often outdated infrastructure and
equipment. There is a high concentration of resources within urban areas, with weak
capacity to reach poor and isolated rural communities. Historical under-investments in
health in the post-communist period, but also external factors (e.g., roads infrastructure)
have resulted in a limited capacity to support equitable access to quality health services
these days.

84.     The public hospitals that are attached to the local administration may receive
funds from the state budget and from the Ministry of Health’s own revenues for
different purposes. These include the following: finalizing investments (new projects or in
progress); medical equipment endowment; capital repairs; modernizing, transforming,
and extending existent constructions, as well as expertise, technical design, and
consolidation of buildings. The local public authorities may also participate in the funding
of administration and operation expenditures, respectively staff-related costs, goods and
services, investments, capital repairs, consolidation, extension, and modernization,
endowment with medical equipment, etc.

85.      The Ministry of Health centralizes the investment objectives/projects and other
capital expenditures that are eligible to be covered under various investments program
(including technical and economic documentations, approval documents, etc.). The draft
of the investments program is elaborated along with the budget proposal of the Ministry
of Health. It has to take into account the following: the limits of budgetary expenditures
established by the Ministry of Public Finance and the strategy of the Ministry of Health
with regard to the investment policy in the health sector and the solicitations from the
public units attached to the Ministry of Health and/or from its specialized structures.

86.     According to the Social Care Law from 2011, the public suppliers of social
services can be:
    • specialized structures from/subordinated to the local public administration and
        the executive authorities of the territorial administrative units organized at
        commune, city, municipality level;
    •   authorities of the central public administration or other institutions subordinated
        or coordinated by them;
    •   health units, education units, and other public institutions that develop, at
        community level, integrated social services.

87.     Social services are classified, taking into consideration the beneficiary, into the
following categories : aimed at children and/or family, people with disabilities, elderly
people, victims of family violence, homeless people, addicted people, victims of the
human traffic, people imprisoned, people with mental illnesses, people from isolated
communities, long term unemployed, and their caregivers. The social services can be
offered at home, in day care centers, in residential centers, in community, protected
homes and units, multifunctional or services complexes, social canteen, mobile services
for food distribution etc. One of the major reforms assumed by the social assistance




                                                                                               21
system after 1989 has been the closing down of big institutions and developing small scale
and community based services.

88.     Social services offered and managed by the authorities of local public
administration are founded through local councils’ decision. They could be organized as
structures with own legal status (as social care institutions managed by a director,
supported by a consulting council formed by representatives of the beneficiaries and of
the social partners in the area) or without own legal status (as social care units inside the
specialty apparatus of the city/commune hall or inside the public service of social care
subordinated to the county or local councils).

89.      As mentioned in the Partnership Agreement social infrastructure is insufficiently
developed to meet current demands. In 2011, there were 524 adult care units, out of
which 27% were functional residential services for elderly people while the number of
elderly people in the rural areas is increasing. A similar situation also applies to nurseries
(as mentioned above): there were 295 units in 2011 at the national level out of which only
2 units in rural areas, while the number of children between 0 and 4 years was 1,054,946
in 2012, out of which 45.5% were children registered in the rural areas.

90.      According to GD 90/2010, the Ministry of Culture is a specialized structure of the
central public administration, which develops and ensures the implementation of
strategies and policies in the cultural sector. The Ministry has to ensure the efficient
administration of its institutional system, including subordinate institutions and
deconcentrated public services. The Ministry has to support, in collaboration with the
local public administration authorities, the proper functioning and activity of cultural
institutions and settlements that are subordinated to local and county authorities.
Furthermore, the Ministry has the attribution to propose and promote partnerships with
the local public administration authorities and with civil society actors in view of
diversifying, upgrading, and optimizing the public services offered by cultural institutions
and settlements.

91.    The public cultural units are: libraries, museums, cinemas, institutions and
companies for art performing or concerts (culture centers or houses) and are
subordinated to the Ministry of Culture, county or local administration. In recent years
there has been a decrease in the number of libraries and an increase in the number of
museums and art or concert performing institutions.

92.     Annex 2 of GD 90/2010 lists the units that operate as subordinated to the
Ministry of Culture and are financed entirely from the state budget. They are the
following: county departments for culture and national patrimony, the National
Preservation and Promotion Center of Traditional Culture, and the State Secretariat for
Cults. The Romanian Copyright Office is a specialized body under the coordination of the
Minister of Culture and is financed from the state budget. The county departments for
culture and national patrimony represent the deconcentrated public services of the
Ministry of Culture and their directors are appointed by the Minister of Culture. The
patrimony of these departments includes rights and obligations over movable and




                                                                                                 22
immovable goods that are in the public or private property of the state and that are
administered by these departments.

93.      There are as well central-level specialized bodies and national interest cultural
institutions that are financed both from their own revenues and through subsidies from
the state budget . They are the following: the national museums, the national theatres,
the national operas, philharmonic, and choir, national art centers, the National Patrimony
Institute, the National Institute for Cultural Research and Training, the National Cultural
Fund Administration, Bucharest Cinema Creation Studio, “Video” publishing house, etc.
There are also some cultural institutions that are financed from their own income/extra -
budgetary revenues – this is the case of Artexim. Finally, there are units that operate
under the authority of the Ministry of Culture: the National Printing Company “Coresi”
S.A., the Autonomous Distribution and Exploitation Administration “RomaniaFilm”,
Cinema Studios “Rofilm”, “Sahia”, “Animafilm”, etc.

94.     The cultural heritage including cultural infrastructure has an important role in
preserving the local identity, the specificity of the areas and maintaining the traditions
for the next generation. According to the Strategy for Culture and Patrimony 2014-2020,
75% of the historical monuments are endangered and 35% of the monuments have a high
degree of degradation.

95.     GD 11/2013 on the organization and functioning of the Ministry of Youth and
Sports establishes the roles and responsibilities of this specialized body of the central
public administration. 5 Among other responsibilities, the Ministry has the competence to
establish youth centers by accommodating unused spaces and buildings from the public
domain of the state or spaces that are administered by the institutions that are under its
subordination, and has the task to develop and implement the plan for the rehabilitation
and expansion of leisure centers and students’ cultural houses. It also has to ensure their
organization and functioning.

96.     Annex 2 to the Government Decision 11/2013 includes the units subordinated
to the Ministry of Youth and Sports and mentions their sources of funding: own income
and subsidies from the state budget. County departments for sports and youth function
as deconcentrated public services of the Ministry. 6 The sports clubs also belong to the
Ministry of Youth and Sports.

97.     According to the Partnership Agreement, the transfer of competencies from the
central to local government (education, health, population registry , basic public
services) was done without a proper assessment of the administrative and financial
capacity of the local authorities. The transfer of responsibilities has been often
incomplete or unclear/diffuse and decentralized public services delivered by local
governments are, in many cases, underfunded.

5 The organizational structure of the Ministry of Youth and Sports is included in Annex 1 to the GD
no. 11/2013, as modified by the GD no. 30/2013.
6 The activity of the county departments for sports and youth is regulated by GD no. 776/2010

regarding the organization and functioning of county departments for sports and youth.




                                                                                                      23
2.4   Conclusions

98.      In order to improve the quality and the use of the planning instruments for the
next EU programming cycle, several measures can be devised. First, all infrastructure
strategies, as well as the actual related projects, should be correlated in space and time.
One relevant example would be the road and utilities infrastructure, with many newly
rehabilitated roads being affected by the water, wastewater or gas construction work. The
report on coordination (also developed as part of this technical assistance) covers this
topic in great depth. 7

99.     Local strategies should take into consideration strategic projects identified by
the higher-level (national, regional or county) development strategies . For example, if
the General Transport Master Plan foresees the rehabilitation of a certain national road or
the development of a new highway, local authorities should invest with priority in the
county and local roads ensuring the connection to that specific road.

100. Investment projects should be territorially integrated at local level in order to
maximize their effects . For example, if a certain urban or rural area is targeted for road
extension or rehabilitation, the investment in utilities or social infrastructure for that
particular zone should be also considered with priority. A good example in this sense is the
PIDU approach for urban areas or the integrated rural renewal projects under 2007-2013
PNDR.

101. A sound prioritization process of the investment projects, correlated with the
real financial and human resources of the communities, should be conducted . In this
sense, this report argues for the use of prioritization criteria for each investment project
proposed (road, water and wastewater, social infrastructure). A full list of potential
criteria (to be applied to the state-funded National Local Development Program) has been
delivered by the World Bank under the Component 2 of this Technical Advisory Service. 8
Particularly important are the criteria relate d to the beneficiary’s capacity of co-financing
the projects.

102. The periodic evaluation of strategy implementation, based on a set of objective
indicators, should be carried out at least every 2-3 years, while monitoring should be
continuous . This way, the ongoing revision of the strategy will be allowed or the
corrective measures will be undertaken.

103. Alternative sources of finance should be explored . Although EU funding will
continue to be the main financing source for most investment project in the 2014-2020
programming period, development strategies should consider all potential financial

sources (a financing mix), including own budgets (if available), PPPs, and PNDL funds or
credits.

104. Authorities should consider the establishment of an inter-department steering
group at the beneficiary level (in case of municipalities and counties) led by one
department/project implementation unit to help the process and ensure ownership of
the development strategy. Law no. 215/2001 should be revised in order to clearly state
that the local / county authorities should elaborate and adopt a decision on both
strategies and lists of priority projects, with clear provisions related to financing sources
(reflected also in the multi-annual budget of that particular authority).

105. The strategy should demonstrate/provide information regarding the
involvement of the community and interested stakeholders in the formulation process .
Public and online consultations for the strategies, including the list of priority projects,
should be carried out and the input of the stakeholders should be clearly specified in a
dedicated chapter of the document and integrated in the content of the planning
document. In order to ensure the sound involvement and accountability of each
stakeholder in the implementation stage, partners and local authorities should elaborate
and sign a partnership contract. This contract should contain both benefits and penalties
for the parties that assumed clear responsibilities in implementing priority projects.
Another report (under Component 1 of the current technical assistance), to be finalized in
late August 2015, explores the potential use of territorial contracts, drawing on best
practices and experiences from other EU member states (e.g., Poland, the UK, etc.).

106. Priority projects should be better promoted especially to private stakeholders .
This way they could better plan and connect their own investments to those envisaged by
public stakeholders/administration (multiplying effect).




                                                                                                25
3     Well-prepared infrastructure


3.1       Legal framework

107. A number of studies can be prepared for the preparatory phase of a project,
from basic concept to detailed design. Each study tries to answer whether and how to
undertake a deeper analysis, in order to have the best results in the execution phase.

108. In Romania, for a new construction or for rehabilitation/modernization works,
Governmental Decision (GD) 28/2008 is the base document, along with other relevant
regulations in force. This document presents the framework for technical and economic
studies related to public investments, and the structure and methodology for elaborating
the cost estimates for investment objectives and intervention works.

109. According to GD 28/2008, the main phases for infrastructure design, including
roads, water and wastewater systems, and social infrastructure, are:
    • For new investments, including extensions:
           o Feasibility study (FS);
           o Technical design (TD);
                o Execution details (ED);
      •    For interventions at existing constructions, including existing installations:
                o Technical expertise, and in some cases, energetic audit;
             o Documentation for the authorization of intervention works (DALI);
             o Technical design (TD);
             o Execution details (ED).
When elaborating documentations for new constructions or extensions, which need the
approval of the Government, another phase is required before the feasibility study, called
a prefeasibility study. As noted later, in practice prefeasibility studies are rarely used and
often lack proper quality.


3.2       Preparatory studies

110. Depending on the size and scope of a project, there are different phases it must
undergo, starting with an idea, or concept, and ending with the actual construction
(execution of works). The timeline varies in each phase depending on the complexity of
the project.

111. For Infrastructure Planning and Facilities, every construction project begins with
an idea – whether it is a sidewalk repair, a new bridge, rehabilitation of a road sector,
new water and wastewater system, or modernization of social infrastructure. First,
someone identifies a probable need. From there, the idea is either studied to determine if
there is truly a need, or it is given to an estimator for a calculation on the cost of the idea.
If approved, the idea is then sent to the planning stage.




                                                                                                   26
112.    An ideal project development framework is presented in the figure below:

                         Figure 2. Project development framework




                            Source: “The use and abuse of feasibility studies” 9



113. The framework specifically incorporates the overlap of the following activities
across project phases:
    • the funding or financial closure activities commence before the completion of the
        feasibility study, but continue after the feasibility study is completed;
    • the commissioning activities overlap with the construction and operation phases;
        and
    • the rehabilitation activities overlap with the operation and the closure phases.


3.2.1   Scoping study

114. Scoping studies provide a future Work Plan, up to the point of commitment to a
prefeasibility study, and includes a description of the following:
    •   Scope and objectives – Define the scope and objectives for a project prefeasibility
        study (PFS), including:
            o declare the base and alternative cases to be considered,
           o declare technical issues requiring further investigation, and
           o identify test work to be undertaken.
    •   Approach – Declare the execution strategy for the PFS, including:
           o minimum standards for the PFS Report,
            o resources required and organization structure,
            o key personnel, and
            o key performance indicators for the PFS.

    •   Cost and schedule – Provide an estimate of cost and schedule to undertake the
        PFS, including:
            o budget based on scope statement breakdown,
            o schedule (Level 2), and
            o key milestones.

115. The decision of undertaking scoping studies is usually analyzed during project
generation or exploration. Unfortunately, they are not very common in Romania.


3.2.2   Prefeasibility study

116. In the current practice of developed countries, the pre-feasibility study or
"concept design" is a fundamental document in the implementation of the project; it is
sometimes more important than the other design / engineering documents. In the case
of projects involving advanced technological solutions or cleverly solving local community
problems, the pre-feasibility study is the document that analyzes various constructive
solutions for various sites, as well as the impact of each proposal on the overall
investment budget and on the budget assigned for that operating period. It also supports
policymaking.

117. The prefeasibility study includes the technical-economic documentation that
substantiates the necessity and opportunity of the investment based on technical and
economic data. The prefeasibility studies or background notes corresponding to the
projects are assessed in order to analyze their suitability. If the proposal passes this
preliminary evaluation, the authorities responsible for the implementation of the project
can move to the feasibility study. In practice, pre-feasibility studies are rarely used in
Romania, while background notes tend to be superficial and poorly argued (there are no
standard forms and they usually justify why the feasibility study is needed, rather than the
investment itself).

118. The prefeasibility study, conducted during the identification phase, ensures that
all problems are identified and alternative solutions are appraised, and selects a
preferred alternative based on Quality Factors. The study should provide the Funding
Authority and partner government with sufficient information to justify acceptance,
modification or rejection of the proposed project for further appraisal.

119.    Prefeasibility studies are typically structured to:
    •   assess the likely technical and economic viability of the opportunity;
    •   consider different process, location, and project configuration cases;
    •   consider different capacities for the project;
    •   determine and recommend the preferred optimal case to be examined during the
        feasibility study;
    •   outline the features of the recommended project;




                                                                                               28
    •   determine key business drivers for the opportunity and examine any potential
        fatal flaws;
    •   determine the risk profile of the opportunity;
    •   determine the nature and extent of the further geological, environmental,
        marketing, or other work needed to be undertaken during the feasibility study;
    •   determine the costs and time to undertake this work and prepare a feasibility
        study, including an estimate of the costs and time to develop the project following
        completion of the feasibility study;
    •   identify the resources, personnel and services required to undertake further work
        on the opportunity; and
    •   provide a comprehensive report with supporting appendices that includes a
        recommendation to proceed or otherwise.


3.2.3   Feasibility study / Documentation for the authorization of intervention works

120. In essence, an investment is a dynamic process that undergoes changes and
adaptations at various times . A feasibility study (FS) (for development of new assets) /
Documentation for the authorization of intervention works (DALI) (for work on existing
assets) provides a comparison basis for any subsequent changes/adjustments and ensures
the initiator of the project that its purpose is fulfilled.

121. The feasibility study / DALI represents establishes the main technical and
economic indicators corresponding to the investment’s objective based on its necessity
and opportunity. It contains functional, technological, building, and economic solutions.
This study can be used by evaluators in order to verify the project’s contribution to the
achievement of the financing program’s objectives and the quality, maturity, and
sustainability of the project. Exact procedures vary across different financing sources, and
particularly across EU and state-budget-funded instruments.

122. In principle, the feasibility study / DALI is the responsibility of a designer
appointed by the local government following a public procurement procedure. The
designer prepares the technical and economic content based on: information provided by
the beneficiary, preliminary studies, and solutions indicated in the approvals and
agreements (if applicable), and is liable for the technical solutions proposed.

123. A feasibility study / DALI, conducted during the Formulation phase, verifies
whether the proposed project is well founded and whether it is likely to meet the needs
of its intended target groups/ beneficiaries. The study should design the project in full
operational detail, taking account of all policy, technical, economic, financial, institutional,
management, environmental, socio-cultural, and gender-related aspects. The study will
provide the Funding Authority and partner government with sufficient information to
justify acceptance, modification, or rejection of the proposed project for financing.

124. The feasibility study / DALI should be seen not as a standalone document, but as
a phase of the project process. This is because these studies will be accompanied by




                                                                                                   29
preliminary surveys (topographical, geotechnical, hydraulic surveys, technical inspection
reports, etc.), by approvals and permits, by plans, calculations of the amounts required for
executing the construction, and by financial, risk, and sensitivity analyses.

125. A feasibility study / DALI must be genuine and conducted in depth. It underpins
the investment decision of the local authorities and presents arguments in favor of
funding to the management authorities of the funding programs. It is not a simple
bureaucratic document and it has long-term implications.

126. During the study process, alternative project configurations can be studied and
decisions can be made on whether or not to proceed with project development and, if
the decision is to go forward, what the optimum configuration is. However, once a
decision to proceed is made, and design, procurement, and construction efforts
commence, there is little opportunity to influence the project outcome significantly.

127. In order to be effective, a feasibility study / DALI should address the following
issues:
    • The purpose of the project: The issue or the need that the investment project is to
        satisfy must be clearly defined. In this respect, clear data must be presented
        concerning the need of the project / target group. In addition, all project
        stakeholders must be defined, as well as their potential influence on its successful
        implementation.
    • The current analysis / current situation: The FS / DALI must provide concrete data
        about the current situation of the infrastructure and must present the limits for
        the analysis of such data. The more complex the projects, the longer, more costly
        and more complex the research of data and technical situation are. The quality of
        the proposed solution and – ultimately – the efficiency of the project directly
        depend on the quality of the input data.
    • The proposed solution: Potential solutions can be indicated as early as the pre-
        feasibility study phase, so that they can be defined in more technical details in the
        feasibility study. The Romanian law (GD no. 28/2008) on feasibility studies
        requires explaining whether the solution chosen is the result of a pre-feasibility
        study. The technical solution proposed must be chosen based on a multi-criteria
        analysis highlighting the benefits of the proposal. Once the best technical solution
        has been established, it requires a very detailed description both in terms of
        technical elements and in terms of its effectiveness. The following questions
        should be answered: does the solution meet the requirements / purpose of the
        project and is it a viable and effective solution?
    • The assessment of the economic efficiency of the project: Once the solution has
        been defined, it must be quantified in money and the costs thus calculated should
        be compared to the benefits of the project. If projects are small or their impact is
        low, it is sometimes sufficient that the project costs be estimated and the benefits
        obtained be listed; as the investment grows, it requires a cost-benefit analysis and
        a risk analysis.




                                                                                                30
128.    In addition to the above elements, the feasibility study / DALI should also:
    •   Ensure that the budget is sufficient for the investment. The FS / DALI identifies the
        risks of exceeding the costs and proposes risk mitigation measures.
    •   Identify potential impediments from the stakeholders and enables them to get
        involved in the project from its initial phases. For example, environmental
        authorities or the utility suppliers can contribute to designing the solutions.
    •   Draft an implementation plan and define the critical phases and moments.
    •   Provide a basis for defining the Terms of Reference for the participants in other
        phases of the project (design, implementation).

129. Some of the problems found with Feasibility Studies/DALI in Romania currently
include the following:
    • Insufficient alternative analysis for FS: Instead of presenting different technical
        solutions, it contains one or two variations of the same solution;
    • Lack of support studies (field studies) or inconsistencies between the FS / DALI
        and the support studies;
    •   There are not enough explanations regarding the context of the project
        throughout the FS / DALI: correlation with regional/national strategies or
        programs is not sufficiently presented;
    •   While the technical solution is not fully developed and described, cost estimates
        are required to be as accurate as possible. The value of basic investment
        calculated at FS / DALI level is the base for the financing contract. Any deviation
        from that value is seen as a deviation from the contract. Most of the financing
        programs in Romania do not approve any overrun of costs or switching between
        cost types. But these modifications of basic costs appear all over during the
        implementation period: at the detailed design phase, at procurement phase, and
        during the investment period.
    •   In some cases, the estimated cost does not contain all types of expenditure
        necessary to implement a project (e.g., publicity, costs related to Project
        Implementation Unit activity, etc.).

130. The objective of FS / DALI is to transform a project idea into a specific plan,
identifying and comparing alternatives with a view to developing different approaches,
satisfying a need, and implementing the original idea. The creation of an information set
enables the competent government authorities to take well-founded, justified decisions in
allocating resources for public investments. Such studies also enable the early
identification of obstacles to the implementation of investment programmes and thereby
accelerate the subsequent design and implementation process.

131. As mentioned before, the main difference between FS and DALIs is their use –
the first are dedicated to new constructions, and the latter to existing ones. Also,
another difference between the two types of documentation is the fact that in feasibility
studies the designer analyses two solutions and proposes one of them, unlike the DALI
phase, which is based on solutions from the expertise made by a technical expert,




                                                                                                31
authorized by MRDPA. Usually, a technical expertise evaluates existing constructions and
proposes recommendations for their improvement.

132. Another difference between the FS and DALI concerns the financial review.
According to GD 28/2008, it is mandatory for feasibility studies to also contain a cost -
benefit analysis in order to sustain the chosen solution, unlike DALI, which does not
contain such an analysis. Usually, the cost benefit analysis is required for PNDL projects for
both types of studies (this happens mostly because of the lack of knowledge of the
beneficiaries, who tend to confuse FS with DALI).

133. The broad purpose of the cost-benefit analysis is to help decision-making and to
make it more rational. More specifically, the objective is to have more efficient allocation
of stakeholders´ resources. Cost-benefit analysis was initially used in the U.S. in the
1930’s, but now cost -benefit analysis is used in many different contexts for many different
purposes.

134. The standard cost-benefit analysis is conducted while a project or policy is under
consideration, independent of its type, before it is started or implemented. The cost-
benefit analysis assists in the decision about whether resources should be allocated by
government or the company to a specific project or policy, or not. In situations in which
analysts care only about efficiency, cost-benefit analysis provides a method for making
direct comparisons among alternative policies.

135. Given the fact that a feasibility study/DALI is also about the delivery of a
business plan, not just construction of a road, process plant and infrastructure project,
construction cost is but one measure of business success. Construction schedule, ramp-
up time, product quality, product output, operating cost, safety and environmental
outcomes are all key measures of business success for a resource development project,
and published information on these measures of project success is also virtually non-
existent.

3.2.4   Detailed design

136. Excellence in project execution is required just to maintain the value
opportunity created from a good feasibility study, and excellence in project operation is
required to deliver the value. A poorly defined project will not deliver the same outcome
as a well-defined project no matter how well executed and operated. Little scope exists to
add or create value during project execution.

137. The phase of detailed technical design has to follow Order 863/2008 of the
Ministry of Development, Public Works and Housing. This presents all stages to follow in
order to obtain a complete documentation. More aspects of detailed technical design are
presented in the following chapter.




                                                                                                 32
3.3   Financing opportunities

138. There are many financing programs available to support different infrastructure
projects. Most of them require that a Feasibility Study (FS) / Documentation for the
authorization of intervention works (DALI) should be prepared according to GD 28/2008.
The legislation presents the structure of the document and the structure of the General
Cost Estimate. It is important to mention that in comparison to other countries, the
Romanian FS stands between preliminary design or concept design and detailed technical
design. It describes the status of the infrastructure, analyses several technical solutions
and presents the proposed solutions from the technical point of view as well from the
socio-economic impact point of view. The General Cost Estimate should include cost
estimates for basic investment, taxes, engineering and consultancy, land acquisitions, and
utilities.

139. Since Romania wanted to access pre-accession EU funds, the country has started
to implement a clearer legislation in this field . The first funding programs available for
the local public authorities included PHARE, ISPA and SAPARD. Whereas ISPA and PHARE
were available for higher value projects, a number of smaller rural projects were funded
under SAPARD.

140. Each of these programs defined its own requirements for drafting the
preliminary studies, especially the Feasibility Study. The difference between the
feasibility studies normally prepared by public authorities and those prepared for
accessing European funds is that, in the latter case, the initiators had to prove the efficient
management of money spent. Thus, there was an emphasis on the existing demand, on
alternative solutions and on the economic efficiency of the projects.

141. With the emergence of post-accession funding programs during the financial
period 2007-2014, the requirements and structure of the preliminary studies were more
clearly defined. GD no. 28/2008 has been used as a basis for most of the feasibility studies
prepared by the public authorities.

142. Programs such as ROP, SOP Environment, or SOP Transport defined assessment
criteria for funding applications, which also included the technical elements for
assessing both the technical documentation and the solutions proposed. Thus, a number
of shortcomings of GD no. 28/2008 were addressed and the quality of the documents
drafted under those programs is higher.

143. The projects for road building or modernization were financially supported
under the ROP (county roads, urban local network), SOP Transport (national roads and
highways) and EAFRD (roads of local interest – in the communes). In addition to the
structure requested by GD no. 28/2008, the following elements were also requested or
considered a plus:
    • Traffic studies: Any proposed rehabilitation of county / national roads had to be
        done depending on traffic needs. In the case of SOP-T, traffic studies had to be
        drafted starting from the count done at FS level and not from the nationally




                                                                                                  33
       available data [The Center for Road Technical Studies and Informatics (CESTRIN),
       every 5 years];
   •   Alternative technical solutions: The studies had to describe at least two road
       structures or different locations;
   •   A rigorous assessment of costs, including bills of quantities (ROP);
   •   Clear maintenance plans, emphasizing maintenance costs. HDM4 (developed by
       the World Bank) was used for a while, but it is no longer used because of the
       different calibration of the data modules;
   •   Rigorous CBA, emphasizing VOC and VTTS: In recent years, on the basis of the
       transport master plan, the projects provided unified data at national level
       regarding the economic unit costs;
   •   A higher score was obtained for the existence of approvals and for overcoming
       potential challenges – such as environmental issues;
   •   The integration of the project in the national / regional strategy and its correlation
       with other projects.

144. The projects for building or modernization of water systems, sanitation
networks, and treatment plants were financially supported under SOP Environment and
the EAFRD. In addition, the following elements were also requested or considered a plus:
    • Willingness-to-pay surveys: Market studies were performed as a primary research
       on the users’ willingness to tolerate increases in charges;
    • Operational and maintenance plan, drafted in detail: Institutional elements were
       discussed and presented – who will operate the network, what are the
       parameters?
    • Advanced hydrogeological surveys;
    • A rigorous assessment of costs, including bills of quantities;
    • Rigorous CBA - both financial and economic analysis;
    • A higher score was obtained for the existence of approvals and for overcoming
       potential challenges - such as environmental issues;
   •   The integration of the project with the water master plans at local / regional level.

145. The projects for building or upgrading the social infrastructure were financially
supported under ROP (schools, hospitals, healthcare centers). In addition to the
structure requested by GD no. 28/2008, the following elements were also requested or
considered a plus:
    • Clear presentation of the needs of the target groups: A higher score was obtained
        for projects covering a larger target group or proposing additional solutions;
    • Integration of the project in the national / regional strategy and its correlation
        with other projects serving the same target group;
    • Clear presentation of the structure that would operate the infrastructure and of
        the related costs;
    • Alternative technical solutions;
    • A rigorous assessment of costs, including bills of quantities (ROP);
    • A higher score was obtained for the existence of approvals and for overcoming
        potential challenges – such as those related to utility providers.




                                                                                                34
3.4      PNDL-specific issues

146. The project preparation assumes the elaboration of the prefeasibility and
feasibility / DALI studies. These are very important in the selection process of the
projects’ funding, as they offer the economic justification (one of the criteria potentially
used in the PNDL process of prioritizing new or existing projects). There were more
solutions implemented in order to help the beneficiaries prepare the technical
documentation. One of them was to finance these documents at the central level, but this
solution did not impose a direct link with the local authorities and sometimes the
technical experts employed did not take into consideration relevant problems, and the
eligible expenditures were not clear. This then led to significant issues during
implementation and to large ineligible costs.

147. The pre-application stage is very important as it can generate delays and
problems, during both the evaluation and implementation stages. If the applicant
prepares complete and correct forms, the verification process of the documentation will
be easier for MRDPA. The report under Component 2 underlines the fact that this stage
should involve active engagement and one-to-one exchanges with potential beneficiaries
and appointment of a liaison person for the MRDPA is suggested in this respect. In
addition, there is a recommendation regarding the promotion of good practices with
respect to the technical solutions and technologies to be deployed and the training of
potential applicants so that they can assure better project designs and accordingly a
smoother implementation of the project.

148. PNDL explicitly notes that the responsibility for preparing the initial technical
documentation belongs entirely to the local authorities. The methodological norms
specify a list of non-eligible expenditures (article 8 (3)), including feasibility studies,
specialty studies, technical assistance, taxes, etc.). That means that the beneficiaries
directly contract technical experts (typically based on the lowest bid criterion), but even
so the quality of the documentation is still unsatisfactory due to the lack of capacity and
proper accountability mechanisms.

149. Some of the problems that occurred during the last programming period
(especially in small communities that lack staff and financial resources) are connected to
the poor training of the designers and the insufficient time they had in order to develop
technical projects. Another factor is related to the local authorities’ lack of capacity to
draft stronger contracts (e.g., to cover the errors and poor-quality work of the designers
and verifiers, even if discovered after the project is received by the beneficiary) and
properly verify the documentation they receive.

150. The PNDL Methodological Norms include a clear template for project proposals,
which applies to both new and ongoing investments . 10 This asks for the following data:
the name of the project; the name of the applicant/local authority; the location of the
project; main physical characteristics; total value of the investment; total value of eligible
costs to be financed from the PNDL; data regarding the design contract (contract ID

     See Annex 2 of the PNDL Methodological Norms




                                                                                                 35
number, value, etc.); and, for ongoing investments, data regarding the construction works,
the percentage of the project completed to date, and the deadline for project completion.

151. Considering the three areas of intervention of PNDL – road infrastructure, water
and wastewater infrastructure, and social infrastructure – the FS should address the
following issues:
     • Define the project application: it quantifies the network users and it identifies
        their needs, it presents clues about their willingness to pay, ;
     • Present the detailed technical condition of the existing infrastructure and of the
        network operator. If the investment is (operationally) part of a regional / national
        network, integration requirements are also identified. In the case of new
        networks, it identifies who will operate the network. Topographical and
        geotechnical surveys provide information about the land;
     • Build upon the existing data, it defines and analyzes various technical solutions. It
        assesses them from a monetary perspective and proposes the most efficient one.
        It makes sure that the designed network is regionally correlated with other
        initiatives and that it meets specific quality and environmental requirements;
     • Present a project implementation plan. It presents risks that may affect the
        implementation and proposes preventive measures;
    •   Present methods of operation and maintenance plans and ensure that the
        necessary funds will be available.

152. In order to apply for funding through the PNDL, the applicant must prepare a FS/
DALI in accordance with GD no. 28/2008. The guidelines do not provide a structure for
assessing FS / DALI or for scoring / prioritizing the projects. In practice, the verification
process focuses on eligibility and conformity aspects.

153. A Bank team of technical experts has reviewed a sample of feasibility studies /
DALIs prepared by PNDL applicants and found a range of inconsistencies:
    • Old and outdated documentations;
    • No FS / DALI presented in the project application – for road infrastructure, the
       traffic study and traffic data were missing;
    • The projects did not meet the eligibility conditions for the PNDL (they were
       oversized or undersized).
    • There was no clear correlation with the requirements of the target group and with
       the regional level policy / strategy.
    • No technical expertise was presented for modernizing buildings.
    • There were no topographical and geomorphological studies. The current condition
       of the infrastructure and utilities was unclear.
    • Alternative technical solutions were not always presented;
    • Cost assessments were flawed – the cost standards proposed in the guidelines for
       eligible expenses were not followed;
    • There were no commitments to sustained operation. There were no maintenance
       plans or realistic long-term cost estimates.
    •   The availability of the approvals/permits was not always clear.




                                                                                                36
154. Another common problem found in the technical feasibility studies concerns the
technical standards used. In the content of technical and economic documents reference
was made to design standards that were replaced according to the Order of the Minister
of Transport, Constructions, and Tourism No. 620/2005 and replaced with Eurocodes,
approved as national standards and used as reference norms in the technical regulations
in construction. Thus, the technical-economic documentation appears to be treated
superficially and not represent a foundation of technical design in accordance with Order
no. MDLPL 863/2008 for approving the "Guidelines for the implementation of certain
specifications of Government Decision No. 28/2008.” Specific technical sol utions are
delivered only at the detailed design phase, which leads to changes in solution and
amounts to the FD / DALI phase. Taking certain products (for instance building materials)
without complying with national and EU-level legislation may lead to changes in the
execution phase solution and rejecting those products and/or work stages, generating
extra costs for the beneficiary.

155. The failure to comply with cost standards is obvious in the case of new
investments, where the cost standard does not take into consideration all the
requirements laid down in the specific design standards. For example, the Standard
INDEX NP01197 – STANDARD ON THE DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION OF
KINDERGARTEN BUILDINGS – stipulates the following functionalities that are not
reproduced in the cost standard:
    • Offices and storage areas for clean and dirty laundry, including the related
       endowments – according to Article T.P.2.1.: “When cooking and laundering (or
       either of the two activities) are performed outside the kindergarten, suitable
       containers will be provided for transporting food and adjacent rooms will be
       provided for storing and washing the dinner sets, cutlery and dishes, for heating
       food and / or rooms for collecting dirty linen and storing clean laundry”;
    • Staff office and medical office – according to T.P.2.4. Rooms for educational and
       care staff;
    • Areas for the movement of the service and care staff, who constitute a separate
       functional flow; they must not be fully embedded in the multifunctional
       playground, so that children have no access to the areas destined exclusively for
       the staff, in accordance with the rules for safe operation;
    •   Constructions and furnishings on the premises (in the yard) of the kindergarten
        according to Article T.P.4.

156. Other inconsistencies between the baseline project stipulated in the cost
standard and the design standard:
    • In the baseline project, the amount of RON 11,415.00 was stipulated for
       machinery and technological equipment – an understated amount, considering
       that the boiler necessary for producing heat is alone worth approximately RON
       30,000.00. This amount should be added to the other machines and technological
       equipment;
    • In the baseline project, the amount of RON 43,340 was earmarked for
       endowments – an understated amount, considering that the strictly necessary
       endowments for the proper functioning of a full-day kindergarten (bed + mattress




                                                                                            37
        set, cabinet for the storage of blankets, table + chair sets for children, table + 4
        chairs sets for children, refrigerator, stove, hood, microwave oven, dishwasher,
        washing machine, tumble dryer, cutlery and crockery set, bedding set, pillow and
        quilt set for children, waterproof bedsheet for children) exceed RON 95,000;
    •   Given the above, the Applicant is forced on the one hand to comply with the
        specific design standard and on the other hand to comply with the requirements
        of Order no. 1851 / 2013 of the Minister of Regional Development and Public
        Administration approving the Methodological norms for implementing the
        provisions of Government Emergency Ordinance No. 28/2013, which approved
        the National Program for Local Development (as subsequently amended and
        supplemented). In particular, Article 8 (2) stipulates that the expenses estimated
        in the general estimate must fall under the provisions of the cost standards in
        force;
    •   This issue can be solved:
            o either by updating and harmonizing the unit costs laid down in the cost
                 standards, according to GD no. 363 / 2010 on the approval of cost
                 standards for publicly funded investment objectives (as subsequently
                 amended and supplemented);
            o or by introducing the concepts of “eligible costs” and ”ineligible costs”,
                 which would allow the Beneficiary to comply with specific design
                 requirements, to choose the technical solution that suits the project’s
                 specific needs and to adequately cover cost overruns included in the
                 chapter on basic investment in the General Estimate.

157. The investment costs stipulated in the General Estimate are not based on the
bills of quantities and related unit prices. These requirements are laid down in the
following regulatory acts:
     • GD no. 28/2008 - Annex 4, Article 13 – “The cost estimate of the item, as drawn
         up in the design phase – feasibility study / documentation for the approval of
         intervention works – shall be revised taking into account the quantities of works
         estimated in the conceptual design phase and the unit prices following the
         implementation of public procurement procedures”;
     • Order no. 863/2008 of the Minister of Development, Public Works, and Housing –
         Annex, Article 1: “The technical project must enable the drafting of execution
         details in accordance with the proposed materials and execution technology, in
         strict compliance with the provisions of the technical project, without requiring
         additional works and without exceeding the cost of the works determined in the
         feasibility study / approval documentation phase.”

158. The requirements of GD no. 363/2010 on the approval of cost standards for
publicly funded investment objectives (as subsequently amended and supplemented)
leave room for interpretation . The lack of substantiation of the investment costs in the FS
/ DALI phase can result in blocking the investment and in using public funds for unfinished
investments if the General Estimate is understated, or in the tying-up of public funds in
one investment to the detriment of others if the General Estimate is overstated.




                                                                                               38
159. GD no. 363/2010 makes the following statement under the Notes on the unit
cost: “Such increases in the unit cost that are mainly due to the influence of the seismic
and climate features of the area considered for determining the location of the
investment, and / or to geomorphological features of the foundation soil that are different
from the features of the baseline investment, shall be justified distinctly in the
documentation for the approval of the technical and economic indicators of the
investment”; however, it does not specify which concrete elements may be overrun and
how much they can be exceeded. This issue could be solved if the MRDPA provided an
instruction concerning the cases that allow cost standard overruns.

160. Another aspect of the technical and economic documents submitted for the
PNDL is the usefulness and the quality of the cost-benefit analysis . According to GD no.
28/2008 and as mentioned before, cost-benefit analysis should be performed only for new
investments (during the FS phase) and not for rehabilitation projects. While there is a
consensus that full social and economic analysis should be prepared only for major
projects, the definition of the CBA to be prepared for PNDL projects seems vague and adds
little value. First, the requirements do not clear differentiate economic and financial
analysis (while both can be performed as CBA) and does not specify standard parameters
to be applied which would make alternative projects comparable. The definition and role
of CBA for PNDL projects should be reviewed.

161. In the case of interventions to existing buildings, it was found that the
rehabilitation works were not justified, because the proposed interventions maintained
an improper situation that did not comply with the standards and norms specific for the
operation of the building . For example, the rehabilitation of a secondary school is
proposed; the school building also houses a kindergarten. Neither of the two functions
(school/kindergarten) observes the rules on traffic flows and has the required areas
stipulated in the specific design standards. Under these circumstances, it is necessary that
the building be upgraded by resizing and reorganizing it in order to comply with the
specific standards. This issue could be solved by introducing a phase of technical and
economic assessment of the documentation, after which such non-conformities can be
corrected at minimum cost.

162. Another problem identified in the assessment of the technical and economic
documents submitted under the PNDL is that the urban planning certificates issued are
incomplete, i.e., they do not require the approvals imposed by the nature of the
investment and the urban infrastructure in the area studied. Most often, the approvals
issued by the water and electricity operator are missing, although they are necessary since
network changes and even new consumers are anticipated. There is no specific legislation
or guidelines to regulate the type of approvals / agreements required for each type of
investment. In the case of changes related to the utility networks, the FS is not based on a
solution study; the latter is obtained after the economic and technical documentation has
been drafted and, many times, it leads to a change in the technical solution.

163. The projects covering new educational or health infrastructure objectives
require staff employed by the State through the line ministries . Such projects do not
include approvals from competent institutions, because the suitability of initiating them




                                                                                               39
must be also undertaken by the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Health,
respectively, through a commitment issued by the subordinated territorial bodies
concerning the availability of qualified personnel to be assigned to such future
institutions.

164. Errors were found in most of the technical and economic documents. In the
calculation of the General Estimate, they consisted of failing to comply with the unit costs
and maximum limits for certain types of expenses laid down in the cost standards – GD
no. 363/2010, as subsequently supplemented (e.g., the Program contribution and the own
contribution were inaccurate).

165. The result of an economic feasibility study, by definition, will be that the project
is feasible and should be advanced to the design and construction phases or that it is not
feasible and should therefore not move forward. However, current practices in
infrastructure projects show that the second possibility rarely considered. This can be
attributed in many cases to the procedures adopted by awarding studies of economic
feasibility to engineering consultants. When the owner awards a contract to an
engineering consultant to perform a detailed economic feasibility study for a certain
infrastructure project, this phase entails a considerable commitment of time and financial
resources to perform the study. Unfortunately, once a project is advanced to this stage,
the implied assumption is that the project is feasible.

3.5       Conclusions

166. Beneficiaries of PNDL and other infrastructure funding should take into
consideration multiple key issues when preparing the technical documentation in order
to assure that the proposals are complete and in line with legal provisions. These issues
include the type of documentation and annexes, the content of the documentation, the
local / county council decisions, and the budget. See Annex 3 (Recommendations for
improving applications; technical documentation from Component 2 report).

167. GD no. 28/2008 is the main law regulating the drafting of the technical
documentation for infrastructure investments in Romania. The law is not sufficiently
clear and detailed, therefore a number of errors – in form and content – occur in the
document drafting process, subsequently affecting the implementation of the investment.

168.       Minimum requirements for the FS / DALI include:
      •    It must comply with the structure of GD no. 28/2008
      •    It must be assumed by the designer
      •    It must clearly present the current situation
      •    It must present the situation of the users / application
      •    It must clearly present the correlation with cost standards
      •    It must submit plans for at least the following specialties: architecture, strength,
           installations.




                                                                                                  40
169.    The stages for preparatory planning should follow the scheme below:

                            Figure 3. Ideal preparatory planning




170. One solution, proposed in the Component 2 Report on the PNDL prioritization
criteria, would be for the MRDPA to endorse standard contract forms as part of the
public procurement documentation in order to assure that qualified, professional
bidders enter the competition. Good practices that refer not only to the pre-feasibility
and feasibility stages, but also to the detailed technical design, include a clear stipulation
of the designer’s responsibility to deliver high-quality outputs, a complete timeline for
every deliverable, including payment terms, and clear requirements that all property
rights over the technical documentation belong to the beneficiary.

171. The cost-benefit analysis can become more useful – for demonstrating the
feasibility of the proposed investments – with clear definition and role and by including a
minimal, yet standardized methodology that does not require great efforts on the part
of the applicants. Consequently, all projects would be analyzed by using the same unit of
measurement, thus helping with the prioritization of the funding proposals. Drafting an
economic analysis, albeit a minimal one can ensure the beneficiary that the FS can be
submitted for financing from multiple sources. Most European funding programs require
an economic analysis, irrespective of the project value.

172. Introducing a phase of technical and economic assessment of the
documentation would ensure that technical non -conformities could be corrected at
minimum cost. Thus, it can be determined whether solutions adopted meet standards in
force and can be implemented without additional costs.




                                                                                                 41
173. It is also recommended to consider introducing a standardized financial model
to facilitate the Beneficiary’s work a nd to prevent errors at the same time. Errors were
found in the calculation of the General Estimate: failing to comply with the unit costs and
maximum limits for certain types of expenses laid down in the cost standards – GD no.
363/2010, as subsequently a djusted (e.g., the program’s estimated contribution and the
beneficiary’s own contribution were inaccurate).

174. New infrastructure projects may require Environment Impact Assessments.
These assessments may include hydrology studies, nature studies, etc., depending on the
project. Therefore, it is possible that a given site will be inappropriate and that another
site is needed. Results of the study are to be made public through a public hearing where
objections to the project may be heard. Depending on the location, it is possible that
significant objections will be raised by NGOs, the public in general, and/or the press. If so,
the project may need to be modified and the public educated on the details of the new
project.

175. Feasibility studies for major projects should be reviewed and analyzed by
experts in order to enhance their quality. This process can be done in the following
sequence:
    •   Asking the award winning consultant who is preparing the feasibility study to
        submit a draft of the study to the beneficiary before submitting the final feasibility
        study report for approval.
    •   After getting the draft study, the beneficiary needs to ask experts in this area to
        review the document. Peer reviewers can be selected from local and/or
        international consultant offices, economic experts, and academic people. They
        can be inside resources (e.g., City Hall staff) or outside consultants.
    •   Peer reviewers are required to answer the primary question: Is the study
        appropriately prepared? They would submit a report that includes: (a) a critical
        review of the draft feasibility study; (b) identification of major deficiencies and/or
        areas of weakness in the draft, if any; and (c) specific recommendations to
        improve the study.
    •   The award-winning consultant should include this review as an appendix in the
        final submitted study, and should respond and address all comments in theses
        reviews to the satisfaction of the owner of the project.

4      Well-designed Infrastructure


4.1      The Romanian system for quality in construction

176. The Romanian system for quality in construction is centered on Law no.
10/1995, which aims to promote the development of sustainable infrastructure works.
Primary categories covered by this law are correlated with EU Regulation no. 305/2011 of
the European Parliament and of the Council from March 9, 2011, and are related to:
structural engineering and stability; safety in use; fire safety measures; hygiene, health,
and environmental protection; insulations and energy efficiency; and noise protection.
Fulfilling the required norms under each category is the responsibility of “all stakeholders
involved in the design, build, use, and reuse of constructions,” which include investors,
researchers, designers, project verifiers, producers and distributors of construction
materials, contractors, owners, users, technical experts, public authorities, and
professional associations. 11 Law 10 also defines the system of quality in construction to
include the following:
          a. Technical regulations for constructions;
          b. Quality of products used;
          c. Technical specifications for new products and procedures;
          d. Verification of projects, implementation of works, and ratings of buildings and
              constructions;
          e. Key parties responsible for ensuring quality of constructions;
          f. Laboratories for related construction tests and assessments;
          g. Measurements;
          h. Formal approval and reception of works;
          i. Evolution of constructions during use and interventions required over time;
          j. Ex-post use of buildings/materials (e.g., upon demolishment);
          k. Public monitoring and control of quality in constructions. 12

177. Technical regulations are established by norms and procedures and address the
design, calculation and composition, execution, and operation of the construction .
Minimum quality standards are established through technical regulations and are required
for construction, and products and procedures used in construction. Certification of
quality products used in construction is performed by manufacturers in accordance with
the methodology and procedures established by the law. Technical approvals for
products, processes and new equipment in construction determines, in accordance with
the legislation, their suitability for use, conditions of manufacture, transportation, storage,
and maintenance of their work.

178. State quality control in construction is exercised by the State Construction
Inspectorate (ISC), subordinated to the MRDPA. The ISC is responsible for the state’s
control of the unitary application of legal provisions in the field of construction quality.

                                                                                                  43
179. Quality technical verifications are mandatory to ensure optimum detailed
design. Specialists certified as technical verifiers must carry out technical quality
verification; they must be civil engineers with a minimum of 8 years design experience,
certified by the MRDPA’s professional examination. Technical verifiers must be different
and independent of the design specialists who elaborated the projects. In practice,
however, this principle is not always followed, which creates a conflict of interest and
aggravates the risk of failing to correct potential errors during the design verification
phase.

180. The quality of the construction execution is mandatory and carried out by
investors through specialized site supervisors . Site inspectors are civil engineers (the site
inspectors certification procedure approved by Order no. 1496/13.05.2011 of the Ministry
of Regional Development and Tourism and MRDT Order no. 277/19.03.2012 approving
and supplementing the Site Inspectors Certification Procedure, as approved by Order no.
1496/13.05.2011 of the Ministry of Regional Development and Tourism) with a minimum
of 3 years of experience, certified by professional examination by the ISC.

181. For rehabilitation/modernization of existing constructions, technical expertise
may be needed and for buildings an energy efficiency audit is also required. This is a
complex activity that includes, where appropriate, research, experiments or tests, studies,
surveys, analyzes and assessments necessary to understand the technical condition of
existing constructions or how a project meets the requirements of law, in order to
fundament the intervention measures. Only certified technical experts can carry out
technical expertise of the constructions or technical projects.

182. The evaluation of the environmental impact is done according to Order
860/2002, respecting Law no. 137/1995. Based on this, an approval needs to be given for
any type of rehabilitation or construction that might have a negative impact on the
environment.

183. The owners, investors, and construction managers sign separate contracts for
verification or technical review/control. Construction companies that perform
construction works ensure the level of quality corresponding to essential requirements,
through their own staff and through certified supervisors responsible for execution and
through their own quality control system.

184. The authorization of laboratories for analysis and testing in construction activity
represents a component of quality system established by Law no. 10/1995 regarding the
quality in construction . This way the technical competence of laboratories is officially
recognized, in order for them to perform analyzes and specific tests for constructions, and
their legal competence to issue valid documents to attest the quality of construction
works.

185. The final approval is a component of the quality system in construction. It is the
document through which the investor declares his acceptance regarding the construction
and gives his approval to put it into use. By the act of “reception,” it is certified that the
contractor has fulfilled his obligations in accordance with the contract and execution




                                                                                                 44
documentation. Acceptance of construction is performed both for new works and for
interventions on existing construction (repairs, strengthening, changes, modernizations,
extensions, etc.). The acceptance is made by the investor/owner, with the participation of
involved parties (designer, constructor, site inspector and/or specialized representatives
such as State Inspectorate in Constructions’ inspector) and is performed in two steps:
    • Acceptance at completion of the works;
    • Final acceptance at the end of the defects liability / warranty period.

4.2     Analysis of current technical standards used for infrastructure projects in Romania, and
        their conformity with UE standards

186. Engineers must follow the regulations and standards in force for any type of
construction design related to roads, water and wastewater infrastructure, or social
buildings. According to Government Ordinance (GO) No. 39/1998 and Law no. 355/2002,
the statute of standards is voluntary, unlike regulations and norms, which are mandatory.

187. Based on the current standards and norms, the Technical Specifications (TS) are
elaborated. They represent the technical documentation that explains every step of the
technological process for the realization of construction elements: resistance elements,
enveloping elements, partition elements, and finishing elements. TS content is not
regulated at the national level, each design company using its own more or less complete
TS. Contractors then usually fail to consider the TS submitted by the designers, as they
have their own execution solutions based on current practice that does not always rely on
performance criteria.

188. Unlike other developed countries, Romania is still using technical standards that
are 10-20 years old or even older. The alignment process of Romanian standards to
European ones is currently being implemented, but unfortunately, it takes time and the
harmonization is done gradually. Thus, peculiar situations appear when conflictual
standards coexist, or for a specific test/material, the old standard was canceled, without
adopting a new one. This way, the design of Romanian roads cannot be at the same level
with the roads designed in developed countries, where the standards are renewed once
every 2-3 years.

4.2.1    Road sector specificities

189. Romania’s road network requires major investments. As of June 2016, the
country continues to lack a highway connecting Constanța in the East to the western
border, where over 70% of Romania’s exports go to. In the aggregate, in 2012, 34,000 km
of county and communal roads were made of dirt or gravel and required modernization,
at a cost of around EUR 8.1 billion. An additional 21,000 km of county and communal
roads only had surface treatment and required rehabilitation. The Component 2 report on
improved prioritization criteria for the National Local Development Program (PNDL), as
well as the Component 1 report on coordination of strategies and investment programs
look at regional specificities in terms of investment needs for the roads sector. The current




                                                                                                45
report focuses on the choice of designs and technologies, keeping in mind that different
parts of the country face a specific set of needs.

190. Countries typically manage their road systems following administrative and
functional classifications. The former assigns road ownership and the latter defines
technical requirements and maintenance practices, and influence the administrative
classification and financing. In many countries, these two classifications are gradually
converging. Functional classification is based on the role that different sections of roads
play in the road network system as well as traffic volume and traffic structure. It is
recognized as an indispensable tool for rational assessment and assignment of
responsibilities in the road sector. For numerous reasons, including transferability of
benchmarks and comparison of performance indicators, it would be beneficial if it used
common criteria.

191. In developed countries, road management is usually based on functional
classification of the road network. Normally, there are three road classes: Arterial,
Collector, and Local roads. Arterials serve mobility, collectors serve mobility and access to
land equally, and local roads primarily access to land with mobility as a lesser function.
There can also be foot and bicycle paths.




                                                                                                46

192. More complex and detailed classification systems are often used for design and
funding purposes. An example of a more detailed classification is shown below. The
names of road classes used by such systems are often descriptive and specific to the
countries concerned so the one provided below should be treated as an example only.
    • Arterials:
            o Principal arterials (motorways and expressways)
            o Minor arterials
    • Collectors:
            o Major collectors
            o Minor collectors
    • Locals:
            o Public local roads
            o Private local roads

193. Functional classification is important because it determines the range of the
design speed for road sections, which in turn governs the geometric standards,
pavement, and maintenance standards. The table below shows the typical key
characteristics of the three basic functional classes of roads.

194. Romanian roads are classified technically and administratively, but not
functionally. The technical classification is supplemented by comments on the function of
the road. Technical classes are, therefore, a mixture of functional and administrative
classification. For example, the E-roads can be motorways (Class I), expressways (Class II),
or two-lane highways (Class III). The national roads, County roads, and Communal roads
are assigned functional characteristics. General observations indicate that some County
roads may need to be classified as Arterial roads, while some National roads as Collector
roads. It is therefore suggested to consider undertaking a thorough functional
(re)classification study to improve classification and introduce a functional dimension. An
improved classification system could then better guide the design parameters of roads
and assure a higher level of homogeneity for the road system.

195. The classification of the Road Network in Romania is typical for many Central
and Eastern European Countries. It is defined in the Government Ordinance No. 43/1997
from 28.08.1997 referring at Roads Domain, updated at in July 2011. In terms of location
and public access, roads in Romania are divided into:
    •     Public roads : public interest roads for road and pedestrian circulation, in order to
          meet the general requirements of the transport economy, population, and
          national defense. These are public property and are maintained by public funds,
          as well as legally.
    •     Private utility roads : roads designed to meet the needs of road transport and
          pedestrians as well as economic objectives, forestry, petroleum, mining,
          agricultural, energy, industrial and other uses, access to premises, and those




                                                                                                              48
       inside them, and for organizing construction sites. These are managed by
       individuals or legal entities that own or manage.

196.   Based on traffic, roads are divided into:
   •   roads open to public traffic, including all public roads and those roads used for
       private utility that provides usually non-discriminatory access for vehicles and
       pedestrians;
   •   roads closed to public traffic, including those roads for private utility serving the
       objectives to which the public has no access, and those public interest roads
       temporarily closed to public traffic.

197. From an administrative-territorial perspective, public roads are further divided
into the following categories:
   •   national roads;
   •   county roads;
   •   local roads.

198. National roads are public state property and include highways (e.g., A1, A2, etc.)
and national roads (DNs) that provide connections to the capital of the country,
between county capitals, other locations of national interest, and with neighboring
countries. They are classified as:
    • motorways;
   •   express roads;
   •   European national roads (E);
   •   main national roads;
   •   secondary national roads.

199. County roads (DJ) are public county property and include county roads,
providing links between:
   •   county capitals and municipalities, with towns, with the residences of the
       commune authorities, with tourist resorts and other attractive locations, with
       ports and airports, with the locations related to national defense or the ones of
       historical importance;
   •   towns and municipalities, and between them and commune residences;
   •   commune residences.

200. Roads of local interest are public property attributed to administrative units,
and can be classified as:
    • communal roads (DC) that provide connections:
           o between commune residence and component villages or with other
             villages;




                                                                                               49
             o between town and villages to which it belongs as well as with other
                 villages;
             o between villages;
    •   vicinal roads (DV) - roads serving several properties that lie at distant limits;
    •   streets (DS) - public roads within the settlements, regardless of name: street,
        avenue, road, keys, embankment, roadside, alley, dead end, etc.

201. For the design of any type of road mentioned above, there are technical
standards involved, which need to be followed. There is a general standard for roads
(STAS 863), one for streets (STAS 10144), and a norm elaborated for extra urban highways
(PD 162).

202. With respect to the technical documentation for the design, construction, and
maintenance of roads, some of the national standards have been harmonized with
European ones and transformed in Romanian Standard (SR EN) documents (in the last
10 years). For example, in January 2015, the Romanian Company for Motorways and
National Roads (CNADNR) issued an internal normative 605/2015 regulating the
conditions for roads construction, replacing STAS 7970 (Road works. Base layers of hot laid
rolled bituminous mixtures. Quality technical requirements and general prescriptions for
execution) and SR 174 (Road works. Hot bituminous rolled pavements).

203. Unfortunately, the harmonization of Romanian standards with European has
remained incomplete. Thus, road engineering is still facing difficulties in working with
standards that are 20-30 years old, or even older. A list with the main Romanian standards
currently in force is included in the table below:

204. Most of the standards used for materials and laboratory tests have been
harmonized with European norms. A good example is the series SR EN 1097 - Tests for
mechanical and physical properties of aggregates, which consists of eleven parts,
presenting different laboratory testing conditions for aggregates used in road
construction.

205. There are also a series of norms and regulations elaborated directly by the
Transport Ministry. They add to the technical standards presented above and complete
them, having a mandatory status.

206. The Romanian pavement design code is similar to the ones used in the European
countries. The most important distinction is between the evaluation and design of new
and existing pavements, where modern practice has evolved to targeted, condition-
specific interventions and explicit consideration of design life, while the Romanian system
does not include such concepts. The discussion below focuses on the existing pavements
and their rehabilitation and does not apply to new pavements.

207. The actual stage of road design should include phases related to the elaboration
of the traffic study, Environmental Impact Study, Road Safety Audit, Road Safety
Inspection, topographic studies, geotechnical studies, geometric design, pavement
design, drainage design, and art works design. Noise protection of urban areas, in the




                                                                                              52
vicinity of the roads where noise arising from vehicles exceeds certain thresholds, is less
documented.

208. The Geotechnical study shall be drafted in accordance with the Standard on
geotechnical documents for constructions (Index NP 074-2014). A project auditor
certified for the “Af” quality standard in constructions must verify it: "Strength and
stability of foundation grounds and ground massifs".

209. According to Order no. 700 / 09 July 2014 of the General Manager of the
National Agency for Cadaster and Land Registration (ANCPI) approving the Rules for the
approval, acceptance and registration in the Cadaster and Land Registry records , the
topographical plans related to the feasibility studies must be accepted / approved by the
Office of Cadaster and Land Registration.

210. Road Safety Audits (RSAs) and Road Safety Inspections (RSIs) are mandatory for
all types of roads, starting from January 1, 2015. According to the law currently in force
(Law no. 265/2008) in Romania, every road project needs to be verified for all its stages
(feasibility study, detailed technical project, after construction) by accredited road safety
auditors, in order for it to comply with predefined checklists. Road safety auditors or
inspectors must be different and independent of the design specialists who elaborated the
projects.

211. Even though stipulated by current legislation, RSAs and RSIs are still not
implemented on all road projects as it is stipulated by Directive 2008/96/EC of the
European Parliament and of the Council. This happens due to multiple reasons: lack of
trained professionals (auditors/inspectors) – only 12 in the entire country; lack of clear
regulations regarding the main authority that is supposed to supervise the audits/
inspections; and also the very high prices established by the Romanian Road Authority
(ARR) (e.g., EUR 50,000 per km for new highways, EUR 15,000 per km for national road
rehabilitations, etc.). 14 Currently, instead of being independent, auditors are contracted by
the designer/constructor, even though this is against the law. Thus, present road projects
still lack road safety.

212. The main problem of the current road infrastructure in Romania is its focus on
vehicles. Usually when funds are allocated for infrastructure, they are all directed to
roads, without taking into consideration the other road users, such as pedestrians and
cyclists. It can be noticed that the standards for sidewalks, footways, and bicycle lanes are
more than 20 years old, and from a technical point of view they do not correspond to the
current traffic needs and are not harmonized with European strategies.

213. Infrastructure safety is the first aspect typically compromised when a road
project is started in Romania. Due to the shortage of financial funds, beneficiaries and
project managers tend to cut technical solutions that are related to the safety of road
users, starting with road signs and markings. The principle used is to build or rehabilitate
as many kilometers as possible, most of the time without considering their safety.

4.2.2   Water and wastewater specificities

214. Romania still has one of the least developed water and wastewater
infrastructure systems in Europe. As pointed out in the Component 2 report on
“Improved Prioritization Criteria for PNDL Projects,” d ata from the National Institute of
Statistics show that some regions are especially deficient in this respect – namely, the East
and South of the country, which also include some of the poorest counties in Romania.

                                                                                                54
This also implies that people have limited resources to dedicate to paying for water and
wastewater services that had not previously used or paid for (i.e., particularly in poor rural
areas, the average willingness to pay for drinking water and sanitation services is very
low). Similarly, the resources of subnational governments in these regions to subsidize
costs are low or often nonexistent. It follows that the choice of designs and technologies is
vital with respect to minimizing post-implementation costs such that consumers can
actually afford to connect to the newly offered services and generate sufficient revenues
to cover operations and maintenance (O&M) expenses.

215. The main principles of water management in Romania, which represent the
basis of the present regulations, in line with the EU framework, are the following:
    • water is a finite and vulnerable resource;
    • water management is organized at the river basin level;
    • integrate management for quality and quantity;
    • river basin solidarity (hydrosolidarity);
    • polluter pays;
    • user pays.

216. The water and wastewater sector is governed by a set of laws. The Ministry of
Regional Development and Public Administration has published a list of Romanian
standards in construction developed as a national version of European standards (SR -EN),
which contains 1377 regulations of which 44 refer to water and wastewater
infrastructure.

217. Generally, the Romanian law is compatible with EU directives. Nevertheless,
legislative dysfunctions are related to the fact that Romanian Law 10/95 does not address
the efficacy of a treatment process such as the treatment of water, wastewater, and
sludge. It only covers the quality of the components used for construction of WWTP
installations.

218. The most important European standards in the field of water and wastewater
are the following:
    • The Council Directive 91/271/EEC concerning urban wastewater treatment
        concerning the protection of the environment from the adverse effects of urban
        wastewater discharges and discharges from certain industrial sectors, but also the
        collection, treatment, and discharge of domestic wastewater, mixture of
        wastewater, and wastewater from certain industrial sectors.
    • The Drinking Water Directive (Council Directive 98/83/EC of November 3, 1998 on
        the quality of water intended for human consumption) concerning the quality of
        water intended for human consumption.
    • The Water Framework Directive 2000/60/EC concerning water resources
        management, which aims to protect and restore aquatic ecosystems, and to
        guarantee long-term, sustainable water usage for individuals, businesses, and the
        natural world.
    • Directive 91/676/EEC concerning the protection of waters against pollution
        caused by nitrates from agricultural sources.




                                                                                                 55
    •   Directive 76/464/EEC and “daughters” directives on pollution caused by certain
        dangerous substances discharged into the aquatic environment of the
        Community.
    •   Directive 2006/7/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 15 February
        2006 concerning the management of bathing water quality and repealing
        Directive 76/160/EEC.

219. Unfortunately, just like the case of road engineering, there are also standards in
force that are 20-30 years old or even older. Some of them can be found in the table
below:

220. In Romania, water must be treated to the standards set down in the drinking
water directive, as modified by Romanian Law no. 458/08.07.2002. The old technical
solution (before 1950) involves only mechanical treatment and chlorination before
distribution. After 1970, the water treatment is improved by manganese and ferric
removal. The new technical solutions applied after 1990 involve the ozonization of the
water, which insures better quality and better hygiene control. The chlorination is not
made any more with lime but with gaseous chlorine that can be better controlled.

221. Water suppliers use a variety of treatment processes to remove contaminants
from drinking water. These individual processes may be arranged in a “treatment
train/chain” (a series of processes applied in sequence). The most commonly used
processes include flocculation and sedimentation, filtration and disinfection for surface
water. Some treatment trains also include ion exchange and absorption to cope with




                                                                                             56
problems with residual tastes and odors or to deal with trace quantities of pesticides.
Treatment trains used for underground water are different from treatment trains used for
surface water and include ferric and manganese removal using active coal. Water utilities
select a combination of treatment processes most appropriate to treat the contaminants
found in the raw water used by the system.

222. Existing, older water distribution networks are frequently inefficient and
wasteful of water. They have grown to serve expanding towns and frequently the core
part of a network is under-sized. Pipes and their joints may be worn out. Various
techniques allow identification of the water losses using water meters, acoustic devices,
electromagnetic and chemical detection.

223. In Romania, wastewater treatment technical solutions hav e evolved
considerably. The old technical solution (before 1960) of construction of wastewater
treatment plant involved only mechanical treatment, which eliminated only solid
materials, floating materials and sand. Starting with 1980 the technical solution was based
on mechanical and biological treatment of wastewater. This technical solution involved,
however, very high power consumption and did not resolve the issue of sludge disposal.
The equipment used was of very poor quality in terms of power consumption and
reliability. After 1990, the new technologies were applied. Nowadays, the technical
solution is mechanical, biological nutrient removal tertiary stage. This solution uses less
power and reduces the quantity of sludge. The equipment is reliable and cost efficient and
the sludge could be used in agriculture, power generation, cement, and construction
industries. Acquisition of incineration industrial equipment has started. It is intended to
use big units at county level in order to minimize costs for energy and chemicals.

224. In the water and wastewater sector, the main power consumption sources are
the pumping stations. They have the technological function of carrying water between
system components and from these components through the distribution network,
ensuring service pressures required by end consumers. First stage of power consumption
reduction was achieved in Romania in 1990 by replacing the existing water supply pumps
with efficiency of 60 – 70% with new pumps with efficiency of 80 – 90%. At this moment
all water supply pumps have been replaced, which has led to a power consumption
reduction of approximately 20%. The second stage of reduction of power consumption
was achieved in 2000 by replacing the existing wastewater pumps with efficiency of 20 –
30% with new pumps with efficiency of 50 – 60%. At this moment nearly 70% of
wastewater pumps have been replaced, which translates into a power consumption
reduction of approximately 30%. The actual state of the art for lowering the power
consumption and improving the pumping system is the introduction, starting with 2010,
of the solid separation pumping system for waste water, which induces a pumping
efficiency of around 70%.


4.2.3   Social infrastructure specificities

225. Social infrastructure buildings are included in the civil buildings legislation and
are covered by the general approach of Eurocodes. A series of European standards (EN




                                                                                              57
1990 - EN 1999) provide a mandatory and common approach for the design of buildings,
civil engineering works, and construction projects. They are intended to:
     • Prove the compliance of building and civil engineering works with the basic
         requirements of the Construction Products Regulations;
     • Determine the performance of structural components, and parts / assemblies;
     • Define the technical specifications in public contracts according to the Public
         Procurement Directive;
     • Set the parameters of best practices.

226. For the design and construction of buildings and civil engineering works, the EN
Eurocodes are intended to be used in conjunction with standards for materials,
products, and test standards. The set of standards covers all aspects of construction,
namely design rules, the properties of materials, the execution of structures and special
works, specifications for construction products, as well as quality control.

227. The main aim is to ensure a more extensive use of European standardization in
policy and legislation and to improve the efficiency, coherence, and visibility of
European standardization. In terms of design in the construction field, main European
regulations are the Eurocodes with subsequent additions:

EUROCODE 1     Calculation of actions on structures
EUROCODE 2     Calculation of concrete structures
EUROCODE 3     Calculation of steel structures
EUROCODE 4     Calculation of composite structures steel-concrete
EUROCODE 5     Calculation of wood structures
EUROCODE 6     Calculation of masonry structures
EUROCODE 7     Geotechnical calculation
EUROCODE 8     Provisions for calculating the resistance of structures to seismic action
EUROCODE 9     Calculation of aluminum structures

228. In Romania, technical regulations in construction are treated in a uniform
manner in the MRDPA under the supervision of the General Technical Directorate.
Specialized technical committees were set up, which, according to Law no. 10/1995
regarding quality in construction and related regulations, have to meet three
requirements:
    • development of technical regulations for components of construction quality
         system;
    • technical approval for products, processes and equipment;
    • certification of conformity of quality for products used in construction.

229. To ensure quality parameters in order to fulfill all these performance
requirements, there were provided standards or codes, regulations, methodologies,
manuals, etc. Romanian Standards (SR) and Romanian codes (CR) are technical documents
with general character and rigorously studied. Their application is mandatory for all the
buildings. Design regulations (NP), guidelines, methodologies, manuals include additional
explanations, practical methods and models that support the effective implementation of
the standards.




                                                                                            58
230. The technical regulations in Romania aim the design, execution, reception, and
operation of constructions and related equipment. In November 1997, the Ministry of
Public Works and Regional Planning launched the program of Romanian Codes - CR for
"technical regulations for civil and industrial engineering structures for the period 1997-
2000 and harmonization with the European Union technical regulations ". CR program
elements have been defined in accordance with Eurocodes 1-9, in the attempt to become
National Application Documents (DAN), i.e., to fully take the content of ENV Eurocodes
into Romanian version. Special features and appropriate adaptation for the situation in
our country were supposed to be found in the National Annex NA.

231. Nevertheless, this program has suffered numerous interruptions and did not
correlate fully with the Eurocode. However, the technical prescriptions issued after year
2000 integrate in their content related provisions of the Eurocodes. Recently, the Ministry
of Regional Development and Public Administration published (September 2014) a list of
Romanian standards in the field of construction, developed as a national version of
European standards (SR-EN), which contains 1377 regulations.

232. According to the law in force, Romanian engineers have to take into
consideration and calculate the Energy Performance of buildings. The Law no. 372/2005,
which is the main normative act in the field of energy performance of buildings, entered
into force in January 1, 2007. Currently it is subject to a legislative proposal modification in
order to comply with the new provisions of the Energy Performance of Buildings Directive.

233. The main requirements for the energy efficiency of buildings introduced by this
law were the following:
    • Starting with January 1, 2007 all new buildings and public buildings need to be
       evaluated and have an energy performance certificate;
    • The same provision is applicable for all types of buildings (existing construction)
       starting with January 1, 2011;
    • New buildings with a surface of more than 1000sqm need to analyze the
       possibility of using alternative sources of energy; the analysis should consist in a
       feasibility study that is required by the local public authority;
    • The existing buildings with surfaces larger than 1000sqm that are undergoing
       renovation processes should seek to improve the energy efficiency of the building,
       wherever it is possible, from technical, economic and functional point of view;
    • The public buildings with a surface larger than 1000sqm should publicly display
       the energy performance certificate.

234. Design regulations apply for schools and kindergartens. Schools and high schools
are designed according to “Regulations regarding design, cons truction and operation of
buildings for schools and high-schools” - NP 010 – 1997. Kindergartens are designed
according to Regulation NP011-97. According to the kindergartens standard the
recommended number of stores for kindergartens with 6-10 groups is one ground and
one floor. For 1-5 groups the number of stores is ground floor. For schools with more than
8 classrooms the recommended number of stores is ground floor and 2 floors. For schools
with less than 8 classrooms the recommended number of stores is ground floor or ground




                                                                                                   59
floor and one floor. Buildings for schools and kindergartens designed and built with
supporting walls of brick, stone, reinforced concrete panels with concrete or steel
structure and concrete slabs have 100 years’ service lifetime. Nurseries are regulated by
the “Regulations regarding design of nurseries and special nurseries” - NP 022-1997.

235. Design regulations also apply to health facilities . Hospitals, dispensaries, and
other health facilities are designed according to general Romanian codes for building
design. They are accompanied by specific regulations, depending on their functional
particularities: “Regulations for design and verifying of hospital buildings and their
installations”- NP015-97, “Regulations for design of dispensaries and other health
facilities” - NP 021-1997 and “Regulations for design of homes of elderly and disabled
people”- NP 023-1997.

236. Design regulations exist for cultural and administrative infrastructure as well.
Cultural objectives of local interest such as libraries, museums, and cultural multi-
functional centers are designed in terms of requirements for strength, stability and
durability under Romanian general design codes for buildings, accompanied by specific
regulations depending on the functionality of these buildings: “Regulations for cultural
networks - ”P 25-1985, “Regulations for design of cultural community centers” - P 87-1986
and “Regulations for design of public audition rooms” - NP 002/0-1996.

237. The social infrastructure design for small communities does not have a proper
technical base. Regulations related to education, health, cultural, and administrative
infrastructure mentioned above have taken into account the socio- economic conditions
of the centralized state, corresponding to the ‘80s-90s. Nevertheless, decentralization is
imposing technical solutions for inter-connecting, multi-functional facilities, adapted for
small communities. These issues require technical and functional review of the technical
regulations mentioned above.

238. Earthquake engineering is the scientific field concerned with protecting society,
the natural and the man-made environment from earthquakes, by limiting the seismic
risk to socio-economically acceptable levels. Traditionally, it has been defined as the
study of the behavior of structures and geo-structures subject to seismic loading, this
considered as a subset of both structural and geotechnical engineering. However, the
tremendous costs experienced in recent earthquakes have led to an expansion of its scope
to encompass disciplines from the wider field of civil engineering and from the social
sciences, especially sociology, political science, economics and finance. The main
objectives of earthquake engineering are to:
    • Foresee the potential consequences of strong earthquakes on urban areas and
        civil infrastructure;
    • Design, construct, and maintain structures to perform at earthquake exposure up
        to the expectations and in compliance with building codes.

239. All the social infrastructure types of buildings in Romania are exposed to the risk
of earthquakes. In terms of designing new buildings in Romania, the reference standard is
P 100-1-2013 vol. I code - the seismic design of new structures, as result of a long history
of earthquakes registrations and research.




                                                                                               60
240.     Before the 1940 earthquake, in Romania most buildings were built taking into
account only the gravitational loads. The earthquake of 1940 was the first major
earthquake affecting the structures of tall buildings constructed after 1920 in Bucharest.
Consequently, in 1941 the authorities adopted the first Romanian standard aiming to
secure the buildings to seismic action, following German and Italian experience. In 1963
and 1970 new versions were developed, based on the American experience (Californian
earthquakes). The earthquake of 1977 was the first major earthquake registered by
technical instruments (seismographs) in Romania. Based on these registrations, first
version of Regulation P100 was adopted in 1978 and improved in 1981, as technical
documentation that describes the particularities of Romanian earthquakes and provides
calculation methodology for securing the buildings at seismic action. Two other important
earthquakes have shaken Romania in 1986 and 1990 and have improved the statistical
approach taken into consideration for the future three editions of this regulation. Starting
with P100-1/2004 the correlation with the European practice (Eurocode 8) was applied.

    •   CR 1-1-4 - 2012 Evaluation of wind action on construction;
    •   and specific normative for structures made of masonry, wood, concrete or steel.

242. A properly engineered structure does not necessarily have to be extremely
strong or expensive. It has to be properly designed to withstand the seismic effects while
sustaining an acceptable level of damage, but without risk of collapse and remaining safe
for users / occupiers.




                                                                                               61
4.3   Current state of research, development and innovation in Romania

243. Innovation and research in construction are poorly developed by research
institutions. The main organizations involved in the research process are the following:
the National Institute for Research in Constructions (INCERC) for civil buildings; the
Institute for Research in Transportation (INCERTRANS); the Technical Roads Studies and
Information Center (CESTRIN) for roads and bridges; and SC PROED SA, SC AQUAPROIECT
SA, National Institute for Hydrology and Water Management (INHGA), Institute for Hydro-
energetic Studies and Design (ISPH) for water supply, wastewater, hydrographic, hydro-
technic and hydrologic works. In the field of design of civil buildings, the emphasis on
research moved to universities. The relationship between research and implementation at
the level of design / execution companies is not found in an organized framework at the
level of professional associations or ministries (MRDPA, Ministry of Transport, and
Ministry of Environment, Waters and Forestry).

244. Laboratories of private construction companies apply programs of verification
and testing under Romanian and European legislation, aiming to contribute to the
harmonization of test methods. Unfortunately, practical experience of laboratories fails
to be disseminated due to interruption of exchange programs organized. The Stat e
Inspectorate in Constructions (ISC) organizes an annual symposium for exchange of
experience, which involves the heads of laboratories and certified road inspectors. At the
same time, it organizes a Road Specialists Congress that allows exchanges of ideas, views,
and information in a professional network.

245. Nowadays any new material proposed on the Romanian market (imported or
invented) must be approved based on laboratory testing procedures. Approvals
procedures for companies that can issue quality certificates for materials and the low
efficiency of the quality verification system have led to the proliferation on the market of
materials with higher quality certificates than real parameters found. Due to low prices,
this market of “acceptable” materials discourages producers who respect the quality
provided in certificates in the production line. Some European countries are maintaining
centralized quality checking for materials by national laboratories, e.g., France - Centre
Scientifique et Technique du Batiment (CSTB). A similar structure existed in Romania, the
National Research Institute in Constructions (INCERC), whose monopoly was abolished.

246. The legislative harmonization process is delayed due to the low degree of
absorption of new SR EN by design companies, due to lack of promotion/dissemination.
The Romanian Association for Standardization does not benefit from adequate funds in
order to organize regular presentations of newly adopted harmonized regulations.

247. Before 1990, the centralized state ensured a forced implementation of research
and innovation in current practice. After 25 years, the Romanian society failed to enable,
in the free market, new links between the few R&I centers (institutes or universities) and
the remaining companies operating on the construction market. Various professional
associations, several congresses, national conferences, and workshops organized by the




                                                                                               62
Ministry or other State institutions did not have continuity in order to become home of
constant promotion of new ideas between construction actors in Romania.


4.4     Analysis of best practice technical solutions proposed to improve cost effectiveness of
        infrastructure projects in Romania

        Cross-sectoral aspects

4.4.1    Compliance monitoring

248. Compliance monitoring is a fundamental activity within environmental
protection and is one of the ways by which adherence to limits and laws can be assessed
for regulatory purposes. It may include a range of inspections and reporting activities
undertaken to determine compliance with regulatory requirements. The achievement of
best practice in compliance monitoring requires careful consideration of key stages:
    • Reasons for monitoring;
    • Responsibility for monitoring (by whom);
    • How to set limits and parameters which can be monitored;
    • Principles of practical monitoring;
    • How to judge compliance;
    • Response to compliance failings;
    • Summary and communication of findings and conclusions.

249.     Formal requirements for compliance monitoring include:
    •    Laws;
    •    Regulations;
    •    Permits;
    •    Directives;
    •    Prohibitions;
    •    General binding rules;
    •    Enforcement orders;
    •    Operator obligations and commitments;
    •    Monitoring and improvement programs.

4.4.2    Data and Document Management systems (DMS)

250. A document management system (DMS) is a computerized method of storage,
management hosting and distribution of project documentation. It is an essential tool to
store, track and distribute documentation and data to users groups who may be
correlated or distantly located. It provides a component of enterprise content
management relative to digital asset management, document imaging, workflow systems
and records management.

251. ISO has created a set of standards regarding technical documentation. Typically,
a DMS acts as a central database / depository for all project documentation, ranging from
drawings, reports, emails, letters, etc. and ensures that all participants and stakeholders




                                                                                              63
have a full record of the project history but also always the latest status of information as
well as the history to date. The document control facility ensures that all necessary actions
are tracked relative to the appropriate time scales and warnings issued of potential
delays. Access to sensitive and /or exclusive information may be restricted to designated
users.


4.4.3      Energy efficient and environment friendly infrastructure

252. Green infrastructure uses vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage
water and to create healthier environments. It seeks to provide a better resolution and
integration of man-made heavy polluting and high energy consumer environment, by
building with nature. Green infrastructure can refer to rainwater harvesting, rain gardens,
planter boxes, flood protection, green streets and alleys, permeable pavements, green
roofs and others. This type of solutions can enhance or even replace a functionality that is
traditionally provided by man-made structures.

                                       Source: http://thegirg.org/15

253. A low energy infrastructure in a life cycle concerns the amounts of energy spent
in its embodied energy, energy needed for operation and demolition. The European
Union is aiming for a 20% reduction in annual primary energy consumption by the year

                                                                                                64
2020. The commission has proposed measures to increase efficiency in all stages in the
energy chain – generation, transformation, distribution and consumption.

254. Energy efficiency standards of infrastructure are not formalized. At this moment,
the Romanian legislation has targeted the energy efficiency based on the art. 4(1) of
Directive 2006/32/EC of the European Parliament. This article stipulates that until 2017
Romania, like other EU countries, has to reduce the total energy consumption by at least
9% compared to 2008 values. In addition, article 1(3) of the Energy efficiency Law no. 121,
published in august 2014, stipulates that by 2020 the national indicative target of reducing
energy consumption is 19%. This has not yet been approved. For Romania, however, it is a
challenge that must be taken up and delivered successfully in the future infrastructure
and social housing projects planned for Romania.

255. Romania has a good potential of solar radiation, which can be used in
photovoltaic applications as an alternative energy source. According to statistical data
for Romania, annual solar radiation on a horizontal surface varies between 1500 kWh/sqm
(in Dobrogea - South/East of Romania) and 1300 kWh/sqm (Transylvanian Plateau) so that
autonomous photovoltaic systems may cover a large territory, especially in isolated areas
with low demand for electricity. 16 This type of photovoltaic applications can be applied in
new technologies for roads, water, wastewater, and social infrastructure, such as facades
or rooftops for buildings, solar powered road signs, traffic lights, power stations, rural
electrification, solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, and many others.

4.4.4   Smart Infrastructure

256. Information availability and exchange is a key characteristic of our society and it
does not exclude infrastructure. Modern infrastructures communicate with users,
operators and between themselves. A smart infrastructure responds intelligently to
changes in its environment, including user demands and other infrastructure, in order to
achieve improved performance.

257. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are advanced applications that aim to
provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic
management and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more
coordinated, and 'smarter' use of transport networks. Although ITS may refer to all
modes of transport, EU Directive 2010/40/EU (7 July 2010) defines ITS as a system in
which information and communication technologies are applied in the field of road
transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and
mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.

258. A variable-message sign, often abbreviated VMS, CMS, or DMS, and in the UK
known as a matrix sign, is an electronic traffic sign often used on roadways to give
travelers information about special events. Such signs warn of traffic congestion,
accidents, incidents, roadwork zones, or speed limits on a specific highway segment.
In urban areas, VMS are used for parking guidance and information systems to guide
drivers to available car parking spaces. They may also ask vehicles to take alternative
routes, limit travel speed, warn of duration and location of the incidents, or just inform of
evolving traffic conditions.

259. While Romania already uses e-vignette, satellite-based tolling systems could
also be considered. Following the successful German experience, many countries have
adopted or are considering adopting advanced tolling technologies which are distance-
based and can be applied to specific categories of vehicles (only heavy trucks, all trucks, all
vehicles) and to specific parts of the network (only motorways, motorways and national
roads, etc.).




                                                                                                               66
260. Smart water systems are important in delivering more integrated and resilient
water, wastewater and flood protection infrastructure in order to meet the current and
emerging global sustainability and climate change challenges. New strategies currently
being implemented or considered around the world include smart closed-loop wastewater
systems with energy recovery, both small and large scale (UK); water resource and flood

261. Building automation is the automatic centralized control of a building's heating,
ventilation and air conditioning, lighting and other systems through a Building
Management System or Building Automation System (BAS). The objectives of smart
buildings are improved occupant comfort, efficient operation of building systems, and
reduction in energy consumption and operating costs.

4.4.5      Comfortable and Safe Road Infrastructure

262. The main purpose of road infrastructure is to satisfy the need for the safe,
economic, and comfortable transport of people and goods. To fulfill these requirements
and services for the users, infrastructure must meet certain quality standards such as skid
resistance, evenness, and noise emission. These properties must be created and
maintained throughout the whole lifetime of a road.

263. Safety aspects are gradually included in all phases of the infrastructure lifecycle,
from worksite preparation to operation and maintenance. Road safety is a key concern
worldwide and Romania still falls behind the European road average on fatality and injury
rates.

264. The road safety audit has the greatest potential for improving safety and is most
cost-effective when it is applied to a road or traffic design before the project is built. It
can be conducted on any design proposal that involves changes to the ways road users
will interact, either with each other or with the physical road environment. It is a formal
process using a defined procedure. To be effective it must be conducted by people who
have appropriate experience and training, and who are independent.

265. The road safety audit needs to be a routine practice, in the same way that
independent structural checking or benchmarking has become a common practice. Road
safety audits are commonly used in the United Kingdom and Australia, and are coming
into wider use in the United States.

266. A self-explaining road can be defined as a road designed and constructed to
elicit correct assessments from road users on appropriate driving behavior matched to
the road environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of driver errors and enhancing
driving comfort. A self-explaining road environment can be facilitated by properly
categorizing the road scene according to existing schemes, i.e., through a set of
standardized “signals” in each road category, easily recognized and acted upon by road
users. Drivers have to cope with increasingly complex traffic environments, including
different types of road layout and all kinds of signposting, many of which are supported by
telematics. In some cases, this may lead to an excessive workload imposed on the driver.
This workload may include striving to read a VMS (variable message sign), while seeking
the correct route in an unfamiliar environment (often in a foreign language and even with
unfamiliar signs). It may also include attempts to detect the required, relevant piece of
information from an abundance of information sources (including in-car navigation
system, traffic management and information center or radio announcements, VMS signs,
road signs, ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems] messages, etc.). 19

267. The most important quality of a self-explaining road is its ability to communicate
to the road users what behavior they should adopt in certain traffic conditions. For
example, it is imperious for a road environment to suggest a low speed for a driver in a
resident area, with many vulnerable road users, by using traffic calming measures.

268. Three practical examples of self-explaining road concepts for rural roads have
been identified in Europe. These concepts introduce different speed and traffic
regulations for different road categories and provide similar solutions to prevent head-on
collisions. Although similar layouts can be identified, there also are some differences due
to design philosophies and local conditions. The distinguish ability is mostly achieved by
conspicuous markings and considerable different cross-section dimensions.

269. In the Netherlands, self-explaining roads are one part of the sustainable safety
concept. Based on a reorganization of the functional categorization plan in 1997, three
categories for the rural road network have been defined according to the traffic functions
mobility, distribution and access. From 1997 onwards, all the measures and modifications
of parts of the network are in line with this categorization plan. One of the most important
modifications was a coherent marking-plan during the last 5 years to improve the
acknowledgement of the function of the road.

270. In Denmark, a system of road categorization according to speed-classes has
been proposed and applied in a pilot study. It uses eight road categories according to the
traffic functions (mobility, distribution and access) and different speed levels (high,
medium, low).

271. In Germany, the forthcoming road design guidelines for rural roads propose four
different road types. They are categorized according to their function and the importance
of connections, each type comprising a distinguishable and standardized road layout.

272. In France, several projects have been started to better understand the influence
of road infrastructure on driving behavior in order to improve road safety. Among
others, projects comprise the collection of experiences on national and local road
networks, the analysis of determinative factors and road user behavior, the improvement
of road legibility processes (guide book and technical notes do exist), field tests of new
road designs such as 2 x 1 lane layout with overtaking lanes, mini-roundabouts in
interurban zones, and a full scale test on a road project. Moreover in 2006, the French
Ministry organized a seminar with more than 600 participants on recent developments to
induce calm driving. The seminar also included presentations from Switzerland and the
Netherlands.


4.4.7   Forgiving roads

273. A forgiving road 21 is defined as a road that is designed and built in such a way as
to counteract or prevent driving errors and to avoid or mitigate the negative
consequences of such. Forgiving road environments can be considered a basic tool to
prevent or mitigate an important percentage of road accidents related to driving errors.
More specifically, statistics show that about 25%-30% of fatal accidents involve crashes
with fixed roadside objects. Those accidents are mainly caused by driving errors, leading
to departure from the road. The existence of a forgiving road environment would prevent
accidents of this type (and generally accidents that involve driving errors) or, at least,
reduce the seriousness of the consequences of an accident.

274. The clear zone is a key safety concept used in road design. It represents the area
that begins at the edge of each travelled lane and is available for emergency use by errant
vehicles that run off the road. This zone includes any adjoining lane/s, road shoulders,
verges and batters.

275. Generally, the width of the required clear zone increases as the design speed
increases. Based on accident analysis in the Netherlands, the SWOV (Dutch Institute for
Road Safety Research) has estimated that the minimum width of clear zones for three
types of roads should be as follows24 : 3.5 meters for single-lane regional highways; 7
meters for single-lane federal highways; 10 meters for motorways.

276. Drainage structures are an essential element of roads. They are designed to
collect the pluvial water but, at the same time, they are very dangerous for road users.
Because of the high water volume, they are designed deep and with a high lateral slope of
the walls, and in some cases they are even made of concrete. The development of new
drainage systems that can cope with the expected amount of rainfall, yet do not create
unsafe conditions for traffic users is not an easy task, but it is a necessary compromise.
Developed countries have started to use permeable drainage systems, built from a porous

infiltration to evaporate, even the ones from the road foundation.

277. Where it is not feasible to eliminate roadside hazards, it is possible to make
them less injurious by changing their design as long as this takes account of real world
accident data and current vehicle design. Frangible poles can be effective in reducing the
severity of pole related crashes. These types of utility poles are specifically designed to
collapse or break away on impact and reduce the severity of potential injuries.

     A risk assessment of the potential effect of using passively safe lighting columns and
     signposts has been performed in the UK by combining the likelihood of occurrence of
     different events that can lead to passenger injuries. The risk associated with the use of
     “passively safe” or “forgiving” lighting columns was evaluated as almost 8 times lower
     than the risk associated with conventional unprotected columns. The solution of
     protecting the column with a safety barrier leads to a risk that is still 2 times higher
     than the risk associated to using “passively safe” columns. (Source: Williams, G. L.,

278. Barrier systems should be used in areas where, in case of a run-off accident, the
consequences would be much worse than if it would hit the parapet. Safety barrier ends
are usually considered hazardous when the termination is not properly anchored or
ramped down in the ground or when it does not flare away from the carriageway. Crashes
with “unprotected” safety barrier ends can result in a penetration of the passenger
compartment with severe consequences.

                       Source: “The influence of road characteristics on road safety” 27

279. The main role of the barrier systems is to diminish the severity of a run -off-road
accident, which is accomplished when they are well designed and installed. For this to
happen, they must absorb the shock of impact and prevent bouncing a vehicle back on the
road just after a collision.

280. The median barriers are designed to avoid front collision between vehicles
travelling from opposite directions, but also they have an impact on pedestrians, as they
encourage them to use safer areas to cross the road. A distinction needs to be made
between the medians used to guide directional traffic management and those used for
safety reasons. The second category must have a more solid construction, since their
function is to divert vehicles tending to go over the median axis and absorb as much of the
kinetic energy during the collision.

freeways, the Crash Modification Factor for the use of milled rumble strips has been
estimated combining different studies29 : 0.89 (which means potential reduction of crashes
of 11%) for single vehicle run-off-road crashes, with a standard error of 0.1; 0.84 (which
means potential reduction of crashes of 16%) for single vehicle run-off-road fatal and
injury crashes, with a standard error of 0.1. For rural two lane roads, the Crash
Modification Factor for the use of milled rumble strips has been estimated combining
different studies: 0.85 (which means potential reduction of crashes of 15%) for single
vehicle run-off-road crashes, with a standard error of 0.1; 0.71 (which means potential
reduction of crashes of 29%) for single vehicle run-off-road fatal and injury crashes, with a
standard error of 0.1. Given the very low standard errors, these results can be considered
extremely reliable in estimating the potential effect of milled shoulder rumble strips on
these types of roads.

     A specific study was conducted in Sweden to evaluate the effectiveness of milled
     shoulder rumble strips in rural dual carriageway freeways. Over a 200 km long
     segment, milled shoulder rumble strips with a typical configuration have been built
     between June and October 2007. Information from all single vehicle accidents
     occurred between January 1, 2004 and December 31, 2010 was collected from the
     STRADA (Swedish Traffic Accident Data Acquisition) database, allowing for the
     development of a before-after analysis. The results show an overall estimate of a
     27.3% reduction of single vehicle crashes (CMF = 0.727). Within a 95% confidence
     interval the potential reduction in accidents was estimated between 8.6% and 45.7%,
     showing a definitely positive effect even though there is still a large variability to be
     explained. (Source: Fagerlind, H., Martinsson, J., Nitsche, P., Saleh, P., Goyat, Y., La

282. A complete street31 is designed and built not only for vehicles, but for all types of
road users. It is very important to create an infrastructure with proper means of
transportation for pedestrians, such as sidewalks, crosswalks - including median crossing
islands and raised crosswalks, accessible pedestrian signals - including audible cues for
people with low vision and pushbuttons reachable by wheelchair users, and sidewalk
bulb-outs; traffic calming measures to lower driving speeds and define the edges of car
travel ways; bicycle accommodations, such as dedicated bicycle lanes or wide shoulders;
mass transit accommodations, such as bus pullouts.

283. Streets that are truly “complete” provide all of us with a choice of mobility
options. They allow everyone to travel to and from work, school, and other destinations
with the same level of safety and convenience, whether or not they have mobility, vision,
or cognitive disabilities. Complete streets also help people who are coping with temporary
disabilities as well as those pushing strollers, pulling wheeled luggage, or managing large
packages.

284. Complete streets provide children with opportunities to walk, bike and play in a
safe environment. More children are likely to walk or bike to school when sidewalks or
footpaths are present, when there are safe street crossings, and when school zones
enforce a reduced vehicle speed. Streets that provide dedicated space for bicycling and
walking help kids get physical activity and gain independence.

285. Complete streets are a natural complement to sustainability efforts, ensuring
benefits for mobility, community, and the environment. Many elements of street design,
construction, and operation can work in favor of achieving both complete streets that
work for all travelers and green streets that serve environmental sustainability.

286. When streets are designed only for cars, they deny people the opportunity to
choose more active ways to get around, such as walking and biking. Even where
sidewalks exist, large intersections and speeding traffic may make walking unpleasant or
even unsafe - discouraging any non-motorized travel. Complete streets provide
opportunities for increased physical activity by incorporating features that promote
regular walking, cycling and transit use into just about every street.

287. Complete streets reduce crashes through comprehensive safety improvements.
The measures that design the street with pedestrians in mind – sidewalks, raised medians,
better bus stop placement, traffic-calming measures, and treatments for disabled
travelers – all improve pedestrian safety. Some features, such as medians, improve safety
for all users: they enable pedestrians to cross busy roads in two stages, and reduce left -
turning motorist crashes to zero, a type of crash that also endangers bicyclists.

288. Planning and designing roads to make them safer for all users and more inviting
to pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users can increase overall capacity and efficiency
without a negative impact on automobile travel. For example, improving intersections
for pedestrian safety can reduce the time needed for a pedestrian crossing signal phase,
keeping vehicular traffic flowing. Complete streets improve access to public transportation
and assist transit vehicles in moving efficiently along the road, making it an attractive and
viable option to more people. Increasingly popular are the use of bus rapid transit and bus
priority signal systems, which allow buses to extend green lights and shorten red lights.

     helped spur economic development and was claimed to enhance the

4.4.9      Sustainable roads

290. Minimizing environmental impacts on communities and natural habitats are the
main issues of this concept. Sustainable or green infrastructure fits into its surroundings
and contributes by means of design and composition to minimizing the impact of traffic
(noise, air pollution and vibrations) and energy consumption of the transport system. It
also optimizes the use of non-traditional materials for road building and reduces the use
of natural resources. Green infrastructure stands for reducing the environmental impact
of traffic and infrastructure on the sustainable society. 34

291. Better integration of infrastructure in its surroundings is rather a matter of
willingness to give natural habitats a chance to survive than a lack of road engineering
solutions. Proper design and modelling of the verges and the creation of barrier-free
ecological areas using eco ducts are examples of ecological engineering that can already
be found in some European countries. Local circumstances and demands will ultimately
determine the best solutions.

      A Norwegian study released on March 19, 2007 found conclusive evidence that road
     realignments and upgrades reduce car emissions. Taking three baseline scenarios, the
     emissions of CO2 were found to be reduced by up to 38% while local pollutants
     dropped by a staggering 75%. The same study indicated that in a majority of cases the
     changes did not generate new car trips. (Source: ERF and IRF “Sustainable
     roads”,2007)


292. Traffic noise is another potential tension area between individual mobility needs
and legitimate societal aspirations for quieter lifestyles. Up to 80 million Europeans
suffer from unacceptable levels of noise, much of it caused by the transport sector. It is
estimated that pavement properties on a well-maintained road network can reduce noise
emission levels by as much as 5 dB(A). Acoustic barriers offer another on-site noise
reduction solution, typically lowering noise levels by 5 to 10 dB(A) (i.e., cutting the
loudness of traffic noise by as much as 50%). 35

      A demonstration trial was undertaken for the UK Highways Agency using solar panels
     mounted on highway noise barriers on the M27. The trial followed an earlier feasibility
     study, which found that the significant infrastructure of noise barriers that already
     exists on UK highways provides an ideal location for solar panels. (Source: ERF and IRF
     “Sustainable roads”,2007)


293. The vertical (gradient of abutments) and horizontal (curves) alignment of road
design and the condition of the road surface (texture, evenness) particularly affect th e
rolling resistance of trucks and thus fuel consumption (and air pollution). Rough and
uneven road surfaces will increase this consumption.

294. Green design solutions for roads have started to be implemented in developed
countries. A good example is represented by the permeable drainage systems, which are
commonly used in the proximity of roads, following the idea that they will be more dry
than wet, even in areas with heavy rain. If the side of the trench is porous, evaporation is
faster, and not just for the water seeped through the sides of the trench in the ground,
but for any other type of infiltration. This is also a sensible ecological measure and it is
called “shallow green ditches.” It has been discovered that most of the critical pollutions
of the water from the road, such as oil and petrol will be destroyed by soil bacteria. For
the case in which the water permeability of the soil is low, a subsurface piped solution is
recommended.

years with no overall plan. To achieve the best results and the highest return on
investment, any physical installation or change of operation must be designed with
anticipated future need for water supply in mind, not just be a repeat of the original
dimension.

296. All potable water systems will have a certain quantity of water that is not paid.
A well run utility will keep the level in the low teens. The best utilities will achieve around
3 percent. Utilities with low quality and poorly maintained infrastructure, inadequate
procedures, no leakage management systems and no meter testing programs may lose 40
percent or more of their output. Some utilities may be uncertain about the actual levels of
water loss. In a country such as Romania leakages in networks can reach high levels (30%
or more), which has an impact on the sustainability of the service. It is very important to
take into consideration the non-revenue water. To achieve a reliable picture, precise
metering equipment must be installed both at the pumping inlet and at the customer.

297. Ideally, each consumer should have a water meter. The meter readings shall be
the basis for payment for water. Romania has not yet achieved this level and water is
often paid for on another basis such as pro rata – depending, for example, on the number
of inhabitants. Many apartment buildings in Romania have water supplies entering in two
or three locations meaning that more than one water meter may be required per
property. More than 90% of the apartment buildings have about four water meters,
including two for cold water and two for hot water. Since 1990, practically all buildings
have been provided with individual water meters. In order to lower the reading costs, the
water companies have started to use water meters with electronic distance reading.
However, the installation cost may be too high for old buildings, and in any case incentives
must be in place for users to comply with any meter installation policy.

298. High quality equipment for water management is required. It is very important
to invest in high quality products in water distribution systems as the equipment is
installed underground, beneath the overlying pavement. If the equipment fails or starts
leaking it might take long before it is discovered and be costly to repair or exchange;
repairs may affect the overlying pavement and cause significant disruption to
communities. Many water utilities have learned the hard way that substandard
equipment might save money when purchased, but is much more expensive in the long
term.

299. The operation of the distribution system tends to have a negative impact on the
water quality. In most places, it is necessary to add chlorine to disinfect the water before
distribution to avoid bacteriological contamination of the water, but if the distribution
system does not operate properly, it will result in excessively high chlorine content near
the pumping station and low or zero chlorine further out in the distribution system. Both
are detrimental to the water quality and to the consumer. The flow and age of the
distributed water must be as uniform as possible all over the distribution system to make
the chlorination efficient. If the chlorine degrades, a distribution system with a high
leakage will be vulnerable to contamination resulting from vacuums developing during
low-pressure situations. A properly designed, operated, and maintained distribution
system will minimize the risk of contamination, and it will secure safe drinking water for
the consumer.

 The water treatment technology used most often in Denmark to convert groundwater
 into drinking water is aeration and filtration for removal of iron, manganese, and
 ammonium. This is a chemical-free and natural process using just compressed air as
 the oxidation media. This treatment method is now also used in Hungary for the
 12,000 inhabitants of Tolna, a city 135 km south of Budapest. The new waterworks
 has a good working environment with no wastewater problems and safe and easy
 operation, and the citizens now enjoy superior drinking water free of chemicals.

 tap water 24 hours a day. Solutions for a safe, reliable and resource-efficient drinking
 water supply)


300. Water quality must be monitored on a continuous basis, because problems will
only be detected with regular sampling. Sampling and analyses should be undertaken at
the well, at the intake, where water exits the waterworks, and throughout the distribution
system. Fortunately, various modern methods, sensors, and measurement equipment
have made it quicker and less costly for utilities to monitor water quality throughout the
process, thereby detecting irregularities in both treatment and supply. Sensors can be
given online links to management systems that ensure alarms and data capture regarding
process irregularities.




                                                                                             79
301. The longer the water remains in the pipeline, the poorer the quality of the water
reaching the customers. Hydraulic models are used to optimize the quality of the drinking
water when it reaches consumers by calculating the age of the water in the network. In
order to establish a functional hydraulic distribution network model, reliable data about
pipeline locations and dimensions is necessary. Further data or estimates about consumer
demands around the distribution network are also required. The more accurate the
information about consumption and time-dependent demand variations for each supply
zone, the more advanced the model simulation of the distribution network that can be
established.

302. Ensuring constant pressure throughout the distribution network is one of the
most important aspects that could benefit from advanced technology, tools, and
designs. Any pressure drop will not only affect the pressure at the tap, but also involve a
huge risk that contamination will be sucked into the distribution network. This is often the
case in the event of a fire, because in many cities firefighting is based on the use of fire
hydrants using water taken from the distribution network. The optimum starting point to
solve this is also with hydraulic models combined with GIS systems, which provide a great
platform for decision-making regarding the distribution network design and rehabilitation.
Real-time modeling may then provide information for daily operation and management of
pressure in the drinking water network — and be even more effective when combined
with pressure sensors installed in the distribution system.

4.4.11 Wastewater management

303. Wastewater projects typically include the construction of a new treatment plant
or the upgrading of existing systems, in order to clean properly the water as well as the
associated distribution system that may include pipes, pumping stations, and storage of
reclaimed water. In the design of sewerage networks optimum use is made of
gravitational flow and pipes are sized and installed at the minimum gradients consistent
with self-cleansing (meaning continuous mobilization of solids at minimum night flows).
The number of pumping stations in an agglomeration is minimized to contain capital and
operational expenses. Vacuum systems are used in plain areas where intensive pumping is
necessary. The action area of a vacuum station is larger than the action area of a regular
pumping station, so the number of vacuum stations and the corresponding power
consumption are minimized.

304.    Three main types of wastewater systems can be identified:
    •   Separate sewer system that collects and transports by at least two separate
        networks all waters which are collected (usually one for wastewater and one for
        rain water);
    •   Mixed sewer system that collects and transports water from the locality through
        different systems, in part through the unitary sewer system and in part by a
        separate sewer system.
    •   Unitary sewer system that collects and carries on the same network all waters,
        sewage and rain water in the locality. This is the cheapest system in terms of both
        investment and operating costs. This system implies a mechanism of water




                                                                                               80
        segregation before the treatment station to deal with overflow due to rainwater.
        In addition, in case of flat areas, the system allows a self-cleaning during the rains,
        which otherwise would need additional mechanical cleaning that induces treated
        water losses and higher costs.

305. Numerous processes can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the
type and extent of contamination. There are two basic approaches: to use the waste in
the water as a resource (such as constructed wetlands) or strictly as pollution (such as the
majority of today's treatment plants). Most wastewater is treated in industrial-scale
energy intensive wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which include physical, chemical,
and biological treatment processes. However, the use of septic tanks and other On-Site
Sewage Facilities (OSSF) is widespread in rural areas, serving up to 20 percent of the
homes in the U.S. 37

306. The most important aerobic treatment system is the activated sludge process,
based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed by
microorganisms able to absorb and adsorb the organic matter carried in wastewater.
Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes (UASB, EGSB) are also widely applied in the
treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be
highly treated and reused as reclaimed water. Wastewaters ecological approaches using
reed bed systems such as constructed wetlands are being increasingly used. Tertiary
treatment is increasingly applied and most common technologies are microfiltration or
synthetic membranes. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is
indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its
minerals). Nitrates can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but
also via intensive microbial denitrification, for which a small amount of methanol is
typically added to provide the bacteria with a source of carbon. Ozone wastewater
treatment is becoming more popular and requires the use of an ozone generator that
decontaminates the water as ozone bubbles percolate through the tank. The solution is,
however, energy intensive. Latest and very promising treatment technology is aerobic
granulation.

307. Dewatered sludge can be dried to lower moisture contents by various processes
termed sludge drying . For transportation, sludge benefits from being as dry as possible
and a cost balance must always be made between transport costs and drying costs. For
use of sludge as a fuel, dry solids mater must generally exceed 50%. Wastewater sludge
can be mixed with the purifiable elements of domestic waste to make a so-called
“compost-like” output that can be used for soil enhancement. Prior to 2008, available
disposal solutions for wastewater sludge included incineration, and sludge was used as an
agricultural fertilizer and disposed to landfills. However, since 2008, following
amendments to the landfill, the option to dispose of sludge into landfill is no longer
allowed. While Romania is still considering the use of wastewater sludge in agriculture,
the other Western European countries are moving towards incineration as a prime
disposal process. The disposal of sludge to agricultural land is prohibited in certain nitrate

sensitive regions and requires considerable storage areas because there is only a narrow
window of time when soil and crop conditions are amenable to receive sludge.

308. Another optimizing action is enhancing treatment processes with
microorganisms. Specialized microorganisms can positively affect solids management and
odor control in wastewater treatment operations. It is also possible to degrade specific
substances with specialized microorganisms to lower substance levels in the plant
effluent. In sludge and biomass treatment, adding actively growing, specialized microbial
strains enhance the response of the biomass to process fluctuations or to degradation of
certain components. Bio-augmentation, as it is called, offers many advantages over
traditional technology platforms such as chemicals and has for years proven its
effectiveness at degrading organic compounds. Other technologies can also improve
effluent quality, but those technologies are often much more expensive and more difficult
to handle.

309. The aeration process in biological wastewater treatment normally takes up
more than half of the total energy demand of the plant and increasing the efficienc y will
have a high impact on total operating costs. Generally, surface-aerated basins do not
achieve the same energy performance as diffused bottom aeration. Taking it one step
further, supplying the exact amount of clean air required in the process with optimized
aeration technology makes it possible to achieve great savings. Analyzing a plant’s current
set-up and an alternative configuration calculated by aeration experts will make it possible
to estimate potential savings.

     A treatment plant in Bloomington, Indiana, USA has achieved annual savings of
     around 1.8 million US dollars by upgrading the plant with new fine-bubble diffusers
     and single-stage centrifugal turbo compressors with dual-point control. In Catalonia,
     Spain a treatment plant for industrial and domestic wastewater with a capacity of
     30,000 cubic meters per day saved around 30 percent of its electricity consumption by
     upgrading the aeration compressors and control system. (Source: Rethink Water &
     Danish Water Forum 2013 - In control of wastewater to protect people and
     ecosystems. Efficient solutions for treatment of wastewater)


310. Disposal of wastewaters from an industrial plant is a difficult and costly
problem. Most petroleum refineries, chemical and petrochemical plants have on-site
facilities38 to treat their wastewaters so that the pollutant concentrations in the treated
wastewater comply with the local and national regulations regarding disposal of
wastewaters into community treatment plants or into rivers, lakes or oceans. Constructed
wetlands are being used in an increasing number of cases as they provided high quality
and productive on-site treatment. Other industrial processes that produce a lot of
wastewaters, such as paper and pulp production, have created environmental concern,

leading to development of processes to recycle water use within plants before they have
to be cleaned and disposed.

311. Reducing the costs of wastewater handling is an issue in most places, as costs
for collection and treatment of wastewater often are twice the costs for production and
distribution of drinking water. More and more wastewater treatment plants in Europe
are thus upgraded with anaerobic digestion of sludge to better collect and utilize
produced biogas for generating electricity or heat. Solutions depend on individual plant
design and opportunities for internal use or sale of the produced electricity or heat. The
limit at which the implementation of anaerobic digestion is financially viable changes with
the development and application of new technologies and changes in the price structure
for purchase and sale of electricity and heat.

312. A new trend is coupled control. Nowadays most of the developed countries’
wastewater treatment plants have online measurement equipment for optimization of
biological processes and plant hydraulics. Now this technology also emerges for the
optimization of sewer systems to avoid massive investments in large retention basins or
increase of sewer network capacity. Online monitoring instruments such as flow meters,
sewage level loggers, and precipitation gauges combined with weather radar at regional
and local levels in advanced storm water drainage and treatment models are now the new
trend for coupled control of drainage system and wastewater treatment plants.

313. Intelligent regulation, control, and coordination in the management of drainage
systems and wastewater treatment plants may be the first defense against floods and
sewer overflows for cities facing higher risks of extreme weather with heavy rainfall,
saving them from new massive investments in climate adaptation. Intelligent
wastewater management is primarily a solution for cities of a certain size and with
combined sewer systems that require special operational rules during heavy rainfall to
avoid hydraulic overload and resulting discharge of untreated wastewater. Integrated
solutions are the new trend to connect the wastewater treatment plant with a drainage
model and get a coherent model for the entire wastewater system. Advanced technology
such as sensors, flow meters, and intelligent software ensure that the capacities of sewer
pipes are maximized. This means that rather than blindly expanding the capacity of the
sewer system to cope with heavy rainfalls, the intelligent system sends the water where
there is room for it.

314. Many countries also use the decentralized treatment for wastewater that is not
discharged to a municipal treatment plant. These solutions are applied mainly in rural
areas, but may also include relatively large areas, such as university campuses or industrial
parks with their own treatment plants. Decentral wastewater treatment thus takes place
at widely different scales from clusters within a mega-city to scattered individual
households in rural areas. The rapid urban growth in many developing countries makes
decentralist solutions attractive in order to maintain a manageable size of sewer
networks, which can be make use of the topography for gravity drainage and avoid
escalating pumping costs. The cluster approach is also attractive in cities with large
differences in service levels between the urban center and surrounding shantytowns or
satellite cities as a gradual upgrading of water supply and sanitation can be achieved via




                                                                                                83
local collection and decentral treatment of wastewater. Still it is important to be aware
that wastewater treatment plants located within cities are difficult to manage due to risk
of foul smell from the treatment basins and the heavy transport required for disposal of
sludge.

315. If treated properly, wastewater can be reused as drinking water in industry
(cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture, and in the rehabilitation
of natural ecosystems. There are numerous benefits to using recycled water for irrigation,
including the low cost, consistency of supply (regardless of season, climatic conditions and
associated water restrictions), and general consistency of quality. Irrigation of recycled
wastewater is also considered as a means for plant fertilization and particularly nutrient
supplementation. Furthermore, organic content can be used for energy production when
concentrated in sludge. Phosphorus can be extracted from the wastewater or sludge and
applied as fertilizer replacing mineral phosphorus, which rapidly is becoming an
increasingly scarce resource. Energy wise, excess heat can be withdrawn for production of
heat and electricity and the remaining mineral and organic content in the sludge can be
used as soil conditioner or as additional fertilizer.

 The Republic of Malta has implemented a new wastewater infrastructure, which aims
 at reusing the effluent for irrigation and for industrial purposes. Treated wastewater is
 today considered a useful resource in Malta and the irrigation systems ensure a
 significant increase in agricultural production during dry periods. The project included
 upgrading of one wastewater treatment plant and building of two new ones to treat
 sewage from most towns and settlements on the two islands of Malta (Malta and
 Gozo). (Source: Rethink Water & Danish Water Forum 2013 - In control of wastewater

      Social infrastructure

4.4.12 Safe social infrastructure

316. The provision of adequate social infrastructure is fundamental to ensuring
people are safe, healthy, and productive in the community. Increasingly sophisticated
research demonstrates the critical link between economic sustainability and investment in
law and order, education, healthcare, culture, recreation, housing and communications
infrastructure.

317. All public buildings, such as those that are part of social infrastructure, must be
accessible and easily used by disabled people. A noticeable change in some parts of the
world is the installation of elevators, automatic doors, wide doors and corridors,
transit lifts, wheelchair ramps, curb cuts, and the elimination of unnecessary steps where
ramps and elevators are not available, allowing people in wheelchairs and with other
mobility impairments to use public sidewalks and public transit more easily and more
safely.




                                                                                                  84
318. Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent ignition of an
uncontrolled fire, and those that are used to limit the development and effects of a fire
after it starts. Fire safety measures include those that are planned during
the construction of a building or implemented in structures that are already standing. The
technical design documentations of a building that is part of the social infrastructure must
specify the fire risk (including smoke control) and the protection systems of the rooms,
spaces and departments for the whole building.

319. Thermal comfort is primordial in modern social infrastructure. The main role of
heating systems is to ensure in the cold season the optimum temperature in the buildings
for social infrastructure. Heating systems can be hot air systems, radiant heating, or heat
pumps. Air conditioning systems are designed to provide thermal comfort conditions in
the warm season in buildings that are part of social infrastructure. They must maintain air
parameters throughout the year, regardless of the variation of meteorological factors, the
occupancy of rooms, in other words, regardless of changing thermal loads (heating,
cooling) and of prevailing humidity and moisture.

4.4.13 Sustainable buildings

320. In October 2014, the EC published a report concerning the imp lementation of
nearly zero energy buildings “NZEBs”. Article 9(1) of the energy performance in buildings
directive is to ensure that by December 2020 all new buildings are to be nearly zero
energy and, after December 2018, new buildings owned and occupied by public
authorities are to be nearly zero energy buildings. It is expected that the nearly zero or
very low energy required should be covered by energy from renewable sources.

321. Recycling provides the opportunity to reduce the embodied energy by using
recycled materials and reusable/recyclable materials/components. The recycling
potential is between 35% and 40% of the embodied energy of a building, which represents
around 45% of the total energy needed. 39

322. Energy efficiency is the first step toward achieving sustainability in buildings.
Energy efficiency helps control rising energy costs, reduces environmental footprints, and
increases the value and competitiveness of buildings. Mostly, energy losses in social
buildings are due to inadequate state of the building envelope, including walls, floors,
roofs, doors and windows. Therefore, any social building older than 20 years is poorly
insulated, needs thermal rehabilitation, in order to save about 50% of energy
consumption and support achieving thermal comfort in winter and in summer. The most
commonly used materials for social infrastructure buildings with thermal insulation can be
classified as:
    • Vegetable: cork, fiber (chips) of wood, flax, straw, etc.
    • Mineral: fiberglass, mineral wool, expanded clay, glass foam, etc.
    • Synthetic materials: expanded polystyrene, polyurethane and phenolic foam, etc.

323. As an integral part of innovative and efficient design as well as to meet the
future EU requirements for nearly zero energy buildings, a comprehensive approach is
necessary to be taken, in order to utilize the benefits and facilities provided by building
controls and management systems. Numerous computerized systems already exist on the
market but it is advisable for designers to take a comprehensive approach and to integrate
fully the building envelope construction and performance with the solar energy collectors,
heating methods, insulation, temperature control, building shading, ventilation, lighting,
metering, water supply, drainage, and waste.

 By optimizing heating, ventilation and air-conditioning systems for its customers in
 over 6,500 buildings around the world Siemens says it has saved them around
 £900,000 and reduced CO2 emissions by 2.4 million tons. (Source: Raconteur Media-
 CLEAN TECHNOLOGY. Turning up the power)


324. The Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD) is considered the main
piece of legislation that supports and regulates the development of energy efficient
buildings. Also known as "the EU green building legislation", EPBD started to be
transposed in the national legislation of most Member States in 2006. Since it is very
comprehensive, it is also difficult to implement fully and to acquire a common position at
the EU level.

325. The directive is designed to promote the energy performance of buildings in the
Member States through the following measures:
    • The introduction of a framework for an integrated methodology for measuring the
      energy performance of buildings.
    • The energy certification and advice for new and existing buildings; and
      the inspection and assessment of boilers and heating/cooling systems.
    • Visionary companies’ interest in developing capabilities to excel in the
      construction and related industries and generate sustained profits.

326. Energy efficiency can be improved in different ways. For existing social
infrastructure buildings in Romania, especially for education and health facilities, thermal
rehabilitation may be accomplished by replacement of heating system (from stoves to
thermal plants), thermal insulation of the building (walls, roof and basement), new
entrance doors, efficient new lighting system and rehabilitation of internal installations.

327. Solar energy, in particular by direct conversion of solar energy into electricity,
can be considered the most common type of renewable energy for buildings that are
part of the social infrastructure. Photovoltaic – PV - systems require light and not
necessarily direct sunlight in order to generate electricity. PV systems can be installed on
roofs or facades, thus contributing to reducing energy consumption in those buildings.
They do not produce pollutants and can be integrated in various aesthetic solutions.




                                                                                               86
 Solar thermal uses energy from the sun to create hot water for use in buildings. It is
 the most prolific renewable technology in the UK with approximately 90,000
 installations currently fitted. Typically, panels of a 3-4 square meter total area will
 produce up to 70 per cent of the hot water demand of a three-person household.

4.4.14 Building Information Modelling (BIM)

328. Building Information Modelling and 3D modelling involves the creatio n and
management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics for
designed elements and forms. BIM software is used by businesses and government
agencies to plan, design, construct, operate and maintain physical infrastructure rang ing
from water and wastewater treatment plant, refuse disposal, electricity and gas supply
services, communications utilities through to roads, bridges, housing and schools. At the
beginning of a project and during the whole life cycle BIM facilitates predictability of
outcome as well as options for change and modification in good time to allow the most
effective decisions to be made often on a “just in time” basis.

329. The use of BIM goes beyond the planning and design phases. It extends through
all stages and supporting processes of cost management and facilities operations. In a
number of EU countries there is an objective to harmonize BIM standards to improve
inter- operability and cooperation.


4.5   Conclusions

330. There are multiple recommendations for improving the design of public
infrastructure projects in Romania. For one, it is mandatory to adapt the technical
standards in force to European standards, reflecting climate change, traffic modifications,
and other new concepts environment friendly. Some standards are too old and their
content is not up to date compared to international best practices.

331. There should be a switch of the current Romanian roads classification to a well-
structured functional classification, including relating the technical classes and
maintenance classes to a revised functional classification via design speed and traffic
volumes. Functional classes provide continuity for the road’s design features (and other
road management matters). Functional classification is also important to land uses and
helps both the road administrations and the road users structure the network.

332. The implementation of the Road Safety Audit and Road Safety Inspection should
be properly done. ARR should organize technical courses for the accreditation of auditors/
inspectors, but also new and clear regulations should be established according to the law
in force. Another important aspect that should be considered is related to the prices for a
RSA or RSI. They should be revised and adapted to the economic situation of Romania.

333. Traffic and environmental impact studies should be required when starting a
design project, just as geotechnical and topographic studies are required currently. This
way, the solution of new construction, modernization, or rehabilitation will have better
technical support.

334. The implementation of drinking water safety management and food safety
systems such as ISO 22000 is needed. Many water utilities in Europe have chosen to be
ISO 22000 certified because this ensures safe healthy water throughout the entire supply
system. Romanian regional water operators should adopt similar measures.

335. The verification of the project should be made by specialists certified as
technical verifiers, different and independent of the design specialists who elabor ate
the projects. The beneficiaries should be the ones to contract the technical verifiers, and
not include this task into the design phase, which is in fact against the law. Put differently,
practice needs to reflect what the law mandates.

5.1       Public procurement in Romania

5.1.1      Legal Framework 40

336. Public procurement procedures constitute one of the most time consuming
stages in the project cycle for infrastructure in Romania . This is a consensus amongst
stakeholders and experts. The Romanian legal framework is now entirely “harmonized”
with the specific European acquis communautaire . The most important legal act regarding
public procurement procedures in Romania is the Government Emergency Ordinance
(GEO) No. 34/2006 on the awarding of public procurement contracts, works concession
contracts, and services concession contracts. This ordinance, as all regulatory acts in this
field, is in accordance with the Romanian constitutional principles, and with the Treaty on
European Union, with the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, as well as
with the European directives on public procurement. The GEO no. 34/2006 represents the
general legal framework for the public procurement field as it provides the principle rules
required for organizing and carrying out these types of procedures.

337. The key institutions for ensuring the implementation of public procurement
rules in Romania are the following:
    • National Authority for Regulating and Monitoring Public Procurement (NARMPP),
         which is the regulatory body;
    • National Council for Solving Complains (NCSC), which is the review body;
    • Unit for Coordination and Verification Public Procurement (UCVPP) within
         Ministry of Finance, which in an ex-ante control body;
    • National Management Centre for Informational Society (NMCIS), which is the
         national operator of the Electronic System for Public Procurement;
      •    ESPP is an information system for public procurement (accessible at www.e-
           licitatie.ro), providing access to the economic operators and contracting
           authorities in the public procurement process.

338. GEO no. 34/2006 provides the fundamental principles of the public procurement
procedures: non-discrimination; equal treatment; transparency; mutual recognition;
proportionality; and efficient use of public funds and accountability. According to the
legislation, any situation for which there is no specific and explicit regulation shall be
interpreted through these principles.




40
  This was covered in depth in the World Bank 2014 report on “ROP 2.0: Support for A pplicants and
Beneficiaries of the Regional Operational Programme 2014-2020.” Some sections are included here for
background purposes.




                                                                                                89
339. The national public procurement legislation provides for four main types of
contracts:
       •   public procurement contracts for services;
       •   supply of goods and provision of works;
       •   services concession contracts;
    • public works concession contracts.
In particular, Art.3^1 from GEO no. 34/2006 (Art. 3^1 was introduced by point 4 of the
sole article of Law no. 337 of 17 July 2006, as published in the Official Journal no. 625 of
20 July 2006) refers to: contracts for works; contracts for provision of goods and contracts
for provision of services, and the Government Decision No. 71/2007 approving the rules
and provisions referring to the awarding of the public works concession contracts and of
services concession contracts.

340. GEO 34/2006 (as amended) allows for all award procedures provided for (and
allowed) in the EU Directives:
    • Open procedure;
    • Restricted procedure (two stages: selection of the best economic operators based
       on qualification and selection criteria and evaluation of the technical and financial
       proposals based on the award criteria);
       •   Competitive dialogue;
       •   Negotiated procedure with prior publication of a contract notice;
       •   Negotiated procedure without publication of a contract notice;
       •   Design contest.

341. The general rule is stated in article 20 (1) of the GEO 34/2006, according to
which the contracting authorities shall award public contracts by applying open or
restricted procedures – at their own free choice. The other procedures may be applied
only in specific circumstances provided for by the legislation. For low-value contracts, the
request for quotations shall be used, which is an open procedure with reduced deadlines.
Framework agreements are considered “special modalities” for awarding contracts. For
concluding a framework agreement, the contracting authority shall apply the same rules
and procedures as for the award of a contract.

342. Starting with January 1, 2013, the direct entrustment cap was raised from EUR
15,000 to EUR 30,000 for services and to EUR 100,000 for construction works, according
to GEO 34, modified by Law 193/2013. 41 Even though the European Union average for
direct entrustment is EUR 130,000 Euro for services and EUR 5,000,000 for works, in
Romania this is still considered a large amount to be entrusted without a bid. If the
services/works are financed from European funds, then the beneficiary is required to post
the entrustment on SEAP if the sum is larger than EUR 5,000.

                                                                                               90
343. According to most public procurement procedures, in practice, the main winning
criterion is the lowest bid. This way, enterprises are forced to cut as much as possible
from different works or quantities, which eventually lead toward a poor quality of design
projects and construction works. In addition, no dumping price is stipulated, so a small
enterprise can bid even below 15% of the estimated initial sum of the project and win, if it
justifies its offer.


5.1.2   Public procurement process

344. Before starting the award procedure, contracting authorities must have all the
tender documents prepared. Usually, tender documents contain the following parts:
    •   Procurement Data Sheet;
    •   Standard Forms;
    •   Contract model;
    •   Tender (technical) specifications.

345. The Procurement Data Sheet (PDS) is intended to provide information about any
request, criteria, and other rules needed to insure the bidder/candidate has access to
complete and explicit information regarding the manner in which the procedure will be
organized, including:
    •   general information regarding the contracting authority (address, telephone, fax,
        e-mail, contact persons, means of communication) and the contract (type, CPV
        code, short description of the activities, estimated value, duration, place of
        delivery/location of works);
    •   instructions which must be complied with in relation to the participation in the
        procedure (deadlines for submitting the bids, place for submitting the bids,
        guarantees, validity of the bids);
    •   minimal requirements for qualification, as well as documents to be presented by
        bidders/candidates for demonstrating the fulfilment of the qualification and
        selection criteria;
    •   information regarding the award criteria ;
    •   instructions regarding the manner of elaboration and presentation of the
        technical proposal and the financial proposal;
    •   instructions regarding the review procedures.

346. The most sensitive issue during the elaboration of the PDS is the decision
regarding the qualification criteria and award criteria. During the verification of various
award procedures applied in recent years for EU funded projects/contracts, the biggest
number of financial correction were related to qualification criteria and award criteria. In
many cases, it was considered that tender documentations had contained
disproportionate qualification requirements and/or irrelevant/inappropriate award
criteria.




                                                                                               91
347. GEO 34/2006 provides for an exhaustive list of qualification criteria that may be
used for verification of the suitability and choice the participants in the award
procedure. The list contains the same criteria as those provided in Art. 45 – 50 of Directive
2004/18/EC:
    •   situation of the legal representative of the company;
    •   suitability to pursue the professional activity;
    •   economic and financial standing;
    •   technical or professional ability;
    •   quality assurance standards;
    •   environmental management standards.

348. The qualification criteria are used to reduce the number of candidates that will
submit bids in the second phase. In an open procedure, the qualification criteria are used
only as a filter: pass/fail. In a restricted procedure, the qualification criteria are used both
as a filter and as selection criteria. For instance, the level of turnover, the value of similar
contracts, the experience of the key experts, are selection criteria generally used in a
restricted procedure.

349. Award criteria are consistent between GEO 34/2006 provisions and the EU
Directives’ provisions. Both criteria – the “most economically advantageous tender”
(MEAT) and the “lowest bid” – are included in GEO 34/2006 without special restrictions.
However, many problems are encountered in practice when contracting authorities apply
the MEAT criteria. Many contracting authorities do not have enough knowledge about
how to formulate adequate award criteria in the tender documentation. The lack of
knowledge, in conjunction with NARMPP intervention, has led to the widespread use of
the lowest bid as an award criterion.

350. A wide range of standard forms has been developed in recent years. Their main
use it to ease the way in which the economic operators prove the fulfilment of the
qualification requirements. There are no specific issues related to this part of the tender
documents for which quite rare difficulties are reported.

351. NARMPP has developed some simplified models for supply contracts, services
contracts, and works contracts (Order no. 138/2012 and Common Order no.
2266/335/2012). These models were designed to facilitate the work of the contracting
authorities and, at the same time, to ensure a general framework for such contracts.
Unfortunately, the contracting authorities used those models rather mechanically. Very
often, the contracts were only a copy-paste version of the model, without adapting the
contractual terms.

352. Tender (technical) specifications are by far the most sensitive is sue in the
development of tender documents. Technical specifications require sufficient personnel
with proper expertise in the field related to the subject matter of the contract and not
necessary in public procurement. Very often, contracting authorities focus on the legal
aspects of public procurement but they do not have experts for preparing the technical




                                                                                                   92
specifications. In case of contracts for works, despite good technical specifications, major
problems are found in practice. The feasibility studies and detailed technical designs are
prepared, as a rule, by external experts, which are chosen following an award procedure
in accordance with GEO 34/2006. Despite of efforts to select a good designer, the result is
that many technical projects are of low quality. It is likely that such situation occurs
because of frequent use of the lowest bid criterion when the designer is selected.

353. The tender procedures start when the contracting authority sends a contract
notice to be published in ESPP and in OJEU (in the case of high-value contracts). Since
2009, the contracting authorities have to publish all the tender documents in ESPP, at the
same time with the contract notice. Therefore, if the tender documents are accepted by
NARMPP, the system will generate automatically the contract notice, which is sent by
electronic means for publication in OJEU and it is published in ESPP as well. All those
operations are performed without any supplementary intervention of the contracting
authority. In case of high-value contracts, minimum deadlines provided for submitting the
bids or applications are the same as provided in EU Directives. Very often, the economic
operators ask for clarifications; according to the law, the contracting authority shall
answer, as a general rule, in no more than 3 working days, and all the answers have to be
attached in ESPP as supplementary pieces of the tender documents.

354. An evaluation committee must be appointed by the Contracting Authority (CA).
This committee must include specialists in the field of the object of the contract to be
awarded and they must be members of the public procurement department within the
CA. In addition, in order to support the evaluation activities, the CA can also appoint co-
opted external experts. During the award process, the members of the evaluation
committee have a confidentiality obligation regarding the contents of the tenders and any
other information submitted by the tenderers. In addition to the confidentiality
agreement, both the evaluation committee and the co-opted experts must sign a
statement of non-conflict of interest.

355. The evaluation committee will decide on essential clarifications and additions
necessary for the assessment of every tender, and the period granted for providing the
information. In case the explanations submitted by the tenderer are not conclusive, the
tender shall be considered irregular. Equally important, the evaluation committee has the
right to correct the arithmetic errors and the formal flaws only with the tenderer’s
approval. When the tenderer does not accept the correction of these errors/flaws, the
tender will be considered irregular. The evaluation committee has the obligation to reject
the unacceptable and irregular tenders.

356. All the bids are opened in a public opening meeting, immediately after the
expiry of the period for submission of bids, as indicated in the tender documentation.
Participation at this meeting is open to any economic operator who submitted a bid. Any
decision on qualification/selection of bidders/candidates or regarding the evaluation of
bids is precluded during the opening session. During the opening of the bids, no bid can be
rejected, except those that fall amongst one of the following situations:
    • they were submitted after the deadline or at another address than the ones
         stipulated in the contract notice;




                                                                                               93
    •   they are not accompanied by the tender security as it was requested in the tender
        documentation.

357. Subsequent analysis, evaluation, and comparison of bids are conducted by
members of the tender committee. External experts may be co-opted for supporting the
tender committee in evaluation of bids, particularly technical specifications. The external
experts involved do not have the right to vote, but they have the obligation to elaborate a
technical report, which is intended to support the decision-making process for the tender
committee in establishing the successful bidder. This report must be attached to the
report of the award procedure and becomes part of the public procurement file. During
the analysis and verification of the documents presented by the bidders, the tender
committee may, at any time, request clarifications or completions of the documents
presented by the bidders in order to demonstrate the fulfilment of the minimum
qualification requirements or to demonstrate the conformity of the bid with technical
specifications. In practice, it can be noticed an excessive preoccupation of tender
committee for the formal aspects of the bids. It is likely that more than a half of the time
allocated for evaluation of bids is devoted to verification of qualification documents to the
detriment of checking the technical proposal. Too much emphasis is given to the “form”
and it appears that, sometimes, the ultimate goal (“substance”) of the public procurement
process – to get the best value for money – is completely forgotten. In practice, there is
still a clear reluctance of the tender committees to correct errors and the tendency is
rather to reject those bids.

358. Abnormally low bids are now excluded. A clear trend for submitting very low
prices has been noted since 2008. In many cases, those bidders were declared winners
and they concluded the contracts at those prices. The main mechanism for covering the
potential losses was contract addenda and additional revenues, which were easier to
justify given the low quality of the technical projects. Trying to stop this tendency, one of
the amendments introduced in the legislation in 2009 established a rule according to
which a bid offering a price less than 85% of the estimated value of the contract (or, less
than 85% of the arithmetic average of the bid prices submitted, in cases where more than
5 admissible bids are submitted), is considered abnormally low. However, such a bid could
be rejected only after the tender committee asks for explanations from the economic
operator. While the law obliges the members of tender committee to ask for detailed
explanation for abnormally low prices, it is unclear whether they have proper technical
skills to analyze the proposed technical solutions. It would be suitable that at least some
of the members of the tender committees have expertise in assessment of technical
specifications.

359. A specific provision of the law allows any company to participate in award
procedures benefitting from the support of another company, which is not participating
in that procedure. Some of the economic operators as well as contracting authorities
perceive this as controversial since it leads to low capacity firms bidding with artificial or
politically oriented support. For instance, if the qualification requirements are too drastic
for an economic operator (e.g. the minimum level of turnover in the last three years must
be EUR 20,000,000 and his turnover is only EUR 10,000,000), he may prove the fulfillment
of the requirement related to the turnover by presenting a commitment from a third party




                                                                                                 94
who meets the minimum level. The commitment must specify that the bidder will have
access to the resources of the third party and, if he will encounter difficulties during the
execution of the contract, the third party commits to provide the full accomplishment of
the contractual obligations, by direct involvement.

360. The evaluation committee has the obligation to establish the successful tender
within 20 days of the opening date. This deadline may be extended only once, in duly
justified cases. The extension of the evaluation period is not limited by the law, however it
is in practice limited to 45 days and any another extension is prohibited. When the
evaluation of tenders is completed, the committee shall elaborate the report on the
award procedure, which shall be signed by all its members. The report shall be forwarded
to the head of the CA for approval.

361. The contracting authority has the obligation to communicate the outcome of the
process to all economic operators involved in the award procedure. All the information is
to be communicated in writing, as soon as possible, but not later than 3 working days of
the date when the decision has been made.

5.2   Main problems with public procurement in Romania

362. The inadequate public procurement framework features as the most important
obstacle in accessing ROP funds in a survey implemented as part of a previous work. 42
One can certainly argue that the same results can be applied to PNDL. Over 70% of public
beneficiaries rate the inadequate public procurement framework as an extremely or very
important obstacle in the implementation phase.

363. The key issue of public procurement procedures is the suboptimal, inefficient ex-
ante and ex-post verification system, with a chronic lack of accountability to all
stakeholders involved, with the exception of beneficiaries, who are left to bear the
entire burden of potential mistakes. For their part, beneficiaries often lack the technical
capacity to avoid all pitfalls of a very complex public procurement framework (GEO
34/2006 and its many subsequent changes). The central authorities (MRDPA) cannot help
much because that would create a conflict of interest with their role in evaluation, while
the Court of Accounts (CoA) only has a mandate for ex-post audits. There are instead
dedicated institutions that are mandated under Romanian law to oversee and regulate
public procurement, particularly the National Authority for Regulating and Monitoring
Public Procurement (NARMPP), the National Council for Resolving Disputes (NCRD), and
the Unit for the Coordination and Verification of Public Procurement (UCVPP). Currently,
none of these actors is willing to formally “endorse” a clear set of general rules or
resolutions for specific cases, so beneficiaries are left to bear the entire responsibility over
the process without the certainty that the other actors involved help eliminate the risk of
subsequent corrections. Beneficiaries are also the only ones penalized even though past
procurement procedures had passed through the NARMPP and UCVPP filters. In quite a

 See the reports on the “ROP 2.0: MA-IB Collaboration and Support for Beneficiaries of the Regional
Operational Programme 2014-2020” (World Bank, 2013)




                                                                                                   95
few cases, corrections apply long after the sums had been reimbursed (i.e., after another
ex-post set of verifications by the CoA) and even after projects have been fully finalized.

364. A related concern is the lack of technical competencies among auditors.
Beneficiaries note that many auditors come from a finance/economics background and do
not fully understand the technical reasons behind certain procedures (for example,
unpredictable but required works that are not related to errors in project design). In
practice, many beneficiaries do not have a clear understanding of why they are sanctioned
and how the level of penalties is decided.

365. More broadly, the overall public procurement system appears broken.
Procedures take too long and are subject to numerous legal proceedings, often times
initiated by “professional challengers.” There are known firms who participate in biddings
and later challenge them, even without any serious reason. If a challenge is struck down
by the National Council for Resolving Disputes (NCRD), some firms will take the case to
court and can generate delays of up to 1-2 years. A solution that has been suggested in
2010 is fining repeated challengers who dispute public procurement procedures without
just cause. They would stand to lose a small sum of money deposited at the time of the
tender, which is obviously a stick that is not big enough to discourage malevolent legal
action. Currently, the Constitutional Court rejected this measure, being considered against
the law.

366. A key priority to improve the system is to allow a departure from the current
focus on the lowest bid as the default selection criterion. The NARMPP has often shown
reluctance to approve documentation that was based on technical-economic standards
for awarding contracts, and many beneficiaries were requested to review such
documentation. A common practice has emerged of using price as the sole selection
criterion, which was found by beneficiaries to be palatable to the NARMPP, whose
approval is needed before publishing the public procurement procedure on the Electronic
System for Public Procurements (SEAP). The consequences have been often regrettable:
some companies have submitted low-ball, dumping price offers and beneficiaries were
not able to disqualify them, so they ended up with contractors trying to (a) provide low-
quality work and (b) increase the price through various tactics like adjusting the technical
project or claiming “diverse and unforeseen expenditures.” For their part, many
beneficiaries have to deal with poor-quality service providers but avoid cancelling the
contract and organizing new public procurement procedures, for fear of going beyond the
agreed calendar for the project’s implementation, which can also result in financial
corrections. As such, they are often in a “catch-22” situation: break the contract and face
the possibility of losing the PNDL financing for current year, or keep working with cheap
service providers who do poor-quality work

367. In addition to allowing the inclusion of defined indicators of technical quality as
selection criteria, decision-makers should apply regulations allowing for the
disqualification of dumping-price offers. In practice, public tender commissions have had
a hard time proving that particular offers were unreasonable or unfounded, despite the
fact that they used their right to ask for clarifications (as mentioned above). There is a




                                                                                               96
need to involve experienced experts in these commissions to determine and explain more
clearly whether a particular offer is feasible or not.

368. In procedures for awarding contracts for works, the technical projects and the
details of execution are the most important parts of the tender specifications. The
effects of poor quality of the tender specifications are felt during the performance of the
contract; sometimes there is a real need to change the technical solutions or to change
the bill of quantities leading to additional contracts, which mean, according to national
legislation and EU Directives, application of the negotiated procedure without prior
publication. The possibility to apply the negotiated procedure without prior publication
has to be interpreted in a very restrictive manner and low quality of the technical
specifications cannot be accepted as reason for awarding a contract (additional) without
reopening the competition. It is worth to note that NARMPP is not at all involved in
verification of technical specifications.

369. Additional contracts may increase the value of the initial contract, in some cases
far exceeding the estimated value. Therefore, in these cases, execution companies are
awarded the tenders for an amount less than or equal to that estimated by the
contracting authority, but during the execution, the amount is increased by additional
contracts. There are cases when the winner of the tender is performing the works for an
amount that exceeds the offers submitted by some of the competitors.

370. There are some cases when bids can be rigged/fake. Bid rigging/faking involve
secret agreements between bidders in order to increase prices or decrease the quality of
products, services, or works to the beneficiaries. The goal is to win the bid at a better price
than would normally result in competition (competitive price). Rigging/faking a tender/bid
takes many forms, but essentially, the bidders agree to act together as a cartel. Among
the participants in the bidding may arise secret agreements for sharing the market,
agreements on winning the bids “by rotation,” agreements that establish successful
tenders, the others participating just to have the minimum number of bidders (so-called
dead hands), arrangements to reward the unsuccessful tenderers by subcontracting, etc.
Another case of rigged/fake bids can be made by proposing peculiar conditions in the
tender specifications that can only be achieved by certain enterprises. These bids are also
called “dedicated bids.”

5.3   Recommendations for improving the public procurement framework

371. Public procurement law must find a compromise between excessive regulation,
meant to ensure strict compliance with governing principles, and freedom of decision,
which would allow contracting authorities to select those tenders that suit best their
particular needs. The following list of recommendations offers potential solutions for
addressing the issues related to the current public procurement framework and ease the
burden on ROP beneficiaries implementing projects. It is important to note that some of
these ideas are particularly technical, while others require a national-level resolution. That
said, the hope is that these suggestions help advance the conversation on an extremely
complex and sensitive topic – public procurement – and enable PNDL beneficiaries to




                                                                                                  97
organize efficient and effective procedures for awarding contracts. At a minimum, some of
these ideas could form the basis of upcoming changes to Romania’s public procurement
law (Government Emergency Ordinance 34/2006), in line with corresponding dynamics at
the EU level.

372. An improved public procurement framework should aim to reduce, to a
minimum, the number of contracts awarded on the basis of the “lowest bid” criterion
and instead rely, in most cases, on the “most economically advantageous tender”
(MEAT) criterion . This evolution, which concerns the entire public procurement field,
resonates with similar concerns at the EU level. There could be a minimum share
(expressed as a percentage of the total value of contract award procedures launched
yearly by a contracting authority) for the contracts awarded based on the MEAT criterion.
These measures involve some changes in the national legislative framework, but they
align with the developments of the Community rules on public procurement. Because they
are based on administrative levers, these measures possess the advantage of having an
immediate effect on the change of the proportion of contracts awarded on the basis of
the MEAT vs. lowest bid criterion and enable, at the same time, the unbiased, rigorous
verification of their compliance (as a % of total contracts awarded).

373. Contracting authorities would benefit from recommended sets of evaluation
factors, based on broad types of public contracts. These factors should be synthetic and
allow for an objective assessment of the tenders, but they have to be, at the same time,
relevant to the object of the contract.

374. Better support is needed to help contracting authorities prevent and avoid
potential conflicts of interests. This can be achieved by providing PNDL beneficiaries with
detailed checklists as a mandatory component of the tender evaluation process. These
should be drawn up based on the template used by PNDL. Raising awareness on conflicts
of interests by filling out such checklists will allow contracting authorities (in good faith) to
avoid omissions due to negligence or to lack of training/experience of the staff. In addition
to a minimum methodology for the verification of conflicts of interests (e.g., guidance
notes on how to fill out the proposed detailed checklists), it is necessary that the relevant
legal provisions be synthesized and clarified. The NARMPP has already begun this effort,
as demonstrated through the issuance of Order no. 170/2012 concerning the
interpretation of Art. 691 of the GEO 34/2006 governing the conflict of interests between
economic operators participating in a procurement procedure and people who hold
decision-making positions within the contracting authority.

375. The usage of professional liability insurances should be expand ed. According to
art. 185 (1) (a) of GEO 34/2006, the economic and financial situation of a particular agent
can also be demonstrated with evidence related to the existence of professional risk
insurance. With regard to this qualification criterion, NARMPP has decided, by Order
509/2011, to restrict the possibility of using this requirement only to cases expressly
regulated by legal provisions (e.g., technical design services.) 43 In the past, some

43According to NARMPP's interpretation, as it follows from Order 509/2011, the following qualification
requirement is unrestrictive: “the bidder must produce evidence regarding the professional risk insurance




                                                                                                      98
contracting authorities have included the requirement concerning the professional liability
insurance in the template for the contract, annexed to part of the procurement
documents. Although this practice has not been expressly approved by NARMPP, the
generalization of this requirement is necessary to improve the delivery of services and, as
argued elsewhere in this report, to “clean up” the market by charging higher premiums of
those providers who do not fulfil their obligations. In order to apply this requirement, the
request for professional liability insurance must be regulated for additional types of
services (following the example of design services, mentioned by NARMPP) and rules must
be adopted on how to calculate the ceiling of professional liability insurance, in order to
avoid situations in which this requirement would be deemed excessive or restrictive.

376. Public procurement procedures can be launched under a “suspension clause”.
Taking into account the significant duration of the selection, the evaluation, and the
contracting stages, the deferred launching of the award procedure, after the signing of the
financing contract, can lead to failure to comply with the schedule of activities, because of
possible delays in public procurement. From this point of view, a possible solution consists
in the launch of awa rd procedures under a “suspension” conditional clause (“clauză
suspensivă”), the effect intervening after the designation of the successful tender, but
prior to the signing of the public contract. The conclusion of the public contract is
delayed/suspended until a particular condition is met (i.e., the financing request
submitted by the beneficiary is approved by the PNDL). This solution requires specifying in
the call for tenders and in other procurement documents that the failure to sign the
financing contract will determine the annulment of the procedure, based on art. 209 (1)
(c) of GEO 34/2006, because the signing of the public contract has become impossible.
This will ensure an appropriate degree of transparency and protect the contracting
authority against a potential liability claim made, in the case of annulment, by the
successful bidder.

377. Recommended templates should be designed for contractual variation clauses.
In the case of public works contracts, the actual performance of the contracts may reveal
differences against the quantities estimated by the technical documents. In order to
regulate such changes of the object of the contract, where they do not involve a review of
the technical solution adopted or of the technical requirements laid down in the
specifications agreed to by the contractor, the contracting authorities can include, in the
contract template, certain variation clauses according to which the final price of the
contract is to be determined as the product between the prices/quantities initially
tendered and the actual costs resulted from works on the ground. Obviously, this option is
valid only if the price of the contract has not been determined in its absolute value, but
only provisionally, as a product between the prices per unit and the quantities of works
estimated by the technical documentation. The legality of variation clauses has been
confirmed also by the letter No. MARKT/C3/EP/kr (2012) 677516 of the General
Directorate Internal Market and Services of the European Commission, but is subject to
the cumulative fulfilment of the following requirements:

related to the contract to be awarded, only if there are legal provisions governing such a situation.” At the
same time, according to the same legal act, it is deemed restrictive a requirement concerning “the
submission by the economic operator of professional risk insurance.”




                                                                                                          99
     •  the formula for calculating the final price has to be defined, objectively, and it
        should be communicated to all prospective bidders, by including it in the
        procurement documents or in the contract template; and
    • variations of the quantities of work and, implicitly, of the price actually paid have
        to result from the mechanical application of the variation clauses.
This solution has the advantage of being suitable to both the current tendering method
for public works contracts, based on detailed items, as well as to the method based on
consolidated components,. The adoption of the solution would be facilitated by the
development of standard contractual clauses (preferably by NARMPP), as well as by
defining the specific implementation mechanism, in order to avoid applying it in the case
of modifications deemed as “substantial.” It is important to emphasize that, as the
European Commission has also specified, by using such contractual clauses, the variations
of the quantities of works and of the final price do not constitute modifications of the
contract per se, but only the application of the provisions of the initial contract.

378. Support for PNDL beneficiaries in the procurement process should be provided.

The assessors may be required by the beneficiaries to evaluate bids and payments from
the PNDL budget and they must be MRDPA certified engineers as site inspector ( Diriginte

Contribution of the new Directives in the EU public procurement framework

379. Three new directives on public procurement bring a significant reform to the
Community law framework 44. In December 2011 the Commission proposed the revision of
Directives 2004/17/EC (procurement in the water, energy, transport and postal services
sectors) and 2004/18/EC (public works, supply and service contracts), as well as the
adoption of a directive on concession contracts. The directives were voted by the
European Parliament on 15 January 2014 and adopted by the Council on 11 February
2014. The Member States have until April 2016 to transpose the new rules into their
national law (except with regard to e-procurement, where the deadline is September
2018).

380. Some of the new provisions are already included in various forms in the
Romanian legislation on public procurement (like the right of the bidders to provide,
initially, only a self-declaration as preliminary evidence that the economic operator
fulfils the relevant qualification criteria), so transposition should be easy. Nonetheless,
more attention should be given, at the national level, to how existing legal mechanisms
and instruments can be applied in practice. The following list is not a comprehensive
review of EU-level changes in public procurement, but merely highlights some issues that
will interest PNDL beneficiaries.

381. The New Directive on public procurement provides for the reduction of the
minimum deadlines for receipt of requests to participate and for receipt of tenders. The
New Directive on public procurement, as set in the text, compared to Directive
2004/18/EC, establishes minimum deadlines comparing with former Directive. The
significant reduction of deadlines for receipt of requests to participate and for receipt of
tenders will accelerate the public procurement procedures. Although the deadlines set by
the Proposal for a Directive on public procurement are minimal, the Member States
having the right to establish longer deadlines, in Romania’s case, it is recommended to
adjust the new minimum deadlines. This adjustment will also speed up the process of
implementing the projects and will minimize the risk of incurring delays versus the
timetable of activities, as set in the financing application. Nonetheless, contracting
authorities should be made aware of the fact that the actual deadlines must be set in
accordance with the complexity of the contract and/or its specific requirements. This
obligation is already provided for by the Romanian legislation (art. 71 of GEO 34/2006),
but it will gain even greater importance if the deadlines are reduced. In order to help
contracting authorities, it would be useful to define guidelines for determining the proper
deadlines for a public procurement procedure, so that these are adequate and sufficient,
as required by the aforementioned legal basis.

382. The directive requires contracting authorities to exclude from participation in a
procurement procedure the economic operators that are in breach of their obligations
related to the payment of taxes or social security contributions. A direct consequence of
this fact will be the obligation of contracting authorities to request from economic
operators the relevant documents in order to check if the aforementioned exclusion
grounds apply. Noncompliance with this may lead to serious outcomes, including
awarding a contract to an economic operator that should have been excluded.

383. A new reason for excluding economic operators from a procurement procedure
includes significant or persistent deficiencies in the performance of a substantive
requirement under a prior contract, which led to early termination of that prior
contract, damages, or other comparable sanctions [art. 57]. This provision allows
contracting authorities to sanction those economic operators that have not fulfilled,
properly and according to the quality standards agreed upon, their previous contractual
obligations, by excluding them from the procurement procedure.

384. The New Directive on public procurement, as set out in the compromise text,
provides for the wider use of self-declarations by economic operators, in the form of the
European Single Procurement Document (art. 59). This provision states the obligation of
contracting authorities to accept that economic operators submit, instead of certificates
issued by public authorities or third parties, the European Single Procurement Document
consisting of an updated self-declaration as preliminary evidence for fulfilling part of the
selection criteria. The main aspects of the European Single Procurement Document are
already regulated in the national legislation on public procurement: art. 11 (4)-(6) of GD
925/2006 stipulate the right of economic operators to submit, initially, only a self-
declaration by which they attest the fulfilment of the qualification criteria set in the
tender documents.




                                                                                               101
385. The growing Community trend of favoring „the most economically
advantageous tender” (MEAT) award criterion is easily discernible. In the New Directive
art 67 it is written that, „contracting authorities shall base the award of public contracts
on the most economically advantageous tender.” However, the text brings an important
nuance: although it mentions only one award criterion – the „most economically
advantageous tender,” the actual definition of this criterion reveals the role that the price
or cost still plays. Thus, the most economically advantageous tender from the point of
view of the contracting authority shall be identified on the basis of the price or cost (using
a cost-effectiveness approach, such as life-cycle costing) and may include the best price-
quality ratio, which shall be assessed on the basis of criteria including qualitative,
environmental, and/or social aspects linked to the subject matter of the public contract.
Consequently, contracting authorities have the possibility of applying the revised MEAT
criterion, based solely on the cost or price offered.

386. As for criteria used to determine the best price-quality ratio, the Proposal
introduces another major change: the possibility of using criteria like the organization,
qualification, and experience of staff assigned to performing the contract. This is
particularly useful in situations where the quality of the staff employed can significantly
affect the level of performance of the contract, allowing contracting authorities to
evaluate and score tenders based on the staff designated for performing the work.

387. Finally, the Directive defines more cases in which contracts and framework
agreements may be modified without a new procurement procedure [art. 72 (1)]. Out of
these, of particular significance is the one stipulated by art. 71 (1) (a), according to which
modifications may occur, irrespective of their monetary value, where they have been
provided for in the initial procurement documents in clear, precise, and unequivocal
review clauses (which may include price revision clauses), or options


5.4   Choice of contract type

388. The historical conditions of the pre-1990 socialist economy meant that the
contracting parties were more or less representing the same player – the state. 45 Under
this system, the work used to be performed by a general contractor (usually a large state
enterprise) and the construction phase was preceded by a full design provided by a state
design institute covering all design specialties. As a result, the contracts used to be rather
sketchy regardless of project size, complexity, or cost. Today’s industry has inherited this
situation, and is more used to a certain contractual simplicity and with a basic traditional
procurement route. Regarding the formulation of contracts, post-1990 efforts were
mainly concerned with the update of main legal contract provisions to respond to the new
legal statutory frame. Very little has been done to prepare the managerial and executive
parts of the contracts to offer better-adapted managerial tools to suit the new economic
conditions. This resulted in a low degree of contractual harmonization with:

     •   the progress of procurement routes and the emergence of new types of
         collaboration in construction (such as design and build formulas, adopted
         especially by the public sector);
     •   the specific and technical-operational working procedures that accompany the
         modern management of complex construction projects.

389. Traditionally PNDL contracts are simple and straightforward. From a sample of
contracts analyzed, the quality ranges from very good contracts quite similar to FIDIC
Green type (discussed below) to simple forms establishing the obligations of each party.

390. While in theory the beneficiary could chose the type of contract that works best
for defining the work components to be executed by the contractor, in practice all PNDL
contracts are for execution based on bill of quantities. The main reasons for this choice
(over a design and build contract) is the low quality of the feasibility studies and the lack
of familiarity with design and build contracts. If the beneficiary designs a project and then
contract out its execution, the technical designer will be mandated to develop a bill of
quantities (BoQ). The BoQ is used in the tendering procedures and helps contractors price
the work required, and also ensures consistency and comparability across different offers.
Designers in Romania typically develop the BoQ with the help of a computerized system
that has data on standard, defined items (based on a collection of construction items of
work – “indicatoare de norme de deviz”).

391. More importantly, the current method preferred by designers is to use BoQs
bas ed on detailed items instead of consolidated components (“articole comasate”),
which generates difficulties during the implementation phase. The approach based on
detailed articles dates from the communist era, when the government implemented all
projects and required extensive explanations for every material used, including its
quantity and its price. This is not needed under a system where a beneficiary and a service
provider agree on a defined list of major components to be delivered as part of a
construction project, along with set indicators and aggregate costs. The essential point is
that the best practice of using consolidated items should be adopted by both beneficiaries
and designers.

392. Compared to the model described above, the design-and-build contract should
provide even more flexibility for contractors with respect to the quantities used, within
the limits defined by the beneficiary. In this case, there is no need to define specific
quantities ex-ante if the contractor is also in charge of developing the technical project.
According to a recent JASPERS report, if a bill of quantities BOQ is included by the
designer, “it can [then] be difficult to agree on the cost of variations if the work defined in
the BOQ is higher or lower than that shown on the tender drawings or defined in the
general specifications.” 46 Ultimately, the principle enunciated above remains valid: the
simpler it is for beneficiaries to define construction work components and monitor their
completion, the more efficient the whole system becomes. This also translates in

beneficiaries and the construction site supervisor having more capacity to focus on other
critical items, instead of tracking every single item and material that goes into producing a
certain deliverable.

393. At the end of the day, the type of contract and BoQ used should be above all the
beneficiary’s choice based on which model delivers greater benefits. A few supporters of
the current preference for detailed items note that it is a method for preventing
corruption and ill-intentioned cost changes. In practice, however, this does not work
because contractors who would resort to such practices have easy ways of tricking the
system. What is more, it should not be important whether the list of detailed items is
implemented exactly as requested, but rather that the final product is according to all
requested specifications. Keeping in mind the various contract forms in use, MA and IB
experts should advise beneficiaries of ROP funds to rely on the system that is easiest and
most efficient to implement.

394. In particular, the FIDIC standard contract forms would help beneficiaries manage
projects better, while protecting the interests of all stakeholders involved. FIDIC, which
stands for the International Federation of Consulting Engineers, is an international private
organization that has developed since the 1950s various contract forms to facilitate the
implementation of infrastructure and construction projects. Gradually, the superior
quality of these proposed forms has translated into more and more people adopting them
around the world. The main benefits of the FIDIC contracts revolve around a balanced
sharing of risks between the beneficiary and the contractor and a greater degree of
familiarity of international investors with the specific conditions and procedures
mandated by these contracts. Indeed, the FIDIC contracts have already demonstrated
their usefulness by covering a broad range of situations that may arise during the project’s
implementation and having clear mechanisms for resolving them in a fair and transparent
manner. Since both beneficiaries and service providers benefit from adopting the FIDIC
contract (compared to other formats that may expose one of the parties to greater risks),
this practice has taken deep roots in the vast majority of developed countries, as well as
for projects implemented by multilateral development banks.

395. In a welcomed recognition of the potential benefits involved in the adoption of
red and yellow FIDIC, the Ministry of European Funds (MEF) has launched a significant
effort to reintroduce these contract forms into the Romanian legislation. The first step
was the May 2013 World Bank report on Improving the National Framework for Preparing
and Implementing Public Investment Projects. This work built on the request expressed by
consulting firms, technical designers, as well as public and private sector beneficiaries,
who manifested a strong preference for FIDIC. The MEF initiated several rounds of
consultations and, in August 2013, published a draft document on three types of FIDIC
contracts (red, yellow, and green), noting its intention to adopt these forms through a
legislative act with a higher authority than a simple Minister Directive (i.e., a Government
Decision). This would prevent conflicts with the current Romanian legislation and improve
the chances of beneficiaries adopting the FIDIC contracts, leveraging all the corresponding
benefits described above.

396. While its approval is still pending, the new FIDIC proposal promises to solve a
number of critical issues that have slowed the implementation of public investment
projects (including investments with ROP co-financing). Specifically:
    • Unpredictable circumstances: The new FIDIC General Conditions clearly define
       what conditions need to be fulfilled for a particular situation to be qualified as




                                                                                                105
        “unpredictable,” a matter of great debate and c onfusion during the 2007-2013
        period.
    •   Role of the engineer : The Engineer has to obtain the beneficiary’s approval in a
        number of instances, such as: particular technical solutions leading to increases in
        the contract’s price (clause 3.5); the appointment of subcontractors (4.4); the
        extension of the execution timeline (8.4); the suspension of works, partially or in
        full (8.8); and increases in the contract’s value beyond the approved budget for
        eligible expenditures, with the potential to minimize the number of instances
        when a particular needed expense is considered “ineligible” and has to be
        incurred by the beneficiary (clauses 13.1, 13.3., 13.5, and 13.6). Importantly,
        however, an issue left unresolved even under the new proposal is the amendment
        of Law 10/1995 that should reflect the role of the engineer, as warranted by FIDIC.
    •   Professional insurance for designers: It is recommended to add a clause (to article
        18) requiring technical designers to have professional insurance. A potential
        formulation of this clause follows: “The contractor has to own a professional
        insurance policy that would cover all risks associated to professional negligence in
        the design of the project. The minimum level of the coverage should be equal to
        the total sum presented in the Annex to the offer. The contractor is required to
        maintain this policy up to the deadline mentioned in the same Annex.” As noted
        earlier in the report, this requirement would significantly boost the designer’s
        ownership over the quality of the product and gradually “clean” the market of
        those firms that are not abiding by rigorous standards.
    •   Dispute Adjudication Board: The proposal introduces for the first time the Dispute
        Adjudication Board (DAB), as the main body responsible for mediating between
        the key parties (beneficiary, contractor, engineer, etc.). The DAB is fundamental
        for accelerating the pace of projects’ implementation and can prevent lengthy
        court procedures.
    •   Existing utility networks: The new FIDIC adds a special clause to the following
        effect: “The contractor is required to know in advance, based on documentation
        submitted by the beneficiary and relevant entities, the physical location of all
        utilities, before the start of any works that may affect the existing networks.”
        While this clause is needed, this would also require that the beneficiary allow
        sufficient time for contractors to prepare their offers and become fully aware of
        the reality on the ground (i.e., under the minimum timeframe of 45 days).
    •   Reception of partial works: The new FIDIC contracts would permit beneficiaries,
        upon the Engineer’s recommendation, to receive partial works, as long as they are
        physically and functionally independent components of the larger project. This
        would create a win-win situation: the beneficiary could begin using certain parts
        of the investment sooner; the contractor would be able to cash in the warranty
        for proper execution; and the overall absorption rate would accelerate.

397. More broadly, the FIDIC contracts ensure that there are balanced
responsibilities between all the key parties – beneficiaries, consultants, designers, and
contractors. In addition, when finalized, the legislative proposal should be correlated with




                                                                                               106
the latest changes in this area: for example, the NARMPP recently issued Order no.
138/2012, which regulates certain provisions for FIDIC contracts applicable to road works.

398. For major projects related to water supply and wastewater, Romania is already
using Yellow and Red FIDIC contracts. Red FIDIC contracts are usually used for execution
of water supply and wastewater networks including necessary pumping stations. A
common situation is to provide water supply and wastewater networks through Red FIDIC
contracts and pumping stations through Yellow FIDIC contracts within the same contract
(also called Yellow in Red). Yellow FIDIC contracts are usually used for execution of
treatment plants, as well as for all types of works with specific execution or operation
technology. In this case, the design is also provided by the constructor.

399. Similarly, both Yellow and Red FIDIC are used for major road works. While Red
FIDIC is used for rehabilitation of national roads, Yellow FIDIC is used for new highways
and motorways.

400. Green FIDIC is adapted to PDNL projects. Green FIDIC is suitable for projects of
small value and low complexity. These are precisely the main characteristics of PNDL
investments. Adoption of Green FIDIC for PNDL may represent a significant step towards
improving the speed and efficiency of implementation. The proposal for Green FID IC is
provided in the annex.

5.5   Conclusions

401. The award criteria should move from the current “lowest bid” criterion to the
“most economically advantageous tender” (MEAT) criterion. There could be a minimum
share (expressed as a percentage of the total value of contract award procedures
launched yearly by a contracting authority) for the contracts awarded based on the MEAT
criterion. This way the competition between enterprises will focus on technical aspects,
not only financial considerations. In addition, this measure will force enterprises to do
their own research for design and building technologies that are more efficient and
effective.

402. Higher attention must be given to technical specifications. Qualified technical
experts, proving no conflict of interest with the bidding companies, must be systematically
involved in the selection process. This will be even more relevant and needed as the use
of MEAT with quality criteria becomes more prevalent.

403. It is very important to make the technical specifications for public procurements
as complete as possible. Requiring new, green, and smart technologies for the
construction of roads, water distribution systems, wastewater plants, and social
infrastructure would be a first step to improve the quality of infrastructure in Romania.

404. Public procurement procedures can be launched under a “suspension clause.”
Taking into account the significant duration of the selection, the evaluation, and the
contracting stages, the deferred launching of the award procedure, after the signing of the




                                                                                              107
financing contract, can lead to failure to comply with the schedule of activities, because of
possible delays in public procurement. From this point of view, a possible solution consists
in the launch of award procedures under a “suspension” conditional clause (“clauză
suspensivă”). The conclusion of the public contract is delayed/suspended until a particular
condition is met (i.e., the financing request submitted by the beneficiary is approved by
the PNDL).

405. Green FIDIC should be adapted to PDNL projects. Green FIDIC is suitable for
projects of small value and low complexity. These are precisely the main characteristics of
PNDL investments. Adoption of Green FIDIC for PNDL may represent a significant step
toward improving the speed and efficiency of implementation.

6.1    Roles and responsibilities

406. The actors involved in the construction process are the Designer, the Certified
Project Verifier, the Constructor, the Certified Technical Execution Responsible (RTE),
the Site Inspector, and the Certified Technical Expert. In compliance with Law no.
10/1995 on the quality in constructions, all the actors involved in the design and execution
of works are responsible for the level of quality of the construction works for which they
are contracted, according to the requirements.

407. The execution of the construction works is the joint effort of the
Beneficiary/Investor, design team, site inspector and Constructor/Contractor. This
process entails technical, financial, and legal aspects necessary to fulfill, during the entire
lifetime of the construction, the essential requirements relating to: a) mechanical
resistance and stability; b) fire safety; c) hygiene, health and environment; d) operating
reliability; e) noise protection; f) energy saving and thermal insulation.

408. In PNDL, beneficiaries are responsible for monitoring work progress and
reporting updates to county councils and to MRDPA. The flow of reports is similar to the
one presented for financing requests: local beneficiaries send all documents
corresponding to PNDL investments to county councils; every quarter, county councils
send to the MRDPA a consolidated update on the progress of construction works. Upon
request, beneficiaries are required to send to the MRDPA any document related to the
financed project. For its part, the MRDPA is responsible for the monitoring and controlling
the program’s implementation. In this capacity, the Ministry can appoint representatives
who, together with counterparts from the State Inspectorate for Constructions, verify the
accuracy of reported data and compare it to the reality on the ground.

409. The state control of construction works is conducted by the State Inspectorate
for Constructions (ISC) throughout Romania, through its related regional inspectorates
that order the measures and penalties provided by the law. Through its regional
inspectorates, ISC may order halting the construction works when it finds that the works
are carried out in violation of legal provisions, of requirements related to construction
quality assurance, without the basic engineering technical design or based on an illegally
issued construction permit. Through its regional inspectorates, ISC informs the public
administration authority on whose territory the inspection was performed about the
findings and the instructed measures. In this situation, the control bodies of the County
Council / Local Council have to monitor and follow up on the manner in which the ISC
instructions are implemented.




                                                                                                  109
410. The Constructor must respect the main obligations as provided in Art. 23 of Law
no. 10/1995 on quality in constructions. Thereby, the Constructor must perform the
following actions:
     • inform the Beneficiary/Investor on the nonconformities and non-compliances
        found in the technical design, so that these problems can be solved;
     • start the execution of works solely to the legally authorized constructions and
        solely on the basis and in compliance with the designs verified by the certified
        specialists;
     • ensure the designed quality level through its own staff, which includes certified
        technical specialists in charge with the construction;
     • invite the parties that are to take part in the inspection of works that have
        reached decisive stages of execution (determinant phases) and provide the
        necessary conditions performing works, so that work continuation approval is
        obtained;
    •   solve nonconformities, faults, and non-compliances that occur during the
        execution stages, only according to the solutions established by the Designer with
        Beneficiary’s/Investor approval;
    •   for the construction works, only use the products and procedures that are
        provided in the technical design, are certified or approved, and meet the essential
        requirements, and manage the control samples;
    •   replace the products and procedures provided in the design with the ones that
        comply with the specified conditions, only based on the solutions proposed by the
        designer with the beneficiary’s/Investor’s approval.
    •   observe the technical designs and detailed engineering to achieve the quality level
        in compliance with the requirements;
    •   notify within 24 hours the State Inspectorate for Constructions (ISC) in case any
        technical failures occur during the construction works;
    •   implement the measures included in the control documents or construction works
        acceptance documents in a timely manner;
    •   remedy, at the contractor’s own expense, the defects that occurred by its fault
        both during the construction period and during the warranty period, as stipulated
        by the law;
    •   leave the temporarily occupied areas in their initial condition, upon the
        completion of the works;
    •   establish the responsibilities of all participants in the production process –
        decision makers, collaborators, subcontractors – according to an own quality
        assurance system and based on legal provisions.

411. The construction works’ compliance with the documentation will be checked for
the Constructor by the technical specialist in charge (RTE). The beneficiary will supervise
the works through the site inspector. The work site inspector’s du ties and responsibilities
are in accordance with the provisions of Law 10/1995 on quality in constructions. The
main purpose of works verification is to confirm observance of the project, specific
technical regulations, and material specifications within the limits provided by the quality




                                                                                               110
indicators and admissible deviations. Depending on the time when verifications are
performed, such verifications target the following:
     •   Determine – by measurements – the correspondence of the checked elements
         with the project;
     •   Verify the existence of documents certifying the quality of materials and
         equipment used in the works;
     •   Perform the tests and trials required by the projects and technical regulations,
         and prepare the documents summarizing such test and trial results as well as the
         Inspection Reports on buried works;
     •   Examine the existence and content of the documentation and inspection reports,
         as well as their summaries and conclusions;
     •   Conduct random checking (at the request of Reception Commission) and
         additional tests to confirm the correctness and validity of the signed documents (if
         these are requested).

412. The contract performance guarantee is established by the contractor to ensure
the Beneficiary that the works will be performed completely and properly during the
agreed contract timeframe. In the tender documents, the Beneficiary will provide the
manner in which the performance guarantee is to be set up and its value, which will not
exceed 10% of the contract price, VAT excluded. 47 Typically, the performance guarantee is
set up by a guarantee instrument issued by a bank or insurance company, in accordance
with the law, and it becomes an appendix to the contract. For works contracts, the
contracting authority is required to issue/return the performance guarantee as follows:
     •   70% of the value within 14 days of the signature of the Reception/acceptance
         report upon works completion, provided that no claims have been made in
         relation to such guarantee and that the hidden defect risk is minimal;
     •   the remaining 30% of the value, upon the expiry of the warranty period for the
         executed works, according to the final acceptance report.

413. The designer, including specialists in architecture, strength and installations, is
initially remunerated for elaboration of the technical design (level of the technical
documentation for construction permit - DTAC) and obtaining the building permit.
During this period many versions, modifications, and changes are discussed and agreed
between the Beneficiary and the Designer. The Beneficiary may suspend payment,
respectively the design, until the construction permit is obtained. It may also happen that
the Beneficiary intentionally undertakes the modification of the technical design,, which is
followed by the redesign of the entire structure after the building permit is obtained. In
such circumstances, the Constructor will not receive the entire project in due time and
thus he will not have time to find any errors or inconsistencies.




47
  According art. 89 of Government Resolution no. 925/2006 on the approval of the rules for the
implementation of the provisions concerning the award of public procurement contracts stipulated by the
Government Emergency Ordinance no. 34/2006, as subsequently amended and supplemented.




                                                                                                   111
414. The work guarantee term (period) is the time between the date of acceptance at
work completion and the final acceptance date, the duration of which is provided under
the contract. Within the warranty period, the constructor must remove, at its own
expense, all the deficiencies that occur due to failure to comply with the contract clauses
or specifications or with the applicable technical regulations. 48


6.2   Preparatory steps

415. The management system of construction works is specific for every Romanian
constructing company based on the national legislation on quality and occupational
health and safety, financial/accounting, public procurement (if applicable), and legal
field. Alignment of national construction quality requirements to the international
requirements took the form of Law no. 10 on quality in constructions adopted on January
18, 1995. Control quality programme for determinant phases is specific for each type of
work and is elaborated by the Designer in the technical design, and is endorsed by the ISC.

416. According to legislation in force (Law 50/1991 on authorizing the cons truction,
republished and amended), the execution of construction works may start only for
constructions authorized under the law. Delays in the release of building permits from
specialized departments in Local Councils / County Councils (mostly due to the delay of
issuance of approvals by the specialized bodies) lead to delays in starting the construction
process. Given that investments of this kind are financed from the PNDL budget,
beneficiaries cannot afford to waste a calendar year due to bureaucracy, lack of staff, or
other reasons put forward by issuing bodies and are forcing the start of the construction
process without having a building permit.

417. The execution of the construction works can be achieved solely based on
technical design developed at the level of detailed engineering. The issuing authority of
the construction permit establishes a timeframe for works commencement of max. 12
months from the issuance date, during which the applicant has the obligation to start the
works. The permit is valid for the entire period of works execution, according to the basic
technical design. The Beneficiary is obliged to notify the construction permit issuing
authority and the construction regional inspectorate about the date when the authorized
works are to be commenced. These deadlines can be extended to a maximum of 12
months; after that, permit reissuance is required.

418. Technological designs, which correlate and include all technological processes
needed to achieve a certain stage of a work, tend to simplify and improve the
organization of infrastructure works. Technological projects include physical stages and
flowcharts of operations, technological descriptions of processes, and all this information
is needed for the development of economic documentation in order to ensure both
quality and economically efficient work execution.



48See GD no. 273/1994 on the approval of the Regulation for the acceptance of construction works and
related installations, as subsequently amended and supplemented




                                                                                                112
419. There are also some issues arising from the design process that may affect the
proper construction process. These include: problems caused by design errors mainly due
to the lack of accuracy of the feasibility studies or support studies (topographic survey and
geological studies); lack of knowledge of the real on-site situation; and the changes in the
on-site situation between the preparation of the technical design and detailed engineering
design and the actual commencement of the execution works.

420. If any inaccurate topographic survey is found, it should be determined whether
the level difference between the geodetic levels provided in the project and the actual
geodetic levels are constant throughout all networks/entire road or differ in various
network areas/road sections. If the level differences are constant, the implications on the
construction works are minor and the actors involved can switch from the absolute level
measuring system to the relative level measuring system. This change will not affect the
quality of works, the amount of works or, ultimately, the construction costs. It should be
pointed out that the post-execution drawings should present the real situation, having the
measuring system expressed in absolute levels.

421. When performing the topographical survey to set the site boundaries, some
observations may arise in relation to the intersection between the designed road and
private land. This is caused by the fact that the Designer has worked based on old,
outdated drawings, which were not approved by the Office for Cadaster and Land
Registration (OCPI). In consequence, delays appear in the project implementation
schedule due to the unclear legal status of the land. It is therefore necessary to issue
immediately a work site provision/instruction for the update of the technical
documentation. The fault belongs to the designer because the designer has not carried
out its work based on the drawings approved by OCPI, but also to the Beneficiary, because
it is the Beneficiary’s responsibility to hand over to the Constructor the land unoccupied,
free of charges. The solutions must include an update of the cadaster drawings and
clarifying clarification of the legal status based on precise topographic survey. Afterwards,
the road will be redesigned based on the plans approved by OCPI. One solution would be
to keep the road structure and dimensions, if the road width cannot be reduced, and to
lease additional land, or both solutions combined (redesign the road and lease additional
land). The final solution will be chosen by the Beneficiary together with the designer,
based on technical and economic grounds.

422. Careful attention should be paid to the intersection between various water
supply and sewerage systems and to any level differences of such systems. If the level
differences on various sections of the network are not constant, the implications on the
actual execution of works are major and can lead to technical solutions that are different
from those provided by the designer in the technical design and detail engineering design.
These different technical solutions may lead to different works quantities and even works
that are different from those provided in the initial project, which may finally affect the
value of the execution contract. Such issues are solved by site provisions/instructions
drawn up by the designer and implemented by the Constructor. If the value of the
contract is exceeded by these site provisions/instructions, any additional value will be
covered by the designer (FIDIC Red book) or by the constructor (FIDIC Yellow book). It
should be underlined that the post-execution drawings must present the real situation.




                                                                                                113
423. In case of problems caused by the designer’s lack of knowledge of the actual on-
site situation, the implications on the execution could be major and could lead to
technical solutions that are different from those provided by the designer in the basic
engineering and detail engineering design. These different technical solutions may lead
to different works quantities and even works that are different from those provided in the
initial project, which may finally affect the value of the execution contract. Such issues are
solved by site provisions/instructions drawn up by the designer and implemented by the
constructor. If the value of the contract is exceeded by these work site instructions, any
additional value will be covered by the designer. It should be underlined that the post -
execution drawings must present the real situation.

424. For the problems caused by the changes in the real on -site situation that has
occurred between the technical design and detail engineering design date, and the
actual commencement of the works, the implications on the construction wo rks could
be major and could lead to technical solutions that are different from those provided by
the designer in the technical design and detail engineering design. These different
technical solutions may lead to different works quantities and even works that are
different from those provided in the initial project, which may finally affect the value of
the execution contract. Such issues are solved by work site provisions/instructions drawn
up by the designer and implemented by the constructor. If the value of the contract is
exceeded by these work site instructions, any additional value will be covered from the
project budget, line 5.3 on “Diverse and unforeseen expenditures.” It should be
underlined that the post-execution drawings must present the real situation.

425. Legislative changes are valid from the moment the Law is published, which may
generate ad-hoc technical and economic changes in the design and execution process. If
the design process has a certain flexibility, changes in the execution process lead to
additional costs and delays.

426. Inconsistencies caused by errors in the preparation of the tender/ bid, based on
which the execution contract was awarded are mainly caused by arithmetic errors when
filling out the lists of quantities. The amounts paid to the constructor will be those
provided in the contract if the correct amount is higher than the amount stipulated in the
contract, or the actual ones if the correct amount is lower than the amount stipulated in
the contract.


6.3   Analysis of best practice regarding technologies proposed to improve cost effectiveness
      for infrastructure investments in Romania

427. The use of new and improved construction materials is an important aspect of
today’s economy. Considering the best international practices, new solutions for road
infrastructure, water and wastewater systems, and social infrastructure are available
regarding the materials used. This way, green and environment friendly infrastructure can
be built.




                                                                                                 114
ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE

428. From the perspective of the materials used, road pavements can be classified
into three major groups, although they have the same function – to take over and
transmit traffic loads to the foundation ground. These three categories are:
    • Flexible road pavement - consists of a series of layers made of mechanically
        stabilized non-cohesive materials and / or hydrocarbon binders, wear and base
        layer made of asphalt, bituminous macadam, or ordinary macadam;
       •   Rigid road pavement - made up of a series of layers stabilized with binders (or not
           stabilized), on which there is a coating of cement concrete;
       •   Mix road pavement - consists of natural aggregates layers that are stabilized
           mechanically and with hydraulic or pozzolan binders, and also includes wear and
           base bituminous layers.

                               Figure 23. Types of road structures




                                    Source: Pavement and foundation 49


429. According to European standards on asphalt mixtures (SR EN 13108), there are
seven types of mixtures:
    • Asphalt Concrete – with a strong mineral body;
    • Asphalt Concrete for very thin layers – used in wear layers of 2-3 cm;
    • Soft Asphalt – has in its composition soft bitumen and are often used in Northern
       countries;
       •   Hot Rolled Asphalt – has a discontinuous and dense mineral body, with high
           performances;
       •   Stone Mastic Asphalt – high chipping content;
       •Mastic Asphalt – is an asphalt mixture without voids;
       •Porous Asphalt – has a high volume of voids, allowing water and air to pass
        through.
In Romania, only three of these asphalt mixtures are used: Asphalt Concrete, Stone Mastic
Asphalt, and Mastic Asphalt. For the others, there are no standards implemented.

430. There are also differences in the types of cement concrete wear layers used
internationally, such as:
    • Simple cement concrete;
       •   Reinforced cement concrete;
       •   Dispersely reinforced cement concrete with synthetic and metallic fibers;
       •   Continuously reinforced cement concrete;
       •   Thin layers for the rehabilitation or reinforcement of flexible pavements;
       •   Slightly noise cement concrete wear layers ;
       •   From prefabricated elements of concrete or reinforced concrete;
       •   Prestressed concrete;
       •   Composite structures.

431. At present, the international focus is on improving mechanization in road
superstructure works and on introducing new and advanced technologies with greater
economic efficiency, in order to ensure rational use of resources. Increasing traffic
volumes, increased axle load, and increased tire pressure on the European road network
have led to the need for stronger and more durable infrastructure, while also ensuring
reduced downtime due to traffic maintenance and rehabilitation. For this, at the European
level the following trends may be observed: 51
       •   Large scale use of polymer modified bitumen and additives;
       •   Recycling both asphalt mixtures and cement concrete road. Recycling makes its
           presence felt increasingly in the construction and rehabilitation of roads, helping
           optimize the use of natural resources, the introduction into the market of
           unsuitable materials called “waste,” and contributing to the development of
           performant materials with high durability;
       •   In terms of cement concrete road, the new worldwide trend is the use of precast
           cement concrete pavements, continuous armed pavements, and cement concrete
           road rehabilitation for roads with asphalt mixtures as wearing layer;

      •   Recently, cold recycling raised high interest for construction and maintenance
          using various technologies such as foamed bitumen, bitumen emulsion or cement,
          with beneficial effects in terms of reducing emissions and energy consumption.
      •   Technologies that reduce the temperature of mixing and placing asphalt mixtures
          - the concept of low-temperature asphalt ("warm mix" or “cold mix”);
      •   The road network occupies a large area with a high potential for energy
          production. Thus, currently, new technologies for the use of this energy through
          various systems are developed – e.g., piezoelectric, sewer pipe networks that
          absorb heat during the summer, which will be returned to fight icing during
          winter.

432. The efforts toward saving natural resources must be extended to saving energy.
Handling of thousands of tons of building materials is a very energy consuming business
for road construction. Nevertheless, important savings can be made by focusing more on
the treatment of these materials on site and in plants. Hot asphalt mixes are the main
components of pavement constructions. The development of high quality low
temperature binders and mixes produces substantial savings in energy and production
costs. In this context and in view of the increasing scarcity of natural oil, the development
of so-called Bbo-binders (binder burn out) is a potential option.

433. A technical solution used internationally, particularly in urban areas, is that of
photo-catalytic paving slabs . They are made of materials designed to minimize air
pollution. Laboratory testing showed higher effectiveness in reducing the NOx
concentration in air, these slabs being increasingly used in Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy,
Japan and France.

434. Most developed countries have used in the road construction process a rigid
pavement solution, with cement concrete. This type of pavement has numerous
advantages comparing to the flexible pavement, which is currently used on most roads in
Romania. Some of these advantages are:
    • great rigidity and consequently a good distribution of the loads on the foundation
       and excellent fatigue behavior;
    • great resistance to wear and rutting and edges that do not erode;
    • not affected by oil, organic substances, chemicals;
    • bright color, skid resistance and safety in winter;
    • environmentally friendly - Asphalt (bitumen) produces lots of highly polluting
       gases at the time of melting it for paving; also, less fuel consumption by the
       vehicle running on a concrete road means less pollution;
    • concrete pavements last long too and require little maintenance, at least if they
       have been designed properly and executed professionally;
    • saving of natural resources: Asphalt (bitumen) is produced from imported
       petroleum, the reserve of which is becoming reduced drastically; on the other
       hand, concrete (cement) is produced from abundantly available limestone.


     Cement concrete roads have been used since the 19 th century and until now more than
     200.000 km were built in US, 3.000 km in Germany, and 90% of the roads in Austria
     were built using this technology. (Source: prof. Gheorghe Lucaci – Course on Rigid road

435.       Like any road pavement, cement concrete has also its disadvantages, such as:
       •   High initial costs;
       •   Need for high standard construction methods;
       •   Joints required for contraction and expansion;
       •   Generally rough riding quality;
       •   High repair costs.

436. The main limitation for the use of cement concrete pavement in Romania is the
building process . Cement concrete pavements imply new technologies, but also qualified
personnel to implement them. Unlike flexible pavements that can be easily repaired in case of
inadequate building, the cement concrete pavements have rigorous standards that must be
strictly respected. In case of flaws, the repair process is very complex and expensive.

437. In Romania, road infrastructure pavement is usually a flexible one, consisting of
various layers and granular materials provided with a layer of bituminous materials on
top. Their main advantages are:

       •   The economic aspect - less costly compared to concrete and a shorter period
           needed to build an asphalt road than a concrete road;
       •   Adaptability to stage construction;
       •   Availability of low-cost types that can be easily built;
       •   Ability to be easily opened and patched;
       •   Easy to repair frost heave and settlement;
       •   Resistance to the formation of ice glaze.


438.       The main disadvantages of flexible pavements are:
    •      Reduced durability (heavy rain and other extreme weather conditions damage the
           asphalt road, and the roads need to be repaired frequently);
       •   Weather pollution (melting asphalt produces lots of harmful greenhouse gases,
           and costly petroleum is required to produce asphalt);
       •   Higher maintenance costs;
       •   Shorter life span under heavy use;
       •   Damage by oils and other chemicals;
       •   Weak edges that may require curbs or edge devices.

439. For flexible road pavements, another advantage is the ability to recycle.
Although this technology is not frequently used in Romania, it might have very good
results from an economic point of view.

440. The main aspects that may interfere in the construction process of a flexible
road pavement are:
    • Segregation – the separation of big dimension aggregates from the smoother part
       of the mixture, due to multiple causes, such as long transport distances;

       •   Contamination with petroleum products – they are used in cleaning the machines,
           and if they get in contact with the asphalt mixture, they dissolve the bitumen;
       •   Compaction problems – due to the high speed of the compactor, among other
           causes;
       •   Working in inappropriate weather conditions;
       •   Low adherence between layers – if the priming is not appropriate, the layers tend
           to not bond to each other.

441. Some of the main aspects that may interfere in the construction process of a
rigid road pavement are:
       •   Segregation – the separation of big dimension aggregates from the smoother part
           of the mixture, due to multiple causes, such as long transport distances;
       •   The improper vibration of the concrete during construction process;
       •   The incorrect execution of joints;
       •   Inadequate leveling of the concrete surface;
       •   Working in inappropriate weather conditions.

442. In case of local roads, such as current communal or rural dirt roads, the existing
gravel can be used provided it has the appropriate features of a subbase layer, or can be
otherwise treated to become a subbase layer capable to withstand traffic and
environments loads. This requires the use of additional materials such as hydraulic
binders (both cement and hydraulic road binders), bitumen emulsions, foamed bitumen or

environmentally-friendly enzymes, all of them with the role of securing a layer capable to
withstand higher vertical loads than the current gravel layer. These new, innovative
methods can yield thinner road structures which are able to withstand similar loads as
regular road structures.

443. Utilization as much as possible of local materials in order to minimize costs of
transportation from remote areas. Thus, the initial assessment of the existing road
infrastructure is of particular importance, and the existing road structure materials should
be used based on reliable technical and economic studies. In case of roads with an existing
structure but which are either very degraded or obsolete in terms of load-carrying
capacity, the following recycling techniques may be reliably used: hot recycling in the
asphalt mixing plant, in-place hot recycling, in-place cold recycling, and full recycling of the
road structure.

444. As far as asphalt mixtures are concerned, there are 4 main aspects which bear
on the production cost: materials, production at the plant, transportation and laying. In
the case at hand, 70% of the cost of a new asphalt mixture is represented by the cost of
materials and of producing the asphalt mixture. Even though an average of 20% of the old
asphalt mixture is used nowadays, this percentage is on a significant increasing trend. If a
new asphalt mixture costs approximately 250 lei per ton, a mixture of 100% recycled
materials could cost as low as 50 lei per ton.

445. The most economical solution is to use recycled asphalt mixtures for the middle
and upper layers of flexible road structures, in which the cheaper recycled bitumen may
be combined with new bitumen and various regeneration additives, thus cutting
production costs. The use of recycled asphalt mixtures in the hot laying technology leads
to savings in excess of $300 million in the USA alone, by cutting down materials use and
removing costs. According to a study, more than 68.3 million tons of recycled asphalt
mixture were reclaimed for use in new roads in the United States in 2012, with related
savings in excess of $2.2 billion.




                                                                                                   122

446. There are more than 15 million kilometers of roads and motorways in the world,
of which a few hundred thousand require significant rehabilitation works on an annual
basis. Governments and local authorities everywhere earmark approximately USD 100
million each year in an attempt to maintain roads functional and safe. In spite of this,
many roads are damaged due to insufficient transportation budgets and to the high costs
of the traditional rehabilitation methods. For instance, approximately 90 million tons of
recycled asphalt mixture are reused each year in the United States, nearly two times more
than the combined quantity of recycled paper, glass, aluminum or plastic60 .

447. The damaged road pavement is characterized by low operating quality and by
physical degradation such as cracks, rutting and slippery road surface. As shown in the
figure below, the deterioration of the road pavement steps up after a few operating years;
however, timely rehabilitation by applying a new coat or by recycling the asphalt can
restore the quality of the road pavement and thus extend the service life of the respective
road. Studies carried out by the World Bank showed that recycling the road lining is highly
cost-effective, particularly when performed before the deterioration becomes very
advanced.

448. Asphalt mixture recycling reduces the amount of virgin aggregate and liquid
asphalt used, and mitigates the cost, logistics, and environmental impact of trucking th e
material to the place of use. It can quickly fix deteriorating pavements, including
problems in the subgrade. When recycled asphalt is used, the new road is often built
better than the first one. The final wearing course can be as minimal as macadam, or as
sturdy as a full layer of hot mix asphalt. Asphalt recycling can also be used to expand lane
widths or shoulders.

449. The hot recycling technology for bitumen road pavements may be applied in the
following variants:
         a) by cold grinding of the existing bituminous layers, followed by proper recycling
by hot mixing of the milled mixture with the additives in a mobile dryer-mixer plant;
         b) by infrared heating (radiant panels) of the existing bituminous layers, followed
by scarifying and mixing the hot asphalt mixture with additives, either directly on the base
or in a vat or mixer above the base.

450. In-place hot recycling is a method for the rehabilitation of degraded road
pavements. This operation is entirely carried out in-place, by means of a machine
assembly (recycling train) and begins by the application of heat to “soften” the road
surface. The softened asphalt material is removed by grinding devices, and subsequently
mixed with or without the addition of recycling agents. The recycled asphalt mixture is
then laid along the road and compacted to complete the recycling process. Although this
recycling method is 100% effective, certain remixing options such as the addition of new
hot asphalt mixture or new mineral aggregates may be required for the structural
correction and improvement of the geometrical features of the road.

451.    Advantages of this method:
      Old, weathered and defective surfaces are replaced by a new layer, which
         eliminates both the longitudinal and the transversal damages;
      Removal of cracks and other surface flaws;
      Reuse of existing materials;
      The recycled mixture is itself recyclable;
      Minimizes road closures – works can be carried out on one lane, while the other
         remains open to traffic;
      Preservation of the current road geometry.
The road pavement produced out of recycled asphalt mixture is usually similar, if not
better than road pavements produced out of new asphalt mixture by traditional methods.

452. The full recycling of the road structure is a cold technological process which
consists in grinding the entire road structure and mixing it with in -place additive
binders, a material which will serve as the base for the future road structure. The usual
additive binders are bitumen emulsion, foamed bitumen, power plant ash and lime.

453. The in-place cold recycling of bituminous road pavements consists of the
following main stages:
      Grinding of the old, degraded asphalt pavements;
      Crushing of the ground material down to the required granularity;
      Spraying binders on the ground material (various binders);
      Mixing of the resulting mixture;
      Laying-in of the mixture;
      Compaction;
      Paving of the laid layer with asphalt, depending on the existing conditions and on
         the sizing requirements for the new structure: 3 asphalt layers (wearing, binding
         and base layer), one or two layers of bituminous pavement, bituminous
         treatments.

454.        The advantages of cold recycling are the following:
           Environmentally-friendly process;
           Reuse of the old asphalt structure materials, with minimum addition of new
             material;
           It is considered the most economical method for road rehabilitation;
           Low cost, as aggregate purchasing and trucking to the laying place are no longer
             required;
           No NOx emissions from hot asphalt mixtures, as the recycling is cold-based.

     A specific example is the rehabilitation of Dersingham Avenue in London, where a total
     of approximately £80,000, 4 weeks of noise and traffic restrictions, and more than 9
     tons of CO2 emissions were saved. Repairing the road by conventional methods would
     have incurred nearly £320,000 in taxpayers’ money and would have lasted for 7
     weeks. Thanks to the in-place cold recycling, the street was rehabilitated in 3 weeks,
     for a total cost of approximately £240,000. Thus, the in-place cold recycling technology
     proved faster, more economical and more environmentally friendly.


455. Using this technology saves power, mitigates the aggregate transportation costs
and construction waste and preserves natural non-renewable resources such as bitumen
or new aggregates. The recycling of asphalt mixtures creates an optimum usage cycle for
the natural resources and supports the asphalt producing industry.

456.      Types of recycling-suitable materials in road construction works:
         Slags : The first experiences in using slags as an aggregate in asphalt mixtures
           dates back to 1969, when an experimental road section was built in Toronto. For
           this road section, steel furnace slag was used as an aggregate in both the base
           course layer and the wearing layer. The asphalt mixtures reviewed showed very
           good results in terms of load-carrying capacity, resistance to external factors and
           durability. 64
         Crumb rubber: Crumb rubber modified bitumen is a mixture of hot bitumen and
           ground rubber from waste or scrap tires. It is widely used in the transportation
           sector in both Europe and the United States. As far as noise is concerned, the
           Rubber Pavements Association (RPA) declared that the addition of rubber in
           asphalt mixtures cuts noise levels by up to 50%.
         Glass : Currently, up to 10% glass can be used instead of aggregates for base
           course layers in the US. The maximum glass size must be 4.75 mm for safety
           reasons, but also since coarse-grained glass surfaces will not have the required
           granularity. The best results were achieved with a glass content of at least 10% of
           the total weight and a glass size less than 6 mm.
         Plastic: UK-based studies on asphalt mixtures containing recycled plastic,
           particularly low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which replace approximately 30%
           of the 2.36 - 5 mm diameter aggregates, showed benefits such as increased
           Mashall stability and tensile strength. The most significant advantage is that the
           production process does not require any alteration of the current LDPE-asphalt
           mixture mixing plants. 65
         Crushed concrete: The American Concrete Pavement Association estimates that
           approximately 322 kilometers of cement concrete roads are recycled each year,
           and that approximately 1750 tons of crushed concrete can be recovered from 1
           km of cement concrete road with a 25 mm average thickness. This means that

           2.6 million tons of concrete are recycled each year in the United States. Concrete
           from roads, sidewalks, buildings and other sources can be crushed for reuse.
           Before crushing, the concrete should be stripped of reinforcements or other
           enclosed materials. Concrete crushing produces hard granular aggregates made
           of inert minerals, such as sand, gravel or crushed stone. Due to cement plaster
           bonding on the concrete aggregates, the aggregates resulting from the crushing
           of concrete are hard textured, have an apparent low density, and their water
           absorption exceeds that of similar sized natural aggregates.

Water and wastewater infrastructure

457. For water and wastewater systems, the durability of a plumbing system is
dependent on the quality of its component parts and the assembly skills of those who
install it. No plumbing system, however well designed, can be expected to operate safely
or hygienically if the products or materials used are unsatisfactory. The inverse is also true
– if the best-quality products or materials are used but are installed incorrectly, the
system will be a failure. 66

458. Pipes, valves, taps and other fittings used for the supply of drinking water or the
removal of wastewater must not contain harmful substances above the specified
amount that could leach into the water. Lead, cadmium, and arsenic are examples of
many possible contaminants that could be present. The pipes, valves, taps, and other
fittings must be capable of conveying water at a nominated pressure within a prescribed
environment, and must be of sufficient strength to contain anticipated internal pressures.
They must also be able to withstand external pressures if they are to be buried. The
impact of environmental factors such as heat, cold, expansion, contraction, corrosion, pH
and bacteria levels also need to be considered.

459. A range of pipe materials is available for water distribution . The old technical
solution (before 1950) of construction of distribution systems involves cast iron and
concrete pipes. Cast iron is an excellent pipe material, which is used even nowadays, but a
very expensive one. This is the reason why cast iron material was completely replaced in
1960 by concrete pipes. Pipes made of concrete were very cheap but very heavy and poor
quality regarding joints and roughness, which induce high power consumption for pumps
and high water losses. The concrete pipes were replaced in 1970 by asbestos cement
pipes, which were lighter and had a better jointing system, at a lower cost. However,
asbestos cement is dangerous to health and the roughness is still high. In the 1980s, steel
pipes were starting to be used for replacing the asbestos cement pipes. The steel material
was better than cement or asbestos cement pipes in all matters (roughness, weight,
joints), but has a very small durability because of poor protection against rust.

460. In recent years, new materials have come into use. Water transmission main
pipes above 600mm are usually made from glass reinforced plastic and smaller pipes
within distribution networks and service pipes to individual properties are made from
black high or medium density polyethylene. For difficult and aggressive soil corrugate high

density, polyethylene is used. New water networks and additions to existing water
networks are designed using computer software and a wide range of design packages are
available. Various computer software is used for hydraulic modeling of the networks that
allow constant pressure and flow irrespective of geodetic levels. Designs generally allow
for some form of ring structure within core networks to allow water to be delivered to any
property by more than one route. Designs also allow for a number of pressure zones
within town where there is variation in altitude and generally allow for sub-zones within a
large network known as District Metering Areas.

461. There are two families of materials available for water pipework systems:
metallic and non-metallic. Of these, the most commonly used materials for drinking-
water supply piping are galvanized steel or iron, copper, polybutylene, unplasticized
polyvinylchloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinylchloride (CPVC), and polyethylene (PE).
Metal alloys, which far exceed the performance specifications of their respective parent
materials, are also widely used. New materials and construction technologies are
continually developed for the building industry and the plumbing industry. Without some
form of control at the respective levels within the plumbing and building industries, it
would be easy for unscrupulous manufacturers to use inferior materials to the detriment
of installers and end-users. This can ultimately damage the environment and the health of
the community and lead to greater costs later when systems fail prematurely

462. Galvanized steel or iron was the traditional piping material in the plumbing
industry for the conveyance of water and wastewater. The term “galvanizing” once
referred to hot dipped galvanizing, in other words total immersion in molten zinc after
pretreatment cleaning. This technology afforded a reasonable level of internal and
external protection to the metal pipe. More recently, the use of electroplating
technologies has provided a more attractive external finish, but little or no internal
protection. Although still included in many codes of practice throughout the world, the
popularity of galvanized piping is declining.

463. Copper tubing is extremely flexible in the hands of a competent installer and
smaller in overall diameter than the equivalent galvanized steel pipes and fittings.
Corrosion can be a problem, though usually to a lesser degree than with galvanized steel;
care must be exercised to avoid contact with dissimilar metals. Copper tubing, due to its
thinner wall section, is relatively light to handle and is available in coil form or straight
lengths as required.

464. Chlorinated polyvinylchloride is widely used in water and sanitary systems for
hot and cold-water distribution. It is a thermoplastic produced by polymerization of vinyl
chloride, with additional chlorination. It offers much better resistance to corrosion and
has a high tolerance to acids. It is fire resistant, though toxic fumes are emitted when it is
burned.

465. Unplasticized polyvinylchloride PVC, when used with a solvent cement jointing
system, is comparable in bulk to galvanized steel or iron for drinking -water piping, but
much lighter. It does not suffer the same corrosion problems internally or externally as
galvanized steel. However, it is susceptible to physical damage if exposed above ground




                                                                                                 129
and it becomes brittle when exposed to ultraviolet light. The pipe is light to handle, but it
is too bulky for aesthetically acceptable internal use in domestic buildings.

466. Polyethylene (PE) pipes and fittings of numerous types and designs have been
available for over forty years. The market requirements today have been refined to three
general groupings, as follows:
    •   High-density PE is available in a post-manufactured stress-relieved state (best
        practice PE), or as extruded product with no treatment; it is used mainly for
        drainage applications where it can withstand higher temperature discharges than
        PVC;
    •   Medium-density PE is more flexible than the high-density pipe. It has a slightly
        thinner wall thickness and is capable of withstanding higher internal pressure; it is
        the preferred material for long-distance drinking-water piping;
    •   Low-density PE is suitable for the irrigation industry, where operating pressures
        are very low and a high degree of flexibility and low cost is required; low-density
        PE pipe and fittings are not acceptable for use for connection to the water mains
        in many countries because of the low pressure rating of the material and its high
        leakage rate.

467. Fiberglass pipe also referred to as Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP), Glass
Reinforced Plastic (GRP), and Reinforced Thermosetting Resin Pipe (RTRP), is one of the
latest trends regarding water and wastewater systems materials. FRP Pipe resistance to
corrosive chemical environments and cost effectiveness has proven its ability to replace
carbon steel and stainless steel pipe at a lower overall cost. Their main qualities are Light
weight, Strength to weight ratio, Dimensional Stability, Electrical properties - Standard
fiberglass pipe is nonconductive.

468. Glass reinforced resin pipe is one of the strongest piping material by weight in
use today. Most of these piping products are made by using filament winding or
centrifugal casting techniques. Varying conditions of service has resulted in the use of
three major FRP piping resins: epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester. Like most plastic piping
systems, FRP is durable, safe and easy to install. In addition, it is very cost competitive
when compared to many metal-alloy piping systems. Most FRP piping has both internal
and external chemical resistant barriers.

Social infrastructure

469. For social infrastructure, there are many building materials typically considered
‘green’. These include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest
standard, rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw, dimension stone,
recycled stone, recycled metal, and other products that are non-toxic, reusable,
renewable, and/or recyclable. For concrete a high performance or Roman self-healing
concrete is available. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also suggests using
recycled industrial goods, such as coal combustion products, foundry sand, and demolition
debris in construction projects.




                                                                                                130
470.    Existing buildings are subject to structural assessment before deciding whether
they should be demolished or rehabilitated. The seismic risk category depends primarily
on the construction timeframe, as described in the Figure 36.

471. The structural rehabilitation solution will be established based on the state of
degradation of the building (seismic risk category), the structural system (frames, walls,
mixed), the building materials used (reinforced concrete, steel, masonry, wood, etc.)
and the Importance-exposure class. Some of these methods are described below.

472. The reinforced plaster shotcreting and reinforced concrete lining methods are
suitable for brick and reinforced concrete buildings. They consist in the total or partial
jacketing of the structural elements (pillars, girders, reinforced concrete or brickwork
walls) with a layer of concrete reinforced with steel bars. This method increases the load-
bearing capacity of the structural elements and improves the overall quality of the
building.

473. The carbon fiber or glass fiber lining is similar to the above, the difference being
that carbon fiber or glass fiber is used instead of reinforced concrete as lining material.

474. The use of reinforced walls or steel bracing consists in the insertion of structural
strengthening elements. This method is suitable for reinforced concrete or steel frame
buildings. Thus, the hollow frames may be fitted with reinforced concrete walls or steel
bracing. This increases the overall stiffness and stability of the building.

475. The fitting of exterior reinforced concrete or steel frames has the advantage of
being carried out mainly on the outside of the building, thus avoiding any disruption of
the normal activities indoors. The works consist in building an outside frame connected
to the supporting structure of the building. It improves the overall stiffness and stability of
the building.




                                                                                                                132

476. In this case, buildings are earthquake-protected by the fitting of elastic
neoprene dampers between the building foundation and the superstructure. Thus, the
building is isolated from its substructure and the effects of potential seismic action on the
building are mitigated. This method is suitable for all structural systems. It is particularly
suited to highly important buildings which are critical in post-earthquake situations, such
as hospitals, emergency centers, buildings that house sensitive equipment such as nuclear
power plants, IT or telecommunication centers. Furthermore, it represents an ideal
solution for heritage buildings, which cannot be subject to works that would alter their
architectural features.

6.4    Construction process and safety

477. According to the regulations in place, every construction company of any size
should appoint a properly qualified person (or several) whose special and main
responsibility is the promotion of safety and health. Before commencing the actual
works on the site, a series of elements should be analyzed: order of the works, focusing on
the analysis of dangerous/hazardous operations and processes workers’ travel routes
designed to protect against exposure to hazards, vehicle access routes, one-way - to the
extent possible, material and equipment storage procedures, as well as on artificial
lighting and procedures on the location of the construction equipment. Special care




                                                                                                      133
should be given to the insulation of power supply lines, personnel handrails, fuel and
explosive material storage and protection of pedestrian access routes bordering the works
site. Fire safety on site mainly includes fire-fighting procedures learned by the workers,
arrangement of Fire safety units provided with fire extinguishers, sand, shovels as per the
drawings provided in the basic engineering design, learned by the Occupational Health
and Safety Department.

478. Companies that perform construction work need to ensure the level of quality
corresponding to essential requirements through their own staff, through Certified
Technical Execution Responsible (RTE), and through their own quality control system.
Since the beginning of the execution process itself, after signing the report of acceptance
of the site and issuing the building permit, an entire process related to time-money-
quality is activated. In terms of unwanted real situations, there are delays in execution,
payment delays, and lack of quality for works that could compromise the finalization of
the construction.

479. During the execution process, many accidents can happen. A high rate of
accidents is caused by: the high percentage of firms and laborers working on their own,
the variety and relatively short lifetime of construction sites, high rotation of
workers/laborers, the large number of seasonal workers (many of them not familiar with
construction processes) and also the influence of climatic conditions.

480. During project implementation, various changes, errors, provisions, etc. by the
Constructor may occur. These must be registered and archived in a public and transparent
system for all parties involved, in order to count/measure precisely the response times. It
is also recommended archiving of photos that are registering works progress (dated),
laboratory tests, site provisions, reports related to critical stages of construction and
weekly and monthly reports, etc.

481. Owners may ask for compensation for damage of their homes caused by traffic
during the works’ execution or operation period. Claims for compensation may or may
not be justified, but if there is no basis of comparison between the situations before-after
implementation/operation of the road, there is virtually no evidence of this. It is
recommended to prepare reports and appraisals on the state of housing located near the
road, clearly showing its condition at the start of construction works (Beneficiary via a
licensed expert).

482. While excavation for foundations’ execution is done, unforeseen situations
occur. Some examples consist of buried foundations or ruins of other construction;
pipelines (fuel / water / steam / electricity) that cannot be dismantled (and must be
removed) or can be still functional (and must be relocated); wires or other utilities routes
not specified in the approvals asked by Urbanism Certificate; accidental hydrocarbons
infiltrations; buried garbage accumulations; archaeological sites; and soil layers with
geotechnical characteristics lower than expected in geotechnical studies. Such situations
require further studies, different technical solutions than adopted in the initial Technical
Design, or even changing the Technical Design and Execution Details. This is a critical time
when compromise should be found between the new technical solution recommended by




                                                                                               134
the Designer, the new cost borne by the Investor/Beneficiary, and the extra time required
to incorporate amendments to be managed by the Constructor. Usually, according to GD
28/2008, an increase in the value of the works up to 10% may be considered acceptable in
the project budget, in accordance with the General Breakdown, chapter 5.3 – “diverse and
unforeseen expenditures.” Nevertheless, the suspension of the investment can also occur
due to the large number of tracks to be relocated, technical complications (pipeline
design, flows, bends, etc.), and/or the associated legal problems in relation with the land
to be used.

483. For excavation works/earthworks in cohesive soil, the Constructor prefers to
reduce / waive construction works for supporting the banks / slopes / embankment to
save labor force / materials. In such circumstances, workers perform construction works
without any protection, with high risk of loss of human lives, destruction of equipment or
deterioration of the foundation soil.

484. The Beneficiary should provide unoccupied land, free of charge to the
constructor. The following activities must be achieved before starting the construction
process:
    • detection of pipes;
    • project for relocation of pipelines;
    • relocation of pipes (relocation may require additional expropriations).

485. In Romania, delays do not result in penalties for the actors involved in the
project, and are generally incurred by the Beneficiary/Investor. Delays, depending on
their magnitude, have a different impact on the works execution.

                             Table 7. Impact of execution delays

486. There are cases when, during the project’s implementation, or after finalization
of the construction, works are found to not meet the quality standards of the project
because of the unprincipled collaboration between the Constructor and the Laboratory.




                                                                                              135
Constant monitoring of laboratory tests and sampling is required, which a site inspector
performs. The Laboratory communicates the test results to the site inspector, upon
request. The Constructor receives written notification from the Beneficiary (upon
notification from the Site Inspector) if the results are not compliant with the technical
specifications. If the Constructor disputes the results, supplementary tests are performed
in order to determine the causes of errors (non-compliant materials used by the
Constructor from the suppliers, works that were carried out in non-compliant
circumstances, etc.)

487. In case of unilateral termination of the contract between the Beneficiary and the
Constructor, the trial in court implies technical and economic evaluation by independent
judicial technical experts of the Court and technical experts of the parties. The number
of the terms and the complexity of contestation/appeal procedures are leading to
settlements in Court that can last a minimum of 12 months. Further procedures for
implementing final decisions taken in Court may take another 12 months. Consequently, a
legal process with a duration of more than 4-6 months will impede construction
completion, regardless of the verdict.

6.5   Personnel and Equipment

488. In order to have sustainable roads infrastructure, water and wastewater
systems and social infrastructure, it is not enough to use the best materials on the
market, but trained personnel and adequate equipment are also needed. To keep up
with the latest best practices, there is a need of continuous professional development for
engineers and for the technical staff of construction enterprises.

489. Lack of works’ quality is due to unskilled staff (low salary employees), p oor
quality, inadequate or degraded materials, and poor or inadequate technology due to
lack of modern equipment. These situations are in fact consequences of the process for
selecting the Constructor, conducted based on the 'lowest bid' criterion. This has led to
awarding the contracts to companies without sufficient experience or without an
adequate quality control system, in conjunction with the lack of quick and effective ways
of imposing penalties when needed.

490. A vital issue is related to the outdated equipment used on construction sites.
Usually they do not have any preliminary technical check-ups and can become dangerous
for the operator and for the workers nearby.

491. Delays from materials and equipment suppliers may also appear. Due to market
competition, these delays are relatively small-scale (hours or a maximum of a few days) in
the case of imports. A flexible management of the Constructor may improve things and
make such situations imperceptible to the total length of the project. An experienced
Constructor, who owns a fleet of equipment, signs service contracts with rental clauses
during potential interruption of operation, and is able to reduce delays to a few hours.




                                                                                             136
6.6   Verification and Control

492. The construction technical book consists of the set of documents related to the
design, execution, acceptance, operation, maintenance, repair, and follow up on the
behavior of the construction. The construction book is completed before the final
acceptance and is kept, for each construction object, by the Beneficiary/Investor. The
construction book is prepared by the Beneficiary/Investor for all final construction objects
subject to building permit, regardless of the nature of the funds that finance such
constructions or related ownership.

493. When building or modernizing an infrastructure work, it is very important to
follow the technical recommendations for temperatures and other specifications.
Authorized laboratories test the quality of the work through samples taken from the field,
according to the norms in force. It is very important to take the samples correctly and
verify if the conditions from the technical specifications are respected.

494. For the payment of works, the Constructor drafts monthly and final payment
situations/statements based on the unit prices of the contracted bill of quantities. The
accuracy/correctness of the amounts claimed by the Constructor is checked from different
viewpoints (supporting documents, quantities, justification for any supplementary works,
payment terms, etc.). The site inspector verifies once a month and confirms the quantities
executed and registered in the measurement books, and also verifies the payment
situations/statements for the quantities confirmed in the measurement books and the
firm unit prices stipulated in the contracted bill of quantities. For the work amounts that
are in addition or less than the contracted bill of quantities, supplementary works bills
(NCS – notă de cantităţi suplimentare ) or withdrawal bills (NR – notă de renunţare ) are
drafted and confirmed by the designer, using the unit prices of the contracted bill of
quantities. Common issues include lack of supporting documents for the prices attached
to bill of quantities, reports, measurements certified by topographic engineers and the
Site Inspector. It is therefore necessary for the Beneficiary to accept in the supervision
team specialized personnel for:
    • measurement of quantities of works;
    • verifying the supporting documents for payment certificates/statements/payment
         requests;
    • verifying of payment terms provided in contract clauses for the Constructor;
    • checking the justifications made by Constructor for additional works or additional
         quantities to existing items in the bills of quantities;
    • verification of detailing costs.

495. During execution, between the issuance of the Building Permit and the
completion of works (Final acceptance), the construction is a continuous (12-36 months)
improvement process. During the execution of the construction at natural scale the
Beneficiary may propose new ideas or solutions. Given the desired character of these
changes, the financial aspects are solved in advance, but integration of changes in the
execution process leads to delays and thus to calendar changes. In general, such situations
are speculated by the Constructor to “encapsulate” in the new execution graphic the
subjective delays due to own inefficiencies in execution.




                                                                                               137
496. Sometimes additional works not covered by the contractual bills of quantities
are found to be necessary during the execution period. These works are registered in the
work site provisions signed by the Beneficiary and they have firm contracted unit prices,
bills of quantities with additional quantities and contracted firm unit prices, as accepted
by the Beneficiary. The payment statements for the additional bills of quantities are
prepared separately from the payment statements for the contracted bills of quantities
provided under the offer. For any additional works that have no correspondence in the
unit prices of the contracted bills of quantities provided under the offer, the
Beneficiary/Investor can accept, based on supporting documents submitted by the
contracting party (invoices, rates, etc. from at least 3 providers), new unit prices valid in
the month when works are executed. The offsetting of values is achieved based on the
supplementary works bills and withdrawal bills, and any excess is limited to the maximum
value as provided under General Breakdown, chapter 5.3 – “diverse and unforeseen
expenditures.” Exceeding of this limit as well as introduction of new items is subject to
contract renegotiation, according to public procurement legislation.

497. Delays/suspensions in the payment of executed works (from the Beneficiary to
the Constructor) may appear during the process. The bureaucracy of the financing body
(bank, national budget, external funding) leads to delays in the release of funding
tranches, despite the achievement of formalities and procedures by the Beneficiary and of
physical stages of execution by the Constructor. At the same time the interruption of
releasing funding tranches by the funding body (the bank, national budget, external
financing) due to non-fulfillment of formalities and procedures by the Beneficiary and/or
physical stages of execution by the Constructor is a frequent cause of delays. In case of
financing from own resources, the capital flow for execution may endure reductions/
interruptions. Investment activities such as execution of a new construction (road, water
supply system, or building for social infrastructure) are the first to be suspended in case of
a liquidity or economic crisis. If the general quality of works (not quantified in measurable
indicators from the beginning) does not meet the quality standards of the Beneficiary, this
may also lead to suspension of payment until the works disputed are corrected/remedied
at the Constructor’s own expense.

498. Reception/Acceptance of works is a component of the quality sys tem in
constructions and represents the document whereby the Beneficiary/Investor declares
that it accepts, takes over the work “with or without reservations,” and that such work
can be exploited/ operated. By the acceptance document, it is certified that the
Constructor has fulfilled its duties under the contract and the execution documentation.
The work reception/acceptance happens in two stages: (1.) Acceptance at the completion
of works by the Beneficiary, within a maximum of 15 calendar days from the notification
of works completion; and (2.) Final acceptance by the Beneficiary within a maximum of 15
days after the warranty period’s expiry date (period provided in the works execution
contract).

499. Reception of the works shall be performed only for the con structions that
comply with the essential quality requirements and for which the documentation
necessary for the construction technical book has been submitted to the




                                                                                                 138
Beneficiary/investor. Art. 30 of Law 10 stipulates that all the parties/actors involved in
the design and execution are liable, as per the undertaken obligations, for the hidden
defects67 of the construction occurring in a period of 10 years from the work acceptance
date, as well as after this date, during the entire life of the construction, for any structural
defects resulting from non-respecting the design and execution rules in force at the date
of construction.

500. Following reception of the site by the Constructor, problems caused by
execution errors and delays may appear. Supplementary costs corresponding to
execution errors must cover re-construction/rehabilitation works at required quality and
are supported by the Constructor. Delays in execution are penalized according to the
contract. In case of water supply and wastewater investments, technological tests must be
performed in order to certify the quality of works. Consumption and operation costs
should be checked in order to fit/match with those guaranteed by the Constructor in his
offer. If this is not the case two situations may appear:
    • In case the input parameters in the plant (typically flow and biological loading) are
          in accordance with the Beneficiary’s declared amounts in the technical
          specifications upon which the Constructor has prepared the offer, the Constructor
          will be penalized according to the contract (usually pay the difference in operating
          costs for certain number of years).
    • In case the input parameters in the plant (typically flow and biological loading) are
          not in accordance with the Beneficiary’s declared amounts in the technical
          specifications upon which the Constructor has prepared the offer, a technical
          expertise will be performed in order to set the percentage of the additional
          operational costs that will be paid by the Constructor and the percentage of the
          additional operational costs that will be paid by the Beneficiary. The percentages
          can vary from 0% to 100% depending on the variation of input parameter values
          related to the values declared by the Beneficiary in the technical specification.


6.7    Conclusions

501. To reduce divergences between designers, beneficiaries, and construction
companies in the implementation stage for PNDL projects, it is recommended to use
“design and build” contracts, when possible. This requires preparation of complete and
sufficiently detailed feasibility studies that form the basis for public tenders for the award
of “design and build” contracts. The winning bidder assumes responsibility for technical
design development and implementation, therefore any discrepancies that may occur
during the implementation stage must be remedied without additional costs for the
beneficiaries, unless certain construction works are unpredictable, which makes them
eligible.

502. Design-build project delivery is a viable, acceptable, and attractive method for
use. It is especially applicable when:


67According to art. 1707 of the Civil Code – a defect is hidden if, on the contract date, such defect cannot
be found by a prudent and diligent buyer/beneficiary without specialized assistance




                                                                                                       139
    •   time is critical for project completion;
    •   there is a limited or designated budget;
    •   increased cost control and innovation are desired;
    •   constructability and savings are important considerations.

503. A clearer provision on the designe r’s responsibility is needed to supply a high
quality product: this provision would include penalties applicable in the event of clear
errors that can be attributable to the design team. One requirement could consist in the
obligation of the designers to have professional indemnity insurance, which some of the
beneficiaries have already started to require in their contract forms. There are companies
that offer these types of professional indemnity insurances. In the long term, the
insurance schemes are extremely useful to reward skilled service supplier and penalize
those suppliers that provide inappropriate technical documentation.

504. A schedule of activities and results, including payment terms, is a good option
for a better development of the works. Some beneficiaries already apply a tranches-
payment system, ensuring that the designer receives the final payment only after
successful completion of the project. This ensures a close contact between designers and
beneficiaries throughout the entire implementation stage, as well as collaboration
between designers, engineers and construction teams, to identify the optimum solutions.

505. Clear requirements are needed to ensure that all the intellectual property rights
for technical documentation stay with the beneficiary. In some cases, when this
provision was not explicitly included in the contract, the designers have refused to allow
modifications to the projects, invoking property rights to the supplied contents, despite
having been remunerated for a particular result.

506. A general solution for issues related to the construction quality is a technical
audit performed during or upon finalization of the construction works. If the audit is
carried out by financial auditors certified by the Chamber of Financial Auditors, the
technical audit may be performed by engineers certified by MRDPA and State Inspectorate
of Construction as Certified Technical Execution Responsible (RTE) and Site Inspectors,
other than those involved in the investment implementation. Technical audit will include:
    • Assessment of the existing situation of infrastructure projects;
    • Assessment of the procurement processes applied for services and works in order
        to ensure economy, efficiency, transparency and also to identify the areas
        requiring improvement;
    • Assessment of appropriateness of technical options and design proposed (verifies
        if the project is cost effective);
    • Checking whether different structures are constructed as per design, drawings,
        and specification and assessment of the construction quality;
    • Assessment of record keeping of different construction materials labors used and
        expenditure incurred.

507. From a technical standpoint, strict rules should be established in certain areas:
risk assessments, trainings, planning, procedures, and agreements. Workers need to be




                                                                                             140
reminded the rules and to be corrected and urged to apply what they have learned.
Working at height, lifting operations, excavation and digging or electrical works are
activities that involve high risk and require strict rules in terms of health and safety at the
workplace. Innovations may consist of daily training of workers, carried out by specialized
staff, in relation with possible specific risks they may face on construction site during the
day. A very useful international initiative is to organize the so-called “Safety Days” or
“Safety Weeks”, during which personnel is involved in simulations and role-plays on
construction site. This kind of training is designed to instruct the workers for various
dangerous situations, at the same time offering them the necessary tools and expertise to
help colleagues in need.

508. Existing legislation in quality construction does not benefit from practical, high
accuracy procedures for technologies’ verification, works quality, and materials’ quality .
In this respect, a mobile laboratory of the State Inspectorate in Constructions is needed. It
is very important to take the samples correctly and verify if the conditions from the
technical specifications are respected.

509. Finalization of any publicly funded infrastructure project implies financial
auditing. Technical auditing is completed by the Reception at the completion of the works
and the Final Reception (at the end of the warranty period) without being based on clear
procedures and/or Technical Audit Manual.

510. The warranty period is mentioned in the bidding technical specifications (case in
which it can bring a higher score to the constructor) and in contracts , usually for a
minimum of two years for most of the construction works. This period should be
regulated and established in national regulations, by taking into consideration the road
technical class, traffic loads, type of road structure, type of water distribution system,
characteristics of wastewater plant, and other factors. By adopting such a measure, the
constructor will have a higher responsibility in building correctly and according to the
standards in force.




                                                                                                  141
7     Well-maintained Infrastructure


7.1       General framework

511. A reliable infrastructure is primarily an available infrastructure. It implies that
external factors such as weather conditions and ad-hoc external shocks to the
infrastructure systems as well as internal factors such as maintenance have little impact
on its performance.

512. Construction behavior monitoring over time is performed in order to meet the
essential requirements of Law no. 10/1995 on quality in constructions :
    • strength and stability,
      •    safety in operation,
      •    fire safety,
      •    hygiene, human health, environmental rehabilitation and protection,
      •    thermal and waterproof insulation and energy saving,
      •    protection against noise,
      •    durability requirements, and
    • operating capacity requirements.
Behavior monitoring during operation for the entire period between the Acceptance upon
completion of works and the Final acceptance is the responsibility of the Contractor or of
the Beneficiary, depending on the contractual terms agreed upon, under the Construction
Contract; after the Final acceptance, it is the responsibility of the Beneficiary.

513. Construction behavior monitoring during operation is established by several
laws and Government Decisions, such as: Government Decision (GD) no. 273/1994 –
Rules for the acceptance of construction works and related installations; Law no. 10/1995
on quality in constructions, as subsequently amended, Rules for drafting the Building Log
Book, GD no. 766/1997 – Regulation on behavior monitoring during operation,
interventions over time and the post-decommissioning of the construction, Standard on
construction behavior over time, index P 130-1999, approved by Order of the Minister of
Public Works and Spatial Planning no. 57 / N / 1999, published in the Construction Bulletin
no. 1/2001, Order no. 847 of 2 June 2014 for the approval of the Procedure on the control
activities carried out for the implementation of the legal provisions on the routine and
special monitoring of the buildings’ behavior during operation - index PCU 004 and of the
specific guides by categories of constructions: roads, bridges, tunnels, water and
sanitation supply, social infrastructure buildings etc.

514. Behavior monitoring during operation, interventions over time and the post -
decommissioning of constructions apply to all construction categories . The exception
from this rule is for residential buildings with ground floor / ground floor plus one story
and for annexes located in the countryside, as well as to temporary buildings. This




                                                                                              142
monitoring is mandatory for all natural and legal persons involved: investors, designers,
executants, owners, managers, users. Construction behavior monitoring during operation,
interventions over time and the post-decommissioning are separate and complementary
actions and their performance should be arranged for by the owner, including at the
request of the manager and of the user. Construction behavior monitoring is carried out
during the life period of the buildings, starting with their execution. It is a systematic
activity of observation, examination and investigation of how buildings respond / react
during their use, under the influence of environmental agents, of operating conditions and
of the interactions of the buildings with the users’ environment and activities. The
purpose of monitoring buildings over time is to obtain the necessary information in order
to ensure their regular operating capacity, to assess the conditions for preventing
accidents and damage and for reducing damages, loss of lives and environmental
degradation, and to hold the necessary information for improving the construction
activity.

515. Construction behavior monitoring can be performed in a continuous or
discontinuous manner. Continuous monitoring involves using observers or installing
devices that keep the construction under surveillance continuously, or record the results
of the measurements made continuously. In terms of practical effectiveness, such
monitoring can be oriented towards triggering an alarm in case of exceeding the critical
values of the measured parameters and causing potentially risky situations. Discontinuous
monitoring involves regular checks or inspections, thus routine observations and
measurements, possibly also including tests or trials by load testing. The pace of the
execution, the seasons, the succession of day and night or the occurrence of disasters may
impose the intervals at which the inspections or checks are performed.

516. Construction behavior monitoring can be performed by routine or special
monitoring. The category of construction behavior monitoring, the time intervals at which
it is performed, and the methodology for carrying out such activities should be
determined by the works’ designer or by a technical expert, depending on the
construction importance category; these data should be recorded in the event log that is
kept under Chapter D of the Building Log Book.

517. Routine monitoring is the activity of construction behavior monitoring,
consisting of observing and recording issues, phenomena or parameters that can
indicate changes in the capacity of the construction in order to meet the strength,
stability and durability requirements established in the projects. During such routine
monitoring, if there is an occurrence of degradation that is considered to affect the
strength, stability and durability of the construction, the owner, and manager or, if
applicable, the user must order a thorough inspection of the construction, followed - if
necessary - by a technical examination.

518. Routine monitoring is performed by direct visual inspection and, if necessary,
with common, permanent, or temporary measuring tools, in accordance with the
provisions of the Building Log Book and the techn ical regulations for behavior
monitoring during operation. In the event of observing degradations, intervention




                                                                                             143
measures should be established. The owners, managers and, where appropriate, the users
should arrange for organizing the routine monitoring of construction behavior, which can
be performed by using their own staff and means or a specialized company may be
contracted for this activity. The routine construction behavior monitoring should be
carried out according to the routine monitoring instructions contained in the conceptual
designs. For old buildings that do not have such instructions, a specialized design company
should be contacted for drafting them. Routine monitoring should be performed at time
intervals stipulated in the routine monitoring instructions, but no less than once a year
and automatically after the occurrence of special events.

519. After an earthquake with a magnitude of over 6.0 on the Richter scale, an
accidental impact resulting in damage to the finish of certain resistance element s, or
after an explosion, investigations should be carried out, consisting of visual inspections
(expanded inspections), measurement of subsidence, deformation, opening of cracks,
etc. Since in the aftermath of a major event, a state of significant degradation is likely to
occur in the structure, at the request of the Beneficiary, a site visit should be conducted
by specialized staff (civil engineer) who - after the inspection – should ascertain if a
specialized examination of the construction is required according to the law in force.

520. Special monitoring consists in measuring, recording, processing and
systematically interpreting the values of the parameters that define the extent to which
buildings maintain their requirements concerning strength, stability and durability
established in the projects. Special monitoring of building behavior should be carried out
in case of:
    •   new constructions of special or exceptional importance established in the project;
    •   constructions during operation, evolving dangerously - as assessed by the
        conclusions of a technical examination or an extended inspection;
    • the request of the owner, of the State Inspectorate for Constructions, of the
        Ministry of Regional Development and Public Administration, or of the
        acknowledged bodies in the construction field.
The special monitoring of construction behavior is carried out by complex and specialized
means of observation and measurement, tailored to each case, in accordance with the
provisions of the current technical regulations or the technical examination that has
stipulated this form of monitoring.

521. The establishment of special monitoring should be notified to the State
Inspectorate for Constructions (ISC) by the investor, the owner, or the user. The
objectives of the special monitoring of construction behavior are:
    •   ensuring construction safety and durability through timely detection of dangerous
        phenomena and the areas they occur in;
    •   supervising the evolution of certain phenomena, with possible negative effects on
        the operating capacity of the building;
    •   the operational reporting of exceeding the warning thresholds or the limit values
        of the measuring and control devices;
    •   checking the effectiveness of the applied intervention measures;




                                                                                                144
    •   checking the environmental impact of the construction;
    •   ensuring a large volume of data necessary for establishing the appropriate values
        for normal operating conditions throughout the lifetime of the building, for
        changes in the execution project if the reality on the ground is different from the
        calculation hypotheses, for the verification - under real conditions – of new
        materials and for the experimental verification of new methods of calculation.

522. Special monitoring is performed with sophisticated technical means by the
competent natural or legal persons with the aim of keeping under observation certain
dangerous latent interaction phenomena during the operation phase of the
constructions under supervision and in order to justify special intervention measures,
such as consolidation. While routine monitoring is stipulated in the instructions drawn up
by the designer at the same time as the project and the operation and maintenance
instructions, serving the owner directly, special monitoring is performed based on a
special monitoring project, serving the owner only at the competent person’s
recommendations, following the latter’s evaluation of the data resulting from this activity.

523. All findings and proposed measures for the routine / special monitoring of
constructions should be recorded in the Building Log Book, which is the basic
documentation for the on-site construction behavior monitoring. The person responsible
for its storage and filling out is accountable to the Beneficiary. The Building Log Book
includes the updated conceptual design, the execution control documents, the acceptance
protocols, the documents related to the building operation, the data summary and the
event logbook.

524. The Regional Inspectorate for Constructions (RIC) and the County Inspectorate
for Constructions (CIC) have an obligation to urgently inform the manager of the SIC
about the technical accidents having taken place during building construction or
operation. The Committees verifying the causes and conditions under which technical
accidents happen during the operation of buildings should draw up inspection reports,
recording the findings that will likely highlight the status quo on the date of the
verification, the causes that can generate technical accidents, the contributing factors on
the date of the technical accident, the measures ordered for immediately bringing to
safety the persons and goods housed in the buildings and in their immediate vicinity, with
deadlines and persons responsible for carrying out these measures. When evaluating the
technical status, the local public authority (and, where appropriate, with the support the
certification authority) should ensure that a technical expert certified in this field for the
essential requirement - mechanical resistance and stability will also be present for the
assessment and establishment of the intervention decision.

525. In the case of educational/cultural units located in protected areas and classified
as architectural monuments or having architectural value, any interventions on the
exterior of the buildings (fencing, pavements, gardens, etc.) will be performed as
restoration activities. They need to be approved first with a letter containing all the initial
details concerning shape, material, color, etc., and seek the endorsement of the National
Commission for Historical Monuments.




                                                                                                  145
526. The documents relating to constructions of any kind should be drafted,
recomposed, filled out, and kept according to the legal provisions concerning the
“Building Log Book.” Only the designers should draft the basic documentation of the
works and the general data necessary for the operation, and they should submit it to the
Owner of the investment. The designers are under an obligation to make corrections to all
execution plans, on all copies on which changes were made during the execution, and at
the end, they are under an obligation to replace these plans with new, original and
updated ones according to the real situation on the ground. The builders are under the
obligation to hand over the designs, site plans, and execution plans changed in accordance
with the real situation on the ground. In case no changes were made to the original plans,
one copy of the plans should be submitted, with a written confirmation that no changes
were made during the execution.

527. The aim of the interventions performed in constructions over time is to maintain
the building stock at the required level of compliance with the requirements and to
ensure the functions of the buildings, including by expanding or modifying their initial
functions because of upgrading. Intervention works are:
    •   maintenance works caused by normal wear or degradation and aimed at
        maintaining the technical condition of the constructions;
    •   restoration works, caused by the occurrence of significant degradation and aimed
        at maintaining or improving the technical condition of the constructions;
    •   upgrading works, including extensions, determined by a change in the
        requirements for constructions or their functions and that can be achieved by
        maintaining or improving the technical condition of the constructions.

528. Maintenance works are caused by normal wear or degradation and are aimed at
maintaining the technical condition of the buildings. Maintenance works consist in
carrying out periodic remediation or repairs of the visible parts of the building elements –
finishes, wear layers, and protective layers and coverings – or of installations and
equipment, including the replacement of worn parts.

529. In the case of roads, routine maintenance work during the summer is a set of
actions regulating the performance of interventions aimed at maintaining, repairing and
ensuring traffic safety. The works and services for the routine maintenance of roads,
tunnels, and bridges during the summer consist of all the intervention activities performed
annually between April 1 and October 31, caused by wear or degradation under normal
operating conditions, aiming at ensuring the technical conditions necessary for safe road
traffic, in compliance with the regulations in force. For the national roads, a costs standard
was approved for the routine maintenance of public roads of national interest during the
summer.

530. For county roads, County Councils may conclude framework agreements for
maintenance works during the summer and for snow removal services for several years
(3 or 4 years). Tulcea County Council and Cluj County Council are examples of good
practice in this regard.




                                                                                                 146
531. There are two distinct issues in the evaluation of any existing pavement
structure: functional condition and structural condition. The first is important for routine
and periodic maintenance, i.e. with no structural improvement. The second is decisive in
rehabilitation cases, i.e. when only structural improvements are made, and renovation
cases, which comprise rehabilitation combined with road geometry improvements. Road
safety should normally be part of all kinds of interventions.

532. Both functional and structural conditions of the existing pavements are mostly
relevant to county roads. The functional condition of a road is preserved by routine and
periodic maintenance. The routine maintenance ensures the safety of daily traffic and all-
weather utilization of roads, especially in winter periods. Structural conditions are related
to the main characteristics of road surface, such as roughness, impermeability and
evenness, and to the defects that may appear on road surface, such as rutting, potholes,
unevenness. All these parameters are easily measured using advanced specialized
equipment.

533. Evaluation of structural condition of the existing roads seeks to obtain the
existing structural (bearing) capacity on which to focus the recommended rehabilitation
or reconstruction actions. Integrated advanced measuring equipment can provide a full
needed range of data and information. These data can include a detailed network
representation with location information (useful for updated road data register), several
parameters describing road link geometric configuration, and road structural condition.
Measuring equipment, augmented with various enhancements, can also be used to
develop a program of recommendations for cost-effective road improvements. The
collected data enable targeted design of interventions, which depends on road condition
and anticipated road design life. Savings in road works from such targeted design
procedures can be substantial and reach up to 40% compared to the currently used
methods. Implementation of such system requires specialized knowledge and training in
the use of the equipment.

534. County roads require maintenance works during operation. In many cases, the
necessary works far exceed the budget assigned. In most cases, the necessary works
exceed the annual amount allocated by the County Councils. For example, in 2015, in Sibiu
County, for the entire network of county roads (906,794 km), a routine maintenance cost
of about 3,277.72 EUR / km is estimated, almost half of what was estimated in the “Study
on roads financing, classification and management ”, elaborated for the Rural
Development Project in Romania in 2005 (7,716 EUR/km). 68 The same is true for Bistrița
Năsăud, with a 754km network of county roads and a maintenance cost of 2,210 EUR/km;
Constanta with 889 km of county roads and a maintenance cost per unit of 446 EUR/km;
Dolj – 1,096 km of county roads and a cost of 2,433 EUR/km, and Ialomiţa with 507 km of
county roads and 1,797 EUR/km.



68The study estimated the maintenance cost based on the data collected in 100 Communes and 5
counties during the sites visits

536. Repair works are caused by the occurrence of significant degradation and are
aimed at maintaining or improving the technical condition of the constructions. The
solutions should be established only after knowing the technical condition of the
buildings, including the causes of the degradation, if any, because of the technical
expertise. In some cases where the buildings are badly affected, if temporary support
works are needed before the actual restoration works, they will also be performed based
on a design drawn up by the expert or by the designer, after having assessed the situation.
Upgrading works are usually carried out through reconstruction, repair or consolidations,
based on a design drafted, checked or analyzed by an expert, in accordance with the legal
provisions applicable.

537. The Ministry of Transport is the administrator of roads of national interest,
directly or through the Romanian National Company of Motorways and National Roads
SA. Seven Regional Directorates for Roads and Bridges (RDRB) are subordinated to the
Romanian National Company of Motorways and National Roads, namely RDRB Bucharest,
RDRB Craiova, RDRB Timisoara, RDRB Cluj, RDRB Iasi, RDRB Constanta, RDRB Brasov. The
mission of these Directorates is to ensure the operation of the road network (national
roads and highways) in conditions of safety, comfort and fluency through maintenance
works, repairs, increasing the traffic capacity, rehabilitation and investment. This requires
an ongoing assessment of the state of degradation of road systems subject to a complex
set of actions due to external factors like heavy traffic, freeze and thaw, moisture,
chemical factors - discharged accidentally or with a specific purpose, etc., leading to
worsening traffic conditions.

538. The roads of county interest are part of the county public property and include
county roads, which provide the link between:
      •    county seats and municipalities, cities, commune seats, spa and tourism resorts,
           ports and airports, important national defense attractions and important
           historical attractions;
      •    cities and municipalities, and between these and commune seats;
      •    commune seats.
County Councils manage the county roads, except for the county road sectors located
within the built urban areas, including artwork and related facilities and accessories, which
are administrated by the respective local councils.

539. The roads of local interest belong to the public property of the local
administrative unit on whose territory they are located and can be classified as:
    • commune roads,
      •    ancillary roads and
      •    streets - public roads within localities, regardless of their name: street, avenue,
           path, embankment, road, alley, dead end, lane etc.
Local councils provide the management of local roads, within their administrative and
territorial range. If a specific road goes across two or more territorial-administrative units,
the classification is approved by the decision of all those local councils.


7.2       Post-Implementation

540. The current legal framework includes no details on requirements for the post-
implementation phase – i.e., tracking the project’s performance after completion. At
least based on the methodological norms, once the actual works are finished, the
beneficiary sends a copy of the completion report to the Ministry. If and when the
warranty period expires, the local authority again sends a copy of the formula
documentation (“procesul verbal de recepție final”) to the MRDPA. Beyond that, the two
key post-implementation functions for any investment program – i.e., ex-post monitoring
and evaluation (M&E) and knowledge sharing – appear to be missing at this point in the
PNDL’s evolution. Put differently, there is no formal process for evaluating the impact of




                                                                                                  149
completed investments and there are no institutionalized efforts for communicating good
practices among past, current, and future beneficiaries of PNDL funds.

541. The most common incidents and failures that need to be considered during
the routine monitoring of construction behavior during operation are:
    • Roads:
           o emergence of potholes, bumps, cracks and grooves in the road coating;
           o emergence and development of fissures and cracks in the joints of decks

                road in which manholes are located;
                damage to the pipelines of water transport and distribution due
                 to the compaction and crumbling of the land where pipes are
                 located;
              clogging of pipelines of water transport and distribution due to
                 inadequate quality of circulating water in terms of turbidity;
       o malfunctions in wastewater collection and transport systems - the highest
         rate appears under the following conditions:
              damage to manholes due to non-compliance by participants in
                 road traffic of axle loads in accordance with the category of the

                  bridges etc.);
       o malfunctions in sludge storage facilities - the highest rate appears under
         the following conditions:
              change of the physical and chemical characteristics of the stored
                  sludge due to insufficient supply of reagents of the quality

             with the measures provided for removing water from the foundations,
             measures for the containment of the joint between the building and the
             protection sidewalk, integrity of pipelines carrying liquids;

542. The current legislation (Regulation of 21/11/1997 on behavior monitoring during
operation, interventions over time and post- decommissioning of constructions)
provides, in Article 16, that the persons conducting the routine and special monitoring,
referred to as professionals responsible for monitoring the behavior of constructions
over time, have the following duties and responsibilities:
    • to know all the details of the construction and to keep up to date the Building Log
        Book, including the event log;
    • to conduct the routine monitoring works and, for the special monitoring, to
        supervise the implementation of programs and projects drawn up in this regard;




                                                                                             152
      •    to notify the owner or the manager of any situations that may entail the
           performance of a technical expertise.

543. The norm on the behavior of constructions over time, indicative P130/1999, also
provides that people responsible for monitoring the behavior of constructions over time
should have the following duties and responsibilities:
    • to know in detail the content of the instructions or project for special monitoring
       of the behavior during operation of the objective for which they were authorized;
    • to know in detail the Building Log Book; to draw up, maintain and keep up to date
       the event log;
    • to participate in the acceptance and installation of measuring and control
       equipment according to the instructions or the special monitoring project;
    • to monitor the compliance with the conditions contained in the instructions or
       project for special monitoring of the behavior during operation and with those
       provided in the Building Log Book;
    • to inspect, at the agreed intervals and immediately after any special event
       (earthquake, flood, heavy rain, snow dump, accidental overload of materials,
       landslide, fire, explosion etc.), the technical condition of the building, in order to
       detect such building elements that, due to their degradation or operating
       conditions, pose a threat to the security and stability of the construction;
    • to request an inspection, an expertise or other action by authorized specialists or
       companies, if degradation is found;
    • to prepare reports on the routine monitoring of the building and to participate in
       the preparation of reports on the special monitoring of construction;
      •    to know the measurement schedule, correlated with the execution and
           exploitation phases;
      •    to notify the relevant parties on the occurrence of certain events or on exceeded
           control values, to allow them to take the appropriate measures.

544. ISC does not authorize professionals responsible for monitoring the behavior of
constructions. Therefore, it recommends that the organization dealing with the routine
monitoring of the in situ behavior of the construction should hire a site supervisor who is
individually authorized for that specialty, having the responsibilities and obligations
mentioned above.

7.3       Investment management

545. The definition of good infrastructure investment management, called from here
on asset management (AM), is given in numerous guidelines and standards, with the
common themes being that of providing the desired level of service in the most cost
effective manner. The following definition is from AASHTO71 : “[Transportation] Asset

71America Association of State Highway and Transport Officials, Subcommittee on Asset Management,
Strategic Plan 2011 –2015




                                                                                                153
Management is a strategic and systematic process of operating, maintaining, upgrading
and expanding physical assets effectively throughout their lifecycle. It focuses on business
and engineering practices for resource allocation and utilization, with the objective of
better decision making based upon quality information and well defined objectives.” For
many infrastructure asset owning agencies, their traditional means of managing the assets
better resembles a Facility Management approach, wherein the approach is to “find and
fix as many faults as possible within the budget available”, with the level of service
provided being an outcome of the works completed and little thought about minimizing
whole of life costs.

546. According to the EPA, asset management is maintaining a desired level of
service for what you want your assets to provide at the lowest life-cycle cost. Lowest
life-cycle cost refers to the best appropriate cost for rehabilitating, repairing or replacing
an asset. Asset management is a framework being widely adopted as a means to pursue
and achieve sustainable infrastructure. It is the practice of managing infrastructure capital
assets to minimize the total cost of owning and operating them while delivering the
desired service levels. A high-performing asset management program incorporates
detailed asset inventories, operation and maintenance tasks, and long-range financial
planning to build system capacity, and it puts systems on the road to sustainability.

547. Each utility is responsible for ensuring that its system stays in good working
order, regardless of the age of components or the availability of additional funds. Asset
management programs with good data —including asset attributes (e.g., age, condition
and criticality), life-cycle costing, proactive operations and maintenance (O&M) and
capital replacement plans based on cost-benefit analyses—can be the most efficient
method of meeting this challenge.

548. AM is important because infrastructure (and in particular road infrastructure) is
so critical to the functioning of modern societies, and will typically constitute the largest
asset of any country. Furthermore, any financial effort, in excess of that necessary, made
on the physical infrastructure is reducing the funds available to be spent on the social
services of a country. With good AM come benefits such as:
    •   Reduced Life-cycle Costs, prolonging asset life and aiding in rehabilitation, repair
        and replacement decisions through efficient and focused operations and
        maintenance;
    •   Consistent Levels of Service, meeting consumer demands with a focus on system
        sustainability;
    •   Ability to Monitor and Track Performance, meeting service expectations and
        regulatory requirements and setting rates based on sound operational and
        financial planning;
    •   Improved Transparency in Decision Making;
    •   Decreased Financial, Operational and Legal Risk leading to fewer surprises going
        forward;




                                                                                                 154
    •   Better Financial Management; Budgeting focused on activities critical to sustained
        performance with ability to Predict Consequences of Funding Decisions and future
        funding needs;
    •   Better Communication.

549. Asset management is centered on a framework of five core questions, which
provide the foundation for many asset management best practices:
    1. What is the current state of the assets?
    2. What is the required "sustainable" level of service?
    3. Which assets are critical to sustained performance?
    4. What are the minimum life-cycle costs?
    5. What is the best long-term funding strategy?


7.3.1   Asset Management in the Road Sector

550. Each road administration is responsible for the management of its own unique
set of assets. However, the American Association of State Highway and Transportation
Officials and the Federal Highway Administration (1997) broadly summarizes the typical
assets of a road administration as:
    •   Physical infrastructure, such as pavements and bridges;
    •   Human resources (personnel and knowledge);
    •   Equipment and materials;
    •   Other items of value such as rights-of-way, data, computer systems, methods,
        technologies, and partners.

551. Generally, the types of assets to be included in an AMS are dependent upon the
administration. Typically, the system will start with the administration’s major assets and
over time will expand to include other assets as data, or system capabilities, become
available for them.

                                                                                              155
552. An important aspect of the use of asset management systems is the need to
monitor the performance of the asset against defined required outcomes or targets of
performance. One approach for this is the use of performance indicators to measure
progress towards achieving the road administration objectives. Other simpler approaches
include the straightforward recording of condition of the asset with time.

553. Some of the different ways that performance can be represented are percentile
of level of condition, effects on users, levels of safety, effects on the environment, and
economic aspects of the network. Each of these represents different measures of
performance of the asset and may be defined by more than factor (e.g. various aspects of
condition may represent the overall condition or noise and pollution may combine to
represent overall environmental performance).

554. The use of performance indicators as a means of performance monitoring and
target setting has been examined by the OECD (1997) in its report Performance
Indicators for the Road Sector. This identified 15 performance indicators used by OECD
Member countries to monitor the performance of the road agencies and include the
results of a field test of their use. The following performance indicators (PIs) were
identified in the report:
    •   Average road user costs;
    •   Level of satisfaction regarding travel time and its reliability and quality of road
        user information;
    •   Protected road user risk;
    •   Unprotected road user risk;
    •   Environmental policy/programmes;
    •   Processes in place for market research and customer feedback;
    •   Long-term programmes;
    •   Allocation of resources to road infrastructure;
    •   Quality management/audit programmes;
    •   Forecast values of road costs vs. actual costs;
    •   Overhead costs (percentage);
    •   Value of assets;
    •   Roughness;
    •   State of road bridges;
    •   Satisfaction with the road system.

555. The same measures of performance are useful by all stakeholders of the asset,
but the importance given to each measure may differ for the different stakeholders. To
consider the performance of the asset, the stakeholders can be divided into three
categories: owners (e.g. government), road administration and users, with each category
equal in importance. The OECD report on performance indicators uses these three
categories of stakeholders and allocates the performance indicators, in terms of each
aspect of performance.




                                                                                              156
556. Performance-based contracting (PBC) are a key Asset Management tool. They
are defined as “a type of contract in which payment for the deliverable is explicitly linked
to the contractor’s successfully meeting or exceeding certain clearly defined performance
indicators”. PBC involves a significant shift away from more traditional approaches to the
delivery and maintenance of road infrastructure and associated services by departing
from the client having responsibility for the design and supervision of construction and
maintenance activities, to focus upon the key outcomes that the client wishes to achieve
and incentivizing the achievement of those outcomes. Most PBC’s consist of a subset of
the following six components: design, build, finance, operate, maintain, and transfer.

557. The World Bank (Bank) has supported different types of PBCs in the road sector
over the last 15 years. The Bank developed sample bidding documents for PBC in 2002
(Performance-based management and maintenance of roads – PMMR (World Bank
(2002)), and again in 2006 (Output- and Performance- Based Road Contracts – OPRC
(World Bank 2006)) to secure minimum standards of quality for PBC implementation. In
addition, the Bank published Transport Note no.27 (World Bank 2005) and a supporting
web based resource Guide (World Bank 2006) in 2006, to assist national and sub-national
road agencies launching or enhancing PBC projects for constructing, operating and
maintaining their road networks.

558. The process of implementing a PBC forces those responsible for the funding,
governance and management (at all levels) of the asset to answer the questions that
have the potential to drift on, lacking answers, without the contractual pressure of the
PBC timeframe. Specifically, to successfully implement a PBC, answers are needed to
questions such as:
    • What assets are own and which of these are to be managed under this contract?
    • What is the level of service that to be provided to the road user?
    • What condition are the assets in?
    •   What is the forward works program required to deliver the least whole-of-life-cost
        solution?
    •   What risks exist in the delivery of the levels of service, and how are those risks
        best managed?

559.    PBCs also tend to:
    •   Provide a better focus by the road agency on governance as a result of the
        separation from the day-to-day operational activities;
    •   Deliver a more consistent (and/or better) service level across the network;
    •   Reduce costs and/or set costs at a fixed level to enable for long term fiscal
        planning by the road agency;
    •   Better allocate risk;
    •   Improve workmanship; and
    •   Address internal labor shortages wherein the authority may not have the internal
        resources/capacity to manage a network according to the traditional model.




                                                                                               157
While many of these desired outcomes might be achieved via alternative contracting
means, it is the PBCs requirement to address all of these at once that is often perceived as
the key benefit to the contract model as they force a paradigm shift.

560. While PBC is mainly used for main roads, it can be a viable alternative for county
and local roads if properly managed. To reduce the risk and attract the private sector
interest, county and local roads in rather good condition, preferably right after
construction or with limited amount of rehabilitation to be done, can be packaged in
groups of roads forming a total length adapted to the size of local and regional
contractors. Simplified monitoring and evaluation system relying on easy verifiable criteria
along with easy payment system need to be implemented for better efficiency.

561. Modern road maintenance must take into account environmental
considerations. Many countries have developed processes for environmental protection
and conservation of natural resources. Funds are also invested in R&D in maintenance and
recycling and for staff training to improve cost-effective maintenance and building
practices and to attract and retain competent personnel.

7.3.2     Asset Management in the Water and Wastewater Sector

562. Asset management for water utilities is more complex than for most other
sectors because of the number, variety, age, condition, and location of assets; the
magnitude of asset investment; and the difficulty of inspecting and maintaining buried
assets. This complexity is often compounded by lack of finance, information, and skills
that can impede acquiring, commissioning, maintaining, overhauling, and replacing assets
at the optimum time72 .

563. One of the main characteristics asset management should have is
comprehensiveness. This feature allows utility managers to obtain better information on
the age and condition of existing assets, determine the level of maintenance needed to
optimize asset performance and useful life, assess the risks associated with the failure of
various assets and set priorities for their maintenance and replacement. In addition, a
better understanding of the trade-offs and implications of management decisions about
the assets, and use better information to justify proposed rate increases or capital
investments are expected. According to the U.S. Government Accountability Office, water
industry officials agree that by making informed decisions about investments in capital
assets, drinking water and wastewater utilities can better justify the rate increases
associated with making needed improvements to their infrastructure.

564. At its most basic level, comprehensive asset management involves the
systematic collection of key data and the application of analytical tools such as life-cycle
cost analysis and risk assessment. Asset management thus provides information that
managers can use to make sound decisions about their capital assets and allows decision
makers to better identify and manage needed investments in their organization’s

infrastructure. By following this approach, organizations also change the process they use
to make decisions, including the types of information they bring to bear, and which
segments of the organization participate in the decision-making process. Using a fully
integrated decision process, many segments of an organization, including accounting,
engineering, finance, maintenance, and operations, are expected to exchange relevant
information, share in the decision-making process, and take an organization-wide view
when setting goals and priorities.

565. For drinking water and wastewater utilities, an integral part of a comprehensive
asset management program is ensuring that adequate funds are available through user
rates or other means. This way asset management decisions can be implemented (e.g.,
ensuring that planned maintenance can be conducted and capital assets can be repaired,
replaced, or upgraded on schedule).

566. Experts within and outside the water industry have published manuals and
handbooks on asset management practices and how to apply them. While the specific
terminology differs, some fundamental elements of implementing asset management
appear consistently in the literature, such as:
    • Collecting and organizing detailed information on assets: Collecting basic
       information about capital assets helps managers identify their infrastructure
       needs and make informed decisions about the assets.
    •   Analyzing data to set priorities and make better decisions about assets: Under
        asset management, managers apply analytical techniques to identify significant
        patterns or trends in the data they have collected on capital assets; help assess
        risks and set priorities; and optimize decisions on maintenance, repair, and
        replacement of the assets.
    •   Life cycle cost analysis: Managers analyze life-cycle costs to decide which assets to
        buy, considering total costs over an asset’s life, not just the initial purchase price.
    •   Risk/ criticality assessment: Managers use risk assessment to determine how
        critical the assets are to their operations, considering both the likelihood that an
        asset will fail and the consequences—in terms of costs and impact on the
        organization’s desired level of service—if the asset does fail. Based on this
        analysis, managers set priorities and target their resources accordingly.
    •   Integrating data and decision making across the organization: Managers ensure
        that the information collected within an organization is consistent and organized
        so that it is accessible to the people who need it. Among other things, the
        organization’s databases should be fully integrated.
    •   Linking strategy for addressing infrastructure needs to service goals, operating
        budgets, and capital improvement plans: An organization’s goals for its desired
        level of service—in terms of product quality standards, frequency of service
        disruptions, customer response time, or other measures—are a major
        consideration in the organization’s strategy for managing its assets. As managers
        identify and rank their infrastructure needs, they determine the types and amount
        of investments needed to meet the service goals.




                                                                                                  159
567. The implementation of the basic elements of asset management is an iterative
process that individual organizations may begin at different points. Within the water
industry, for example, some utilities may start out by identifying their infrastructure
needs, while other utilities may take their first step by setting goals for the level of service
they want to provide. The interrelationship between the elements of asset management
can alter an organization’s strategy for managing its assets. For example, once an
organization has completed a risk assessment, it may scale back its efforts to compile a
detailed inventory of assets to focus initially on those assets determined to be critical.
According to advocates of asset management, while many organizations are implementing
certain aspects of the process, such as maintaining an inventory of assets and tracking
maintenance, these organizations are not realizing the full potential of comprehensive
asset management unless all of the basic elements work together as an integrated
management system.

     Better information enabled the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority to improve
     its maintenance decisions and eliminate some unneeded maintenance activities. For
     example, in an effort to optimize maintenance practices in one of their treatment
     plants, utility officials reassessed maintenance practices for 12 equipment systems,
     such as different types of pumps. By using the assessment results to improve
     maintenance planning for these assets, the utility decreased the labor hours spent on
     preventive maintenance by 25 percent from the hours recommended by the original
     equipment manufacturers, according to utility officials. Similarly, in analyzing its
     maintenance practices, the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority found it was
     lubricating some equipment more often than necessary. By decreasing the frequency
     of oil changes, the utility reported it saved approximately $20,000 in oil purchase and
     disposal costs. In addition, the utility extended the life of its assets by decreasing the
     lubrication—over-lubrication can cause equipment parts to fail prematurely. (Source:

7.4      Asset Management in infrastructure projects funded by PNDL

568. Asset Management covers asset management activities, irrespective of their
form – financial or tangible. This is an umbrella term for various activities, from managing
financial assets to managing the infrastructure (roads, water, and sanitation).

ROAD INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR

569. “Asset management” as applied to the roads sector can be considered to be “a
systematic process of maintaining, upgrading and operating assets, combining
engineering principles with sound business practice and economic rationale, and
providing tools to facilitate a more organized and flexible approach to making the
decisions necessary to achieve the public’s expectations.” 73 In practice, an asset

management system (AMS) will include all the processes, tools, data, and policies
necessary for the effective management of all the assets for which the road
administration is responsible, including physical infrastructure such as pavements and
bridges as well as human resources, equipment and materials and other items of financial
and economic value.

570. Asset management is ultimately about managing a road administration’s
resources more like a business. In many countries, road administrations are now required
to implement standardized asset inventory, valuation and depreciation approaches and
enhance the information provided as part of their annual financial statements, in a
manner more in line with those used by private sector companies.

571. In 2005, under the World Bank’s Rural Deve lopment Program (RDP), a
project/survey was initiated for developing a road maintenance management system
for the Romanian roads. Five counties were selected: Botoșani, Călăraşi, Dolj, Sălaj, and
Tulcea, each with 20 communes (totaling 100 communes in the country). The study
performed an analysis for the development of a multiannual program of works. A
management and maintenance system for local roads was also achieved and HDM4 74 was
used as a working tool for this purpose. Based on the works schedule averag e annual
funds to be used for economically efficient maintenance are calculated. The survey results
are useful for preparing future budgets necessary for the local road network. The reports
include both technical and economic models for scientifically based analysis and could be
considered as potential guidelines for future analyses. Nationally, the study can be
considered a good starting point for enhancing the experience in other Romanian
counties.

Water and wastewater sector

572. In Romania, the management of water supply and sanitation services is
delegated to the Regional Operators. While there is little asset management as defined
before, some features are presented in the following part.

573. A high volume of piping characterizes supply / treatment plants an d water
supply / sanitation networks. The operation of these constructions depends decisively on
their proper functioning. For all equipment, technical sheets will be drawn up, containing

   HDM-III simulates the conditions and costs for the lifetime of a road or a group of roads starting from a
number of construction and maintenance strategies for modernized or not modernized roads. HDM4
(Highway Development and Management Model) has been realized starting from HDM-III as a result of
international effort of British Overseas Development Administration, Asian Development Bank, Road
Administration of Sweden, Inter-American Federation of concrete Manufacturers and World Bank. Based
on the knowledge accumulated from previous use of road management HDM-III has been extended with:
i) Updated and calibrated technical relations to the most recent level of knowledge; ii) Supplementary
facilities for traffic congestion treatment and for non-motorized vehicles, concrete pavements, effects on
the environment and traffic safety; iii) Improvement of the analysis and decision framework, so it might
be used at different levels of planning, financing/budgeting, evaluation and management. HDM -III
simulates the conditions and costs for the lifetime of a road or a group of roads starting from a number of
construction and maintenance strategies for modernized or not modernized roads.




                                                                                                       161
all data from the project, the technical documentation submitted by suppliers or
executants and from the operational data taken on the ground and certified by
acceptance protocols upon takeover, which must confirm their conformity with reality.

574.    During operation, the data sheets should be filled out with data concerning:
    •   incidents or damages;
    •   equipment damaged as a result of the incident or damage;
    •   incidents or damages to other equipment caused by the incident or damage in
        question;
    •   repairs made to remove the incident / damage;
    •   the cost of repairs;
    •   the list of parts and / or subassemblies replaced during repair;
    •   the duration of the repair period;
    •   the behavior during operation between two scheduled repairs;
    •   the due date and the type of the next scheduled repair (routine maintenance
        works, technical revisions, routine and capital repairs);
    •   the due date of the following regular check;
    •   periodic testing and after repair reports according to the technical specifications
        and legal requirements.

575. The technical data sheets for the basic machinery should also include data on
foundations, equipment, earthing systems, protection devices, control, remote
transmission, and telecommunications systems. For adduction and exhaust channels,
buildings, tanks and the like, as well as for lifting equipment, boilers and pressure vessels,
the documentation required by the applicable regulations in force should be prepared and
used.

576. Apart from the technical data sheets, a record of routine maintenance works,
technical revisions, and regular and capital repairs is kept for basic equipment. The basic
machinery, the auxiliary equipment (pumps, motors), and the major mechanical systems
(tanks, dams, gantries, cranes) must be provided with indicative signs containing the
identification data for that equipment in accordance with the rules in force. All the
mentioned equipment, as well as the pipelines, must be marked according to a system
that would allow rapid and easily visible identification during operation.

577. The operating staff should prepare daily operational data sheets if these data
are not recorded and stored by a computer system. The data stored in the computer
system or prepared by the operating staff represent the primary form of technical
evidence. The main works to be carried out by the operating staff, in relation to the
operating activities, consist of:
    a) facility surveillance;
    b) regular facility checks;
    c) performing various tasks;




                                                                                                 162
    d) periodic maintenance works;
    e) unscheduled maintenance works;
    f) accidental intervention works.
The periodic maintenance works are those stipulated in the instructions of the equipment
suppliers, in the Technical operating rules and in the internal instructions / technical
procedures and should be executed, usually without stopping the basic machinery.
Unscheduled maintenance works are performed in order to prevent or eliminate
degradation, damage or incidents.

578. Analysis and recording of incidents and failures should be done. In order to
increase the operational safety of the water supply and sanitation service and the
continuity of the service, the Operator prepares operative and systematic analysis
procedures for undesirable events that occur in the water supply and sanitation system.
This way measures are established on increasing the reliability of the equipment and
technological schemes, on improving operational/maintenance/repair activity and on
increasing the level of training and discipline of the operating staff.

579.    Events that are analyzed refer mainly to:
    •   common faults;
    •   malfunctions in the catchment systems, treatment plants, water transport and
        distribution networks;
    •   malfunctions in the collection and transport systems, in wastewater treatment
        plants and sludge treatment and disposal plants;
     • incidents and failures;
     • systematic deviations of distributed water parameters.
Failure analysis should be performed immediately after the event occurrence by the
Operator’s staff in charge.

580.    The analysis of each incident or failure should include:
    •   place and time of the occurrence of the incident or failure;
    •   situation prior to the incident or failure, whether the work was performed under
        the usual scheme, indicating possible deviations from it;
    •   causes that favored the emergence and development of the incident or failure;
    •   maneuvers carried out by the staff during the occurrence and removal of the
        incident or failure;
    •   operation status of signaling, protection and automation systems;
    •   effects produced by the incident or failure on plants, whether the equipment was
        damaged, describing the damage;
    •   effects on users, utilities not delivered, duration of the work discontinuation,
        estimated amount of damage or other effects;
    •   technical causes and factors that caused each event in the sequence of events
        causing the incident or failure;




                                                                                           163
    •   behavior of staff during the incident or failure and the observance of the technical
        instructions and internal procedures applicable to them.

581. A thorough analysis of an incident or failure should show the basic cause, which
produced it. This might be the result of a deficient design of the plant, of deficiencies in
system installation, as well as of equipment deficiencies, of poor quality materials or due
to the action or inaction of certain individuals on or in connection with the system or
equipment under analysis. The incident or failure analysis results are transmitted to those
involved in order to obtain their viewpoint. The analysis of the failure or incident should
be performed at the headquarters of the Operator of the respective facilities, with the
participation of the designer, the equipment supplier and/or the contractor, as
appropriate, their participation being compulsory at the request of the Operator.

582. Ensuring system operational safety is a key aspect of asset management. To
increase the operational safety of the water supply and sanitation services and water
supply and wastewater takeover continuity, the Operator should prepare internal
technical instructions and procedures establishing rules for conducting maneuvers in the
facilities belonging to the water supply and sanitation system. Commissioning of the
equipment newly installed should be performed according to the design and/or
equipment provider instructions on the mechanical and technological tests and
commissioning. During the mechanical testing of the equipment, maneuvers and
operations performed are the responsibility of those who perform the installation, with
the participation of the operating personnel. After the completion of mechanical tests,
construction - installation works acceptance is performed and works are taken over by the
recipient based on an acceptance report.

Social infrastructure

583. In this area, Romania has no experience on asset management. Behavior
monitoring during operation and maintenance could be considered preliminary phases;
they are shown below.

584. Routine maintenance and behavior monitoring of buildings that are part of the
social infrastructure is a permanent activity required throughout the lifetime of a
building. The schedule for the maintenance and behavior monitoring (maintenance) of
socio-cultural buildings consists of all technical and administrative actions, including
surveillance operations, undertaken by the community where the school is located, in
order to extend the functional, structural and aesthetic characteristics and the useful life
of the building.

585. The local or county council should appoint a team that, every six months, will
check all the social infrastructure buildings that are owned/ managed by the County
Council or by the City Hall. The inspection team should consist of 5-7 members including:
    • a member of the education/culture/urban and spatial planning boards within the
        city hall/county or local council; the school principal or another teacher; staff
        qualified in maintenance activities, the school administrator;




                                                                                               164
      •    specialists, consultants, companies, employees dedicated to this work, if the
           board so determines, who are remunerated on a contract basis from the local
           budget; and
      •    representatives of the designer and constructor: architect and engineer, site
           supervisor; cost assessment expert. This team should prepare, for each building,
           an inspection report on the existing situation and should make budgetary
           proposals to fix the problems and keep the building at standard operating
           technical parameters.

586.       The elements that determine the maintenance activities’ planning are:
    •      inspection performed by the designated team;
      •    identification of the type of work (very urgent, urgent, routine);
      •    organization of the maintenance work (planning of deadlines and responsibilities)
           and cost identification and their planning;
      •    activity planning and budgeting;
      •    identification and allocation of financial resources;
      •    monitoring of works during execution;
      •    works acceptance / final acceptance and filling in the construction log book.

587.       The team should establish three categories of works:
      •    Very urgent : whose nonperformance can lead to accidents, damages etc. (e.g. gas
           installation faults). To be immediately remedied.
      •    Urgent works: works whose non-performance would lead to a poor educational
           process in terms of quality. To be remedied until the start of the following school
           year.
      •    Routine or planned works: to be planned for the following year, during holidays,
           etc.

588. The mayor/deputy mayor or vice-president of the County Council, as
appropriate, should supervise the prioritization of the maintenance works proposed by
the inspection team. Employees of specialized services within city halls and each unit
manager should keep a record of the planning activity. The commission for urban and
spatial planning/technical projects/investment and the management of the institution
(represented by the inspection team) should be responsible for carrying out the works and
should be present at the reception of the works.


7.5       Conclusions

589. Asset management is of crucial importance for infrastructure works. New
transparent and standardized methods are needed for a better development of the
process.




                                                                                                 165
590. Specialists working on projects funded under PNDL acquire valuable knowledge
and extensive practical experience. However, this knowledge is not shared and is often
lost when projects are completed. To build on the experience gained and to avoid
repeating errors, it is extremely important to share experience and knowledge. In this
way, beneficiaries can find more information about similar projects in the same county. To
that end, seminars can be organized to disseminate knowledge on two levels: detailed
information can be shared among projects of the same type (roads, water and sanitation,
social infrastructure), while general information can be disseminated to the public.

591. During the warranty period, the Constructor is required to deal only with faults
that arise from the operation, not under routine maintenance. Currently, the legislation
allows framework agreements to be concluded for maintenance during winter or summer
time (for road maintenance works), possibly with a different company than the one that
performed the works. The intervention of another company on the works executed by the
Constructor may invalidate the warranty provided by the Constructor to the Beneficiary
during the period between works acceptance (on completion) and the final acceptance.
For example, the degradation of the wear layer caused by snow removal activities
performed by the maintenance company can be attributed to the latter’s lack of
professionalism, leading to the Constructor’s refusal to remedy the degradation of the
items concerned. Therefore, when contracting the Constructor, the Beneficiary should
include in the specifications the requirement for maintenance after the completion of the
works, during the warranty period. This relates to the recommendation to supplement the
legislation with the FIDIC Design-Build-Operate type of contract. Another important
recommendation for PNDL is related to the eligibility of maintenance costs within the
PNDL budget.

592. The designer should draw, solely at the request of the Beneficiary, the
specifications for monitoring over time the behavior of constructions that require
routine maintenance works. It is recommended that this type of specifications be
mandatory for every type of work within the infrastructure projects financed under PNDL.

593. According to standards for asphalt mixes, the wear layer can be replaced every 5
years. To ensure legislative consistency throughout the project, the proposed interval for
road maintenance should be of at least 5 years. No roads should be rehabilitated/
modernized before this period. PNDL should not finance road works on sections that were
built/rehabilitated over the previous 5 years (from whatever source of financing), as
argued in the other reports developed as part of this technical assistance.

594. Maintenance/modernization/rehabilitation of county/communal/local roads
could be managed by the current Regional Directorates for Roads and Bridges,
subordinated to the CNADNR. Communes do not receive adequate resources for planning
and programming road maintenance works. Only urgent actions or minimum annual
actions are planned in order to keep the road network at least in minimum conditions for
use and operation. This is natural, given that the budgets of most communes are low, and
road infrastructure is not considered as a priority by the decision-makers. In addition to
the lack of financial resources, communes are also confronted with the lack of qualified
technical staff. An important benefit of this proposal is the unified prioritization of




                                                                                             166
maintenance during the summer and especially during the winter (Regional Directorates
for Roads and Bridges subordinated to CNADNR take action for snow removal on national
roads, but in order to reach the localities, snow removal on local and county roads is also
required, which is under County Councils for county roads, or U.A.T. for DC/DS/streets).

595. Alternatively, the Government should consider establishing eight Regional
Directorates for the implementation of maintenance/ rehabilitation/modernization
projects for county/local roads. Local needs should continue to be determined locally,
based on the strategies of communes and counties. In contrast, the proposed Directorates
should carry out the implementation of projects at regional level. This would allow for an
easier implementation of local road projects, taking this burden off the shoulders of local
councils in rural areas, as most of the time they lack specialized staff. A Regional
Directorate     should      also    have     a     unified    vision     regarding      the
maintenance/modernization/rehabilitation of county roads, which will allow the financing
of the maintenance/rehabilitation/modernization of entire county roads that run over
several counties. The eight Directorates should have specialized technical personnel from
the County Directorates for Roads and Bridges of the County Councils. The MRDPA and
the Ministry of Finance can act as coordinating entities of the proposed Regional
Directorates.

596.    The proposed Regional Directorates should have responsibilities such as:
    •   Regular inspection and continuous assessment of public roads;
    •   Development of proposals for the maintenance plan;
    •   Coordination and supervision of maintenance projects during the summer;
    •   Coordination and supervision of maintenance projects during the winter;
    •   Coordination and supervision of urgent works and minor maintenance works;
    •   Execution of routine administrative works;
    •   Preparation and payment of the maintenance works performed.




                                                                                              167
8     Conclusions and recommendations


8.1    Targeted strategies and specific action steps proposed for public investments in
       Romania

597. Any strategy should demonstrate/provide information regarding the
involvement of the community and interested stakeholders in the formulation process .
Public and online consultations for the strategies, including the list of priority projects,
should be carried out and the input of the stakeholders should be clearly specified in a
dedicated chapter of the document and integrated in the content of the planning
document. In order to ensure the sound involvement and accountability of each
stakeholder in the implementation stage, partners and local authorities should elaborate
and sign a partnership contract. This contract should contain both benefits and penalties
for the parties that assumed clear responsibilities in implementing priority projects.
Another report (under Component 1 of the current technical assistance), to be finalized in
late August 2015, explores the potential use of territorial contracts, drawing on best
practices and experiences from other EU member states (e.g., Poland, the UK, etc.).

598. The periodic evaluation of strategy implementation, based on a set of objective
indicators, should be carried out at least every 2-3 years, while monitoring should be
continuous . This way, the ongoing revision of the strategy will be allowed or the
corrective measures will be undertaken.

599. Local strategies should take into consideration strategic projects identified by
the higher-level (national, regional or county) development strategies . For example, if
the General Transport Master Plan foresees the rehabilitation of a certain national road or
the development of a new highway, local authorities should invest with priority in the
county and local roads ensuring the connection to that specific road.

600. Investment projects should be territorially integrated at local level in order to
maximize their effects . For example, if a certain urban or rural area is targeted for road
extension or rehabilitation, the investment in utilities or social infrastructure for that
particular zone should be also considered with priority. A good example in this sense is the
PIDU approach for urban areas or the integrated rural renewal projects under 2007-2013
PNDR.

601. Authorities should consider the establishment of an inter-department steering
group at the beneficiary level (in case of municipalities and counties) led by one
department/project implementation unit to help the process and ensure ownership of
the development strategy. Law no. 215/2001 should be revised in order to clearly state
that the local / county authorities should elaborate and adopt a decision on both
strategies and lists of priority projects, with clear provisions related to financing sources
(reflected also in the multi-annual budget of that particular authority).




                                                                                                168
602. A sound prioritization process of the investment projects, correlated with the
real financial and human resources of the communities, should be conducted . In this
sense, this report argues for the use of prioritization criteria for each investment project
proposed (road, water and wastewater, social infrastructure). A full list of potential
criteria (to be applied to the state-funded National Local Development Program) has been
delivered by the World Bank under the Component 2 of this Technical Advisory Service. 75
Particularly important are the criteria related to the beneficiary’s capacity of co -financing
the projects.

603. Alternative sources of finance should be explored . Although EU funding will
continue to be the main financing source for most investment project in the 2014-2020
programming period, development strategies should consider all potential financial
sources (a financing mix), including own budgets (if available), PPPs, and PNDL funds or
credits.

604. In order to improve the quality and the use of the planning instruments for the
next EU programming cycle, several measures can be devised. First, all infrastructure
strategies, as well as the actual related projects, should be correlated in space and time.
One relevant example would be the road and utilities infrastructure, with many newly
rehabilitated roads being affected by the water, wastewater or gas construction work. The
report on coordination (also developed as part of this technical assistance) covers this
topic in great depth. 76

605. Priority projects should be better promoted especially to private stakeholders .
This way they could better plan and connect their own investments to those envisaged by
public stakeholders/administration (multiplying effect).

606. Multi-annual financing and the correlation between investment priorities and
budgets are needed . Although the county or local councils approve strategies, these
documents do not typically contain a financing need assessment for the entire
programming period or the potential financing sources for each of the proposed projects,
and/or there is no specific allocation in the local budget for the priority projects identified
in the strategy.

607. A stronger “partnership culture” among stakeholders in general is ne eded . So
far, most PPP alternatives for the implementation of strategic projects are completely
ignored, while the only focus is on EU-funded programmes, with limited resources made
available to innovative schemes.

608. For Infrastructure Planning and Facilities, every construction project begins with
an idea – whether it is a sidewalk repair, a new bridge, rehabilitation of a road sector,
new water and wastewater system, or modernization of social infrastructure. First,
someone identifies a probable need. From there, the idea is either studied to determine if

75

Infrastructure,” World Bank, 2015




                                                                                                  169
there is truly a need, or it is given to an estimator for a calculation on the cost of the idea.
If approved, the idea is then sent to the planning stage.

609.    The stages for preparatory planning should follow the scheme below:

                            Figure 43. Ideal preparatory planning




610. The cost-benefit analysis can become more useful – for demonstrating the
feasibility of the proposed investments – with clear definition and role and by including a
minimal, yet standardized methodology that does not require great efforts on the part
of the applicants. Consequently, all projects would be analyzed by using the same unit of
measurement, thus helping with the prioritization of the funding proposals. Drafting a n
economic analysis, albeit a minimal one can ensure the beneficiary that the FS can be
submitted for financing from multiple sources. Most European funding programs require
an economic analysis, irrespective of the project value.

611. Introducing a phase of technical and economic assessment of the
documentation would ensure that technical non -conformities could be corrected at
minimum cost. Thus, it can be determined whether solutions adopted meet standards in
force and can be implemented without additional costs.

612. It is also recommended to consider introducing a standardized financial model
to facilitate the Beneficiary’s work and to prevent errors at the same time. Errors were
found in the calculation of the General Estimate: failing to comply with the unit costs and
maximum limits for certain types of expenses laid down in the cost standards – GD no.
363/2010, as subsequently adjusted (e.g., the program’s estimated contribution and the
beneficiary’s own contribution were inaccurate).




                                                                                                   170
613. Feasibility studies for major projects should be reviewed and analyzed by
experts in order to enhance their quality. This process can be done in the following
sequence:
    • Asking the award winning consultant who is preparing the feasibility study to
       submit a draft of the study to the beneficiary before submitting the final feasibility
       study report for approval.
    • After getting the draft study, the beneficiary needs to ask experts in this area to
       review the document. Peer reviewers can be selected from local and/or
       international consultant offices, economic experts, and academic people. They
       can be inside resources (e.g., City Hall staff) or outside consultants.
    • Peer reviewers are required to answer the primary question: Is the study
       appropriately prepared? They would submit a report that includes: (a) a critical
       review of the draft feasibility study; (b) identification of major deficiencies and/or
       areas of weakness in the draft, if any; and (c) specific recommendations to
       improve the study.
    • The award-winning consultant should include this review as an appendix in the
       final submitted study, and should respond and address all comments in theses
       reviews to the satisfaction of the owner of the project.

614. A recommended solution would be compliance monitoring, which is a
fundamental activity within environmental protection and is one of the ways by which
adherence to limits and laws can be assessed for regulatory purposes. It may include a
range of inspections and reporting activities undertaken to determine compliance with
regulatory requirements. The achievement of best practice in compliance monitoring
requires careful consideration of key stages:
    • Reasons for monitoring;
    • Responsibility for monitoring (by whom);
    • How to set limits and parameters which can be monitored;
    • Principles of practical monitoring;
    • How to judge compliance;
    • Response to compliance failings;
    • Summary and communication of findings and conclusions.

615. Also, for a better administration, a document management system (DMS) is
recommended, which is a computerized method of storage, management hosting and
distribution of project documentation. It is an essential tool to store, track and distribute
documentation and data to users groups who may be correlated or distantly located. It
provides a component of enterprise content management relative to digital asset
management, document imaging, workflow systems and records management.

616. Public procurement law must find a compromise between excessive regulation,
meant to ensure strict compliance with governing principles, and freedom of decisio n,
which would allow contracting authorities to select those tenders that suit best their
particular needs. The following list of recommendations offers potential solutions for
addressing the issues related to the current public procurement framework and ease the
burden on ROP beneficiaries implementing projects. It is important to note that some of




                                                                                                171
these ideas are particularly technical, while others require a national-level resolution. That
said, the hope is that these suggestions help advance the conversation on an extremely
complex and sensitive topic – public procurement – and enable PNDL beneficiaries to
organize efficient and effective procedures for awarding contracts. At a minimum, some of
these ideas could form the basis of upcoming changes to Roma nia’s public procurement
law (Government Emergency Ordinance 34/2006), in line with corresponding dynamics at
the EU level:
    • An improved public procurement framework should aim to reduce, to a minimum,
        the number of contracts awarded on the basis of the “lowest bid” criterion and
        instead rely, in most cases, on the “most economically advantageous tender”
        (MEAT) criterion.
    • Contracting authorities would benefit from recommended sets of evaluation
        factors, based on broad types of public contracts. These factors should be
        synthetic and allow for an objective assessment of the tenders, but they have to
        be, at the same time, relevant to the object of the contract.
    • Better support is needed to help contracting authorities prevent and avoid
        potential conflicts of interests. This can be achieved by providing PNDL
        beneficiaries with detailed checklists as a mandatory component of the tender
        evaluation process.
    • The usage of professional liability insurances should be expanded.
    • Public procurement procedures can be launche d under a “suspension clause”.
        Taking into account the significant duration of the selection, the evaluation, and
        the contracting stages, the deferred launching of the award procedure, after the
        signing of the financing contract, can lead to failure to comply with the schedule
        of activities, because of possible delays in public procurement. From this point of
        view, a possible solution consists in the launch of award procedures under a
        “suspension” conditional clause (“clauză suspensivă”), the effect intervening after
        the designation of the successful tender, but prior to the signing of the public
        contract.
    • Recommended templates should be designed for contractual variation clauses. In
        the case of public works contracts, the actual performance of the contracts may
        reveal differences against the quantities estimated by the technical documents. In
        order to regulate such changes of the object of the contract, where they do not
        involve a review of the technical solution adopted or of the technical
        requirements laid down in the specifications agreed to by the contractor, the
        contracting authorities can include, in the contract template, certain variation
        clauses according to which the final price of the contract is to be determined as
        the product between the prices/quantities initially tendered and the actual costs
        resulted from works on the ground.
    • Support for PNDL beneficiaries in the procurement process should be provided.
        Establishing a new professional body of assessors for the alternative technical
        solutions. The assessors may be required by the beneficiaries to evaluate bids and
        payments from the PNDL budget and they must be MRDPA certified engineers as
        site inspector (Diriginte de șantier ) of Technical Responsible with Execution (RTE).

617. Maintenance/modernization/rehabilitation of county/communal/local roads
could be managed by the current Regional Directorates for Roads and Bridges,




                                                                                                 172
subordinated to the CNADNR. Communes do not receive adequate resources for planning
and programming road maintenance works. Only urgent actions or minimum annual
actions are planned in order to keep the road network at least in minimum conditions for
use and operation. This is natural, given that the budgets of most communes are low, and
road infrastructure is not considered as a priority by the decision-makers. In addition to
the lack of financial resources, communes are also confronted with the lack of qualified
technical staff. An important benefit of this proposal is the unified prioritization of
maintenance during the summer and especially during the winter (Regional Directorates
for Roads and Bridges subordinated to CNADNR take action for snow removal on national
roads, but in order to reach the localities, snow removal on local and county roads is also
required, which is under County Councils for county roads, or U.A.T. for DC/DS/streets). It
is mandatory to have technical standards to establish the necessity of maintenance works
depending on the degradation degree of the infrastructure, but also the costs for such
works.

618. A continuing professional training system should be implemented to ensure the
best possible working environment in the field of infrastructure investments. Such a
system should be mandatory for all professionals in this field and should be targeted at
both training on the current legislation and correct implementation of investments.


8.2       Efficient and innovative designs and technologies for public infrastructure invest ments
          in Romania

619. In the planning process, stakeholders should look for modern, efficient, and
sustainable infrastructure to be reliable, green, safe, and smart . This report considers
that these are the main pillars (families of characteristics) desired and researched in the
design of new infrastructure, which respond to current requirements and concerns:
    • Reliable infrastructure is available and durable, i.e. demonstrates high quality and
        low maintenance of the infrastructure components. The concept is closely related
        to lifetime engineering and involves the project optimization, with particular
        attention to maintenance, upgrades, and refurbishments.
      •    Green infrastructure features energy efficient and environmentally friendly
           designs. The concept can be applied to the design, building, and operation,
           including materials, techniques, and management for all the inputs, processes and
           outputs.
      •    Safe infrastructure minimizes accident risks for users and operators/workers. It
           also implies that, in case of an accident, the infrastructure is designed to minimize
           consequential effects.
      •    Smart infrastructure communicates with users, operators, and with other
           infrastructure. Modern infrastructure is more and more connected with the real
           and virtual world through direct information sent to users about its real time
           conditions, to operators about maintenance status, energy consumption, etc., and
           adapt itself to the conditions of use.




                                                                                                   173
620. There are multiple recommendations for improving the design of public
infrastructure projects in Romania. For one, it is mandatory to adapt the technical
standards in force to European standards, reflecting climate change, traffic modifications,
and other new concepts environment friendly. Some standards are too old and their
content is not up to date compared to international best practices.


         Cross-sectoral aspects

8.2.1     Energy efficient and environment friendly infrastructure

621. Green infrastructure uses vegetation, soils, and natural processes to manage
water and to create healthier environments. It seeks to provide a better resolution and
integration of man-made heavy polluting and high energy consumer environment, by
building with nature. Green infrastructure can refer to rainwater harvesting, rain gardens,
planter boxes, flood protection, green streets and alleys, permeable pavements, green
roofs and others. This type of solutions can enhance or even replace a functionality that is
traditionally provided by man-made structures.

622. A low energy infrastructure in a life cycle concerns the amounts of energy spent
in its embodied energy, energy needed for operation and demolition. The European
Union is aiming for a 20% reduction in annual primary energy consumption by the year
2020. The commission has proposed measures to increase efficiency in all stages in the
energy chain – generation, transformation, distribution and consumption.

623. Romania has a good potential of solar radiation, which can be used in
photovoltaic applications as an alternative energy source. According to statistical data
for Romania, annual solar radiation on a horizontal surface varies between 1500 kWh/sqm
(in Dobrogea - South/East of Romania) and 1300 kWh/sqm (Transylvanian Plateau) so that
autonomous photovoltaic systems may cover a large territory, especially in isolated areas
with low demand for electricity. 77 This type of photovoltaic applications can be applied in
new technologies for roads, water, wastewater, and social infrastructure, such as facades
or rooftops for buildings, solar powered road signs, traffic lights, power stations, rural
electrification, solar lamps, water pumps, parking meters, and many others.

8.2.2     Smart infrastructure

624. Information availability and exchange is a key characteristic of our society and it
does not exclude infrastructure. Modern infrastructures communicate with users,
operators and between themselves. A smart infrastructure responds intelligently to
changes in its environment, including user demands and other infrastructure, in order to
achieve improved performance.

625. Intelligent transportation systems (ITS) are advanced applications that aim to
provide innovative services relating to different modes of transport and traffic

77
     Romania National Report, Harghita Energy Management Public Service & UEM CARDT, Wide the SEE




                                                                                               174
management and enable various users to be better informed and make safer, more
coordinated, and 'smarter' use of transport networks. Although ITS may refer to all
modes of transport, EU Directive 2010/40/EU (7 July 2010) defines ITS as a system in
which information and communication technologies are applied in the field of road
transport, including infrastructure, vehicles and users, and in traffic management and
mobility management, as well as for interfaces with other modes of transport.

626. A variable-message sign, often abbreviated VMS, CMS, or DMS, and in the UK
known as a matrix sign, is an electronic traffic sign often used on roadways to give
travelers information about special events. Such signs warn of traffic congestion,
accidents, incidents, roadwork zones, or speed limits on a specific highway segment.
In urban areas, VMS are used for parking guidance and information systems to guide
drivers to available car parking spaces. They may also ask vehicles to take alternative
routes, limit travel speed, warn of duration and location of the incidents, or just inform of
evolving traffic conditions.

627. While Romania already uses e-vignette, satellite-based tolling systems could
also be considered. Following the successful German experience, many countries have
adopted or are considering adopting advanced tolling technologies which are distance-
based and can be applied to specific categories of vehicles (only heavy trucks, all trucks, all
vehicles) and to specific parts of the network (only motorways, motorways and national
roads, etc.).

628. Smart water systems are important in delivering more integrated and resilient
water, wastewater and flood protection infrastructure in order to meet the current and
emerging global sustainability and climate change challenges. New strategies currently
being implemented or considered around the world include smart closed-loop wastewater
systems with energy recovery, both small and large scale (UK); water resource and flood
information and management response systems (Netherlands, China); holistic catchment
management integrated with water supply and wastewater management (US) 78 .

629. Building automation is the automatic centralized control of a building's heating,
ventilation and air conditioning, lighting and other systems through a Building
Management System or Building Automation System (BAS). The objectives of smart
buildings are improved occupant comfort, efficient operation of building systems, and
reduction in energy consumption and operating costs.


         Road infrastructure

630. In developed countries, road management is usually based on functional
classification of the road network. Normally, there are three road classes: Arterial,
Collector, and Local roads. Arterials serve mobility, collectors serve mobility and access to
land equally, and local roads primarily access to land with mobility as a lesser function.
There can also be foot and bicycle paths.

631. The actual stage of road design should include phases related to the elaboration
of the traffic study, Environmental Impact Study, Road Safety Audit, Road Safety
Inspection, topographic studies, geotechnical studies, geometric design, pavement
design, drainage design, and art works design. Noise protection of urban areas, in the
vicinity of the roads where noise arising from vehicles exceeds certain thresholds, is less
documented.


8.2.3   Self-explaining roads

632. A self-explaining road can be defined as a road designed and constructed to
elicit correct assessments from road users on appropriate driving behavior matched to
the road environment, thereby reducing the likelihood of driver errors and enhancing
driving comfort. A self-explaining road environment can be facilitated by properly
categorizing the road scene according to existing schemes, i.e., through a set of
standardized “signals” in each road category, easily recognized a nd acted upon by road
users. Drivers have to cope with increasingly complex traffic environments, including
different types of road layout and all kinds of signposting, many of which are supported by
telematics. In some cases, this may lead to an excessive workload imposed on the driver.
This workload may include striving to read a VMS (variable message sign), while seeking
the correct route in an unfamiliar environment (often in a foreign language and even with
unfamiliar signs). It may also include attempts to detect the required, relevant piece of
information from an abundance of information sources (including in-car navigation
system, traffic management and information center or radio announcements, VMS signs,
road signs, ADAS [advanced driver assistance systems] messages, etc.). 80

633. The most important quality of a self-explaining road is its ability to communicate
to the road users what behavior they should adopt in certain traffic conditions. For
example, it is imperious for a road environment to suggest a low speed for a driver in a
resident area, with many vulnerable road users, by using traffic calming measures.


8.2.4    Forgiving roads

634. A forgiving road 81 is defined as a road that is designed and built in such a way as
to counteract or prevent driving errors and to avoid or mitigate the negative
consequences of such. Forgiving road environments can be considered a basic tool to
prevent or mitigate an important percentage of road accidents related to driving errors.
More specifically, statistics show that about 25%-30% of fatal accidents involve crashes
with fixed roadside objects. Those accidents are mainly caused by driving errors, leading
to departure from the road. The existence of a forgiving road environment would prevent
accidents of this type (and generally accidents that involve driving errors) or, at least,
reduce the seriousness of the consequences of an accident.

635.     The main elements to design a forgiving road are:
     •   The clear zone, which is a key safety concept used in road design. It represents the
         area that begins at the edge of each travelled lane and is available for emergency
         use by errant vehicles that run off the road. This zone includes any adjoining
         lane/s, road shoulders, verges and batters.
     •   New drainage systems that can cope with the expected amount of rainfall yet do
         not create unsafe conditions for traffic users, for example permeable drainage
         systems, nu concrete.
     •   Frangible poles, specially designed to break away on impact and to reduce the
         severity of potential injuries; they consist in a main mast, designed for heights of
         up to 15 m. The base is made up of two plates joined by three evenly-spaced
         screw bolts. These plates and bolts break away on impact, in order to allow the
         pole mast to collapse at the base for minimum impact on the vehicle.
     •   Shock-absorbing poles ensure adequate safety on impact at low speeds (e.g. less
         than 80 km/h). They are particularly suitable on low-speed roads and/or
         pedestrian-intensive areas. The shock absorbing poles differ from frangible poles
         by staying attached to the supporting structure and absorbing the entire impact
         energy. The deformation of the pole is controlled by the designed weakening of
         the pole mast in the lower 4 m part from the total 5 m length.
     •   Safe barriers with shock absorbers.
     •   Shoulder rumble strips have been proven a low cost and extremely effective
         treatment in reducing single vehicle run-off-road crashes and their severity.

8.2.5     Complete streets

636. A complete street82 is designed and built not only for vehicles, but for all types of
road users. It is very important to create an infrastructure with proper means of
transportation for pedestrians, such as sidewalks, crosswalks - including median crossing
islands and raised crosswalks, accessible pedestrian signals - including audible cues for
people with low vision and pushbuttons reachable by wheelchair users, and sidewalk
bulb-outs; traffic calming measures to lower driving speeds and define the edges of car
travel ways; bicycle accommodations, such as dedicated bicycle lanes or wide shoulders;
mass transit accommodations, such as bus pullouts.

637. Planning and designing roads to make them safer for all users and more inviting
to pedestrians, bicyclists, and transit users can increase overall capacity and efficiency
without a negative impact on automobile travel. For example, improving intersections
for pedestrian safety can reduce the time needed for a pedestrian crossing signal phase,
keeping vehicular traffic flowing. Complete streets improve access to public transportation
and assist transit vehicles in moving efficiently along the road, making it an attractive and
viable option to more people. Increasingly popular are the use of bus rapid transit and bus
priority signal systems, which allow buses to extend green lights and shorten red lights.


8.2.6     Technologies for sustainable roads

638. Better integration of infrastructure in its surroundings is rather a matter of
willingness to give natural habitats a chance to survive than a lack of road engineering
solutions. Proper design and modelling of the verges and the creation of barrier-free
ecological areas using eco ducts are examples of ecological engineering that can already
be found in some European countries. Local circumstances and demands will ultimately
determine the best solutions.

639. Green design solutions for roads have started to be implemented in developed
countries. A good example is represented by the permeable drainage systems, which are
commonly used in the proximity of roads, following the idea that they will be more dry
than wet, even in areas with heavy rain. If the side of the trench is porous, evaporation is
faster, and not just for the water seeped through the sides of the trench in the ground,
but for any other type of infiltration. This is also a sensible ecological measure and it is
called “shallow green ditches.” It has been discovered that most of the critical pollutions
of the water from the road, such as oil and petrol will be destroyed by soil bacteria. For
the case in which the water permeability of the soil is low, a subsurface piped solution is
recommended.

640. At present, the international focus is on improving mechanization in road
superstructure works and on introducing new and advanced technologies with greater
economic efficiency, in order to ensure rational use of resources. Increasing traffic
volumes, increased axle load, and increased tire pressure on the European road network
have led to the need for stronger and more durable infrastructure, while also ensuring

reduced downtime due to traffic maintenance and rehabilitation. For this, at the European
level the following trends may be observed: 83
       •   Large scale use of polymer modified bitumen and additives;
       •   Recycling both asphalt mixtures and cement concrete road. Recycling makes its
           presence felt increasingly in the construction and rehabilitation of roads, helping
           optimize the use of natural resources, the introduction into the market of
           unsuitable materials called “waste,” and contributing to the development of
           performant materials with high durability;
       •   In terms of cement concrete road, the new worldwide trend is the use of precast
           cement concrete pavements, continuous armed pavements, and cement concrete
           road rehabilitation for roads with asphalt mixtures as wearing layer;
       •   Recently, cold recycling raised high interest for construction and maintenance
           using various technologies such as foamed bitumen, bitumen emulsion or cement,
           with beneficial effects in terms of reducing emissions and energy consumption.
       •   Technologies that reduce the temperature of mixing and placing asphalt mixtures
           - the concept of low-temperature asphalt ("warm mix" or “cold mix”);
       •   The road network occupies a large area with a high potential for energy
           production. Thus, currently, new technologies for the use of this energy through
           various systems are developed – e.g., piezoelectric, sewer pipe networks that
           absorb heat during the summer, which will be returned to fight icing during
           winter.
       •   Use of photo-catalytic paving slabs, especially in urban areas. They are made of
           materials designed to minimize air pollution. Laboratory testing showed higher
           effectiveness in reducing the NOx concentration in air, these slabs being
           increasingly used in Belgium, United Kingdom, Italy, Japan and France.

641. The efforts toward saving natural resources must be extended to saving energy.
Handling of thousands of tons of building materials is a very energy consuming business
for road construction. Nevertheless, important savings can be made by focusing more on

the treatment of these materials on site and in plants. Hot asphalt mixes are the main
components of pavement constructions. The development of high quality low
temperature binders and mixes produces substantial savings in energy and production
costs. In this context and in view of the increasing scarcity of natural oil, the development
of so-called Bbo-binders (binder burn out) is a potential option.

642. In case of local roads, such as current communal or rural dirt roads, the existing
gravel can be used provided it has the appropriate features of a subbase layer, or can be
otherwise treated to become a shape layer capable to withstand traffic and
environments loads. This requires the use of additional materials such as hydraulic
binders (both cement and hydraulic road binders), bitumen emulsions, foamed bitumen or
environmentally-friendly enzymes, all of them with the role of securing a layer capable to
withstand higher vertical loads than the current gravel layer. These new, innovative
methods can yield thinner road structures which are able to withstand similar loads as
regular road structures.


8.2.7   Recycling

643.     Utilization as much as possible of local materials in order to minimize costs of
transportation from remote areas. Thus, the initial assessment of the existing road
infrastructure is of particular importance, and the existing road structure materials should
be used based on reliable technical and economic studies. In case of roads with an existing
structure but which are either very degraded or obsolete in terms of load-carrying
capacity, the following recycling techniques may be reliably used: hot recycling in the
asphalt mixing plant, in-place hot recycling, in-place cold recycling, and full recycling of the
road structure.

644. Asphalt recycling reduces the amount of virgin aggregate and liquid asphalt
used, and mitigates the cost, logistics, and environmental impact of trucking this
material to the paving site. It can quickly fix deteriorating pavements, including problems
in the subgrade. Using asphalt recycling, the new road is often built better than the
original. The final wearing course can be something as minimal as a chip seal or as sturdy
as a full layer of hot mix asphalt. Asphalt recycling can also be used to expand lane widths
or shoulders.

645.     The hot recycling technology for bitumen road pavements may be applied in the
following variants:
         a) by cold grinding of the existing bituminous layers, followed by proper recycling
by hot mixing of the milled mixture with the additives in a mobile dryer-mixer plant;
         b) by infrared heating (radiant panels) of the existing bituminous layers, followed
by scarifying and mixing the hot asphalt mixture with additives, either directly on the base
or in a vat or mixer above the base.

646.     In-place hot recycling is a method for the rehabilitation of degraded road
pavements. This operation is entirely carried out in-place, by means of a machine
assembly (recycling train) and begins by the application of heat to “soften” the road
surface. The softened asphalt material is removed by grinding devices, and subsequently
mixed with or without the addition of recycling agents. The recycled asphalt mixture is
then laid along the road and compacted to complete the recycling process. Although this
recycling method is 100% effective, certain remixing options such as the addition of new
hot asphalt mixture or new mineral aggregates may be required for the structural
correction and improvement of the geometrical features of the road.

647.     The full recycling of the road structure is a cold technological process which
consists in grinding the entire road structure and mixing it with in -place additive
binders, a material which will serve as the base for the future road structure. The usual
additive binders are bitumen emulsion, foamed bitumen, power plant ash and lime.

648.    Using this technology saves power, mitigates the aggregate transportation costs
and construction waste and preserves natural non-renewable resources such as bitumen
or new aggregates. The recycling of asphalt mixtures creates an optimum usage cycle for
the natural resources and supports the asphalt producing industry.

649.     Types of recycling-suitable materials in road construction works:
        Slags : The first experiences in using slags as an aggregate in asphalt mixtures
          dates back to 1969, when an experimental road section was built in Toronto. For

           this road section, steel furnace slag was used as an aggregate in both the base
           course layer and the wearing layer. The asphalt mixtures reviewed showed very
           good results in terms of load-carrying capacity, resistance to external factors and
           durability. 86
         Crumb rubber: Crumb rubber modified bitumen is a mixture of hot bitumen and
           ground rubber from waste or scrap tires. It is widely used in the transportation
           sector in both Europe and the United States. As far as noise is concerned, the
           Rubber Pavements Association (RPA) declared that the addition of rubber in
           asphalt mixtures cuts noise levels by up to 50%.
         Glass : Currently, up to 10% glass can be used instead of aggregates for base
           course layers in the US. The maximum glass size must be 4.75 mm for safety
           reasons, but also since coarse-grained glass surfaces will not have the required
           granularity. The best results were achieved with a glass content of at least 10% of
           the total weight and a glass size less than 6 mm.
         Plastic: UK-based studies on asphalt mixtures containing recycled plastic,
           particularly low-density polyethylene (LDPE), which replace approximately 30%
           of the 2.36 - 5 mm diameter aggregates, showed benefits such as increased
           Mashall stability and tensile strength. The most significant advantage is that the
           production process does not require any alteration of the current LDPE-asphalt
           mixture mixing plants. 87
         Crushed concrete: The American Concrete Pavement Association estimates that
           approximately 322 kilometers of cement concrete roads are recycled each year,
           and that approximately 1750 tons of crushed concrete can be recovered from 1
           km of cement concrete road with a 25 mm average thickness. This means that
           2.6 million tons of concrete are recycled each year in the United States. Concrete
           from roads, sidewalks, buildings and other sources can be crushed for reuse.
           Before crushing, the concrete should be stripped of reinforcements or other
           enclosed materials. Concrete crushing produces hard granular aggregates made
           of inert minerals, such as sand, gravel or crushed stone. Due to cement plaster
           bonding on the concrete aggregates, the aggregates resulting from the crushing
           of concrete are hard textured, have an apparent low density, and their water
           absorption exceeds that of similar sized natural aggregates.


         Water and wastewater infrastructure

8.2.8     Control Systems and water management technology

650. All potable water systems will have a certain quantity of water that is not paid.
A well run utility will keep the level in the low teens. The best utilities will achieve around
3 percent. Ideally, each consumer should have a water meter. The meter readings shall be
the basis for payment for water. Romania has not yet achieved this level and water is
often paid for on another basis such as pro rata – depending, for example, on the number

of inhabitants. Many apartment buildings in Romania have water supplies entering in two
or three locations meaning that more than one water meter may be required per
property. More than 90% of the apartment buildings have about four water meters,
including two for cold water and two for hot water. Since 1990, practically all buildings
have been provided with individual water meters. In order to lower the reading costs, the
water companies have started to use water meters with electronic distance reading.
However, the installation cost may be too high for old buildings, and in any case incentives
must be in place for users to comply with any meter installation policy.

651. Water quality must be monitored on a continuous basis, because problems will
only be detected with regular sampling. Sampling and analyses should be undertaken at
the well, at the intake, where water exits the waterworks, and throughout the distribution
system. Fortunately, various modern methods, sensors, and measurement equipment
have made it quicker and less costly for utilities to monitor water quality throughout the
process, thereby detecting irregularities in both treatment and supply. Sensors can be
given online links to management systems that ensure alarms and data capture regarding
process irregularities.

652. The longer the water remains in the pipeline, the poorer the quality of the water
reaching the customers. Hydraulic models are used to optimize the quality of the drinking
water when it reaches consumers by calculating the age of the water in the network. In
order to establish a functional hydraulic distribution network model, reliable data about
pipeline locations and dimensions is necessary. Further data or estimates about consumer
demands around the distribution network are also required. The more accurate the
information about consumption and time-dependent demand variations for each supply
zone, the more advanced the model simulation of the distribution network that can be
established.

653. Ensuring constant pressure throughout the distribution network is one of the
most important aspects that could benefit from advanced technology, tools, and
designs. Any pressure drop will not only affect the pressure at the tap, but also involve a
huge risk that contamination will be sucked into the distribution network. This is often the
case in the event of a fire, because in many cities firefighting is based on the use of fire
hydrants using water taken from the distribution network. The optimum starting point to
solve this is also with hydraulic models combined with GIS systems, which provide a great
platform for decision-making regarding the distribution network design and rehabilitation.
Real-time modeling may then provide information for daily operation and management of
pressure in the drinking water network — and be even more effective when combined
with pressure sensors installed in the distribution system.

8.2.9   Wastewater management

654. Numerous processes can be used to clean up wastewaters depending on the
type and extent of contamination. There are two basic approaches: to use the waste in
the water as a resource (such as constructed wetlands) or strictly as pollution (such as the
majority of today's treatment plants). Most wastewater is treated in industrial-scale




                                                                                               183
energy intensive wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), which include physical, chemical,
and biological treatment processes. However, the use of septic tanks and other On-Site
Sewage Facilities (OSSF) is widespread in rural areas, serving up to 20 percent of the
homes in the U.S. 88

655. The most important aerobic treatment system is the activated sludge process,
based on the maintenance and recirculation of a complex biomass composed by
microorganisms able to absorb and adsorb the organic matter carried in wastewater.
Anaerobic wastewater treatment processes (UASB, EGSB) are also widely applied in the
treatment of industrial wastewaters and biological sludge. Some wastewater may be
highly treated and reused as reclaimed water. Wastewaters ecological approaches using
reed bed systems such as constructed wetlands are being increasingly used. Tertiary
treatment is increasingly applied and most common technologies are microfiltration or
synthetic membranes. After membrane filtration, the treated wastewater is
indistinguishable from waters of natural origin of drinking quality (without its
minerals). Nitrates can be removed from wastewater by natural processes in wetlands but
also via intensive microbial denitrification, for which a small amount of methanol is
typically added to provide the bacteria with a source of carbon. Ozone wastewater
treatment is becoming more popular and requires the use of an ozone generator that
decontaminates the water as ozone bubbles percolate through the tank. The solution is,
however, energy intensive. Latest and very promising treatment technology is aerobic
granulation.

656. Dewatered sludge can be dried to lower moisture contents by various processes
termed sludge drying . For transportation, sludge benefits from being as dry as possible
and a cost balance must always be made between transport costs and drying costs. For
use of sludge as a fuel, dry solids mater must generally exceed 50%. Wastewater sludge
can be mixed with the purifiable elements of domestic waste to make a so-called
“compost-like” output that can be used for soil e nhancement. Prior to 2008, available
disposal solutions for wastewater sludge included incineration, and sludge was used as an
agricultural fertilizer and disposed to landfills. However, since 2008, following
amendments to the landfill, the option to dispose of sludge into landfill is no longer
allowed. While Romania is still considering the use of wastewater sludge in agriculture,
the other Western European countries are moving towards incineration as a prime
disposal process. The disposal of sludge to agricultural land is prohibited in certain nitrate
sensitive regions and requires considerable storage areas because there is only a narrow
window of time when soil and crop conditions are amenable to receive sludge.

657. Another optimizing action is enhancing treatment processes with
microorganisms. Specialized microorganisms can positively affect solids management and
odor control in wastewater treatment operations. It is also possible to degrade specific
substances with specialized microorganisms to lower substance levels in the plant
effluent. In sludge and biomass treatment, adding actively growing, specialized microbial
strains enhance the response of the biomass to process fluctuations or to degradation of

certain components. Bio-augmentation, as it is called, offers many advantages over
traditional technology platforms such as chemicals and has for years proven its
effectiveness at degrading organic compounds. Other technologies can also improve
effluent quality, but those technologies are often much more expensive and more difficult
to handle.

658. The aeration process in biological wastewater treatment normally takes up
more than half of the total energy demand of the plant and increasing the efficiency will
have a high impact on total operating costs. Generally, surface-aerated basins do not
achieve the same energy performance as diffused bottom aeration. Taking it one step
further, supplying the exact amount of clean air required in the process with optimized
aeration technology makes it possible to achieve gr eat savings. Analyzing a plant’s current
set-up and an alternative configuration calculated by aeration experts will make it possible
to estimate potential savings.

659. A new trend is coupled control. Nowadays most of the developed countries’
wastewater treatment plants have online measurement equipment for optimization of
biological processes and plant hydraulics. Now this technology also emerges for the
optimization of sewer systems to avoid massive investments in large retention basins or
increase of sewer network capacity. Online monitoring instruments such as flow meters,
sewage level loggers, and precipitation gauges combined with weather radar at regional
and local levels in advanced storm water drainage and treatment models are now the new
trend for coupled control of drainage system and wastewater treatment plants.

660. Intelligent regulation, control, and coordination in the management of drainage
systems and wastewater treatment plants may be the first defense against floods and
sewer overflows for cities facing higher risks of extreme weather with heavy rainfall,
saving them from new massive investments in climate adaptation. Intelligent
wastewater management is primarily a solution for cities of a certain size and with
combined sewer systems that require special operational rules during heavy rainfall to
avoid hydraulic overload and resulting discharge of untreated wastewater. Integrated
solutions are the new trend to connect the wastewater treatment plant with a drainage
model and get a coherent model for the entire wastewater system. Advanced technology
such as sensors, flow meters, and intelligent software ensure that the capacities of sewer
pipes are maximized. This means that rather than blindly expanding the capacity of the
sewer system to cope with heavy rainfalls, the intelligent system sends the water where
there is room for it.

661. Many countries also use the decentralized treatment for wastewater that is not
discharged to a municipal treatment plant. These solutions are applied mainly in rural
areas, but may also include relatively large areas, such as university campuses or industrial
parks with their own treatment plants. Decentral wastewater treatment thus takes place
at widely different scales from clusters within a mega-city to scattered individual
households in rural areas. The rapid urban growth in many developing countries makes
decentralist solutions attractive in order to maintain a manageable size of sewer
networks, which can be make use of the topography for gravity drainage and avoid
escalating pumping costs. The cluster approach is also attractive in cities with large




                                                                                                185
differences in service levels between the urban center and surrounding shantytowns or
satellite cities as a gradual upgrading of water supply and sanitation can be achieved via
local collection and decentral treatment of wastewater. Still it is important to be aware
that wastewater treatment plants located within cities are difficult to manage due to risk
of foul smell from the treatment basins and the heavy transport required for disposal of
sludge.

662. If treated properly, wastewater can be reused as drinking water in industry
(cooling towers), in artificial recharge of aquifers, in agriculture, and in the rehabilitation
of natural ecosystems. There are numerous benefits to using recycled water for irrigation,
including the low cost, consistency of supply (regardless of season, climatic conditions and
associated water restrictions), and general consistency of quality. Irrigation of recycled
wastewater is also considered as a means for plant fertilization and particularly nutrient
supplementation. Furthermore, organic content can be used for energy production when
concentrated in sludge. Phosphorus can be extracted from the wastewater or sludge and
applied as fertilizer replacing mineral phosphorus, which rapidly is becoming an
increasingly scarce resource. Energy wise, excess heat can be withdrawn for production of
heat and electricity and the remaining mineral and organic content in the sludge can be
used as soil conditioner or as additional fertilizer.


8.2.10 New materials

663. There are two families of materials available for water pipework systems:
metallic and non-metallic. Of these, the most commonly used materials for drinking-
water supply piping are galvanized steel or iron, copper, polybutylene, unplasticized
polyvinylchloride (PVC), chlorinated polyvinylchloride (CPVC), and polyethylene (PE).
Metal alloys, which far exceed the performance specifications of their respective parent
materials, are also widely used. New materials and construction technologies are
continually developed for the building industry and the plumbing industry. Without some
form of control at the respective levels within the plumbing and building industries, it
would be easy for unscrupulous manufacturers to use inferior materials to the detriment
of installers and end-users. This can ultimately damage the environment and the health of
the community and lead to greater costs later when systems fail prematurely.

664. Copper tubing is extremely flexible in the hands of a competent installer and
smaller in overall diameter than the equivalent galvanized steel pipes and fittings.
Corrosion can be a problem, though usually to a lesser degree than with galvanized steel;
care must be exercised to avoid contact with dissimilar metals. Copper tubing, due to its
thinner wall section, is relatively light to handle and is available in coil form or straight
lengths as required.

665. Chlorinated polyvinylchloride is widely used in water and sanitary systems for
hot and cold-water distribution. It is a thermoplastic produced by polymerization of vinyl
chloride, with additional chlorination. It offers much better resistance to corrosion and
has a high tolerance to acids. It is fire resistant, though toxic fumes are emitted when it is
burned.




                                                                                                  186
666. Unplasticized polyvinylchloride PVC, when used with a solvent cement jointing
system, is comparable in bulk to galvanized steel or iron for drinking-water piping, but
much lighter. It does not suffer the same corrosion problems internally or externally as
galvanized steel. However, it is susceptible to physical damage if exposed above ground
and it becomes brittle when exposed to ultraviolet light. The pipe is light to handle, but it
is too bulky for aesthetically acceptable internal use in domestic buildings.

667. Polyethylene (PE) pipes and fittings of numerous types and designs have been
available for over forty years. The market requirements today have been refined to three
general groupings, as follows:
    •    High-density PE is available in a post-manufactured stress-relieved state (best
         practice PE), or as extruded product with no treatment; it is used mainly for
         drainage applications where it can withstand higher temperature discharges than
         PVC;
    •    Medium-density PE is more flexible than the high-density pipe. It has a slightly
         thinner wall thickness and is capable of withstanding higher internal pressure; it is
         the preferred material for long-distance drinking-water piping;
    •    Low-density PE is suitable for the irrigation industry, where operating pressures
         are very low and a high degree of flexibility and low cost is required; low-density
         PE pipe and fittings are not acceptable for use for connection to the water mains
         in many countries because of the low pressure rating of the material and its high
         leakage rate.

668. Fiberglass pipe also referred to as Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic (FRP), Glass
Reinforced Plastic (GRP), and Reinforced Thermosetting Resin Pipe (RTRP), is one of the
latest trends regarding water and wastewater systems materials. FRP Pipe resistance to
corrosive chemical environments and cost effectiveness has proven its ability to replace
carbon steel and stainless steel pipe at a lower overall cost. Their main qualities are Light
weight, Strength to weight ratio, Dimensional Stability, Electrical properties - Standard
fiberglass pipe is nonconductive.

669. Glass reinforced resin pipe is one of the strongest piping material by weight in
use today. Most of these piping products are made by using filament winding or
centrifugal casting techniques. Varying conditions of service has resulted in the use of
three major FRP piping resins: epoxy, polyester, and vinyl ester. Like most plastic piping
systems, FRP is durable, safe and easy to install. In addition, it is very cost competitive
when compared to many metal-alloy piping systems. Most FRP piping has both internal
and external chemical resistant barriers.

        Social infrastructure

8.2.11 Safe and accessible buildings

670. All public buildings, such as those that are part of social infrastructure, must be
accessible and easily used by disabled people. A noticeable change in some parts of the




                                                                                                 187
world is the installation of elevators, automatic doors, wide doors and corridors,
transit lifts, wheelchair ramps, curb cuts, and the elimination of unnecessary steps where
ramps and elevators are not available, allowing people in wheelchairs and with other
mobility impairments to use public sidewalks and public transit more easily and more
safely.

671. Fire safety measures include those that are intended to prevent ignition of an
uncontrolled fire, and those that are used to limit the development and effects of a fire
after it starts. Fire safety measures include those that are planned during
the construction of a building or implemented in structures that are already standing. The
technical design documentations of a building that is part of the social infrastructure must
specify the fire risk (including smoke control) and the protection systems of the rooms,
spaces and departments for the whole building.


8.2.12 Sustainable buildings

672. Energy efficiency is the first step toward achieving sustainability in buildings.
Energy efficiency helps control rising energy costs, reduces environmental footprints, and
increases the value and competitiveness of buildings. Mostly, energy losses in social
buildings are due to inadequate state of the building envelope, including walls, floors,
roofs, doors and windows. Therefore, any social building older than 20 years is poorly
insulated, needs thermal rehabilitation, in order to save about 50% of energy
consumption and support achieving thermal comfort in winter and in summer. The most
commonly used materials for social infrastructure buildings with thermal insulation can be
classified as:
    • Vegetable: cork, fiber (chips) of wood, flax, straw, etc.
    • Mineral: fiberglass, mineral wool, expanded clay, glass foam, etc.
    • Synthetic materials: expanded polystyrene, polyurethane and phenolic foam, etc.

673. Recycling provides the opportunity to reduce the embodied energy by using
recycled materials and reusable/recyclable materials/components. The recycling
potential is between 35% and 40% of the embodied energy of a building, which represents
around 45% of the total energy needed. 89

674. As an integral part of innovative and efficient design as well as to meet the
future EU requirements for nearly zero energy buildings, a comprehensive approach is
necessary to be taken, in order to utilize the benefits and facilities provided by building
controls and management systems. Numerous computerized systems already exist on the
market but it is advisable for designers to take a comprehensive approach and to integrate
fully the building envelope construction and performance with the solar energy collectors,
heating methods, insulation, temperature control, building shading, ventilation, lighting,
metering, water supply, drainage, and waste.

675. Energy efficiency can be improved in different ways. For existing social
infrastructure buildings in Romania, especially for education and health facilities, thermal
rehabilitation may be accomplished by replacement of heating system (from stoves to
thermal plants), thermal insulation of the building (walls, roof and basement), new
entrance doors, efficient new lighting system and rehabilitation of internal installations.

676. Solar energy, in particular by direct conversion of solar energy into electricity,
can be considered the most common type of renewable energy for buildings that are
part of the social infrastructure. Photovoltaic – PV - systems require light and not
necessarily direct sunlight in order to generate electricity. PV systems can be installed on
roofs or facades, thus contributing to reducing energy consumption in those buildings.
They do not produce pollutants and can be integrated in various aesthetic solutions.

8.2.13 Building Information Modelling (BIM)

677. Building Information Modelling and 3D modelling involves the creation and
management of digital representations of physical and functional characteristics for
designed elements and forms. BIM software is used by businesses and government
agencies to plan, design, construct, operate and maintain physical infrastructure ranging
from water and wastewater treatment plant, refuse disposal, electricity and gas supply
services, communications utilities through to roads, bridges, housing and schools. At the
beginning of a project and during the whole life cycle BIM facilitates predictability of
outcome as well as options for change and modification in good time to allow the most
effective decisions to be made often on a “just in time” basis.

678. The use of BIM goes beyond the planning and design phases. It extends through
all stages and supporting processes of cost management and facilities operations. In a
number of EU countries there is an objective to harmonize BIM standards to improve
inter- operability and cooperation.


8.2.14 New green building materials

679. For social infrastructure, there are many building materials typically considered
‘green’. These include lumber from forests that have been certified to a third-party forest
standard, rapidly renewable plant materials like bamboo and straw, dimension stone,
recycled stone, recycled metal, and other products that are non-toxic, reusable,
renewable, and/or recyclable. For concrete a high performance or Roman self-healing
concrete is available. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) also suggests using
recycled industrial goods, such as coal combustion products, foundry sand, and demolition
debris in construction projects.

680.    Existing buildings are subject to structural assessment before deciding whether
they should be demolished or rehabilitated. The seismic risk category depends primarily
on the construction timeframe, as described in the Figure 36.




                                                                                               189

681. The structural rehabilitation solution will be established based on the state of
degradation of the building (seismic risk category), the structural system (frames, walls,
mixed), the building materials used (reinforced concrete, steel, masonry, wood, etc.)
and the Importance-exposure class. Some of these methods are described below.

682. The reinforced plaster shotcreting and reinforced concrete lining methods are
suitable for brick and reinforced concrete buildings. They consist in the total or partial
jacketing of the structural elements (pillars, girders, reinforced concrete or brickwork
walls) with a layer of concrete reinforced with steel bars. This method increases the load-
bearing capacity of the structural elements and improves the overall quality of the
building.

                                               (right)




683.    The carbon fiber or glass fiber lining is similar to the above, the difference being
that carbon fiber or glass fiber is used instead of reinforced concrete as lining material.

684. The use of reinforced walls or steel bracing consists in the insertion of structural
strengthening elements. This method is suitable for reinforced concrete or steel frame
buildings. Thus, the hollow frames may be fitted with reinforced concrete walls or steel
bracing. This increases the overall stiffness and stability of the building.

685. The fitting of exterior reinforced concrete or steel frames has the advantage of
being carried out mainly on the outside of the building, thus avoiding any disruption of
the normal activities indoors. The works consist in building an outside frame connected
to the supporting structure of the building. It improves the overall stiffness and stability of
the building.

steel braced frames on the outside of an existing building – the Emergency Hospital of Slobozia

686. In this case, buildings are earthquake-protected by the fitting of elastic
neoprene dampers between the building foundation and the superstructure. Thus, the
building is isolated from its substructure and the effects of potential seismic action on the
building are mitigated. This method is suitable for all structural systems. It is particularly
suited to highly important buildings which are critical in post-earthquake situations, such
as hospitals, emergency centers, buildings that house sensitive equipment such as nuclear
power plants, IT or telecommunication centers. Furthermore, it represents an ideal
solution for heritage buildings, which cannot be subject to works that would alter their
architectural features.

   documentation


1. Type of documentation & annexes
      Roads: Choose carefully between the feasibility study (FS) and the DALI. For modernization works
        of existing infrastructure, always pick the DALI
      Water and wastewater: For new projects aimed at building new infrastructure, the FS is required.
        For existing/ongoing projects (with new investment components), the SF and the technical
        expertise shall be submitted. For modernization of current infrastructure the DALI shall be
        prepared
      Update specialty studies and technical expertise studies
      Include the geotechnical study with proper seal of approval (“verificat la cerința Af”)
      If the detailed technical design is available and is submitted, also include the FS / DALI. Also
        include the project verifiers’ notes and expertise, for each specialty
      Include all documents needed to prove/establi sh ownership of new/modernized infrastructure
      Include the “urbanism certificate” with all corresponding permits required *
2. Content of documentation
     Make sure that the description of the need and opportunity for the investment fulfils the
        requirements of GD 28/2008;
     Include information of how the project correlates/fits under local/regional/national strategies in
        the relevant sector;
     Develop the cost-benefit analysis in accordance with the EU Guide (as part of FS and only for those
        applications that requi re FS);
     Make explicit the commitment to operate and maintain the project upon completion ;
3. Local/County Council Decision
      Make sure the decision explicitly mentions the co-financing amount;
      Make sure to include in the decision the key technical-economic indicators;
4. Budget
     Check that respective expenses are within the GD 363/2010 limits on cost standards;
     Include sources of financing along with the overall budget (“deviz general”).
*Note: The urbanism certificate should not be released by the relevant authority without the
permits/approvals required for the construction permit (requires amendment to Law 50/1991). All
investments in the power distribution sector shall be supported by the beneficiary of the works subject to
the urbanism certificate, with 6-month or even 1-year prior notification to the power distributor.

Annex 5: Maintenance costs



County roads require maintenance works during operation. In many cases, the necessary works far exceed the budget assigned. In most cases, the necessary
works exceed the annual amount allocated by the County Councils. For example, in 2015, in the Sibiu County, for the entire network of county roads
(906,794 km), a routine maintenance cost of about 3,277.72 EUR / km is estimated, almost half of what was estimated in the STUDY ON ROAD
FINANCING, CLASSIFICATION AND MANAGEMENT prepared for the Rural Development Project in Romania in 2005 (7,716 EUR / km). 90 The same is true
for Bistrita Nasaud, with a 754 km network of county roads and a maintenance cost of 2,210 EUR / km, for Constanta – with 889 km of county roads and a
maintenance cost per unit of 446 EUR / km, for Dolj – 1,096 km of county roads and a cost of 2,433 EUR / km, and for Ialomita – with 507 km of county
roads and 1,797 EUR / km.
