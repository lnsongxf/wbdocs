2   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
I.    Overview
This document should be read together with the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development’s (IBRD)
Financial Statements and Management’s Discussion and Analysis (MD&A) for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015
(FY15). IBRD undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statements. Box 1 provides IBRD’s selected
financial data as of, and for the three months ended, September 30, 2015 and 2014, as well as for the fiscal year
ended June 30, 2015.
Business Model
IBRD, an international organization owned by its 188 member countries, is the largest multilateral development
bank in the world and is one of the five institutions of the World Bank Group (WBG); the others are the
International Development Association (IDA), the International Finance Corporation (IFC), the Multilateral
Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA), and the International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (ICSID).
Each of these organizations is legally and financially independent, with separate assets and liabilities. IBRD is not
liable for their respective obligations. The WBG’s two goals, to be achieved by 2030, are to end extreme poverty by
reducing the percentage of people living on less than $1.90 per day to no more than 3% globally, and to promote
shared prosperity in a sustainable manner by fostering income growth for the bottom 40% of the population in every
developing country. In October 2015, the WBG raised its poverty line figure upwards, from $1.25 to $1.90 a day, to
reflect the increase in prices worldwide based on updated purchasing-power-parity data.
IBRD provides loans, guarantees, and knowledge for development focused projects and programs to middle-income
and creditworthy lower-income member countries. Its main business activity is extending loans to its eligible
member countries. IBRD offers its borrowers long-term loans that can have a final maturity of up to 35 years.
Borrowers may customize their repayment terms to meet their debt management or project needs. Loans are offered
on both fixed and variable terms, and in multiple currencies; though borrowers have generally preferred loans in U.S
dollars and euros. IBRD also provides access to risk management tools such as derivative instruments, including
currency and interest rate swaps.
IBRD’s loans are financed through its equity, and from money borrowed in the capital markets. IBRD is rated triple-
A by the major rating agencies and investors view its bonds as high quality securities. IBRD’s funding strategy is
aimed at achieving the best long-term value on a sustainable basis for its borrowing members. Its ability to
intermediate the funds it raises in international capital markets to developing member countries is important in
helping it achieve its goals. IBRD issues its securities both through global offerings and bond issues tailored to the
needs of specific markets or investor types. This is done by offering bonds to investors in various currencies,
maturities, markets, and with fixed and variable terms, often opening up new markets for international investors by
offering new products or bonds in emerging-market currencies. IBRD’s annual funding volumes vary from year to
year. This strategy has enabled IBRD to borrow at favorable market terms and pass the savings on to its borrowing
members. Funds not immediately deployed for lending are held in IBRD’s investment portfolio to supply liquidity
for its operations.
IBRD makes extensive use of derivatives to manage its exposure to various market risks arising from the above
activities. These are used to align the interest and currency composition of its assets (loan and investment trading
portfolios) with that of its liabilities (borrowing portfolio), and to stabilize the earnings on its equity.
Management believes that these risk management strategies, taken together, effectively manage market risk in
IBRD’s operations from an economic perspective. However, these strategies necessarily entail the extensive use of
derivatives, which introduce volatility through unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the reported basis
income statement (particularly given the long-term nature of some of IBRD’s assets and liabilities). Accordingly,
Management makes decisions on income allocation without reference to unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses
in its non-trading portfolios – see Basis of Reporting – Allocable Income below.




                                      IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 3
Basis of Reporting
Financial Statements
IBRD’s financial statements conform with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(U.S. GAAP), referred to in this document as the “reported basis”. All instruments in the investment and borrowing
portfolios and all other derivatives are reported at fair value, with changes in fair value reported in the statement of
income. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, except for loans with embedded derivatives, which are
reported at fair value. Management uses the reported net income as the basis for deriving allocable income.
Fair Value Results
In an attempt to address the asymmetry in the reported financial statements, in which not all financial instruments
are reported on the same measurement basis, IBRD reflects all financial instruments at fair value in the MD&A. The
fair value of these instruments is affected by changes in such market variables as interest rates, exchange rates, and
credit risk. Management uses fair value to assess the performance of the investment-trading portfolio; to manage
certain market risks, including interest rate risk and commercial counterparty credit risk; and to monitor the results
of the Equity Management Framework (EMF).
Allocable Income
The volatility in IBRD’s reported net income is primarily driven by the unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses
on the derivative instruments in IBRD’s non-trading portfolios (loans, borrowings, and EMF). These derivatives are
primarily used to align the interest rate and currency bases of its assets and liabilities. In line with IBRD’s financial
risk management policies, IBRD expects to maintain its non-trading portfolio positions. As a result, for non-trading
portfolios, allocable income only includes amounts which have been realized. For trading portfolios (investment
portfolio), allocable income includes both realized amounts, as well as unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses.
Management has consistently followed this practice of excluding unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on its
non-trading portfolios from reported net income to arrive at allocable income, since adopting Financial Accounting
Standards Board’s (FASB’s) guidance on derivatives and hedging in FY01. Accordingly, in years in which reported
net income has been positively impacted by unrealized mark-to-market gains on the non-trading portfolios, IBRD
did not take these unrealized mark-to-market gains into account in making income allocation decisions. Likewise, in
the case of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the non-trading portfolios, IBRD consistently excludes these
amounts from reported net income to arrive at allocable income.
Allocable income also reflects certain other adjustments to reported net income, namely: Board of Governors-
approved and other transfers, pension adjustments, and restricted income. All of these adjustments reflect
Management’s view of the most appropriate measure of a given year’s financial results for allocation purposes
(Table 2). See June 30, 2015, MD&A for a detailed discussion on allocable income.

II.      Financial Performance and Risk Management
As part of IBRD’s lending, borrowing, and investment activities, IBRD is exposed to market, counterparty and
country credit risks. To manage these risks, IBRD has put in place a strong risk management framework, which
supports Management in its oversight functions. This framework is designed to enable and support IBRD in
achieving its goals in a financially sustainable manner.
In an effort to maximize IBRD’s capacity to lend to member countries for development purposes, IBRD limits its
exposure to market and counterparty credit risks. Among the various types of market risks, interest rate risk is the
most significant risk faced by IBRD. IBRD’s exposure to currency and liquidity risks is minimal as a result of its
risk management policies. In addition, IBRD faces two types of credit risk: country credit risk and counterparty
credit risk.

is aligned with the financial risk associated with its loan
portfolio as well as other exposures over a medium-term
capital-planning horizon. Under this framework, IBRD
evaluates its capital adequacy as measured by stress tests and an appropriate Board approved minimum level for the
long term equity-to-loans ratio, currently set at 20%.
As shown on Table 1, IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio decreased from 25.1% at June 30, 2015 to 24.7% at September
30, 2015, and remained above the minimum ratio of 20%. The decrease in the ratio was primarily due to the $5.6
billion increase in net positive loan disbursements. Of this amount, $2.6 billion relates to disbursements on Deferred
Drawdown Options (DDO’s). The decline in effective and undisbursed DDO’s, therefore did not have a net impact
on the total exposure. Under IBRD’s currency management policy, to minimize exchange rate risk in a
multicurrency environment, IBRD matches its borrowing obligations in any one currency (after derivative activities)
with assets in the same currency. In addition, IBRD’s policy is to minimize the exchange rate sensitivity of its
capital adequacy as measured by the equity-to-loans ratio. It implements this policy by periodically undertaking
currency conversions to align the currency composition of its equity with that of its outstanding loans, across major
currencies. As a result, the impact on IBRD’s equity-to-loans ratio from the exchange rate movements during the
year was negligible.

Financial Results
The primary sources of IBRD’s income are the equity contribution and the net interest margin on its loans funded by
borrowings. The main driver of the equity contribution is revenue from the derivatives used as part of the EMF. In
addition to the regular interest earned from the derivative instruments, this revenue, on an allocable income basis,
includes net mark-to-market gains which have been realized during the year as a result of the liquidation of
derivative positions. Additionally, equity contribution includes revenue from the proportion of loans which are
funded by equity and certain minor adjustments including those relating to discontinued loan products. IBRD also
earns revenue from other development activities, as well as the margin on its investment portfolio.
On a reported basis, IBRD had net income of $745 million for the first three months of FY16, compared with a net
loss of $417 million during the same period in FY15. The higher net income during the first three months of FY16
primarily relates to the unrealized mark-to-market gains experienced on the non-trading portfolios (See Table 4). For
the first three months of FY16, IBRD’s allocable income was $29 million, compared with $556 million during the
same period in FY15. The higher allocable income during the first three months of FY15 was primarily due to the
$581 million of gains from the termination of certain EMF positions. In contrast, there were no terminations of
trades during the same period in FY16. The following is a discussion on the key drivers of IBRD’s financial
performance, including a reconciliation between IBRD’s allocable income and reported net income.

6   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
Net Interest Margin
As of September 30, 2015, IBRD’s equity to loans ratio was 24.7%, indicating that approximately 25% of IBRD’s
net loans and other exposures is funded by equity, and the remainder funded by borrowings. For the portion of loans
funded by borrowings, the net interest margin has remained relatively stable compared with the prior year (Table 2).
Net Non-Interest Expenses
As shown on Table 3, IBRD’s net non-interest expenses primarily comprise administrative expenses, net of revenue
from externally funded activities. These expenses have remained stable over the two year period.

Unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses on non-trading portfolios
These mainly comprise unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on IBRD’s loan, borrowing, and EMF
portfolios. Since IBRD expects to maintain its non-trading portfolio positions, unrealized mark-to-market gains and
losses associated with these positions, are excluded from reported net income to arrive at allocable income. As a
result, from a long-term financial sustainability perspective, income allocations are made on the basis of amounts
which have been realized.




                                       IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 7
As shown on Table 4, for the first three months of FY16, $753 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains were
excluded from reported net income to arrive at allocable income ($959 million unrealized mark-to-market losses in
the first three months of FY15). See discussion below for more details.

a. Includes adjustments to reclass net realized mark-to-market gains (losses) to the related interest income and expense lines for
   allocable income purposes.
b. Includes related derivatives.
c. Included in other derivatives on the Balance Sheet.

EMF: During the first three months of FY16, IBRD had unrealized mark-to-market gains of $741 million for the
EMF in its reported net income, primarily as a result of the decline in the U.S. interest rates.
Loan portfolio: On a reported basis, while the derivatives which convert IBRD’s loans to variable rates are reported
at fair value, all loans are reported at amortized cost, with the exception of one loan with an embedded derivative,
which is reported at fair value. As a result, while from an economic perspective, all of IBRD’s loans after the effect
of derivatives carry variable rates, and therefore have a low sensitivity to interest rates, this is not reflected in its
reported net income. For the first three months of FY16, the $497 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the
loan portfolio relate primarily to the impact of the decrease in long-term interest rates during the period on the loan
related derivatives. In order to show the effect of its risk management policies, IBRD reflects its loans at fair value
in the MD&A. See Section III for more details.
Borrowing portfolio: Given that all of the derivatives and the related underlying borrowings are at fair value, there is
no asymmetry in the reported net income, and therefore, unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the
borrowing related derivatives are correspondingly offset by unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on the
underlying borrowings. As a result, since IBRD does not hedge its own credit, the main component of the net
unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses relates to the impact of the change in IBRD’s own credit. See Section III
for more details.

Loan portfolio
As part of its lending activities, consistent with its mandate IBRD has exposure to sovereign (country) credit risk.
Country credit risk reflects potential losses arising from protracted arrears on payments from borrowers on loans and
other exposures. IBRD manages this risk by applying individual country exposure limits. These limits take into
account the creditworthiness and performance of borrowers. In addition, to ensure that the financial risks associated
with its loans and other exposures do not exceed its risk-bearing capacity, IBRD uses a strategic capital adequacy
framework as a key medium-term capital planning tool.
Portfolio Concentration Risk
Portfolio concentration risk, which arises      Figure 3: Country Exposures as of September 30, 2015

IBRD’s exposure to a single borrowing
country is restricted to the lower of an Equitable Access Limit (EAL) and the Single Borrower Limit (SBL). The
SBL effective on September 30, 2015 was $20.0 billion for India and $19.0 billion for the other four SBL-eligible
borrowing countries (Brazil, China, Indonesia, and Mexico), lower than the EAL of $28.1 billion at September 30,
2015.
Provision on Loans and Other Exposures
IBRD records a provision to reflect the probable losses inherent in its loan portfolio and other exposures. As of
September 30, 2015, IBRD had an accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures of $1,657 million,
which was approximately 1% of these exposures, ($1,554 million as of June 30, 2015 - 1% of exposures). As of
September 30, 2015, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to Zimbabwe. (Refer
to Note D: Loans and Other Exposures in the Notes to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements).




                                     IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 9
For the first three months of FY16, there was a charge of $98 million, reflecting an increase in net loan
disbursements and the change in the credit quality of the loan portfolio during the period. This compares with a
charge of $40 million in the same period in FY15, primarily reflecting an increase in net loan disbursements during
the period.
Lending Activities
As of September 30, 2015, IBRD’s net loans outstanding amounted to $160.3 billion,              Figure 4: Net Loans
3% higher than June 30, 2015. The increase was mainly attributable to $5.6 billion in net       Outstanding
positive loan disbursements made in the first three months of FY16.                             In billions of U.S. dollars

In the first three months of FY16, IBRD had new loan commitments (including
guarantees) totaling $6.4 billion, 36% lower than the same period in FY15 (Table 6).            150
Commitments during the first three months of FY15 were exceptionally high due to the

Gross disbursements during the first three months of FY16 were $7.9 billion, 45% above

Investment Portfolio
Funds raised through IBRD’s borrowing activity which have not yet been deployed for lending, are held in IBRD’s
investment portfolio to ensure liquidity for its operations. IBRD restricts its liquid assets to high-quality investments
as its investment objective prioritizes principal protection over yield. Liquid assets are therefore managed
conservatively, and are primarily held for potential disruptions in IBRD’s access to capital markets.
IBRD has operated at levels of liquidity in the range of between 140% and 175% of the prudential minimum. The
prudential minimum liquidity level has been set at $27.5 billion for FY16, and the liquid asset portfolio was at 156%
of this level as of September 30, 2015.
Commercial Counterparty Credit Risk
Commercial counterparty credit risk is managed by applying eligibility criteria, volume limits for transactions with
individual counterparties, and using mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions. The effective




10   IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015
management of this risk is vital to the success of IBRD’s funding, investment, and asset/liability management. The
monitoring and managing of this risk is continuous, given the changing market environment.
As a result of IBRD’s use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap transactions, its residual commercial
counterparty credit risk is concentrated in the investment portfolio. IBRD’s overall commercial counterparty credit
exposure decreased by $1.6 billion during the first three months of FY16, reflecting the impact on the investment
portfolio, of loan disbursements made during the first three months of FY16. As shown on Table 8, the credit
quality of IBRD’s portfolio remains concentrated in the upper end of the credit spectrum, with 70% of the portfolio
rated AA or above and the remaining portfolio primarily rated A. The A rated counterparties primarily consisted of
financial institutions (limited to short-term deposits and swaps) and sovereigns. Most of the BB or lower rated
exposure relates to IBRD’s investment in a debt security issued by the Hypo Alpe-Adria Bank as discussed below.

In FY07, IBRD purchased for $190 million a debt security issued by an Austrian bank, Hypo Alpe-Adria, which was
fully guaranteed by the state of Carinthia. As of September 30, 2015, this debt security had a carrying value of $25
million. The loss in the value of the security is the result of legislation passed in FY14 to cancel the underlying debt.
In July 2015, this legislation was overturned and ruled by the Austrian Constitutional Court as unconstitutional and
the guarantee was reinstated. The investment had a carrying value of $13 million as of June 30, 2015, resulting in
unrealized mark-to-market gains of $12 million during the three month period ended September 30, 2015. IBRD
will continue to monitor the value of this investment and related market developments.

Liquid Asset Portfolio
As of September 30, 2015, the net investment portfolio totaled $44.1 billion (Figure       Figure 5: Liquid Asset
5), with $43.0 billion representing the liquid asset portfolio (see Note C:                Portfolio
Investments to the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). This compares with           In billions of U.S. dollars
an investment portfolio valued at $45.1 billion as at June 30, 2015, with $44.0            50
billion representing the liquid asset portfolio. The $1.0 billion decline in the liquid    40
asset portfolio reflects the impact of loan disbursements made during the first three
                                                                                           30

was primarily due to higher unrealized mark-to-market losses on the portfolio,
partially offset by higher interest income.
Borrowing Portfolio
IBRD issues debt securities to both institutional and retail investors in a variety of     Figure 6: Borrowing
currencies. During the first three months of FY16, IBRD raised medium and long-            Portfolio
term debt of $14.3 billion in 15 currencies.                                               In billions of U.S. dollars

As of September 30, 2015, the borrowing portfolio totaled $168.7 billion, an
increase of $9.9 billion from June 30, 2015 (see Note E: Borrowings in the Notes to        150

the Condensed Quarterly Financial Statements). This increase was mainly due to net
                                                                                           100

Equity Contribution and Equity Management Framework
Under its current interest rate risk management strategy, IBRD seeks to match the interest rate sensitivity of its
assets (loan and investment trading portfolios) with those of its liabilities (borrowing portfolio) by using derivatives,
such as interest rate swaps. These derivatives effectively convert IBRD’s financial assets and liabilities into
variable-rate instruments. This strategy helps IBRD to manage the interest margin on the proportion of loans funded
by debt, against interest rate volatility. The interest revenue on the remaining proportion of loans funded by equity,
if left unmanaged, would be highly sensitive to fluctuations in short-term interest rates. To manage this exposure,
IBRD uses an EMF, which seeks to manage the sensitivity of IBRD’s revenue from loans funded by equity to
fluctuations in short-term interest rates. In particular, the EMF allows the flexibility of managing the duration of
IBRD’s equity within a range of zero to five years based on market and macroeconomic conditions. It also allows
IBRD to realize some of the unrealized mark-to-market gains from the positions. As measured by duration, the
interest rate sensitivity of IBRD’s equity remained largely unchanged at 4.4 years as of September 30, 2015, from
4.8 years as of June 30, 2015. The market value of the EMF position increased to $1.6 billion as of September 30,
2015, from $0.7 billion as of June 30, 2015. The increase was primarily as a result of net unrealized mark-to-market
gains of $741 million experienced during the first three months of FY16, due to the decline in the U.S. interest rates
(Table 4).
The main driver of equity contribution is revenue from the derivatives used as part of the EMF. In addition to the
regular interest income earned from the derivative instruments, this revenue, on an allocable income basis, includes
net mark-to-market gains which have been realized during the year as a result of the termination of derivative
positions. Additionally, equity contribution includes revenue from the proportion of loans which are funded by
equity and certain minor adjustments including those relating to discontinued loan products.
For the first three months of FY16, the equity contribution amounted to $191 million, compared with $674 million
for the same period in FY15, where IBRD had $581 million of realized gains as a result of the liquidation of certain
EMF positions during that time. There were no terminations of positions during the same period in FY16. This
decline was however partially offset by the increase in interest income earned during FY16, as a result of the
increase in the volume of EMF positions.

III.         Summary of Fair Value Results
Fair Value Adjustments
An important element in achieving IBRD’s financial goals is its ability to minimize the cost of borrowing from
capital markets for lending to member countries by using financial instruments, including derivatives. The fair value
of these financial instruments is affected by changes in the market environment such as interest rates, exchange rates
and credit risk. Fair value is used mainly to assess the performance of the investment trading portfolio, to monitor
the results of the EMF, and to manage certain market risks, including interest rate and commercial credit risk for
derivative counterparties.
As shown in Table 9, on a fair value basis, if interest rates increased by one basis point, IBRD would experience a
net unrealized mark-to-market loss of approximately $24 million as of September 30, 2015.

Figure 7 provides a further breakdown of how the use of derivatives affects the overall sensitivity of the loan and
borrowing portfolios. For example, for the borrowing portfolio, a one basis point increase in interest rates would
result in net unrealized mark-to-market gains of $51 million on the bonds. These would be significantly offset by the
$48 million of net unrealized mark-to-market losses on the related swaps, resulting in net unrealized mark-to-market
gains of $3 million for the portfolio.

                                          IBRD MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 13
Effect of Interest and Credit
IBRD uses derivatives in its loan and borrowing portfolios to arrive at floating rate instruments, as part of its risk
management strategies. The sensitivity of these portfolios to interest rate movements, after the effect of derivatives
is therefore low, resulting in relatively small interest rate related unrealized mark-to-market gains/losses in income
(Figure 7).
For the first three months of FY16, the unrealized mark-to-market gains on the EMF position of $741 million were
primarily due to the decrease in U.S. interest rates experienced during the first three months of FY16.
For the first three months of FY16, IBRD experienced $516 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains on the
borrowing portfolio, which is comprised of $665 million mark-to-market unrealized gains due to the widening of its
credit spreads, partially offset by $232 million of mark-to-market losses due to the decline in interest rates. As
shown on Table 9, the dollar value change corresponding to a one-basis-point upward parallel shift in interest rates
on IBRD’s own credit relative to LIBOR is about $51 million of unrealized mark-to-market gains.
In addition, IBRD experienced $1.5 billion of unrealized mark-to-market losses on the loan portfolio, which was
mainly due to the net widening of Credit Default Swaps (CDS) spreads for several of its borrowing member
countries during the same period. As shown on Table 9, the dollar value change corresponding to a one-basis-point
upward parallel shift in CDS rates on the loan portfolio is about $36 million of unrealized mark-to-market losses.
See the June 30, 2015, MD&A for a detailed discussion on how the credit risk of each portfolio is managed.
Fair Value Results
As non-financial assets and liabilities are not reflected at fair value, IBRD’s equity is not intended to reflect fair
value. Under the fair value basis, in addition to the instruments in the investment and borrowing portfolios, and all
other derivatives, loans are reported at fair value and all changes in AOCI are also included in fair value net income.
Tables 11-12 provide a reconciliation from the reported basis to the fair value basis for both the balance sheet and
income statement.

20           IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
NOTES TO CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTE A—SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING AND RELATED POLICIES
Basis of Preparation
These unaudited condensed quarterly financial statements should be read in conjunction with the June 30, 2015,
audited financial statements and notes included therein. The condensed comparative information that has been
derived from the June 30, 2015, audited financial statements has not been audited. In the opinion of management,
the condensed quarterly financial statements reflect all adjustments necessary for a fair presentation of IBRD’s
financial position and results of operations in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States of America (U.S. GAAP).
Management makes estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the condensed quarterly financial statements and the
reported amounts of income and expenses during the reporting periods. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in
making those estimates, actual results could differ from those estimates. Areas in which significant estimates have
been made include, but are not limited to, the provision for losses on loans and other exposures, valuation of certain
instruments carried at fair value, and valuation of pension and other postretirement plan-related liabilities. The
results of operations for the first three months of the current fiscal year are not necessarily indicative of results that
may be expected for the full year.
Certain reclassifications of the prior year’s information have been made to conform with the current year’s
presentation. In particular, the presentation for realized mark-to-market gains and losses on the Statement of Income
and the Statement of Cash Flows for the prior period was changed to better reflect the manner in which these
derivatives are economically hedging the related portfolios. For the Statement of Income, these amounts were
previously presented on a gross basis as part of Interest, net, for the Equity management and Borrowing portfolios,
with a corresponding offset in the related Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses for the respective portfolios.
For the Statement of Cash flows, within the Cash flows from operating activities category, consistent with the gross
basis presentation on the Statement of Income, realized mark-to-market gains and losses, were previously shown as
part of Other assets and liabilities, with a corresponding offset in the Unrealized mark-to-market gains and losses on
non-trading portfolios, net. Under the new presentation, realized mark-to-market gains and losses are no longer
presented on a gross basis. As a result:

        On the Statement of Income, for the three months ended September 30, 2014, interest revenue on Equity
         management, net, decreased by $581 million, while the related unrealized mark-to-market losses decreased
         by $581 million. Interest expenses on Borrowings, net, increased by $6 million while the related unrealized
         market-to-market losses, net decreased by $6 million. Similarly, interest revenue on Investments-Trading,
         net increased by $29 million while the related unrealized mark-to-market losses increased by $29 million.
         There was no net effect on net income (loss) due to this reclassification.

        For the Statement of Cash Flows, for the three months ended September 30, 2014, Unrealized mark-to-
         market losses (gains) on non-trading portfolios, net decreased by $587 million, with a corresponding
         change in miscellaneous assets. There was no net effect on the Cash flows from operating activities in the
         Statement of Cash Flows.

Accounting and Reporting Developments
In July 2010, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the Act) became law. The Act
seeks to reform the U.S. financial regulatory system by introducing new regulators and extending regulation over
new markets, entities, and activities. The implementation of the Act is dependent on the development of various
rules to clarify and interpret its requirements. As the rules are being developed, IBRD continues to assess the impact
on its business. As of September 30, 2015, IBRD believes that the Act has not had any significant effect on its
business.
In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU 2015-14, Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606): Deferral of
the Effective Date. The ASU defers for one year the effective date of ASU 2014-09 Revenue from Contracts with
Customers. As a result, for IBRD, ASU 2014-09 will be effective beginning from the quarter ending September 30,
2018, with earlier application permitted as of the quarter ending September 30, 2017.

During the three months ended Septermber 30, 2015, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2. On June
30, 2015, $834 million of investments related to non-U.S. government obligations were transferred from Level 2 to
Level 1 within the fair value hierarchy. This transfer was based on the outcome of the annual review of the inputs
used to measure fair value.
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Summarized below are the techniques applied in determining the fair values of investments.
Investment securities
Investment securities are classified based on management’s intention on the date of purchase, their nature, and
IBRD’s policies governing the level and use of such investments. These securities are carried and reported at fair
value, or at face value or NAV, which approximates fair value. Where available, quoted market prices are used to

                     IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)                                   25
determine the fair value of trading securities. Examples include most government and agency securities, mutual
funds, futures contracts, exchange-traded equity securities and ABS and TBA.
For instruments for which market quotations are not available, fair values are determined using model-based
valuation techniques, whether internally-generated or vendor-supplied, that include the standard discounted cash
flow method using market observable inputs such as yield curves, credit spreads, and constant prepayment rates.
Where applicable, unobservable inputs such as constant prepayment rates, probability of default and loss severity are
used. Unless quoted prices are available, time deposits are reported at face value which approximates fair value, as
they are short term in nature.
Securities purchased under resale agreements, Securities sold under repurchase agreements, and Securities lent
under securities lending agreements
These securities are of a short term nature and reported at face value which approximates fair value.
Commercial Credit Risk
For the purpose of risk management, IBRD is party to a variety of financial transactions, certain of which involve
elements of credit risk. Credit risk exposure represents the maximum potential loss due to possible nonperformance
by obligors and counterparties under the terms of the contracts. For all securities, IBRD limits trading to a list of
authorized dealers and counterparties. In addition, IBRD receives collateral in connection with resale agreements as
well as swap agreements. This collateral serves to mitigate IBRD’s exposure to credit risk.
Swap Agreements: Credit risk is mitigated through the application of eligibility criteria and volume limits for
transactions with individual counterparties and through the use of mark-to-market collateral arrangements for swap
transactions. IBRD may require collateral in the form of cash or other approved liquid securities from individual
counterparties in order to mitigate its credit exposure.
IBRD has entered into master derivatives agreements which contain legally enforceable close-out netting provisions.
These agreements may further reduce the gross credit risk exposure related to the swaps. Credit risk with financial
assets subject to a master derivatives arrangement is further reduced under these agreements to the extent that
payments and receipts with the counterparty are netted at settlement. The reduction in exposure as a result of these
netting provisions can vary due to the impact of changes in market conditions on existing and new transactions. The
extent of the reduction in exposure may therefore change substantially within a short period of time following the
balance sheet date. For more information on netting and offsetting provisions see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
The following is a summary of the collateral received by IBRD in relation to swap transactions as of September 30,
2015 and June 30, 2015.

As of September 30, 2015, IBRD had received total cash collateral of $2,625 million ($2,729 million—June 30,
2015), of which $2,605 million was invested in highly liquid instruments ($2,714 million—June 30, 2015).
Securities Lending: IBRD may engage in securities lending and repurchases, against adequate collateral, as well as
securities borrowing and reverse repurchases (resales) of government and agency obligations, and corporate and
ABS. These transactions have been conducted under legally enforceable master netting arrangements, which allow
IBRD to reduce its gross credit exposure related to these transactions. For balance sheet presentation purposes,
IBRD presents its securities lending and repurchases, as well as resales, on a gross basis. As of September 30, 2015,
amounts which could potentially be offset as a result of legally enforceable master netting arrangements were $374
million ($822 million—June 30, 2015).
Securities lending and repurchase agreements expose IBRD to several risks, including counterparty risk,
reinvestment risk, and risk of a collateral gap (increase or decrease in the fair value of collateral pledged). IBRD has
procedures in place to ensure that trading activity and balances under these agreements are below predefined
counterparty and maturity limits, and to actively manage net counterparty exposure, after collateral, through daily
mark-to-market. Whenever the collateral pledged by IBRD related to its borrowings under repurchase agreements

and securities lending agreements declines in value, the transaction is re-priced as appropriate by returning cash or
pledging additional collateral.

Transfers of securities by IBRD to counterparties are not accounted for as sales as IBRD still retails control over
these securities and therefore the accounting criteria for the treatment as a sale have not been met. Counterparties are
permitted to repledge these securities until the repurchase date.
At September 30, 2015, and June 30, 2015 there were no liabilities relating to securities transferred under repurchase
or securities lending agreements that had not settled at that date.
The following tables present the disaggregation of the gross obligation by class of collateral pledged and the
remaining contractual maturities for repurchase or securities lending agreements that are accounted for as secured
borrowings as of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015:

 repurchase or securities lending agreements


In the case of resale agreements, IBRD receives collateral in the form of liquid securities and is permitted to
repledge these securities. While these transactions are legally considered to be true purchases and sales, the
securities received are not recorded on IBRD’s Balance Sheet as IBRD has not obtained control over these securities
and therefore the accounting criteria for treatment as a sale have not been met. As of September 30, 2015, securities
purchased under resale agreements included $437 million of securities which had not settled at that date ($252
million—June 30, 2015). For the remaining purchases, IBRD received securities with a fair value of $2,048 million
($1,875 million—June 30, 2015). None of these securities had been transferred under repurchase or security lending
agreements as of that date (Nil—June 30, 2015).

NOTE D—LOANS AND OTHER EXPOSURES
IBRD’s loans and other exposures (exposures) are generally made to, or guaranteed by, member countries of IBRD.
In addition, IBRD may also make loans to the International Finance Corporation (IFC), an affiliated organization,
without any guarantee. Other exposures include: Deferred Drawdown Options (DDOs), Irrevocable Commitments,
Exposures to member Countries’ Derivatives, and Guarantees. IBRD’s loans are reported at amortized cost, with the
exception of one loan which is carried and reported at fair value, because it contains an embedded derivative.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding derivatives used in the loan portfolio, see Note F—Derivative Instruments.
Of the total loans outstanding as of September 30, 2015, 82% were to the Latin America and the Caribbean, Europe
and Central Asia, and East Asia and Pacific regions, combined.
As of September 30, 2015, only 0.3% of IBRD’s loans were in nonaccrual status and were all related to one
borrower. The total provision for losses on accrual and nonaccrual loans accounted for 1.0% of the total loan
portfolio. Based on IBRD’s internal credit quality indicators, the majority of loans outstanding are in the medium
risk and high risk classes.
Credit Quality of Sovereign Exposures
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s exposures, management has determined that IBRD has one portfolio segment –
Sovereign Exposures. IBRD’s loans constitute the majority of the Sovereign Exposures portfolio segment.
IBRD’s country risk ratings are an assessment of its borrowers’ ability and willingness to repay IBRD on time and
in full. These ratings are internal credit quality indicators. Individual country risk ratings are derived on the basis of
both quantitative and qualitative analyses. The components considered in the analysis can be grouped broadly into
eight categories: political risk, external debt and liquidity, fiscal policy and public debt burden, balance of payments
risks, economic structure and growth prospects, monetary and exchange rate policy, financial sector risks, and
corporate sector debt and vulnerabilities. For the purpose of analyzing the risk characteristics of IBRD’s exposures,
these exposures are grouped into three classes in accordance with assigned borrower risk ratings which relate to the
likelihood of loss: Low, Medium and High risk classes, as well as exposures in nonaccrual status. IBRD considers
all exposures in nonaccrual status to be impaired.
IBRD’s borrowers’ country risk ratings are key determinants in the provision for losses. Country risk ratings are
determined in review meetings that take place several times a year. All countries are reviewed at least once a year,
or more frequently, if circumstances warrant, to determine the appropriate ratings.
IBRD considers loans to be past due when a borrower fails to make payment on any principal, interest or other
charges due to IBRD on the dates provided in the contractual loan agreement.

Accumulated Provision for Losses on Loans and Other Exposures
Management determines the appropriate level of accumulated provisions for losses, which reflects the probable
losses inherent in IBRD’s exposures. Probable losses comprise estimates of potential losses arising from default and
nonpayment of principal amounts due, as well as present value losses. Delays in receiving loan payments result in
present value losses to IBRD since it does not charge fees or additional interest on any overdue interest or charges.
These present value losses are equal to the difference between the present value of payments of interest and charges,
made according to the related instrument’s contractual terms and the present value of its expected future cash flows.
It is IBRD’s practice not to write off its loans. All contractual obligations associated with exposures in nonaccrual
status have eventually been cleared, thereby allowing borrowers to eventually emerge from nonaccrual status. To
date, no loans have been written off.
Notwithstanding IBRD’s historical experience, the risk of losses associated with nonpayment of principal amounts
due is included in the accumulated provision for losses on loans and other exposures.

Guarantees
Guarantees of $1,670 million were outstanding at September 30, 2015 ($1,432 million—June 30, 2015). This
amount represents the maximum potential amount of undiscounted future payments that IBRD could be required to
make under these guarantees, and is not included in the Condensed Balance Sheet. These guarantees have original
maturities ranging between 5 and 20 years, and expire in decreasing amounts through 2029.
At September 30, 2015, liabilities related to IBRD's obligations under guarantees of $60 million ($42 million—June
30, 2015), have been included in Other liabilities on the Condensed Balance Sheet. These include the accumulated
provision for guarantee losses of $23 million ($17 million—June 30, 2015).
During the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, no guarantees provided by IBRD were
called.
Waivers of Loan Charges
IBRD provides waivers on eligible loans, which include a portion of interest on loans, a portion of the commitment
charge on undisbursed balances and a portion of the front-end fee charged on all eligible loans. Waivers are
approved annually by the Executive Directors of IBRD.
The reduction in net income for the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, resulting from
waivers of loan charges is summarized below:

Segment Reporting
Based on an evaluation of IBRD’s operations, management has determined that IBRD has only one reportable
segment since financial results are reviewed, and resource allocation decisions are made, at the entity level.
Loan income comprises interest, commitment fees, loan origination fees and prepayment premia, net of waivers. For
the three months ended September 30, 2015, one country contributed in excess of 10 percent of total loan revenue;
this amounted to $63 million.

Fair Value Disclosures
The only loan carried at fair value is classified as Level 3. This loan has an embedded derivative and its fair value is
estimated on a matrix basis against the related bond. As IBRD’s loans are not traded, the yield which is used as a
key input to determining the fair value of this loan is not observable. The yield applied in determining the fair value
of the loan at September 30, 2015 was 6.2%. An increase (decrease) in the yield would result in a decrease
(increase) in the fair value of the loan.
The following table provides a summary of changes in the fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 loan during the three
months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014:

32            IBRD CONDENSED QUARTERLY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: SEPTEMBER 30, 2015 (UNAUDITED)
Valuation Methods and Assumptions
All IBRD’s loans are made to, or guaranteed by, countries that are members of IBRD, except for those loans made
to IFC. IBRD does not currently sell its loans.
As of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, except for one loan which is reported at fair value, all other loans are
carried at amortized cost. The fair value of these loans is calculated using a discounted cash flow method. This
method incorporates Credit Default Swap spreads for each borrower. Basis adjustments are applied to market
recovery levels to reflect IBRD’s recovery experience. IBRD’s loans, including the one reported at fair value on a
recurring basis, are classified as Level 3, within the fair value hierarchy.
NOTE E—BORROWINGS
IBRD issues unsubordinated and unsecured fixed and variable rate debt in a variety of currencies. Some of these
debt instruments are callable. Variable rates may be based on, for example, exchange rates, interest rates or equity
indices.
Borrowings issued by IBRD are carried and reported at fair value. As of September 30, 2015, 99% of the
instruments in the portfolio were classified as Level 2, within the fair value hierarchy.
IBRD uses derivative contracts to manage the currency risk as well as the repricing risk between its loans and
borrowings. For details regarding the derivatives used in the borrowing portfolio, see Note F—Derivative
Instruments.

During the three months ended September 30, 2015, IBRD credit spreads widened. The estimated financial effects
on the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2015, were unrealized mark-to-market gains
of $665 million. During the three months ended September 30, 2014, IBRD’s credit spreads tightened. The
estimated financial effects on the fair value of the debt issued and outstanding as of September 30, 2014, were
unrealized mark-to-market losses of $153 million.
IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings primarily relate to structured bonds. The fair value of these bonds is estimated using
valuation models that incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs, and unobservable inputs. The
significant unobservable inputs used in the fair value measurement of structured bonds are correlations and long-
dated interest rate volatilities. Generally, the movements in correlations are considered to be independent from the
movements in long-dated interest rate volatilities.
Correlation is the statistical measurement of the relationship between two variables. For contracts where the holder
benefits from the convergence of the underlying index prices (e.g. interest rates and foreign exchange rates), an
increase in correlation generally results in an increase in the fair value of the instrument. The magnitude and
direction of the fair value adjustment will depend on whether the holder is short or long the option.
Interest rate volatility is the extent to which the level of interest rates change over time. For purchased options, an
increase in volatility will generally result in an increase in the fair value. In general, the volatility used to price the
option depends on the maturity of the underlying instrument and the option strike price. For IBRD, interest rate
volatilities are considered an unobservable input for maturities greater than ten years for certain currencies.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Techniques applied in determining the fair values of debt instruments are summarized as follows:
Discount notes and vanilla bonds
Discount notes and vanilla bonds are valued using the standard discounted cash flow method which relies on market
observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads and funding spreads, where available,
quoted marked prices are used to determine the fair value of short-term notes.
Structured bonds
Structured bonds issued by IBRD have coupon or repayment terms linked to the level or the performance of interest
rates, foreign exchange rates, equity indices or commodities. The fair value of the structured bonds is derived using
the discounted cash flow method based on estimated future pay-offs determined by applicable models and
computation of embedded optionality such as caps, floors and calls. A wide range of industry standard models such
as one factor Hull-White, LIBOR Market Model and Black-Scholes are used depending on the specific structure.
These models incorporate market observable inputs, such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates, basis spreads,
funding spreads, interest rates volatilities, equity index volatilities and equity indices. Where applicable, the models
also incorporate significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.

IBRD is not required to post collateral under its derivative agreements as long as it maintains a AAA credit rating.
The aggregate fair value of all derivative instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that are in a liability
position on September 30, 2015 is $5,270 million ($4,230 million—June 30, 2015). IBRD has not posted any
collateral with these counterparties due to its AAA credit rating.
If the credit-risk related contingent features underlying these agreements were triggered to the extent that IBRD
would be required to post collateral on September 30, 2015, the amount of collateral that would need to be posted
would be $2,411 million ($1,709 million—June 30, 2015). Subsequent triggers of contingent features would require
posting of additional collateral, up to a maximum of $5,270 million ($4,230 million—June 30, 2015). In contrast,

Offsetting assets and liabilities
IBRD enters into International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) master netting agreements with
substantially all of its derivative counterparties. These legally enforceable master netting agreements give IBRD the
right to liquidate securities held as collateral and to offset receivables and payables with the same counterparty, in
the event of default by the counterparty.
The presentation of derivative instruments is consistent with the manner in which these instruments are settled.
Interest rate swaps are settled on a net basis, while currency swaps are settled on a gross basis.

Transfers between Level 2 and Level 3 are due to changes in price transparency.
The fair value of IBRD’s Level 3 borrowings related derivatives is estimated using valuation models that
incorporate model parameters, observable market inputs and unobservable inputs. The significant unobservable
inputs used in the fair value measurement of these derivatives are correlations and long dated interest rate
volatilities. See Note E—Borrowings for details on these unobservable inputs.
The following table provides a summary of the valuation technique applied in determining fair values of these Level
3 instruments and quantitative information regarding the significant unobservable inputs used.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
Derivative contracts include currency forward contracts, TBAs, swaptions, exchange traded options and futures
contracts currency swaps and interest rate swaps. Currency swaps and interest rate swaps are either plain vanilla or
structured. Currency forward contracts and plain vanilla currency and interest rate swaps are valued using the
standard discounted cash flow methods using market observable inputs such as yield curves, foreign exchange rates,
basis spreads and funding spreads. For structured currency and interest rate swaps, which primarily consist of
callable swaps linked to interest rates, foreign exchange rates, and equity indices, valuation models and inputs
similar to the ones applicable to structured bonds valuation are used. Where applicable, the models also incorporate
significant unobservable inputs such as correlations and long-dated interest rate volatilities.
NOTE G—RETAINED EARNINGS, ALLOCATIONS AND TRANSFERS
IBRD makes net income allocation decisions on the basis of reported net income, adjusted to exclude unrealized
mark-to-market gains and losses on non-trading portfolios, net, restricted income and Board of Governors-approved
transfers, and after considering the allocation to the pension reserve.
On August 6, 2015, IBRD’s Executive Directors approved the following allocations relating to the net income
earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, an increase in General Reserve by $36 million and a decrease in the
Pension Reserve by $55 million.
Subsequent event: On October 9, 2015, IBRD’s Board of Governors approved an immediate transfer to IDA of
$650 million out of the net income earned in the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015. The transfer to IDA was made on
October 15, 2015.
Retained earnings comprise the following components at September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015:

NOTE H—PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS
IBRD, IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) participate in a defined benefit Staff
Retirement Plan (SRP), a Retired Staff Benefits Plan (RSBP) and PEBP that cover substantially all of their staff
members.
All costs, assets and liabilities associated with these pension plans are allocated between IBRD, IFC and MIGA
based upon their employees’ respective participation in the plans. Costs allocated to IBRD are then shared between
IBRD and IDA based on an agreed cost sharing ratio. The net periodic pension cost for the SRP, RSBP and PEBP is
included in Pension expenses, in the Condensed Statement of Income.

Loans
IBRD has a Local Currency Loan Facility Agreement with IFC which is capped at $300 million. At September 30,
2015, the loan balance under this facility amounted to $17 million ($17 million—June 30, 2015) and carried a fixed
interest rate of 3.96% and maturity of 1 year. This loan is not eligible for interest waivers.
IBRD has another facility with IFC under which IFC can borrow up to $197 million. This loan is at LIBOR less 25
basis points (0.19% as of September 30, 2015) and is not eligible for interest waivers. At September 30, 2015, the
balance of this loan was $196 million ($196 million—June 30, 2015).
During the fiscal year ended June 30, 2015, IBRD entered into an exposure exchange agreement with MIGA under
which IBRD and MIGA exchange selected exposures, with each divesting itself of exposure in countries where their
lending capacities are limited, in return for exposure in countries where they have excess lending capacity. Under
the agreement, IBRD and MIGA have each exchanged $120 million of notional exposure as follows: MIGA
assumes IBRD's loan principal and interest exposure in exchange for IBRD's assumption of principal and interest
exposure of MIGA under its Non-Honoring of Sovereign Financial Obligation agreement. As of September 30,
2015, liabilities related to IBRD’s obligation under this agreement amounted to $3 million ($3 million—June 30,
2015). These include an accumulated provision for guarantee losses of less than $1 million (less than $1 million—
June 30, 2015).
Administrative Services
Expenses jointly incurred by IBRD and IDA are allocated based on an agreed cost sharing ratio, and amounts are
settled quarterly. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, IBRD’s administrative expenses are net of the
share of expenses allocated to IDA of $349 million ($374 million—three months ended September 30, 2014).
Other Revenue
Revenue jointly earned by IBRD and IDA is allocated based on an agreed revenue sharing ratio. Amounts are settled
quarterly. For the three months ended September 30, 2015, IBRD’s other revenue is net of revenue allocated to IDA
of $40 million ($45 million—three months ended September 30, 2014).
For the three months ended September 30, 2015 and September 30, 2014, the amount of fee revenue associated with
services provided to affiliated organizations is included in Revenue from externally funded activities on the
Condensed Statement of Income, as follows:

NOTE J—COMPREHENSIVE INCOME
Comprehensive income consists of net income and other gains and losses affecting equity that, under U.S. GAAP,
are excluded from net income. For IBRD, Comprehensive income (loss) comprises currency translation adjustments,
the cumulative effects of a change in accounting principle related to the implementation of FASB’s derivatives and
hedging guidance, pension-related items, and net income. These items are presented in the Condensed Statement of
Comprehensive Income.

Valuation Methods and Assumptions
As of September 30, 2015 and June 30, 2015, IBRD had no assets or liabilities measured at fair value on a non-
recurring basis.
For valuation methods and assumptions as well as additional fair value disclosures regarding Investments, Loans,
Borrowings and Derivative assets and liabilities, refer to Note C—Investments, Note D—Loans, Note E—
Borrowings and Note F—Derivative Instruments, respectively.
Due from Banks: The carrying amount of unrestricted and restricted currencies is considered a reasonable estimate of
the fair value of these positions.
