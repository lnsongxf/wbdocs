Executive Summary
Most commodity price indexes rebounded in the second quarter of 2016, continuing their upward climb from January
lows on improved market sentiment and tapering supplies. Oil prices jumped by more than a third due to supply out-
ages and strong demand. Given this rebound and expected reduction in inventories during the second half of the year,
the crude oil price forecast for 2016 is being raised to $43 per barrel (bbl) from $41/bbl in the April assessment, still a
15 percent drop from 2015. Metals prices are projected to decline 11 percent in 2016, a slightly larger drop than an-
ticipated in April, mainly driven by an ongoing surplus in the copper market. Agricultural prices for 2016 have been
revised slightly upwards due to weather patterns in South America, but are still expected to register a marginal decline
from last year. A large upward revision for precious metal prices of more than 8 percentage points versus the April as-
sessment reflects the increased demand for safe haven assets. For 2017, a modest recovery is projected for most com-
modities as demand strengthens and supply tightens. This issue of the Commodity Markets Outlook examines the im-
plications of low energy prices for food prices. It finds that, given the energy-intensive nature of agriculture, high
energy prices were an important driver of the post-2006 surge in agricultural prices. Over 2011-16, lower energy
prices are estimated to account for up to one-third of the projected 32 percent decline in prices of grains and soybeans.

second quarter of 2016 (Figure 1). Oil prices averaged                   second quarter, led by agriculture, which was up 8
$47.70/bbl in June, 37 percent above their first quar-                   percent. Gains were concentrated in oils and meals
ter average. The oil price rebound reflects a number of                  (up 17 percent) due to poor harvests in South Amer-

                               Moving in tandem?
Energy prices declined 45 percent in 2015 and are projected to drop another 16 percent in 2016. Given the energy
intensive nature of agriculture, lower energy prices will help reduce the cost of producing food commodities. They will
also ease policy pressures to encourage production of biofuels, which have been a key factor behind the growth of food
commodity demand over the past decade. During 2011-16, they are likely to account for up to one-third of the pro-
jected 32 percent price decline of grain commodities and soybeans.

          Notes: All variables (except interest rate) are expressed in logarithmic terms. The dependent variable is the logarithm of the nominal price divided by the price of manufacture
          goods. Because of data unavailability, the regressions for soybeans and palm oil begin in 1965 (the rest span 1960-2014). The last row, Panel, reports estimates from a
          random effects model. The R-square for the Panel refers to the overall R-square. Absolute t-statistics in parentheses, * = 10 percent, ** = 5 percent, *** = 1 percent.

 Notes: n/a implies data not available. Roundwood (which refers to Industrial roundwood), reported in cubic meters solid volume underbark (i.e. exclusing bark), is an aggregate
 comprising sawlogs and veneer logs; pulpwood, round and split; and other industrial roundwood except wood fuel. Sawnwood, reported in cubic meters solid volume, includes
 wood that has been produced from both domestic and imported roundwood, either by sawing lengthways or by a profile-chipping process and that exceeds 6mm in thickness.

M     ost commodity price indexes rebounded in the second
quarter of 2016, continuing their rise from January on improved
market sentiment and tapering supplies. Oil prices jumped by
more than a third due to supply outages and strong demand.
The crude oil price forecast for 2016 is raised to $43/bbl from
$41/bbl in April. Metals prices are projected to fall 11 percent in
2016, a larger drop than anticipated in April. Agricultural prices
for 2016 have been revised slightly upwards due to weather
patterns in South America, but should register a small decline
from last year. An 8 percentage point upward revision for
precious metal prices from April reflects safe haven demand.
A Special Focus section finds that, given the energy-intensive
nature of agriculture, high energy prices were an important
driver of the post-2006 surge in agricultural prices. Over 2011-
16, relatively lower energy prices are likely to account for up to
one-third of the projected 32 percent decline in prices of grains
and soybeans.

The World Bank’s Commodity Markets Outlook is published
quarterly, in January, April, July, and October. The report
provides detailed market analysis for major commodity groups,
including energy, metals, agriculture, precious metals, and
fertilizers. Price forecasts to 2025 for 46 commodities are also
presented, together with historical price data. Commodity price
data updates are published separately at the beginning of each
month.
