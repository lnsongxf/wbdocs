           The Pacific Disaster Risk Financing and Insurance
           (DRFI) Program is one of the many applications
           of PCRAFI. It is designed to increase the financial
           resilience of PICs by improving their capacity
           to meet post-disaster financing needs without
           compromising their fiscal balance. Through DRFI,

           The Pacific has seen several recent cases that show
           the need for immediate liquidity post-disaster. In
           the Cook Islands, in the immediate aftermath of
           TC Pat in 2010, a delay in the receipt of travel
           funds meant that key government personnel could
           not immediately commence the initial damage
           assessment. Following TC Vania in 2010, Vanuatu
           had to reallocate a significant amount of the
           national budget. Similarly, Fiji and Samoa had to
           reallocate budgetary funds in the wake of TC Evan
           in 2012 and 2013; and the Santa Cruz earthquake
           in the Solomon Islands in February2013 drained
           the annual budget for the National Disaster
           Management Office and used the majority of the
           national contingency budget.

           Lacking contingency reserves and access to short-
           term loan funds, PICs have limited post-disaster

is located south of the equator in an area known for the
frequent occurrence of tropical cyclones with damaging
winds, rains and storm surge between the months of October
and May. In the South Pacific region from the equator to New
Zealand in latitude and from Indonesia to east of Hawaii
in longitude almost 1,000 tropical cyclones with hurricane-
force winds spawned in the last 60 years, with an average
of about 16 tropical storms per year. Samoa was affected by
devastating cyclones multiple times in the last few decades.
For example, tropical cyclones Ofa and Val, in 1990 and
1991, caused 21 fatalities and widespread destruction with
total economic losses between 300 and 500 million USD that
crippled the local economy. Figure 4 shows the levels of wind
speed due to tropical cyclones that have about a 40% chance
to be exceeded at least once in the next 50 years (100-year
mean return period). These wind speeds, if they were to
occur, are capable of generating severe damage to buildings,

              This note on Samoa forms part of a series of country Disaster Risk Finance and Insurance (DRFI) notes
              that were developed to build understanding of the existing DRFI tools in use in each country and to
              identify gaps future engagements in DRFI that could further improve financial resilience. These notes
              were developed as part of the technical assistance provided to countries under the Pacific DRFI program
              jointly implemented by the World Bank and the Secretariat of the Pacific Community financed by the
              Government of Japan. The technical assistance builds on the underlying principles of the three-tiered di-
              saster risk financing strategy and focuses on three core aspects: (i) the development of a public financial
              management strategy for natural disasters, recognizing the need for ex-ante and ex-post financial tools;
              (ii) the post-disaster budget execution process, to ensure that funds can be accessed and disbursed easily
              post-disaster; and (iii) the insurance of key public assets, to resource the much larger funding require-
              ments of recovery and reconstruction needs. The Pacific DRFI Program is one of the many applications
              of PCRAFI. It is designed to increase the financial resilience of PICs by improving their capacity to meet
              post-disaster financing needs without compromising their fiscal balance.
