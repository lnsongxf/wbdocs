          TRAINING ON THE USE OF THE HYDROLOGIC MODEL
                    FOR THE SAVA RIVER BASIN


1          Introduction
This document presents a report on the training on the use of the hydrologic model for the Sava River
Basin (SRB) that has been developed within the Water and Climate Adaptation Plan (WATCAP) being
prepared by the Consultant for the International Sava River Basin Commission (ISRBC) under World
Bank funding.1 The model development is described in detail in Annex 1 of the main WATCAP report
“Development of the Hydrologic Model for the Sava River Basin”.



2          Overview
The training was held in Zagreb on 12-13 November 2014 in the wake of the final WATCAP workshop
held on 11th November 2014. The training was performed by the consultant’s (COWI) team consisting
of Jasna Plavsic, Zana Topalovic and Nikola Zlatanovic. The 2-day training was undertaken according
to the agenda given in section 3.

A total of 24 participants attended the training sessions. The participants came from the major stake-
holders in the Sava Basin riparian countries. The list of participants is given in section 4.

The training consisted of theoretical and practical sessions. The first day was dedicated to introducing
the HEC-HMS software to the participants, including an overview of the rainfall-runoff modelling tech-
niques, introduction to the use of HEC-HMS, and tutorials in which participants learned to perform
basic tasks in HEC-HMS and in HEC Data Storage System Visual Utility Engine (DSSVue). The sec-
ond day was dedicated to the detailed description of the Sava Basin Hydrologic Model (SBHM) that
was developed, including technical details necessary for understanding the model organizational
structure.

The training material was distributed to the participants, including:

•       two versions of the SBHM (one with observed data and one with climate scenarios),

•       the report on the SBHM development,

•       presentations and hand-outs for all training sessions in electronic format.

The presentations are also available at the ISRBC web site2.

Interesting and lengthy discussions took place both days, but especially on the second day. The par-
ticipants seemed to be very interested in the topic and motivated to learn the modelling techniques.

The training assessment was made at the closing of the course. All participants responded to the sur-
vey. The results are given in Box 1.

Other comments given by participants in the survey are as follows:

•       “Please consider training in HEC-HMS in duration of 5 days, similar to courses given by HEC of
        USACE.”

•       “Concise and with measure, excellent lecturers. Very interesting.”

•       “Organize a similar event again. Commendation for everything.”

•       “The training should be enriched with more practical examples for the model itself and possibili-
        ties for its amendment, with discussion how it would affect the results.”

•       “It would be good to organize another training in duration of 5-7 days to get into detail of the pro-
        cesses, from model creation, to calibration and verification, and to model use via simulations, with
        more practical work.”

•       “Organize another workshop about use of software”

•       “Commendations for the concept of the course and for jolly atmosphere.”

•       “Organize regular courses for HEC-HMS.”

•       “Everything is perfect.”

•    “Thank you!”

•    “Too short for such a wide subject”

•    “I propose to create a document in the Sava Commission languages, e.g. “Short manual for the
     system use” with examples from particular basins; e.g. the Bosna River for BiH, and similar.”

•    “Great.”
