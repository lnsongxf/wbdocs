This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Belarus
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Belarus regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Belarus;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Belarus;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Belarus; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Belarus.
       Use data to help inform the Belarus country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In January 2013, 190 stakeholders of the World Bank in Belarus were invited to provide their
opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the Presidential Administration;
the office of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian;
employees of a ministry or a state committee; project management units (PMUs) overseeing
implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and multilateral
agencies; private sector organizations; the financial sector/private banks; CSOs; the media;
academia/research institutes/think tanks; and beneficiaries of a program. A total of 115
stakeholders participated in the country survey (61% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via post or email and returned them accordingly.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Belarus; their overall attitudes toward the
Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the
World Bank; the Bank’s future role in Belarus; and the Bank’s communication and information
sharing in Belarus.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Belarus: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Belarus is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas of development would contribute most to improving
   people’s lives and generating economic growth in Belarus.

   weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to promote development
   and reduce poverty in Belarus, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate
   more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.

   meets Belarus’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the Bank’s level
   of effectiveness across thirty development areas, such as economic growth, governance and

   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results in Belarus and its technical
   quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank ’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing Belarus’ institutional capacity, and
   providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Belarus: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Belarus’ development in the near future and to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Belarus.

   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to their information requests.

       For further analyses, the small number of respondents from private sector organizations
        were combined with respondents from the financial sector and banks, the few
        respondents from the office of the Prime Minister, the office of Minister, the office of
        Parliamentarian, and beneficiaries of a program were included in the “Other” category.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Geographic Location

       The vast majority of respondents indicated that they were located in Minsk. Because of
        the small number of respondents from oblast cities, these locations were combined into
        the “Other” category for all further analyses.
       Responses across both geographic locations for all country survey questions can be found
        in the Appendix C (see page 75). Only significant differences between geographic
        locations in response to indicator questions will be discussed in the body of this report.

    strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Belarus, the
    Bank’s ability to help achieve development results, and the Bank’s relevance to Belarus’s
    development.

IV. General Issues Facing Belarus
Headed in the Right Direction
       A majority of employees of ministries/state committees and respondents from local
        government indicated that the Belarusian economy was headed in the right direction,
        while respondents from multilateral agencies and private sector organizations/financial
        sector/banks were more likely to indicate that the Belarusian economy was headed in the
        wrong direction. Respondents from PMUs tended to indicate that they were not sure
        whether the Belarusian economy was headed in the right or wrong direction.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Belarus, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty specific areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increas e.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Belarus. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                Education;
                Social protection;
                Financial markets;
                Global/regional integration; and
                Job creation/employment.
       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Belarus, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                Education;
                Waste management;
                Energy;
                Water and sanitation;
                Environmental sustainability; and
                Forestry development.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
        There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across two of these
         aspects of the World Bank ’s effectiveness as a development partner in the country:
         inclusiveness and flexibility in terms of Bank’s products and services. For the most part,
         employees of ministries/state committees tended to give the highest ratings for these
         aspects whereas respondents from CSOs tended to give significantly lower ratings.
        Respondents across both geographic locations had statistically similar ratings.
