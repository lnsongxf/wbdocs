This Zambia Country Report is a product of The Mining Investment and Governance Review for Zambia, which was
undertaken in March-April and October 2015 by a team led by Michael Baxter and consisting of Lois Hooge, Wilfred
Lombe, Anne-Claire Howard, Julia Baxter, Yann Lebrat, Isabella Gerber, David Mihalyi and Giorgia Cecchinato. A wide
range of stakeholders was interviewed during the review and the team wishes to thank all participants for their time
and valuable comments.

This report presents data on mining investment and governance indicators for Zambia that are current as of
October 1, 2015. Scores for any of the indicators in the review may have changed since that date.

underlying strength of institutions, and ways to enhance
mining’s contribution to local and national development.
The Zambia MInGov report has one annex: The Zambia
MInGov Data Compendium. It contains scores for each
of the 314 individual questions, and their aggregation to
theme and value chain stage level. In time, the MInGov
website will provide access to MInGov country reports
and their under-lying data, as well as other information
on MInGov.

Country review data is made available in this report (and
in future on the website) to facilitate: (i) the user’s ability to
drill down into the data; (ii) the identification of countries
that are similar in terms of mining sector importance,
governance and investment attractiveness; and (iii) the
identification of stakeholder priorities. This information
should help stakeholders develop options to strengthen
sector governance, investment and impact. However, it
should be kept in mind that MInGov is neither a ranking
nor an index: it does not present rankings of countries on
the strength of their mining sector governance or attrac-
tiveness for investment in the sector.

This report presents data on mining investment and
governance indicators for Zambia that are current as of
October 2015.

     vestments Holdings Plc (ZCCM-IH), which has a 10-20 per cent shareholding in most major mining companies. Given the size of this shareholding, ZCCM-IH
     is treated in this MInGov review as a state-owned enterprise (SOE). There is no other SOE in the mining sector in Zambia.

     higher score corresponds to better governance and capacity.

Note: The score for each theme is the average of scores of the five value chain stages in that theme (see Figure 2). The score for the value chain stage is the

        indicator scores; the indicator scores are the average of the scores of their underlying questions. The color coding is the same as in the matrix (Figure 2).
        Intervals for scoring performance are as follows: n Very low (1.0-1.75); n Low (>1.75-2.50); n High (>2.50-3.25); and n Very high (>3.25-4.0), where a
        higher score corresponds to better governance and capacity.

      Intervals for scoring performance are as follows: n Very low (1.0-1.75); n Low (>1.75-2.50); n High (>2.50-3.25); and n Very high (>3.25-4.0), where a

It is up to the stakeholders in the Zambian mining                Regarding the mining sector as an integral and driving
economy to decide how they might follow-up on this                force in development planning and implementation; and

Six “low hanging fruit” are:                                         impacts of mining.

•	 Adequately resourcing sector regulatory and
   monitoring agencies, particularly ZEMA and
   geodata services;



Figure 8:	 Recommended Follow-up Points


     Contracts, Licenses and Exploration Value Chain Stage

     •	 Improved institutional performance. Quick wins include (a) keeping the mining cadastre up to date, (b) facil-
        itating public access to useful geological data, and (c) making mining contracts and license details readily
        accessible.

     •	 More efficient exploration rights. Address the reasons that exploration rights appear to be more open to
        dispute and uncertainty in comparison to mining licenses.

     •	 Acceptable levels of transparent government discretion. Minimize the application of discretion in license
        award and management, and apply it consistently and transparently.

     Operations Value Chain Stage

     •	 Improve intra-governmental coordination. Clarify inter-ministerial arrangements that affect mining, and identify
        and implement incentives to address that the multi-sectoral nature of mining sector development and investment.

•	 Effective support for ASM. Establish a body (with participation of all relevant stakeholders) to develop and
   implement a strategy to address the economic, social and environmental concerns and impacts of ASM.

•	 Timeframes and processes. Ensure that timeframes and processes for all required review and approval steps
   affecting mine operations are established, monitored and enforced.

Taxation and State Participation Value Chain Stage

•	 Refinement of some tax policies. Finalize modification of tax policies on transfer pricing and related party
   transactions.

•	 Minimum revenue streams. Review fiscal policy to ensure government receives an adequate minimum
   revenue stream at all stages of mine production.

Revenue Distribution and Management Value Chain Stage

•	 Fiscal discipline and rules. Strengthen steps needed for fiscal discipline and fiscal rules for savings and
   expenditure of minerals revenues (supported by adequate cost-benefit analysis).

•	 Reliable revenue sharing. Define and implement a system of sharing resource revenue between central and
   sub-national governments.

•	 Public expenditure and financial accountability. Apply continued attention to improving performance
   against PEFA indicators.

•	 Efficient public investment. Address the policy and practical constraints that appear to weaken the effec-
   tiveness and efficiency of the public investment program.

Local Impact Value Chain Stage

•	 An effective ZEMA. Ensure that ZEMA is provided with sufficient resources, support and accountability to
   enable it to perform its foreseen and required role with respect to the mining (and other sectors).

•	 Effective addressing of environmental and social impacts. Review the effectiveness of procedures meant to
   address mining environmental and social impacts.

•	 Attention to human rights and employment equity. Assess how to better implement human rights and
   employment equity relevant to the mining sector, and develop and implement an action plan to this end.

•	 Timely, comprehensive and meaningful consultation. Continue efforts to ensure timely, comprehensive and
   meaningful consultations on the environmental and social impacts of all scales of mining.

Cross-Cutting Themes

•	 MInGov and Doing Business link with investment environment. Use MInGov and Doing Business findings to
   monitor the business and investment environment from the perspective of investors across the value chain.




                                                                                                                  26
ZAMBIA MINING INVESTMENT AND GOVERNANCE REVIEW




     •	 Mining key to development planning. Review the place of mining in the national development plan and
        identify steps to attract investment to the sector and to maximize its contribution to economic and social
        development.

     •	 Missing: national local supplier development policy. Develop and implement a national policy on local
        supplier development for the mining sector that covers employment, skills development, procurement,
        investment and social programs.

     •	 Spatial planning perspective. Introduce spatial planning concepts into the national development plan and
        sector plans, and use spatial planning to facilitate infrastructure support for the mining sector.

     •	 Private-public partnerships for infrastructure. Overcome constraints to public/private investment in the
        provision of infrastructure, especially that of value to the mining sector and communities around mining
        activities.
