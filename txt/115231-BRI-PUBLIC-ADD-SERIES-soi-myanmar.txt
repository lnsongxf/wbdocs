CONTEXT:
Myanmar is one of the world’s most disaster-prone countries,
ranking 9th out of 191 countries in the INFORM Index for Risk
Management. Torrential rains from July 2015 and the onset of
cyclone Komen triggered severe and widespread ﬂooding and
landslides across 12 out of 14 states. Half of the most-affected
40 townships were in the two poorest states: Rakhine and Chin.
Landslides severed road connectivity, making the transport
sector the most-impacted public sector, with agriculture
sustaining the heaviest damages and losses overall.
