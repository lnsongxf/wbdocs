Abstract: Laboratories provide essential services to the health sector on the monitoring and
treatment of disease. Routine implementation of new diagnostic techniques may be costly;
therefore, understanding their clinical utility, impact, and cost-effectiveness are necessary to
guide decisions as to whether and how such techniques should be implemented. In this study, the
authors design a conceptual framework for examining the following: (1) optimal mix
of laboratory services at different levels of the health system; (2) combination of resources
required within laboratories to promote efficiency; and (3) potential for outsourcing to promote
cost containment. The framework considers both the health and economic rationale for laboratory
investments. The authors then use the conceptual framework to inform a decision analytics
model that maps out the health and economic impact of laboratory investments, and to illustrate
the model by investigating the best placement of a new technology (GeneXpert) for detecting
multi-drug-resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The illustrative application of the model shows that
investment in a new diagnostic technology for MDR-TB is cost-effective regardless of placement
in a district-level (satellite) or national-level (reference) laboratory. Placement of the GeneXpert
system at the satellite laboratory results in patients tested for MDR-TB or TB at lower costs than
the reference laboratory. Furthermore, if testing occurs at the satellite laboratory, more primary
and secondary cases are treated and cured than if testing was conducted at the reference
laboratory, leading to better outcomes. Overall, testing at the satellite laboratory results in more
deaths averted and more disability life-adjusted years (DALYs) saved. Both facilities have
average costs per DALY well below the WHO-suggested threshold for the per capita gross
domestic product (GDP). However, the satellite laboratory saves more DALYs at a lower
additional cost per DALY.

This project evolved from the growing recognition of the importance of laboratories in disease
prevention and control. This occurred against the backdrop of increased investments in
laboratories worldwide and in Africa, in particular East Africa, through the East Africa Public
Health Laboratory Networking Project. There is a broad based recognition that weak laboratory
systems can lead to misdiagnosis of diseases and a lack of etiological confirmation of disease
outbreaks, which increases the economic costs of treatment, compromises patient care, and
hampers the response to disease outbreaks. Hence, it is critical to improve understanding of how
to invest more efficiently and effectively in laboratory systems and laboratory networks. This
project helps to provide understanding about optimal investment strategies.

1.       Well-equipped and effective laboratories are the cornerstone of a well-functioning health
care system. Laboratories help to inform clinical decisions regarding diagnosis, treatment
eligibility, treatment failures, and the timing of shifts to new treatment regimens. In addition,
they perform key public health roles in monitoring disease trends, tracking outbreaks, and
effectively diagnosing pathogens during epidemics.

2.      The Maputo Declaration on Strengthening of Laboratory Systems, which resulted from
the Consensus Meeting on Clinical Laboratory Testing, Harmonization and Standardization, held
in Maputo, Mozambique, in 2008, recognized that “limited laboratory capacity represents a
major barrier to implementation and sustainability of prevention, treatment, and care programs
for HIV, malaria, and tuberculosis” (World Health Organization [WHO], 2008). In response to
this growing recognition of the importance of laboratory medicine in addressing health issues in
developing countries, in 2010 the World Bank approved the US$63.7 million East Africa Public
Health Laboratory Networking Project (EAPHLNP). The project aims to establish a network of
efficient, high quality, accessible public health laboratories for the diagnosis and surveillance of
TB and other communicable diseases in the East African Community member states. The
original group of countries included Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, with Burundi
(US$15 million) added in 2012. The laboratories serve as surveillance sites for monitoring and
early detection and response to disease outbreaks; have introduced and tested new diagnostic
technologies; and are conducting drug resistance monitoring. The project is strengthening
laboratory capacity by improving the existing infrastructure, increasing the quality of human
resources available, and updating information systems.

3.      With the advent of new laboratory technologies and with increased investment in
laboratory capacity in Africa, it becomes critically important to evaluate the impact, cost-
effectiveness, and value for money of strengthening laboratory systems and to determine the most
efficient mix of services to be offered. Increasingly, WHO and other international agencies
working on health and human development issues are relying on cost-effectiveness and value for
money approaches in developing their guiding principles (WHO, 2009). Routine implementation
of new diagnostic techniques may be costly; therefore, understanding their clinical utility, impact,
and cost-effectiveness are necessary to guide decisions as to whether and how such techniques
should be implemented. Such understanding is particularly important, given that the benefits of
some diagnostic technologies, which are part of routine care in developed countries, often need
to be weighted by their costs in resource-constrained countries in the developing world
(Walensky, et al., 2010).

4.     This study sought to understand the impact of investing in a network of public health
laboratories on economic and health outcomes. The study team designed a methodology for
examining three key issues: (1) optimal mix of laboratory services at different levels of the health
system; (2) mix of resources required within laboratories to promote efficiency; and (3) potential
for outsourcing to promote efficiency and cost containment. Specifically, the study lays out a
conceptual framework that considers the health and economic rationale for laboratory
investments; it uses the conceptual framework to inform a decision analytic model that maps out
the health and economic impact of laboratory investments; and it illustrates the model by
                                                1
investigating the best placement of a new technology (GeneXpert) for detecting multi-drug-
resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB). This decision analytic model is flexible enough to be applied
to different scenarios when considering investments in laboratories, especially in the context of
limited data.

5.       The illustrative application of the model shows that investment in a new diagnostic
technology for MDR-TB is cost-effective regardless of placement in a satellite (district-level) or
reference (usually at the national level) laboratory. Placement of the GeneXpert system in the
satellite laboratory results in fewer patients tested for MDR-TB or TB at lower costs than the
reference laboratory. The model further indicates that if testing occurs at the satellite laboratory,
more primary and secondary cases are treated and cured than if testing is conducted at the
reference laboratory, leading to higher total treatment costs if testing occurs at the satellite
laboratory. Overall, testing at the satellite laboratory results in more deaths averted and more
disability life-adjusted years (DALYs) saved. Both facilities have average costs per DALY well
below the WHO-suggested threshold for the per capita gross domestic product (GDP). However,
the satellite laboratory saves more DALYs at a low additional cost per DALY.

6.     Part II describes the conceptual framework. Part III illustrates the applicability of the
conceptual framework to testing for MDR-TB, explains the assumptions used to test the
conceptual framework, and includes limitations of the analysis. Part IV explains the findings
from the illustration of the model. Part V summarizes the main findings.

                                   CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

7.     The EAPHLNP is strengthening laboratory capacity, which is expected to contribute to
improvements in health outcomes. Two key areas of investment include laboratory infrastructure
and human resources capacity, both of which had been neglected over the recent decades. Within
laboratories, weak infrastructure can stem from, for instance, inadequate equipment and supplies
and antiquated diagnostic methods; and from insufficient quality and quantity of personnel to
detect and diagnose diseases (Martinez-Guarneros et al., 2003; Addo et al., 2006; Bates &
Maitland, 2006; Petti et al., 2006; Ridderhof et al., 2007; Sarkinfada et al., 2009; Addo et al.,
2010; Funjungo et al., 2012). Limitations in either laboratory infrastructure or human capacity
undermine the reliability of disease detection and diagnoses, which may contribute to
misdiagnosis, presumptive or incorrect treatment, further spread of disease, and/or an increase in
drug-resistant strains.

8.     Strengthening laboratory capacity improves diagnostic capabilities that will reduce the
incidence of misdiagnosis and better align treatment options for patients. These factors
contribute to better health outcomes, which in turn, lead to enhanced economic outcomes for the
population. Fewer people may be burdened with the effects of the disease or may die from the
disease. Transfiguring the health status of a population may then result in higher economic
                                                 2
growth as seen by declines in worker absenteeism and increases in labor productivity and
ultimately in gross national product.

Figure A: Conceptual Framework




9.      Figure A illustrates the pathway between investments in laboratory capacity
strengthening, improved delivery of quality laboratory services, and key health and economic
outcomes. Underpinning this pathway are external factors that are assumed to be outside the
immediate control of the networking project, but which will affect outcomes. These external




                                             3
factors impact both the demand for laboratory services and the cost of testing.1 In the
framework, inputs (that is, laboratory capacity investments) lead to better outputs (that is,
improved delivery of quality laboratory services) and consequently improve health and economic
outcomes. Details on various elements of the conceptual framework are included in Appendix I.

                        MEASURING IMPACTS THROUGH COST-EFFECTIVENESS

10.     The conceptual framework provides the basis of a model to determine the cost-
effectiveness of investing in various aspects of the laboratory network. The model combines the
costs of investing in laboratories and the resulting health and/or economic outcomes.

11.    The input measures capture the types of investments in laboratory capacity that the
project supports (for example, equipment, supplies, personnel, and laboratory management
information systems (LMIS). By investing in these components, laboratories will be able to
improve the quality of their services, including improved accuracy of the tests performed (that is,
higher specificity and sensitivity of tests), delivery of timely test results, and improved
communication to health care providers (Salinas et al., 2010; Bell et al., 2006; Kay et al., 2006).

12.     Outcomes can encompass measures of individual health, disease containment, and
individual and/or public economic benefits (that is, employment, wages, GDP). To determine if
laboratory investment strategies are cost-effective, the model weighs the effectiveness of the
investments on outcome measures against the costs of these investments. In this way, alternative
investment strategies can be compared to determine which strategy delivers the highest impact
for the least cost.

13.     This conceptual framework is used to guide the development of the decision analytic
model that incorporates measures of effectiveness and costs in a unified framework. This
approach can be used to determine and compare the expected impact and cost-effectiveness of
alternative investment strategies, when data are limited. It can also be used to estimate future
costs based on newly implemented strategies or medical interventions. Appendix II provides
details of the decision analytic model used to estimate the cost-effectiveness of laboratory
investments under this framework.

  The application of the conceptual framework will assume these factors are fixed in the short-run and already
reflected in the outcomes measurement in the model.

PART III – AN APPLICATION OF THE COST-EFFECTIVENESS MODEL


                                           OVERVIEW

14.     In this analysis, we implement the cost-effectiveness model in the specific context of
estimating the clinical outcomes associated with improved TB laboratory services in Africa. The
model includes assessment of various parameters that could be modified in the near term to
improve the testing procedures for TB. To illustrate how the model is implemented, we provide a
specific example of the decision analysis process, testing for first-line drug resistance to TB.
This specific illustrative example of the model measures the impact of using testing devices at
the local level (satellite) versus sending specimens for testing at a reference laboratory. In
evaluating this component, the model is determining the impact of the speed of testing on patient
retention, diagnosis, and treatment rates.

15.     Drug susceptibility testing (DST) has been historically performed in national or regional
reference laboratories due to the lack of capacity and biosafety levels of the smaller satellite
laboratories. Health facilities often collect sputum specimen from suspected TB patients and
then transport the specimen to reference laboratories for DST. The most widely used phenotypic
method for DST requires growing organisms in drug-containing and drug-free control media, a
process that can take up to six weeks (Fonseca, Moore, and Durier, 2011). This does not include
the transportation time between the laboratories.

16.     Xpert MTB/RIF drastically reduces this wait time, allowing the detection of TB and
resistance to rifampicin (a first-line TB drug) in a matter of hours. Use of Xpert MTB/RIF also
does not require highly skilled staff. In 2011, WHO approved Xpert MTB/RIF for use in initial
testing for TB and resistance to first-line drugs amongst individuals suspected of being multi-
drug resistant to TB (MDR-TB) or having HIV-associated TB (WHO, 2011c). WHO
recommended using Xpert MTB/RIF in districts or at placement points closest to the patient
(WHO, 2010c). Xpert MTB/RIF reduces the diagnostic time and consequently, provides an
opportunity to immediately start TB patients on a drug regimen, thereby reducing patient loss to
follow-up and transmission rates. However, Xpert MTB/RIF is only recommended for disease
detection and not treatment monitoring. Sputum Smear Microscopy (SSM) and culture remain
the recommended methods for determining treatment outcomes among TB patients. In the
model, treatment costs of MDR-TB include the use of these two methods.

17.      The model is equipped to estimate cost-effectiveness of a variety of outcomes, including
both public and private health and economic outcomes. We concentrate on the health differences
that result from testing for MDR-TB within and across laboratories and based on the speed and
accuracy of results provided through each facility. The model accounts for both the direct effects
of testing and treatment as well as the indirect effects of disease transmission.

18.    We calculate the number of patients tested, which include secondary cases arising from
uncured and untreated cases, and the average cost per patient tested across the two laboratory
                                                5
types (satellite/district and national/reference laboratories), given the existing cost of all inputs
into the test and laboratory capacity. Using these estimates we then calculate the average cost of
cases diagnosed and treated, including treatment of incorrectly diagnosed patients, and compare
those against changes in lives saved (as measured in disability adjusted life-years (DALYs).
DALYs are reported as the number of years of life lost to poor health, disability, or death. They
measure the extent of the public health burden of disease.2

                                              STUDY POPULATION

19.      The population investigated for this project is the group of patients with symptoms of TB
presenting at satellite facilities. The comparison comes from measuring the effects of sending
specimens to a reference laboratory (represented by the National Tuberculosis Regional
Laboratory in Kampala, Uganda) or providing testing at a satellite facility (represented by the
Kitale District Hospital in Kitale, Kenya).3 At the time of data collection for the study, the
reference laboratory tests for TB was using SSM, mycobacterial culture, and recently began using
Xpert MTB/RIF. The satellite laboratory initially used only sputum smear microscopy (SSM) to
test for TB.

                                             MODEL PERSPECTIVE

20.     Data were collected to analyze the cost differences from the perspective of the public
health system. These costs include personnel, training and supervision, staff travel (as relevant to
performing their duties), laboratory supplies and equipment, contracted services, infrastructure
(both existing and new), utilities, and other supplies and equipment.

21.     The costs do not include patient out-of-pocket costs or time spent getting to or waiting at
the facility. However, these factors contribute to the model outcome in terms of the probability
that a patient returns for follow-up.

                                                  TIME HORIZON

22.    The study time horizon is a two-year window to align with minimum duration of
treatment with standardized second-line drugs (Kenya Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation,
2009).

                                             MODEL ASSUMPTIONS

23.     A simple decision analytic model (as described in detail in Appendix II) was produced
using the Stata 12. We expounded on the decision analytic model to further capture the specifics
of testing for TB in Kenya, including the probability of the patient returning for treatment. The

 Additionally, it is possible to monetize DALYs if a measure of cost-effectiveness is desired or in order to assign an
economic cost to the disease burden.

3
 Using laboratories in two different countries may potentially overstate the incremental cost between the satellite
and reference laboratories if there are significant cost differences across countries.
                                                          6
decision analytic model is shown in Figure II-D in the Appendix. To operationalize the model,
we make several assumptions that are summarized below (Table 1-4)

Testing

24.     The baseline model assumes that both the reference and satellite laboratories test all
presenting cases who previously received TB treatment or had contact with MDR-TB with the
GeneXpert system using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay. However, only 97 percent of all transported
sputum arrives at the reference and satellite laboratories with an appropriate quality for testing
due to inefficiencies in sputum collection and delivery. Furthermore, Xpert MTB/RIF testing
volume at the reference laboratory, which tests samples from multiple facilities, is independent of
the testing volume received from the project-supported facility. We assume the volume of Xpert
MTB/RIF tests at the reference laboratory is roughly equal to half the volume of SSMs currently
conducted. For simplification, the model assumes that positive test results indicate drug
resistance to rifampicin and negative test results indicate TB without drug resistance to
rifampicin.

Laboratory Capacity

25.     Table 1 shows the assumptions concerning laboratory capacity of the satellite and
reference laboratories. Scores from the Stepwise Laboratory Improvement Process Towards
Accreditation (SLIPTA) are used as a proxy for testing quality/accuracy. We acknowledge that
high SLIPTA scores on laboratory processes do not necessarily translate to testing accuracy,
which can be better measured by external quality assessments. With this caveat in mind,
however, we assume that laboratories with high capacity, as indicated by the SLIPTA scores, are
assumed to have higher testing quality. This is reflected in the laboratory-specific values for
specificity and sensitivity for Xpert MTB/RIF tests. We also assume that the probability of the
laboratory correctly interpreting the test result is 100 percent for both laboratories because
interpretation of the Xpert MTB/RIF results is independent of laboratory capacity and relies
solely on the GeneXpert technology. Hence, better interpretation of test results, as depicted in
the generic decision analytic model, is not relevant for this analysis.

Treatment and Transmission

26.      Treatment occurs at the local health facility and is affected only by the availability of test
results, not where the test was performed. Once the test results are determined, the patient must
return to the local health facility for treatment. It is assumed that patient follow-up is affected by
the time it takes to return the test results. Therefore, the shorter distance from the patient to the
satellite laboratory relative to the reference laboratory increases the probability of follow-up,
which is reflected in the model.

27.    There are three different treatment options included in the model: (1) treat with
standardized second-line drugs; (2) treat with the retreatment regimen; or (3) no treatment.
Specific treatment options depend on the results of the Xpert MTB/RIF test. Positive test results


4
  We assume that reliance on part-time or volunteer labor to conduct testing, specifically Xpert MTB/RIF, reflects
insufficient staffing. The reference laboratory has a greater reliance on part-time or volunteer labor than the satellite
laboratory.
                                                           8
(that is, diagnosed with drug resistance to rifampicin) lead to treatment options (1) or (2). These
options occur because while the test detects drug resistance to rifampicin, medical providers may
prescribe the retreatment regimen rather than treatment with second-line drugs due to factors
such as shortages and/or costs of second-line drugs. On the other hand, negative test results (that
is, diagnosed with non-resistant TB) lead to treatment options (2) or (3). Medical providers may
ignore the results of the test and prescribe treatment empirically. Each of these treatment options
is related to a probability of the patients being cured, dying, defaulting (dropping out from
treatment), or not responding to treatment as shown in Table 2.

Note: The “Default/Nonresponse Rate” for untreated patients indicates the percent of remaining patients who have
neither been cured nor have died.

28.     As seen in Table 3, transmission of TB occurs at a rate of eight cases per year. The
transmission period of TB depends on the effectiveness of treatment. Specifically, patients who
are correctly diagnosed with MDR-TB or TB and are treated with second-line drugs or on a
retreatment regimen, respectively, and are cured, transmit only during the first month of
treatment. Similarly, the model assumes that all patients who die after correct diagnosis and
treatment do so after the first month of treatment and transmit during this first month. All other
cases (that is, false-negatives, false-positives treated with second-line drugs, defaulters/non-
responders, and cases who do not return for treatment) remain infectious over the entire two-year
period.

29.    We assume that primary cases transmit the disease strain of their mycobacteria (that is,
TB patients transmit TB and those with MDR-TB transmit MDR-TB). All secondary cases are

tested for MDR-TB using Xpert MTB/RIF and treatment for their particular strain of the
mycobacteria occurs at rates similar to the primary cases. This analysis focuses only on primary
and secondary cases, although the model allows for the inclusion of further cases generated by
secondary cases (that is, tertiary cases and beyond).

Testing data (Sensitivity and Specificity)

31.     We use the sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF to rifampicin as indicated in
Boehme, et al. (2010), where patients in Peru, Azerbaijan, South Africa and India were tested for
TB and resistance to rifampicin. The authors determined that Xpert MTB/RIF correctly
diagnosed resistant TB (sensitivity) 97.6 percent of the time and correctly determined no
resistance to rifampicin (specificity) in 98.3 percent of cases.

Cost

32.     At the time of data collection for this study, the laboratories had either not yet or just
recently started using the GeneXpert system. For purposes of this analysis, we assume that
testing with Xpert MTB/RIF had been implemented from the start of the study period and
estimate costs using actual and imputed costs of all elements of operations needed to perform the
test. We assume that inputs into Xpert MTB/RIF testing are fixed in the short-term (that is, labor,
materials and equipment, staff travel, utilities and rent, and investments in new infrastructure),
and that variable costs include the test-specific supplies (that is, specimen collection containers,
pipettes, and Xpert MTB/RIF cartridges needed for each sample).5

33.     Costs were assessed in 2012 US dollars. Cost data were collected from a satellite facility
in Kenya and a reference laboratory in Uganda, two of the countries participating in the East
Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project (EAPHLNP). Data were collected on the
costs of testing for TB (that is, SSM, mycobacterial culture, and Xpert MTB/RIF) over a one-year
period (May 1, 2011, to April 30, 2012).6 The costs of laboratory testing include costs incurred
for labor, materials and equipment, staff travel, utilities and rent, and infrastructure.

34.     Labor costs are calculated from annual salaries and pro-rated according to the time spent
on each of the tests. Rent per year is calculated based on floor space and equivalent monthly
rental values. Annualized equipment costs are calculated using the assumption of a 5-year life
expectancy and a discount rate of 3 percent. Investments in new infrastructure are also
annualized at a similar discount rate but over a 30-year life expectancy. Sources of data for these
cost components include interviews with staff and key officials, and administrative and project
records. Detailed information regarding the study design and data collection method can be found
in Appendix III.

                                                    LIMITATIONS

35.     We recognize important potential limitations that must be considered when interpreting
the findings, especially considering that this is only an illustration of how to apply the conceptual
model. First, due to limitations around data collection, we were unable to collect complete cost
data on the reference laboratory in Kenya. As a result, we use the reference laboratory in Uganda
as a proxy for a reference laboratory in Kenya under the assumption of similar laboratory
capacity and operating environments across the two laboratories. We recognize that these
laboratories may indeed have different characteristics and potentially costs that may confound the
findings. Depending on how these differences translate into cost discrepancies, this assumption
may overstate the incremental cost between the reference and satellite laboratories.


5
  Both the reference and satellite laboratories incur transportation costs for the delivery of tests. The model includes
only the incremental cost between the two facilities and subsumes this cost within the fixed costs of the reference
laboratory. The reference laboratory contracts with a private courier service that transports the specimen between
laboratories.
6
  Costs were also collected for the testing and diagnosis of HIV, but for the application of the model, we do not
separately model the HIV-related outcomes.
                                                          11
36.     Second, the application of the model relies on treatment costs and parameters of treatment
outcomes derived from the literature, in particular, studies conducted in Peru, a middle-income
country with a strong TB control program. None of the other studies reviewed that would be
more applicable to low-income countries clearly stated or included treatment costs or parameters
on treatment outcomes. This assumption, however, will not influence the main findings as the
treatment costs and outcome parameters are the same regardless of whether testing occurs at the
reference or satellite laboratory.

37.     Finally, the results of this application may not be generalizable to all settings due to a
possible correlation between testing performance and epidemiological setting (for example,
prevalence of TB and MDR-TB). Because the testing environment may influence the sensitivity
and specificity of the test, misdiagnosis and inadequate treatment may occur, especially if
treatment prescription is based solely on the result of Xpert MTB/RIF. This is especially true in
low TB prevalent areas. A recent study evaluated the performance of Xpert MTB/RIF in: (1) low
versus high TB prevalent settings; (2) HIV-positive and HIV-negative populations; and (3)
different sputum collection methods (Luetkemeyer et al., 2014). The study found that the
performance of Xpert MTB/RIF did not significantly vary with changes in these parameters and
suggests that confirmatory DST may not be necessary for treatment in these settings. However,
confirmatory DST may still be necessary for instance, in populations with increasing rifampicin
monoresistance; costs for confirmatory testing have not been included in this application but can
be easily incorporated into the conceptual framework.

                                   PART IV – FINDINGS
38.      The population tested is derived from the population in the catchment area of the satellite
laboratory and the assumptions presented in Table 4. We calculate the number of retreatment
patients (that is, those patients most likely to have developed drug resistance) presenting at the
satellite laboratory with symptomatic TB from the catchment area population and disease
probabilities (n=116 possible cases, of which 9 individuals possibly have MDR-TB and the
remaining 107 cases have TB).

                                            OUTCOMES

39.      Figure B shows how the differences in tests performed at each of the laboratories
translate into differences in treatment outcomes at each of the laboratories. Overall, testing at the
satellite laboratory results in more deaths averted through both cases cured and secondary cases
averted due to reduced transmission (688 cases due to satellite testing versus 581 cases through
the reference laboratory, or 58 percent versus 49 percent of all cases). Additionally, fewer cases
default (do not return for treatment) and more cases respond to treatment when tested at satellite
laboratory due to quicker turnaround of laboratory results.

                                                 13
40.    Table 5 shows that the satellite laboratory will test slightly fewer cases (n=1,132 cases)
than the reference laboratory (n=1,193 cases) since closer proximity of the satellite laboratory to
the patient reduces the transmission rate of TB. This results in fewer patients (primary and
secondary cases) acquiring MDR-TB or TB and fewer tests are required.

                                                     COSTS

41.     The unit cost of testing at the satellite laboratory under the model assumptions is lower
than the reference laboratory. The satellite laboratory performs an Xpert MTB/RIF test for
around US$35 per test, while the reference laboratory costs almost US$44, primarily because of
higher facility costs at the reference laboratory.

Note: Assumes a transmission rate of 8 new cases per year per infected patient. The transmission period is 1 month
for effective treatment and 24 months for ineffective treatment.




42.      Table 6 shows the average cost of treatment for TB and MDR-TB patients. While the
satellite laboratory tests slightly fewer patients (n=1,132; Table 5), more patients are treated
(n=907; Table 6). In other words, the satellite facility refers 80 percent of diagnosed cases for
treatment. On the other hand, the reference laboratory loses 197 patients who after testing never
return to the health clinic for treatment (Table 6). Primarily as a result of this patient loss to
treatment, the reference laboratory refers only 783 of the 1,193 cases tested for treatment, or 66
percent of diagnosed patients (see Table 5 and Table 6). Both the reference and satellite
laboratories fail to refer for treatment 214 and 225 cases diagnosed with TB, respectively, as a
result of negative test results.7 Neither the cases lost to follow-up nor the cases not treated incur
treatment costs. This is primarily due to the increased transmission that occurs from a higher
number of untreated patients tested at the reference laboratory. While treatment rates are assumed
to be the same at all facilities in this model (see Table 3), the number of untreated patients lost is
larger at the reference laboratory leading to a larger number of patients transmitting the disease
for longer periods of time. This could be further refined if data were available identifying actual
treatment rates for each facility and/or disease strain.

    Numbers may not add due to rounding.

                                                        14
43.     The satellite laboratory’s higher referral load for treatment subsequently leads to higher
treatment costs. Results from the reference laboratory resulted in the treatment of 783 patients at
a cost of $1,782 per patient treated. The satellite laboratory tests resulted in the treatment of 907
patients at a cost of $1,871 per patient treated, approximately $90 per patient higher than the
results from the reference laboratory. The difference in treatment costs stems primarily from the
additional 82 cases treated with the higher cost treatment regimen, using second line drugs. The
average cost per patient diagnosed at the reference laboratory and satellite laboratories and
subsequently treated is $1,848 and $1,915, respectively.

44.     Missing from these calculations are the savings achieved from averting additional cases
of MDR-TB or TB. Because the satellite laboratory is able to provide almost instantaneous
results, patients testing positive for MDR-TB or TB are not lost to follow-up. In fact, immediate
treatment of existing cases results in 61 secondary individuals who otherwise would have
contracted MDR-TB or TB remaining healthy. The savings in both testing ($2,123) and expected
treatment costs ($54,074)8 results in a total savings of $56,197 or $921 per secondary case
averted. These results are delineated in Table 6. On the other hand, testing in the reference
laboratory results in 12 primary and 185 secondary cases (Total =197) lost to follow-up. This
means that, not only are the individuals not being treated, they continue to spread the disease to
an additional 8 individuals annually for up to two years. Since the costs of tertiary cases and
beyond are not calculated here, the model is very conservative in its estimate of the impact on
patients lost due to both costs and clinical outcomes.




8
  The expected cost of treatment is calculated as [prevalence rate of MDR-TB*the number of secondary cases
averted*cost of 2nd line treatment] + [(1-prevalence rate of MDR-TB)*the number of secondary cases*cost of
retreatment regimen].

                                      COST-EFFECTIVENESS

45.     In order to better compare outcomes under the two scenarios, we look at these results in
terms of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs). DALYs are outcome measures that capture both
the mortality and morbidity of the disease, allowing for comparison across states (that is, death,
cure, non-treatment). Estimates of DALYs account for the benefits of timely and correct
treatment prescription and the corresponding reduced transmission. The lower treatment load and
the resulting lower number of cases cured for the satellite laboratory results in a higher number of
DALYs saved as a result of testing at the satellite laboratory (n=7,547) rather than the reference
laboratory (n=5,923).

46.     Combining both the costs of testing and treatment and the number of DALYs saved
reveal that investment in a new diagnostic technology for MDR-TB is cost-effective regardless of
placement in a satellite or reference laboratory. This can be seen in Table 7, which shows that
the satellite laboratory, on average, spends $230 per DALY saved and the reference laboratory
incurs $244 per DALY saved. Both average costs are well below $808, the per capita GDP of
Kenya, and hence can both be considered “very cost-effective” strategies (World Bank, 2012).

47.    As both testing through the reference and satellite laboratories are cost-effective, Table 7
also shows the incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICERs). ICERs measure how much
additional investment is required to save an additional DALY relative to the alternative
(comparator) scenario, or the ratio of the incremental cost and the incremental number of DALYs
saved. The resulting ICER indicates that by utilizing the satellite laboratory instead of the
reference laboratory, an additional 1,623 DALYs can be saved at a cost of only $179 per DALY.

                                   PART V – DISCUSSION
48.     The illustrated model describes a method for determining the most cost-effective facility
for performing a specific test under the existing laboratory structures and costs. In addition to
assessing the direct effects of changes to laboratory capacity, through the introduction of a new
technology, on public health outcomes, this study also evaluated the reduction of transmission of
infection as a result of the disease being successfully treated.

49.    Our analysis looks at the use of Xpert MTB/RIF assays at sites closest to the patient
population. Under conditions and assumptions outlined in the analysis, testing for MDR-TB
among retreatment patients at the satellite laboratory is more cost-effective than performing the
same test at a more-distant facility. This difference occurs partially because of lower test costs at
the satellite laboratory, but also because of the number of patients lost to follow-up when
required to wait for results from the reference laboratory. These patients continue to transmit the
disease over the entire treatment window of 24 months, which leads to increases in secondary
cases and the overall number of cases tested.

50.      One tension in the model is that costs include both testing and treatment costs.
Successful testing for MDR-TB results in more cases diagnosed. Treating MDR-TB is almost
five times as expensive as the retreatment regimen for TB. Testing at the satellite and the
reference laboratories results in a similar number of TB patients treated, but because patients fail
to return for treatment after testing by the reference laboratory, a larger number of the more
expensive MDR-TB patients tested at the satellite laboratory end up being treated. The end
result is that overall treatment costs resulting from testing at the satellite laboratory are far higher
than the costs associated with testing at the reference laboratory, negating any cost savings from
testing even with the inclusion of costs saved from secondary cases averted. Focusing solely on
treatment and testing costs fails to incorporate indirect costs from the increase in the burden of
the disease in the population, which is a byproduct of the patients with MDR-TB or TB not
receiving treatment and transmitting at an annual rate of 8 cases per patient. Incorporating the
benefits of testing and treating with the inclusion of DALYs captures this (Table 7). As a result,
testing at the satellite laboratory becomes a more cost-effective option than testing at the
reference laboratory.

51.     The model includes two pathways for patients to dropout: (1) during the diagnostic period
(“loss to follow-up”); and (2) prior to treatment. The reference laboratory loses almost 200 cases
to follow-up under the first pathway. These patients submit an initial specimen but fail to return.
Previous studies have examined patient dropout during TB diagnosis. Although these studies
focus more specifically on SSM diagnostics, many of the reasons remain applicable even with
Xpert MTB/RIF, especially if patients must return to receive their test results. A study in Malawi
found that the poor spent on average, 244 percent of their monthly income accessing TB
diagnostic services despite free diagnostic services (Kemp et al. 2007). These costs stemmed
from days lost of work, transportation, and food costs during care-seeking episodes.


                                                  19
52.     Other reasons for failure to follow-up include dissatisfaction with public health services
(Rao et al. 2009), in particular long waiting lines (MacPerson et al. 2014). This reason may hold
truer for those cases that receive no treatment even after receiving their test results (that is, the
second pathway prior to treatment). In the model, reference and satellite laboratories fail to treat
214 and 225 TB cases, respectively. Patients may also refuse treatment due to not completely
understanding the sequelae of TB, the benefits of treatment or an inability to miss work for
treatment. A recent systematic review quantifying the rate of pre-treatment loss to follow-up
found that, between 6 to 38 percent of patients fail to return for treatment in sub-Saharan Africa
(MacPerson et al. 2014).

53.     The decision analytic model presented allows a public health administrator to determine
the most cost-effective investment in the laboratory network. The model itself is flexible enough
to incorporate a multitude of scenarios such as determining the most cost-effective location of a
diagnostic test, as illustrated here, or looking across multiple tests and multiple laboratories and
deciding the most cost-effective placement of each.

54.     The decision analytic model can also be useful in determining how to strengthen
laboratories to perform epidemiological monitoring to detect disease outbreaks. An efficient
surveillance system would enable countries or regions to detect the emergence and spread of
diseases. Public health officials may need to decide where to invest resources to increase the
surveillance capacity of the laboratory network, for instance, in laboratory personnel, computer
equipment, diagnostic testing or even a quality assurance program.

                USE OF DECISION ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE COST-EFFECTIVENESS

56.     Decision analysis incorporates measures of effectiveness and costs in the unified
framework. Put together, these enable an evaluation of the relative value of laboratory investment
strategies through a cost-effectiveness analysis. The fundamental metric in this analysis is the
incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER), which is the ratio of incremental costs to
incremental health or economic benefits between alternative strategies. In resource-constrained
regions, cost-effectiveness thresholds are informed by the recommendations of the Commission
on Macroeconomics and Health (sponsored by WHO). These recommendations specify that
interventions may be considered “very cost-effective” if they have an ICER less than the
country’s per-capita GDP and “cost-effective” if they have an ICER between one and three times
the per-capita GDP.

57.    In order to determine the cost-effectiveness of alternative investments, this project
incorporates the use of a simplified decision tree approach as shown in Figures II-A to II-C. The
decision tree determines and compares the results of conducting testing under different laboratory
network structures or regimes:

      1. Using laboratories at different levels of the network structure or a regime without a
         regional network capacity
      2. Regional cooperation and an expanded and strengthened laboratory network.


58.      The model captures the impact of following components:

      1. Laboratory Capacity
             Investments in laboratory infrastructure and human capacity, specifically in the
                expansion of the number laboratories (at the satellite, reference, and supra-
                regional levels)
             Increased availability of equipment and supplies, higher quality equipment,

Inputs: Laboratory Capacity

60.     The decision tree in Figure II-A shows the laboratory capacity along one line of a branch
of the simplified decision tree utilized in this analysis.10 The decision tree accounts for the
viability of the specimen received from the health facility, the availability of equipment, the
quality of the equipment, the availability of supplies, inventory control, staffing, and training and
mentoring of personnel (Ninci et al., 2004; Marinucci et al., 2011; Addo et al., 2010; Walker,
2001).

Outputs: Laboratory Results

61.     Additional laboratory systems, including management information systems (MIS) for
monitoring and evaluations, can aid in the performance of a laboratory. Having these systems in
place can increase the number of tests performed and improve accuracy. All of these laboratory
factors contribute to whether the timely test results will be delivered and communicated to the
health care provider (Salinas et al., 2010; Bell et al., 2006; Kay et al., 2006), as shown in Figure
II-B.

     Much of the specific information analyzed in the lab has been collapsed for ease of illustration. More detailed
      information about the expanded decision tree, including the indicators measured, can be found below.

Outcomes: Health

62.      Figure II-C illustrates the resulting treatment options and effects, as well as the ensuing
effect on the measured outcome that results from treatment (Bisoffi et al., 2011). The laboratory-
specific sensitivity and specificity of the test will influence outcomes. Patient loss to treatment
often occurs when patients must return multiple times after specimen collection but prior to the
initiation of treatment. The decision tree accounts for this patient loss and the resulting
outcomes. Once the patient does return for treatment, the treatment options may include treating
with drugs or even no treatment, which can also be included in the model. Patients then are
cured, die, or default/non-respond (that is, drop-out or do not respond) to treatment.

                                            STUDY DESIGN

64.     As part of the development of a generic framework applicable across multiple diseases
and situations, ICF developed a set of indicators for measuring the economic and health impacts
from improved laboratory services, taking into account the type of data that are readily available
or can easily be collected. Data for these indicators were obtained from the literature, secondary
data, expert opinion, and primary data collection.

65.     Primary data collection was conducted via rapid assessment and included collection of
retrospective cost and outcome data and interviews with key personnel. The cost data collected
through the processes described below allows assessments of per test costs and effects of various
program activities (for example, mentorship, management information systems) on the costs and
outputs.

66.    Primary data were collected on tests for HIV, TB, and drug resistance. The specific tests
for which program costs are assessed are the following:

67.      HIV

      Rapid HIV for initial disease detection

      Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of HIV antibodies in blood samples

      Western blot for confirmation of HIV antibodies after a positive ELISA test

      CD4 count to determine when to begin treatment for HIV infection

      Viral load to determine the level of activity of HIV disease and also to indicate if the
         medication regimen is working

68.      Tuberculosis

      Sputum smear microscopy (SSM) for initial detection of TB

      Mycobacterial culture for definitive diagnosis of tuberculosis

      Xpert MTB/RIF to identify mycobacterium tuberculosis complex and detect resistance to
         rifampicin (RIF)

Economic Costs of Testing

69.     Laboratory costs were collected through the retrospective review of existing program
records. This included interviews of key personnel involved with supporting or managing
laboratory sites. Data on the volume of specific TB and HIV tests performed and indicators of
test quality (for example, number of tests that are false positive or false negative, test turn-around

                                                   40
time) were extracted from the management information systems or other recordkeeping systems.
A combination of cost data and the data on the number, and quality, of tests performed allows for
the calculation of the cost per test for tests considered in the analysis. Additional interviews were
conducted to assess the significance of various program activities (for example, mentorship) in
improving laboratory performance.

Cost Collection and Time Frame

70.    Cost data were collected at multiple laboratories to assess the total economic costs
incurred over a one-year period (May 1, 2011, to April 30, 2012).

Categories for Analysis

71.     Costs can be evaluated by type of test performed, inputs needed, sources of support, and
program activities. These categories are designed to reveal the portion of total costs devoted to
each type of laboratory test, different laboratory activities, the portion of total costs devoted to
different input types, and the portion of total costs borne by each organization involved in
supporting the laboratories. By doing so, the analysis presents a detailed description of the
resource flow through the laboratories.

Test Performed

72.    Cost data at each facility are collected to assess the cost of each test performed.
Information about costs specific to each test were collected along with general and administrative
costs that are incurred by the facility and are shared across tests. Information about costs
incurred by tests not considered in the analysis is also collected to give a full financial picture for
each laboratory.

Inputs

73.    In order to assess the total costs at each facility, the costs of each individual input used at
each laboratory were collected. The date of the expense as well as the portion of the cost used
towards laboratory testing efforts was collected. Specific information, including descriptions and
comments about factors that may affect the analysis were also included in the collection process.
Table III-1 delineates the input categories that were used, further breaking them down into
recurrent costs and investment costs.

Sources of Support

74.     For each cost item collected, all sources of financial or in-kind support are considered in
order to provide complete information on the laboratory’s financial support. These are shown in
Table III-2. The sources of support (for example, host country government, regional partners,
multilateral partners) and their relative share of support are tracked for each site. Costs per test
are then calculated and can be disaggregated according to the source of support.



                                                  41
Program Cost Categories

75.     As well as assessing total costs and costs per test, cost data are disaggregated according to
program-relevant themes. This allows for a further analysis of the use of the inputs and the extent
to which they are used to conduct the testing activity. The program categories relevant to this
analysis are shown in Table III-3.

      The full cost of personnel employed for activities related to testing services. Includes
         salaries or wages; employer share of taxes and fringe benefits; housing,

                                              DATA COLLECTION

76.      Primary data were collected from government organizations, national reference
laboratories, district-level hospital laboratories, and supporting implementing partners. We
interviewed key officials and staff members in Uganda and Kenya, two of the countries
participating in the East Africa Public Health Laboratory Networking Project (EAPHLNP). The
facilities and organizations interviewed and providing records include the following:
                                                         44
   Ministry of Public Health and Sanitation; Division of Leprosy, TB & Lung Diseases
      (DLTLB); Nairobi, Kenya

   Ministry of Health; National TB and Leprosy Program (NTLP); Kampala, Uganda.

   National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL), Kampala, Uganda.

   National TB Reference Laboratory (NTRL), Nairobi, Kenya

   Central Public Health Laboratories (CPHL), Kampala, Uganda

   National HIV Reference Laboratory (NHRL), Nairobi, Kenya

   Kenya Medical Research Institute (KeMRI), Nairobi, Kenya

   Malindi District Hospital, Malindi, Kenya

   Gulu Regional Referral Hospital, Gulu, Uganda.

   St. Mary’s Hospital Lacor, Gulu District, Uganda

77.     In Kenya, two data collectors visited each of the district laboratories, and each of the data
collection visits lasted two days. Prior to the site visits, the District Medical Officer of Health,
the Medical Superintendent, and the administrator in charge of the laboratory (Lab-in-Charge) for
each of the district labs were informed about the nature of the study and were provided with an
introduction letter from the Ministry of Health. The data collectors provided the Lab-in-Charge
with a list of the specific types of information that were required for the study. Informing the lab
manager in advance of the visit helped to ensure that the lab manager and staff were prepared for
the visit and gave them time to organize materials prior to the visit.

78.     At the site visit, the data collection team met with the Medical Superintendent and Lab-
In-Charge, reviewed the purpose of the evaluation, and provided them with a detailed description
of the types of data to be collected. Data collection involved gathering information from a variety
of staff, including the medical superintendent, hospital administrator, hospital data officer,
District Medical Officer of Health, District Medical Lab Technologist, Lab-in-Charge, lab staff,
TB clinic staff, and ART clinic staff. The data collectors reviewed administrative records
(including financial reports, EQA reports, equipment maintenance logs, test-specific registers,
monthly reports, accounts, procurement records and personnel records) maintained by the
laboratory. In cases where documentation was absent, the data collectors gathered information to
make estimates whenever possible. In cases where documentation exists but was not readily
available, the data collectors continued to make attempts to follow up and obtain this
information, to varying degrees of success.


                                                 45
79.     In Uganda, one data collector met with visited the Kampala NTRL for one day and spent
half a day at each district laboratory. Due to the limited amount of time available for collection,
on-site data collection was limited to assessment of time use (test-specific and program activity)
and other information that was eased by face-to-face contact. MIS information and any other
information that could be easily sent through email or which required time to coordinate, was
pursued after the site visits.

80.    Data collection at the laboratories focused on (1) administrative data regarding laboratory
processes, reporting, training and mentoring programs, and, in Kenya, (2) cost data. Specific
information was gathered to identify the processes and costs of the eight previously identified
tests:

   Rapid HIV test

   ELISA

   Western blot

   CD4 count

   Viral load

   Sputum smear microscopy

   Mycobacterial culture

   Xpert MTB/RIF

Administrative Data

81.     The administrative data collected included recent epidemiological data (diseases
incidence and prevalence at the national level and in the catchment areas of the laboratories
where the data were being collected), number and types of tests sent to higher level labs
(including reference laboratories overseas) as well as turnaround times of those tests, results of
testing quality assessments, and training and mentoring programs. Administrative data collected
from the satellite laboratories were supplemented by data obtained from the Ministry of Health
and the national reference laboratories. Questionnaires for the collection of administrative data
can be found in Appendix IV.

Cost Data

82.     Cost data collected included type, quantity and cost of resources used specifically for the
tests identified, as well as resources shared across all tests for the general management of the lab
(for example, time spent by the Lab-in-Charge for the overall management of the lab, utilities for
the whole hospital) during the study time period. Resources include personnel, equipment,

Data Collection Instrument for Ministry, SRL, and NRL



Data will be collected from the Ministry of Health (Ministry), the National Reference
Laboratories (NRL) for TB and HIV, and the Supranational Laboratories for TB and HIV.

This file should be saved separately for each country. The combined information from the
Ministry, NRLs, and SRLs (for both HIV and TB) should all be included in one document.




Before proceeding, a new version of this file should be saved as

         C.    On-site tests: Measuring adequate resources

         For each resource category and test, please fill in the percentage of required resources you have available for each test.

         For example, in staffing, 50% would indicate half the staff needed to perform all tests in a timely manner; 100% is fully staffed;
         anything over 100% indicates overstaffing.

         If reporting a percentage presents difficulties, ask if there is adequate staffing/equipment/supplies, yes (code as ≥ 100) or no (code as
         < 100%). Then see if the estimate can be refined (for example, they have exactly the right amount of staffing (100%), more than
         adequate (>100%).

                                                                                     If test is not performed, please indicate reason

         E. On-site tests: Measuring viable specimens
         Please indicate the percentage of specimens rejected for each test. If possible, try to separate between on-site specimen
         collection and specimens received from other labs (and, if available, further separate between specimens received from
         network lab and out-of-network labs).
         (This should come from the Specimen Rejection Logbook. If logbook is not available, ask for qualitative estimates for any
         period.)

1. General Information
This Instrument is designed to collect information on the costs of HIV and tuberculosis treatment. One instrument should be used for each treatment facility. Within the instrument each page
collects a different type of information. The first page collects general project information and defines time period for the costing, the second page records codes to be used in subsequent parts
of the document. Subsequent pages collect cost information by input type. Each page can be accessed through clicking on one of the links at the bottom of this page.
Light blue cells are calculation cells (not for data entry).

Laboratories provide essential services to the health sector on the monitoring and treatment of disease. Routine
implementation of new diagnostic techniques may be costly; therefore, understanding their clinical utility, impact, and
cost-effectiveness are necessary to guide decisions as to whether and how such techniques should be implemented.
In this study, the authors design a conceptual framework for examining the following: (1) optimal mix of laboratory
services at different levels of the health system; (2) combination of resources required within laboratories to promote
efficiency; and (3) potential for outsourcing to promote cost containment. The framework considers both the health
and economic rationale for laboratory investments. The authors then use the conceptual framework to inform a
decision analytics model that maps out the health and economic impact of laboratory investments, and to illustrate the
model by investigating the best placement of a new technology (GeneXpert) for detecting multi-drug-resistant
tuberculosis (MDR-TB). The illustrative application of the model shows that investment in a new diagnostic technology
for MDR-TB is cost-effective regardless of placement in a district-level (satellite) or national-level (reference)
laboratory. Placement of the GeneXpert system at the satellite laboratory results in patients tested for MDR-TB or TB
at lower costs than the reference laboratory. Furthermore, if testing occurs at the satellite laboratory, more primary
and secondary cases are treated and cured than if testing was conducted at the reference laboratory, leading to better
outcomes. Overall, testing at the satellite laboratory results in more deaths averted and more disability life-adjusted
years (DALYs) saved. Both facilities have average costs per DALY well below the WHO-suggested threshold for the
per capita gross domestic product (GDP). However, the satellite laboratory saves more DALYs at a lower additional
cost per DALY.
