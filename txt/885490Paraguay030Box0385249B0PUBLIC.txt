I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Paraguay
        perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Paraguay regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Paraguay;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Paraguay;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               work and activities, and communication and information sharing in Paraguay; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Paraguay.
       Use data to help inform Paraguay country team’s strategy.


II. Methodology
In May and June 2013, 260 stakeholders of the World Bank in Paraguay were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President; the office of a
Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or
implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-supported
projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project;
local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector
organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based
organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-based
groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 152
stakeholders participated in the country survey (58% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via courier and returned completed questionnaires
similarly. Respondents were asked about: general issues facing Paraguay; their overall attitudes
toward the World Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the World Bank’s
knowledge work and activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in
Paraguay; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Paraguay.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing Paraguay: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Paraguay is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the most important development
   priorities, which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating economic
   growth in Paraguay, and how to best achieve “shared prosperity”.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with and the effectiveness of the World Bank, Inter-American Development Bank, and Latin
   American Development Bank. Respondents were asked to rate Bank staff preparedness to
   help Paraguay solve its development challenges, their agreement with various statements
   regarding the Bank’s work, the extent to which the Bank is an effective development partner,
   and that the Bank’s services meet the national development needs of Paraguay. Respondents
   were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the
   Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work,
   and with which stakeholder groups the Bank should collaborate more.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Paraguay, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Paraguay’s needs for knowledge services and financial instruments, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across eighteen development areas, such as social protection.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge Work and Activities: Respondents were asked to indicate
   how frequently they consult Bank knowledge work and activities, the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its knowledge work and activities, and to rate the quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge work and activities, including how significant of a contribution it makes to
   development results and its technical quality. Respondents were also asked if they consulted
   the most recent LAC Flagship Report and if so, to evaluate it.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Paraguay: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank and international development cooperation should play in
   Paraguay’s development in the near future and to what extent they believe the Bank has
   moved in the right direction over the last three years. Respondents were also asked to
   indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Paraguay and which
   services the Bank should offer more of in Paraguay.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their Internet access, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy .
   Respondents were also asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Paraguay, and geographic location.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 154 respondents (34% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2008. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

Current Position
       For further analyses, respondents from the office of a Minister were combined with those
        from the office of the President; respondents from PMUs were combined with consultants
        working on Bank-supported projects; respondents from private foundations and CBOs
        were combined with NGOs; respondents from the financial sector/private banks were
        combined with those from the private sector; and the few respondents from local
        government, bilateral agencies, and trade unions were included in the “Other” category.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)

Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)

       There were several instances in which there were statistically significant stakeholder
        group differences across these eighteen areas of development. For the most part,
        consultants on Bank-supported projects gave the highest ratings for the Bank’s
        effectiveness across these areas whereas respondents from the office of a Parliamentarian
        and the private sector/financial sector/private banks tended to give significantly lower
        effectiveness ratings. Those areas with significant stakeholder group differences were:
                “Anti-corruption”;
                “Transport”;
                “Basic infrastructure”;

Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Paraguay, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the eighteen specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results incr ease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development resu lts.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Paraguay. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at law and justice;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport;

        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Paraguay, suggesting that ratings of
        effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
                The Bank’s effectiveness at basic infrastructure;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at crime and violence;
                The Bank’s effectiveness at transport; and
                The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth.
