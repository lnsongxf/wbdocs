To better understand dynamics of agricultural risks and identify appropriate responses,
incorporate agricultural risk perspective into decision making, and build capacity of
local stakeholders in risk assessment and management, the Agricultural Risk Manage-
ment Team (ARMT) of the Agriculture and Environment Services Department of the
World Bank is conducting an agricultural sector risk assessment in Senegal. The cur-
rent report was developed by a team led by Stephen D’Alessandro and comprising
Amadou Abdoulaye Fall, George Grey, Kersten Hell, Traci Johnson, Simon Simpkin,
Kilara Suit, and Abdrahmane Wane.

The team is especially grateful to Aifa Fatimata Ndoye Niane and Vikas Choudhary
of the World Bank for their support and inputs throughout the activity’s planning,
fieldwork mission, and report preparation. The team would also like to extend its
appreciation to Maguette Diop Ndiaye of the Ministry of Economics and Finance, the
Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Equipment, other government representatives,
farmers, market traders, and all those who shared their perspective and insights, which
provided the basis for this study and its findings.

This activity would not have been possible without the generous contributions from
USAID, Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Government of the Netherlands and State
Secretariat for Economic Affairs (SECO) of the Government of Switzerland.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Senegal’s agricultural economy today accounts for roughly one-sixth of national gross
domestic product (GDP), down from nearly one-quarter in the mid-1980s. Although
sector output has expanded by 70 percent over the past 30 years, population growth
has quadrupled. During this period, successive government policies have promoted
intensiﬁcation of crop and livestock production via supportive policies and public
investments.1 And yet, growth has been lackluster amid limited take-up of improved
seeds and fertilizer consumption that remains among the lowest in the region. A major
limiting factor has been widespread reluctance among the millions of smallholder
farmers in Senegal who dominate production to assume the risks associated with
increased productivity. With only limited capacity to manage these risks, highly vulner-
able farmers choose to limit their exposure by limiting their outlays. Moreover, unman-
aged risks have a profound impact on sector performance. A sound understanding of
the risks faced by farmers and other agricultural sector stakeholders enables develop-
ment of risk management systems that can at once support new productivity invest-
ments, strengthen resilience, reduce losses, and drive sector growth.

This agricultural risk assessment study was undertaken to provide a review of produc-
tion, market, and enabling environment risks facing farmers and other stakeholders
across Senegal’s agriculture sector. The report has been compiled with extensive anal-
ysis of crop and livestock production, price, and meteorological data records over the
period 1980–2012. It includes a review of key documentary evidence of yield and risk
events together with input from interviews held with farmers, traders, processors and
others in rural Senegal as well as with government and agricultural research staﬀ
between March and May 2014. The results of the analysis are considered in the light
of the vulnerability of the diﬀerent stakeholders to the eﬀects of ex post shock events
and the resulting ex ante impact upon investment. The most salient issues and results
of this analysis are outlined in the text of the report. A considerable volume of sup-
porting data is supplied in the appendixes, including (1) an analysis of cumulative
rainfall during 1980–2013; (2) an assessment of levels of vulnerability among key

INTRODUCTION
Risks are a pervasive and permanent ﬁxture of the agricultural landscape. They are
also costly. Unchecked, they breed uncertainty and stiﬂe investments. For a given rate
of return, the higher the risk associated with an agricultural enterprise, the lower the
level of investment that it can attract. On the aggregate, this can have a debilitating
impact on sector growth. This is especially true when risk is ampliﬁed by a limited
capacity to absorb shocks. When risks do manifest, they can cause substantial losses to
income and assets—especially among the most vulnerable communities—placing
livelihoods, and in extreme cases, sector growth, in jeopardy. Failing to address
agricultural risk can severely hamper long-term economic growth and poverty
reduction eﬀorts.

The performance of Senegal’s agricultural performance exempliﬁes the impact of
unmanaged risk on productivity among vulnerable smallholder crop producers and
pastoralists. Despite the fact that well over half (57.1 percent in 2012) of the popula-
tion lives in rural areas and derives some portion of its livelihood from agriculture, the
sector itself contributes less than one-ﬁfth (16.7 percent in 2012) to GDP, according
to the World Bank. Despite several years of strong performance, sector growth has
averaged 2.3 percent since 1980, amid notable volatility in year-on-year performance
(ﬁgure 1.1).

A succession of agricultural strategies designed to increase productivity has largely
failed to intensify production beyond a subsistence level, and much of the country,
although suitable for agriculture, remains underdeveloped. Keeping risks in check,
shielding the most vulnerable, and building resilience among all agricultural stake-
holders to better withstand and recover from inevitable shocks requires moving from
ad hoc interventions to proactive, systematic and sustained risk management.

The government of Senegal has historically responded to drought and other shocks
with direct ﬁnancial support to farmers as well as general assistance to the rural popu-
lation. More recently, GOS put in place a series of emergency response and ﬁnancial
mechanisms to help aﬀected communities better cope with shocks and enhance ﬂows
of rural credit. These include the Fonds de Boniﬁcation, Fonds de Garantie, and the

AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS IN SENEGAL
To inform the analysis and discussion of agricultural risk in Senegal, this chapter
presents an overview of the country’s agriculture sector. The most pertinent sector
characteristics related to risk are given particular attention. The analysis primarily
covers the 33-year period from 1980 to 2012 to assess the frequency and severity of the
most important risks.

AGRICULTURE SECTOR IN SENEGAL
Table 2.1 shows the key economic indicators for Senegal with notable import to agri-
culture. Of particular relevance is the fact that while approximately 57.1 percent2 of
the population lives in rural areas and is largely dependent upon agriculture, over the
ﬁve years up to 2012, agriculture and associated activities generated only 16.7 per-
cent of national GDP, according to the World Bank’s World Development Indicators.
Considering the current GDP of US$14.05 billion and a population of 13.73 mil-
lion, it is evident that there is considerable discrepancy in rural vs. urban incomes.
Whereas per capita GDP may be US$1,023, the average per capita value added for
the population dependent upon agriculture is US$300; the rest of the largely urban
population is 6.7 times higher (US$2,000). This is due largely to the relatively low
output of the country’s agricultural production systems, which generate less than
US$1.00 per capita per day. This suggests that the bulk of agricultural activity is of a
subsistence nature.

In fact, the level of production is inadequate to meet national demand and Senegal
imports signiﬁcant volumes of food. Food imports in 2012 were worth US$1,546 mil-
lion, or 11 percent of GDP and up to 26 percent of total imports by value, according
to the World Bank. Senegal’s exports are valued at slightly over 50 percent of total
imports and the current account is balanced largely through a combination of remit-
tances and development assistance.

 According to the World Bank, Senegal has one of the highest levels of urbanization in Africa, estimated at
42.9 percent in 2012 and growing at a rate of 3.6 percent per year.

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS
The main sources of risk in Senegal’s agricultural sector are reviewed in this chapter.
These include production risks, market risks, and a general set of risks associated with
the enabling environment for agriculture. The incidence and implications of multiple
or successive shocks are also considered.


PRODUCTION RISKS
In terms of production, the most important factor contributing to agricultural risk is
weather. Other factors include crop pests and diseases (both before and after harvest),
windstorms, bush ﬁres, and livestock diseases having weak response mechanisms. Each
of these factors is considered in more detail below.

WEATHER RISKS
Weather-related risks manifest mainly through extremes of temperature and precipita-
tion. In the former case, the actual impact of extreme temperatures upon crop yields
in Senegal is uncertain. Over the past 40 years, mean annual temperatures across
Senegal have increased rapidly (averaging 0.19°C per decade), but prior to that period,
mean annual temperatures had decreased substantially, so that current mean annual
temperatures have only recently regained the levels experienced at the beginning of
the last century (ﬁgure 3.1).

Extreme Temperatures
Although it is evident that high temperatures that inhibit plant production (generally
in excess of 35°C) will occasionally occur during the growing season, their impact is
not easily determined, because it will often have been confounded by moisture stress.
Similarly, the impact of extreme cold is not easily measured because it occurs so rarely
in Senegal (although an important exception is the impact of cold rain upon weakened
livestock, as happened in 2002). Extreme temperatures may well constrain production,
but although changes in the frequency and impact of extreme temperature anomalies
can be modeled (see appendix A), they are not empirically evident. Temperature per
se is rarely considered by stakeholders as a contributory factor to crop production risk,
and does not feature as an observed cause of ex post impacts.

CHAPTER FOUR
ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL
RISKS
The frequency, severity, and costs of adverse events are analyzed in this chapter as the
basis for prioritizing the various sources of risk. The conceptual and methodological
basis described below is then applied to production, market, and enabling environ-
ment risks. The various sources of risk are then reviewed to discern the most critical.

CONCEPTUAL AND METHODOLOGICAL
BASIS FOR ANALYSIS
For the purposes of this study, risk is deﬁned as an exposure to a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial
loss or other adverse outcome whose occurrence and severity is unpredictable. Risk
thus implies exposure to substantive losses, over and above the normal costs of doing
business. In agriculture, farmers incur moderate losses each year as the result of unex-
pected events such as suboptimal climatic conditions at diﬀerent times in the produc-
tion cycle and/or modest departures from expected output or input prices. Risk refers
to the more severe and unpredictable adverse events that occur beyond these smaller
events.

This concept diﬀers from the common perception of “risk” by farmers and traders,
based on the year-to-year variability of production and prices. It should also be distin-
guished from constraints, which are predictable and constant limitations to productiv-
ity and growth and which contribute to ineﬃciencies in production and marketing
systems.


LOSS THRESHOLDS
As agricultural production is inherently variable, the immediate step for analysis is to
deﬁne loss thresholds, which distinguish adverse events from smaller, inter-annual varia-
tions in output. This is achieved by ﬁrst estimating a time trend of “expected” produc-
tion in any given year, based on actual production, and treating the downside diﬀerence
between actual and expected production as a measure of loss. A loss threshold of 0.33
standard deviation from trend is then set to distinguish between losses resulting from

CHAPTER FIVE
VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS
All stakeholders in agricultural value chains assume some level of risk. Vulnerability
presents when the potential impact of risk events is greater than a stakeholder’s capac-
ity to absorb adverse impacts. This may be because knowledge of the frequencies or
impacts of risk events is inadequate (as a result, for example, of unforeseen changes in
climate) or because actions that might otherwise limit the level of risk assumed are
constrained by circumstances so that involuntary exposure to risk is increased. (This is
especially true where capacity for adaptation lags behind changing circumstances.)
A more comprehensive analysis of the factors contributing to vulnerability is presented
in appendix C. Its key conclusions and relevance to diﬀerent types of stakeholders are
listed below.

Table 5.1 provides a simple ranking of risks reported by smallholders (Wane and
Galandou 2012). The most oft-cited risk, reported by almost 50 percent of households,
highlights their perceived vulnerability to food price shocks. This is indicative of high
levels of market dependence because of insuﬃcient productive capacity together with
low levels of oﬀ-farm income. It is perhaps notable that the most important vulnerabil-
ity is not to a risk inherent to agricultural production but to rural households as con-
sumers. Initiatives designed to increase the prices paid for staple crops may well expose
households to higher levels of vulnerability if not accompanied by other measures.

The second most oft-cited risk also relates to cash dependence and the limited ﬁnan-
cial resources of producers that constrain their capacity to deal with increases in the
costs of inputs. It is again signiﬁcant that although this shock does aﬀect agricultural
production, it is mediated through local input markets rather than through a physical
event such as drought or disease. The same is true for the fourth most important area
of vulnerability, that is, the loss of productive capacity through death, disease, or dis-
ability, which altogether aﬀect almost 25 percent of households. These shocks may
aﬀect agricultural production, but the eﬀect is not upon the agricultural production
system itself.

It is only the third most frequently cited risk event (poor rains), reported by nearly one-
quarter (23.8 percent) of households, that has a direct eﬀect on agricultural production

RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
Previous sections have highlighted sources of risks that are pervasive across the Senega-
lese agriculture landscape. These risks are both numerous and complex. They manifest
with varying levels of frequency and severity, and can cause substantial losses to crops and
livestock, with profound short-term and long-term impacts on income and livelihoods.
Putting in place eﬀective risk management measures can help mitigate adverse impacts
on agricultural supply chains and the livelihoods they support. However, it is virtually
impossible to address all risks at once. Thus, it is necessary to prioritize interventions
based on which risks occur most frequently and which cause the greatest ﬁnancial losses.

RISK PRIORITIZATION
Using quantitative measures and anecdotal evidence collected directly from stakehold-
ers, this analysis has evaluated risks for the crop and livestock subsectors. Owing to the
lack of reliable data, some of the risks could not be quantiﬁed. In such cases, the
assessment team relied more on qualitative measures. Based on the team’s combined
quantitative and qualitative assessment, table 6.1 prioritizes the most important risks.
This prioritization was presented during a roundtable at MEF in Dakar on March 21,
2014. It provides a basic ranking of agricultural risks on the basis of the probability of
the event occurring and the anticipated impacts in terms of ﬁnancial losses. The iden-
tiﬁed risks located in the grayer areas represent the most signiﬁcant risks.

Overall, this prioritization identiﬁed (1) erratic rainfall, punctuated by drought; (2)
locusts; (3) price volatility; and (4) crop pest and diseases as the most important risks
facing Senegal’s agricultural sector. Parasitic weeds such as Striga, aﬂatoxin contami-
nation (maize, groundnuts) and other postharvest threats, and livestock diseases were
also deemed important, but to a lesser extent.

It is worth noting that incidences of drought have declined signiﬁcantly within the most
recent decade, but it remains unclear whether this change is temporary or rather the
result of a shift in long-term weather patterns. Although an observed wetting over
roughly the same period has led to recurrent ﬂooding in many parts of the country,
aﬀecting urban and coastal areas, impacts on crop and livestock production have been
limited at the aggregate level.

CLIMATE CHANGE IMPACTS ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
Climate change is a long-term trend that will exacerbate natural resource constraints on
agricultural production in Senegal by making weather patterns more variable, and
increasing the frequency and intensity of severe weather events. As result, climate change
will directly aﬀect the incidence of some agricultural risk events and indirectly aﬀect the
incidence of others. Understanding how climate change trends aﬀect farm productivity
is essential to formulating an agricultural risk management plan that maximizes the use
of scarce resources. Regardless of the future extent of global warming, identifying and
implementing risk management strategies that address agricultural risks, including those
exacerbated by climate change, can reduce volatility and improve sustainability in the
sector.

VULNERABILITY TO CLIMATE CHANGE
In the Mapping the Impacts of Climate Change index under “Agricultural Productivity Loss,”
the Center for Global Development ranks Senegal sixth out of 233 countries globally for
“direct risks” due to “physical climate impacts” and 23rd out of 233 for “overall vulner-
ability” due to “physical impacts adjusted for coping ability” (Wheeler 2011).

Like most of the countries in the Sahel region, Senegal’s agricultural sector is highly
vulnerable to the eﬀects of climate change. The country’s climate is already charac-
terized by high temperatures and low, highly variable annual precipitation, factors
that negatively aﬀect the productivity of heat-sensitive crops. More than 95 percent
of the total cropped area depends on rain-fed systems, and most farmers and herd-
ers practice traditional forms of agriculture (Khouma et al. 2013, 319). Because of
these factors and the importance of the sector in Senegal’s national economy, cli-
mate change impacts on crop yields and land suitability will have far-reaching
eﬀects.

The agricultural sector accounts for approximately 15 percent of GDP and is an
important source of foreign exchange earnings. Agriculture also plays a key role in

SENEGAL VULNERABILITY ANALYSIS

INTRODUCTION
Agricultural shocks are one important factor driving chronic poverty and food insecu-
rity in Senegal. Shocks aﬀect household well-being in a variety of ways, by limiting
food availability, weakening food access, and negatively aﬀecting monetary well-being
through the depletion of productive assets. Chronically vulnerable groups with high
exposure to hazards experience a disproportionate impact from adverse events and
lack coping mechanisms available to other groups. In this context, vulnerability is a
useful lens through which to examine agricultural shocks because it allows policy mak-
ers to determine which groups are most aﬀected and to target risk management solu-
tions accordingly.

GENERAL TRENDS
Rural households are more likely to be poor and food insecure than are urban house-
holds in Senegal. In rural districts, 15.1 percent of households are severely or moder-
ately food insecure, compared with 8.6 percent in urban districts. Malnutrition, a
direct cause of food insecurity, is signiﬁcantly higher in rural areas: almost 20 percent
of rural children under age ﬁve are stunted, compared with 9 percent of children in
urban zones. Important sources of vulnerability in the rural environment include (1)
poor access to markets, (2) low levels of educational attainment and poor quality edu-
cation, and (3) lack of diversity in income opportunities. All three factors increase the
vulnerability of households to food insecurity and aﬀect rural communities more
acutely than urban ones.

APPENDIX C
AGRICULTURAL INSURANCE IN SENEGAL
Agriculture is important for Senegal. It contributes 20 percent to GDP and provides
employment to 60 percent of its workforce. It is key to food security and to protect the
country against the increasing ﬂuctuations of international food prices, which saw rice
prices triple in 2007–08.

The increase of agriculture productivity is a paramount objective of the government
of Senegal. The Programme de Relance et d’Accélération de la Cadence de
l’Agriculture au Sénégal aims at implementing the objectives of the Plan Senegal
Emergent in the agriculture sector and focuses on four strategic crops: rice, onions,
groundnuts, and oﬀ-season fruits and vegetables. The underlying goals that explain the
selection of these crops are: (1) coverage of the whole of Senegal with these products;
(2) gradual suppression of food dependence (rice and onions); (3) development of
exports (oﬀ-season fruits and vegetables); and (4) jobs creation and additional income
generation.

Agriculture is risky in Senegal. Ninety-eight percent of cultivated land is rain fed, and
as Senegal belongs to the Sahel, rain is scarce in parts of the country and unreliable
across the country, causing damage by excess as well as scarcity. The World Bank’s
Agriculture Risk Management Team estimates that during 1980–2012, total losses
from production risks aﬀecting maize, rice, millet, sorghum, peanuts, and cowpeas
alone totaled US$1.38 billion, that is, US$41.7 million per year. A detailed report was
shared with the government of Senegal in the second half of 2014; its ﬁndings have
informed the work of the AIDP and this report.

World Bank analysis using the Modèle d’Analyse des Risques de Cultures du Sénégal
modeled an average annual crop loss cost of 10 percent of national crop value and
indicates a 1 in 100 year loss of 44 percent of the national average crop value. The
2002–03 drought cost an estimated 35 percent of national crop production, almost
US$50 million. Annual groundnut production decreased by 70 percent, likewise the
average cash ﬂow to groundnut farmers. The 2004–05 locust infestation reduced mil-
let yields by 23 percent and sorghum yields by 14 percent. The livestock sector is also

APPENDIX F
RATIONALE FOR RISK ASSESSMENT
METHODOLOGY

The rationale behind the risk prioritization exercise is based upon the nature of risk in
agriculture, and it is necessary to deﬁne risk to understand its nature. First it is key to
recognize that risk is an abstract concept associated with an activity, and cannot exist
of itself. Only if an activity is undertaken does the possibility of its outcomes being
diﬀerent to those hoped. Secondly, risk involves a detrimental outcome normally but
not always associated with reduced returns on investment. Farmers the world over are
aware that there is “a risk” inherent in crop production and that in doing so they “risk”
the assets that they invest in the process. Thirdly, the risk inherent in an activity is mag-
niﬁed as the ratio between the potential for downside loss and the capacity to absorb
that loss (Weeks 1970) Commercial farmers who risk $1,000 per ha but have the assets
to sustain a loss of that size take on less risk than a smallholder for whom the loss of
$1,000 might result in complete bankruptcy and loss of livelihood.

Since the word risk is widely used colloquially, It is also important to deﬁne what, for
the purposes of this prioritization exercise at least, risk is not. It is not a speciﬁc type of
event—such as drought. Although we talk of such events as “risks,” they are not risks
of themselves. Although the potential for a drought to occur might contribute to the
risk inherent in crop production, the fact that a drought might contribute much more
to rain-fed crop production that it would to irrigated vegetable production highlights
the fact that risk is more a property of an activity than of the event itself. Neither is risk
the probability that an event might occur. Although the work risk is often colloquially
used in place of chance or probability, the words are not interchangeable. A greater prob-
ability that a detrimental event might occur can increase the risk inherent in an activity
that is aﬀected by that event, but does not itself constitute that risk.

Risk as described above is an abstract and subjective concept, but it is a critical aspect
of the stochastic processes that typify agricultural production systems. Although deter-
ministic value chain analyses can help to determine the optimal path for rural develop-
ment, the reality is often at odds with deterministic optima, frequently as a result of the
impacts of risk upon rural investment decisions. Unless the perceived risks faced by
