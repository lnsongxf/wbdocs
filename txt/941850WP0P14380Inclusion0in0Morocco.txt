Preface
Financial capability, as defined by the World Bank and in this report, is the internal capacity to act
in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic and environmental conditions. It encompasses
knowledge (literacy), attitudes, skills and behavior of consumers with respect to understanding, selecting,
and using financial services, and the ability to access financial services that fit their needs (World Bank
2013d).

Financial capability has become a policy priority for policy makers seeking to promote beneficial
financial inclusion and to ensure financial stability and functioning financial markets. Today people
are required to take increasing responsibility for managing a variety of risks over the life cycle. People who
make sound financial decisions and who effectively interact with financial service providers are more likely
to achieve their financial goals, hedge again financial and economic risks, improve their household’s
welfare, and support economic growth. Boosting financial capability has therefore emerged as a policy
objective that complements governments’ financial inclusion and consumer protection agendas. To this
end, policy makers are increasingly using surveys as diagnostic tools to identify financial capability areas
that need improvement and vulnerable segments of the population which could be targeted with specific
interventions.

In response to a request of the Bank Al Maghrib (BAM), the World Bank has implemented a financial
capability survey. Financial inclusion, financial literacy and consumer protection are high on the agenda of
the BAM and the Ministry of Finance. The BAM has in particular implemented many initiatives in this area in
recent years (from the promotion of a modern credit bureau helping prevent over-indebtedness to specific
measures designed to promote transparency in bank services, e.g. minimum disclosure requirements
following standardized templates); BAM is keen to initiate the preparation of a national financial capability
strategy (an initiative also supported by the Ministry of Finance). The proposed survey constitutes a key
diagnostic tool to prepare such a strategy, to set quantifiable and concrete targets, and to assess the
effectiveness of future financial capability enhancing programs. So far, no financial capability surveys have
been conducted in Morocco and it is one of the very first such experiences in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) region.

The key findings and recommendations presented in this report cover 4 main areas: 1. Financial
Inclusion, 2. Financial Capability, 3. Relationship between Financial Inclusion and Capability, and 4.
Financial Consumer Protection. The remaining chapters are structured as follows. Chapter 1 explores the
financial inclusion landscape in Morocco. Chapter 2 gives an overview of Moroccans’ levels of financial
capability, in particular about their financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors. The relationship between
financial capability and inclusion is discussed in chapter 3. The last chapter investigates if the products
which financially included individuals use are effectively meeting their needs.

Executive Summary
Financial Inclusion

 Approximately 41 percent of Moroccan adults use a formal financial product or service. This
 places Morocco well above the average level of financial inclusion in the Middle East and North
 Africa, as well as above the average level in lower middle income countries (18 percent and 28
 percent, respectively). However, within Morocco there are sharp variations in the use of formal
 financial services across different population segments. Men are twenty percentage points more
 likely than women to report using a formal financial product, and while 61 percent of adults in the top
 quartile of the income distribution are financially included, just 25 percent of those in the bottom
 quartile percent fall into the same category. Moroccans living in urban areas are also significantly
 more likely to be financially included: 53 percent of these adults report using a formal financial
 product, compared to 19 percent of their rural counterparts.

 Bank accounts are the most commonly used financial product, with 28 percent of adults
 reporting having a deposit or checking account. However, among women this value falls to 21
 percent and among rural residents and those in lowest quartile of the income distribution just 10
 percent have a bank account.

 Just over one in ten Moroccan adults reports having formal credit from a bank, credit card
 company or consumer credit and a similar proportion report using money transfer services.
 Fewer than three percent of Moroccans report having a mortgage or using an investment or pension
 product. As with overall patterns of financial inclusion, men, richer adults, and those living in urban
 areas report higher usage of these products.

 Microfinance institutions (MFIs) currently reach about five percent of the adult population, a
 finding consistent with supply-side data. Despite this relatively low penetration rate, there is high
 awareness of microfinance institutions: 68 percent of Moroccans report being familiar with services
 offered by MFIs. Unlike credit from banks, lower-income adults are more likely than their higher-
 income counterparts to report having credit from an MFI. Clients of MFIs are also unlikely to use
 banks. Just one percent of adults with an outstanding loan from a MFI report also having credit from
 a bank, and only eight percent of these adults have a savings or deposit account with a bank.

 Insurance is used by around 24 percent of the adult population in Morocco which is mainly
 due to mandatory insurance classes. The vast majority of insurance holders (over 90 percent)
 report using a form of mandatory insurance including motor third party liability. Just two percent of
 the adult population reports using self-initiative take up types of insurance, such as private health or
 life insurance.



                                                   11
    18 percent of Moroccan adults report that they use a Shari’ah compliant3 financial product
    with murabaha being the most commonly cited product. The popularity of the Murabaha product
    in Morocco is consistent with research that estimates that 70 to 80 percent of commercial Islamic
    lending products are Murabaha -based. Those not using Shari’ah compliant financial products
    generally cite lack of need, access, and knowledge as the main reasons. Doubts about authenticity
    do not appear to be a main obstacle to use of Shari’ah compliant financial products, with only 10
    percent of non-users citing this reason.

    The approximately 13 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal financial
    products or services - in Morocco are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural
    areas. Among these adults, the most commonly reported obstacle to formal account ownership is
    lack of enough money to use one (37 percent), followed by a lack of need for a formal account (27
    percent), and the high costs associated with owning and using a formal account (24 percent). Many
    adults – particularly those not participating in the formal financial system – using informal methods to
    save and borrow: 33 percent of adults report using only informal methods to save, and 10 percent of
    adults rely exclusively on informal lenders (such as moneylenders, family, or friends) to borrow.
    However, 49 percent of adults do not save at all and 72 percent of adults do not borrow.




Recommendations
In light of 24 percent of the unbanked citing high costs as main reason for not having a bank
account, BAM should continue to encourage competition among financial service providers and
lower barriers for new players to enter the market. Recent research indicates that high costs of opening
and maintaining accounts are associated with a lack of competition (Demirguc-Kunt and Klapper 2012)
Allowing for robust competition among financial service providers enables the potential of innovative
technologies to expand the range of available products and lower their cost.

Research should be conducted to understand the effectiveness of BAM’s efforts to require banks to
offer cheap and convenient no-frills accounts and other basic financial services. Twenty-four percent
of unbanked respondents report that high costs are a main barrier to formal accounts, suggesting that the
costs associated with these accounts remain prohibitively high for a significant portion of the population or
that the availability of no-frills accounts are not widely known. International experience in countries such as
India or the Philippines shows that the introduction of no-frills accounts must be complemented with public
awareness campaigns to mitigate the risk that the uptake of these products may be very low. These
financial education initiatives must be aimed at fostering the understanding and the demand for such


3Due to a number of caveats the measured penetration rate of Islamic Finance products should be considered as an upper
bound estimate for the proportion of Moroccan adults who are using a Shari’ah compliant product.

fundamental financial products, in particular among the poorest segments of the population including
women and rural dwellers. Given that empirical evidence provides robust justification for policies that
encourage the provision of basic accounts for savings and payments, it would be worthwhile to conduct
research in order to understand the effectiveness of this policy in Morocco and the degree to which it has
lowered barriers to access for underserved populations.

Promote the sustainable provision of a wide range of financial services for the poor, rural dwellers,
and women which have been identified through this survey as underserved segments of the
population. Despite banks’ efforts to extend products and services to low -income clients, the survey data
indicates a lack of suitable products addressing the needs of large parts of the population. Given that
insurance is a useful instrument to smooth seasonal income fluctuations faced by a substantial fraction of
rural residents, consideration could be given to promoting innovation in the development of micro-insurance
products, such as those aimed at rural and agricultural sectors (e.g. combined weather and area yield
indexed crop insurance). With only two percent of the adult population using self-initiative take up types of
insurance and one third living in rural areas, an enormous business potential remains to be tapped by the
insurers and other providers. Other products whose provision should be promoted are savings products
which help Moroccans to reduce their vulnerability to periodic economic and social shocks. While the
private sector is likely to play a key role in developing more suited products for larger parts of the
population, the government’s role would be to promote innovations through incentives and developing the
enabling regulatory framework.

Allowing, and advocating for branchless banking offers the potential to further expand the
coverage of financial services and to reach the poor, rural dwellers, and women. Mobile or agent
banking can dramatically reduce the costs of delivering financial services, in particular in low-density and
remote areas. Moreover, it can not only reduce explicit costs for those 24 percent of the financially
excluded adults who reported not having an account because they are too expensive but also implicit costs
such as the opportunity cost of time lost to traveling and waiting for those 37 percent of the adult population
who indicated lack of sufficient income as a main barrier to use a formal account. Policies fostering the
further development of these low-cost technologies such as the development of an enabling regulatory
framework appear to be a promising policy response to lift barriers in accessing formal financial services for
people living on low incomes and in rural and remote locations, as well as for women who tend to be more
adoptive to technology than their male counterparts as shown by international evidence.

Moreover, initiatives to bring women into the financial sector need to reveal and take into account,
the substantial differences which can exist between men and women in their access, needs and
preferences of financial services. For instance, evidence from Indonesia shows that even though men
and women are equally likely to have savings accounts, males are more likely to be motivated to have an
account in order to obtain a formal loan, whereas women are more likely to be motivated to have an
account to save for future needs. In relation to insurance, Indonesian women are shown to purchase more
often education insurance as compared to their male counterparts who prefer life insurance, and to a less
degree, asset insurance.

Financial Capability

 The survey results suggest that knowledge levels of basic financial concepts are a challenge
 in Morocco, as well as in many countries across different income levels. On average,
 Moroccan respondents were able to correctly answer 3 out of 7 questions on financial literacy. While
 90 percent of the sample was able to perform simple divisions, around 40 percent of the survey
 participants understand how inflation affects their savings, and a fifth seems to be comfortable in
 solving slightly more difficult numeracy tasks in order to identify better bargains. Compared to
 respondents from 22 countries, for most financial literacy measures survey participants in Morocco
 perform near the middle of the pack, except in terms of their understanding of what inflation is, an
 area in which they lack behind respondents of most other countries. Vulnerable groups who provided
 2 or less correct responses to the financial literacy questions are more likely to live on the lowest
 incomes, to have low educational attainment, and they are less likely to be formally employed.

 As far as the average number of financial products known is concerned, respondents are
 familiar with products provided by 4.3 different types of providers. The main products
 Moroccans are familiar with are offered by banks (90 percent), followed by products offered by
 savings and credit self-help groups (89 percent), MFIs (68 percent), and money transfer operators
 (65 percent). Insurance products are known by less than half of the sample (45 percent).
 Respondents who are only aware of two or less providers and their products tend to be young, never
 finished primary school, and are out of the labor force. For instance, while those with highest
 educational attainment indicated to be familiar with 4.5 providers and their products, those with no
 schooling demonstrated awareness of 3.5 providers and the products they offer. A more concerning
 finding is, that only 20 percent of Moroccans living in rural areas are familiar with the services offered
 by insurance companies, although insurance is a useful instrument to smooth seasonal income
 fluctuations faced by a substantial proportion of rural residents.

 An international comparison shows that Moroccans are mastering the task of choosing
 financial products and tend to be far-sighted, but they are among the most challenged with
 respect to managing their day-to-day finances and providing for old age expenses. Moroccans
 outperform respondents from seven other countries in their propensity to think about the future and
 in the area of choosing financial products. However, in light of the aforementioned difficulties
 respondents faced in solving simple numeracy tasks in order to identify better bargains, it may be
 questionable if people end up selecting those products which meet their needs best. The comparison
 to survey participants in other countries further shows, that Moroccans struggle with their daily
 money management and achieve lower scores for their attitudes towards savings. The most
 concerning finding is, however, that Moroccans’ farsightedness does not translate into proper action
 and that they lack far behind survey participants in other countries in their ability to make provisions


                                                    14
   for old age expenses.

   Important characteristics which are found to be strongly associated with lower scores in a
   number of financial capability areas are living on low incomes and in rural environments, as
   well as not having learned sound financial habits from a young age. Compared to urban
   dwellers, respondents who live in rural habitats tend to be more challenged in terms of budgeting,
   refraining from overspending, and monitoring their expenses. Low income populations, on the other
   hand, seem to have less financial control and struggle more than high income earners in setting up a
   budget and sticking to it and in their ability to cope with unforeseen events, resulting in a difference
   of 35 and 15 points in their budgeting and planning for unexpected events scores. Moreover, starting
   early pays off since having saved as a child correlates with a higher ability to budget, to live within
   means, to refrain from overspending, and to cover for unexpected expenses.



Recommendations
It is suggested to refine the financial education strategy and action plan developed by the newly
established ‘foundation for financial education’ to address the challenges listed in this report. In
order to ensure that scarce resources are used in the most efficient way, prioritization of certain financial
capability enhancing programs is essential. Such priorities could be based on a number of criteria, including
i) the need, ii) desired and expected impacts, iii) costs, iv) opportunities to scale up and v) leverage on
existing programs.

In light of overall low financial knowledge and product awareness levels, harnessing the potential
of mass media campaigns to provide information about basic financial concepts and key features
of financial products may be an effective means to target least financially literate and hard-to-reach
populations. The survey results suggest that in Morocco TV usage is almost universal, even among those
at the bottom of the pyramid. As a result TV is appears to be an effective channel to reach out to remote
populations and those who are the least familiar with financial concepts and products (see Box 2).
Particular areas of focus for public awareness campaigns include: (i) the meaning of simple and compound
interest, (ii) the key benefits, features, and risks of basic retail products such as (no-frills) savings accounts,
consumer loans, and mortgages. Awareness campaigns can also be used to (iii) raise rural dwellers’
awareness of the purpose of insurance products which would allow them to smooth their seasonal income
fluctuations.

In order to reach the adult target audience and to boost their ability to manage day-to-day finances
and to ensure that their far-sightedness translates into proper long-term actions, innovative and
interactive measures, and edutainment in particular, should be considered. The field of behavioral
economics has documented a plethora of behavioral biases which can prevent people from translating their
knowledge into action. For instance, people tend to be biased towards the status quo and to choose the


                                                        15
default option. They may also suffer from self-control issues, procrastination, overconfidence, or
systematically underestimate the time to complete tasks (Buehler et al 2002). These biases may explain
why Moroccans’ farsightedness does not translate into proper long -term decisions-making and why they
are more challenged in providing for old age expenses than survey participants in other countries. Recent
research has shown that innovation on delivery matters for inducing and sustaining behavioral change.
Conveying financial messages through innovative ways such as using popular TV soap operas, films,
videos or radio programs can be quite effective, not only in improving knowledge but also in altering
behavior (Berg and Zia 2013, Di Maro et al 2014). Edutainment programs are also presumed to be much
more effective if messages are delivered in an engaging an entertaining manner through appealing stories
that stick to memories, and if they are repeated and reinforced over time. For instance, in Kenya, a popular
television drama, ‘Makutano Junction’, incorporated financial education messages into some of its stories.
These messages aim to encourage people to save regularly or to open a bank account, rather than to keep
money under a mattress. Other examples of the use of entertainment education for finance are ‘Scandal!’ in
South Africa or ‘Mucho Corazon’ in Mexico. As with other soap operas, people watch these edutainment
dramas because they identify with the characters and enjoy the stories; but in the course of watching the
shows, they benefit from the financial capability enhancing messages.

Integrating financial capability-enhancing initiatives into existing programs in Morocco that offer
cash incomes could provide a huge opportunity for improving long-term financial behaviors of
beneficiaries, in particular as the duration of these programs increases. Around the world conditional
cash transfers have been shown to affect people’s investments in health and edu cation (see Benhassine et
al. 2014). The scaling-up of social cash transfers in Morocco such as, for instance the Tayssir4 program,
may therefore provide a good opportunity for enhancing the ability of beneficiaries and their families to
manage their daily finances and to make provisions for old age expenses, if financial education can be
integrated. As the duration of these programs increases the more promising their impact may be in terms of
sustaining long-term behavioral change. Likewise, public works programs that are implemented by the
Moroccan government may provide another excellent avenue for reaching out to vulnerable groups
identified in this report and to close financial knowledge gaps and promote desired behaviors.


In the medium to long-term the provision of financial education from an early age should be
encouraged as the survey results suggest that starting early can have value. Opportunities of school-
based financial education programs need to be explored, as basic principles of financial capability such as
budgeting, separating needs from wants to be able to refrain from overspending, as well as savings or
making provisions for old age should be acquired at a young age. If people form sound habits on how to
manage their money from a young age, they are more likely to adhere to them throughout their lives. Even
though mixed international evidence exists on the effectiveness of school-based financial education
programs on changing student’s behaviors, there are lessons learned from other countr ies which have
implemented such programs. Success has been observed, when providing financial education in ways

which students find relevant to their lives either currently or in the near future, and if it is interactive. High-
quality material or textbooks are therefore required, and teachers need to be well-trained on the content
and techniques. In addition, as existing curricula are already saturated, it is advisable to integrate financial
education into a variety of existing subjects including math, economics, or social studies rather than adding
a new subject into the curriculum. In case resources to train teachers and to develop and provide teaching
materials are scarce, it may be best to focus, at least at the onset, on incorporating financial education into
one or two subjects over three or four consecutive academic semesters.

Relationship between Financial Inclusion
and Capability

   Moroccans who save and borrow from formal sources are more aware of various financial
   institutions and their products than those who tap into informal sources, or those who do not
   save or borrow at all. If formal financial providers offer services of higher quality, this pattern may
   suggest that Moroccan respondents with more information about the financial sector, select better
   products and institutions than those with less information.

   Whereas Moroccans without formal financial products are less likely to know about the
   services offered by formal financial institutions, their awareness levels of financial concepts
   are comparable to those of users of financial products and services. On the one hand, this
   result suggests that a substantial proportion of Moroccans that is not being reached by financial
   products has a similar understanding of financial concepts as respondents with established relations
   with financial institutions. On the other hand, it suggests that both financially excluded Moroccans as
   well as those who are included deserve policy attention. In order for financial products to provide
   maximum benefits, their users need to know and understand how to use them which suggests a
   stronger role for financial institutions in providing financial education programs to their clients.

   In contrast to the patterns observed for financial awareness, in Morocco there are no
   substantial differences in financial behaviors and attitudes of respondents with and without
   formal financial products. This finding suggests that both formally included and excluded
   segments experience difficulties with respect to managing their day-to-day finances and planning for
   old age expenses.



Recommendations
In order to enable financially included Moroccans to benefit from the products they use, financial
knowledge and capability-enhancing programs could be combined with available financial products
that most people can access. Financial education programs could be tied to existing formal financial
products most people can access and use such as at the time when they open a bank account, take out a
loan, or conclude a mandatory insurance policy such as a motor third party liability. Moments like these are
further examples of so called teachable moments, which are times in people’s life when they are more likely
to be receptive to new information. These programs should not only help to close existing gaps in their
customers’ understanding of financial concepts but inform about the need to build up savings cushions for
unexpected financial shocks and old age expenses. Rural and low income populations could in addition be
informed about how to best set up a budget and to monitor their expenses and could potentially be



                                                     18
provided with mobile phones based personal finance tools, such as ‘Juntos Finanzas’. It needs to be
ensured, however, that all educational materials be informative, clear, impartial, and free from marketing.

BAM may consider sharing the results of this survey widely with different financial service
providers to potentially develop products with design features tailored to help their clients and
underserved segments of the population to meet their long-term savings goals. Since the large
majority of the population seems to struggle with daily budget management and long-term financial
planning, it could make good business sense for financial service providers to develop products which meet
the needs of their clients and underserved populations. For instance, they could develop micro-pension
products or savings products with design features that help people to meet their long-term savings goals,
such as commitment savings account or labeled accounts. The former consists of accounts where a certain
amount of funds is deposited and access to cash is relinquished for a period of time or until a goal has
been achieved. The latter describes accounts created with explicit savings goals, such as the
establishment or expansion of a business, a car purchase, housing, or education (World Bank 2013a).




                                                    19
Financial Consumer Protection

   The survey results suggest that banks and their products are less able to meet the needs of
   their clients as compared to six other types of providers and the products they offer. When
   respondents were asked if they are satisfied with the financial products they use, the highest
   satisfaction rates are achieved by savings and credit self-help groups, money transfer operators,
   money exchange offices, and MFIs, which are viewed as meeting the needs of around 70 percent of
   their client base. Only 43 percent of banks’ clients reported that they were satisfied with their products
   which is a concerning finding given that bank products are the most commonly used products.

   Although a substantial proportion of respondents (25 percent) experienced a financial
   service provider conflict, the majority did not try to solve perceived conflicts they
   encountered. The incidence rate of reported conflicts with financial institutions is much higher in
   Morocco than in the few countries for which a comparable indicator is available. Nevertheless, less
   than half of those Moroccans who faced a dispute (43 percent) took actions to try to solve it. Women
   and rural dwellers were more likely than the rest of the population to have faced a financial service
   provider conflict.

   In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, redress systems such as the respective
   regulatory government agency or legal courts were not sought at all by those who
   experienced a dispute. The most common actions taken to try to resolve disputes were to
   approach the service provider through friends and family (69 percent), to stop using the services
   before the contract expired (50 percent), or to approach the service provider through community
   elders (35 percent). The appropriate government authority and legal courts were only sought as
   redress systems in 1 percent of all conflict cases. More than two thirds of those who did not take any
   actions to solve a dispute reported as main reason for their inertia that they perceived financial
   institutions as being too powerful. Around 62 percent indicated that they think the government
   authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not aware of any government
   agencies they can approach for help.



Recommendations
These findings highlight that financial education efforts need to be complemented by measures to
strengthen the financial consumer protection framework, including regulations in the area of
consumer disclosure. Such measures would serve to level the playing field between suppliers and
consumers of financial services. It needs to be ensured that consumers are provided with sufficient
information to allow them to select financial products that are the most affordable and suitable. In line with
the recommendations of the World Bank’s Good Practices f or Financial Consumer Protection, financial


                                                      20
service providers should therefore be required to provide a standardized ‘key fact statement’ that explains
in plain language the key terms and conditions for each product (see World Bank 2012). Despite providing
information on the effective annual percentage rate, monthly installments, the commission fee, etc., the key
fact statement could also include options and contacts for dispute resolution. Prior to its launch, it would be
beneficial to undertake consumer testing of key fact statements in order to ensure that the presented
information is properly understood by consumers and that the format entails all required information.

Moreover, financial service providers should be required to inform their clients about their right to
complain and about their complaints handling procedures. Legal or regulatory provisions should require
financial institutions to provide customers with information on internal complaints handling procedures
(including contact information and time limits). This information should not only be disclosed in their products’
terms and conditions but also be visibly posted in branches and online. In addition, customers should be
informed about formal redress systems such as BAM or legal courts to increase low awareness levels of
government agencies which can be approached for help in the event of a dispute with a financial service
provider.

Given the high rate of reported conflicts with financial institutions, BAM should analyze consumer
complaints statistics submitted by banks and other financial service providers and use this
information as inputs to their supervisory and regulatory activities. All financial institutions and banks in
particular, should be obliged to share their complaints data with BAM. Based on the analysis of the consumer
complaints and inquiries, BAM could propose guidelines, instructions or conduct public awareness campaigns
that address the main problems identified in such analysis. For instance, BAM may issue case studies based
on real complaints that would explain in plain language particular complaints, how they were dealt with and
why. Such case studies might be published on BAM’s website, in local newspapers and/or disseminated
through different alternative channels including local government structures and communities.

To gain additional insights into why banks and their products seem to satisfy their clientele less than
other type of providers it is suggested to conduct further research. Mystery shopping can be a very
powerful tool to determine the quality and quantity of information consumers receive, and if both vary pending
on the perceptions sales staff have of different types of consumers. Focus group discussions with consumers
of bank services are another effective research technique which helps to delineate attitudes, motivations, and
opinions of the participants regarding the most important issues and concerns they have with bank services
and products.

It is further recommended that BAM considers re-visiting its existing formal system of redress in
order to quickly and effectively resolve disputes that are not resolved by financial providers’ internal
complaints procedures. Given the fact that more than 60 percent of those who reportedly encountered a
conflict did not try to solve it because they think the government agencies do not function properly, it appears
to be critical to make formal redress systems more user-friendly and relevant for those clients who
experienced a conflict with a financial service provider. It is also crucial to explain the role BAM plays in
market conduct supervision and consumer protection.

Background on the Morocco Survey
The financial capability questionnaire used for this survey has been extensively tested in the
context of low- and middle income countries. The survey instrument used is based on a questionnaire
developed with support by the Russia Financial Literacy and Education Trust Fund (RTF) and is
tailored to measure financial capability in low and middle income countries, although it can also be used
in high income countries. Extensive qualitative research techniques were used to develop this survey
instrument, including about 70 focus groups and more than 200 cognitive interviews in eight countries to
identify the concepts that are relevant in low- and middle-income settings, and to test and adapt the
questions to ensure that they are well understood and meaningful across income and education levels. The
instrument is currently used or planned to be used in 14 countries in Latin America, Africa, Middle East and
East Asia and the Pacific.

The survey instrument used allows financial capability, financial inclusion, and consumer
protection issues to be assessed and measured. Financial capability is measured by knowledge of
financial concepts and products, and by attitudes, skills and behavior related to day-to-day money
management, planning for the future, choosing financial products and staying informed. In order to jointly
analyze financial capability and inclusion, the survey instrument captures information on usage of different
kind of financial products and providers. The financial consumer protection section gathers information on
incidence of conflicts with financial service providers and levels of satisfaction with financial products
offered by different financial institutions. The survey instrument has been further customized to the policy
priorities of BAM, through adding specific questions, for example relating to usage of Shari’ah compliant
financial products and services and deposit insurance awareness.

The Morocco survey is nationally representative of the financially active population and comprises
a total sample of 3,000 adults. To fulfill the requirement of a scientifically sound survey which allows
inferences to the whole universe of financially active adults in Morocco, probability sampling techniques
were used to select a sample of 3,000 adults. Thereby, the most recent 2004 Morocco Census of
Population and Housing, kindly provided by the national statistics office (HCP), was used as a sampling
frame. The population was divided into strata based on area (urban/rural) with urban areas further
subdivided by housing type. The resulting 5 strata are rural, and the 4 different urban housing types -
luxurious housing, old medina housing, social and economic housing, precarious and clandestine housing. 5

The sample was selected through a three stage cluster sampling. The primary sampling units (PSUs)
selected at the first stage were enumeration areas (EA) delineated for the 2004 Morocco census. In total

5Urban areas are designated one of four housing categories. If an area contains multiple housing types, it is categorized by the
most common type in the area. Luxurious housing has large gardens located in areas with very high standards of living. Old
medina locates in the part of town where the different aspects of traditional life and old urbanization dominated. Social and
economic type of housing is occupied by middle class population in the former slums or areas with the small presence of traders
and no industrial activities. Precarious and clandestine housing is very basic and lacks sanitary accommodations, such as water
and electricity.

                                                              22
200 PSUs were selected with probability proportional to size (PPS). The measure of size for each EA was
based on the number of households in the sampling frame. Following the first stage selection of EAs, a
household listing was conducted in the chosen EAs. In each selected PSUE, a sample of 20 households
was selected from this list at the second stage, out of which 15 were targeted for surveying and 5 were
reserve households for replacement purpose only. Finally, within each selected household, eligible adults
either responsible for personal or household finances were randomly drawn by means of the Kish grid.
Proper individual weights were calculated and used in the following analysis to adjust for varying
probabilities of selection (design weights).

Between September and December 2013, a Canadian survey firm implemented the survey using
computer-assisted personal interview methods (CAPI). Étude Économique Conseil (EEC) Canada, a
Montreal based survey firm, was hired to conduct the Financial Capability in Morocco. To ensure highest
data quality and avoid common errors associated with paper-and-pencil surveys, an electronic version of
the questionnaire including consistency were programmed and the survey was administered from tablet
computers. Due to extensive efforts and different strategies used (e.g. training of enumerators on refusal
conversion strategies, letters which were in advance to inform re spondents about the surveys’ objectives, 5
contact attempts, etc.) the total non-response rate was less than 15 percent of the total targeted
households.

The adult population to which the results of this survey are meant to extrapolate has the following
key characteristics: Two thirds of the population lives in urban areas, while the remaining 34 percent live
in rural environments (see Figure 32). Slightly less than half of the population is woman (45 percent, see
Figure 34). Ranking all individuals by their reported household income and dividing them into 4 groups, 24
percent of the population fall in the lowest income segment (less than 3600 MAD per month), 23 percent in
the second lowest (between 3601 MAD and 6900 MAD), 25 percent in the second highest (between 6901
MAD and 9100 MAD), and 28 percent in the highest income group (more than 9100 MAD, see Figure 33).
Forty-five percent of the population is younger than 35, 35 percent ages from 35 to 55, and 20 percent of
the population is older than 55 (see Figure 35). In terms of the education attained, 4 percent of the
population has some or completed tertiary education including university, college, technical and vocational
school education; 46 percent has some or completed secondary schooling, which includes lower and
higher secondary degrees; 21 percent has completed primary schooling, while around one third of the
population has no schooling (see Figure 36). 83 percent of the population is characterized as earning
stable income, while the remaining 17 percent is facing irregular and uncertain income flows (see Figure
37). The average number of adults per household is 5, whereas an average sized household comprises 7
people. As shown see Figure 38 in Appendix, 42 percent of the respondents live in households with 4 to 6
members, 50 percent in households comprising 7 or more members.

1. Financial Inclusion
1.1 Introduction/Overview
As in many countries, increasing the access to and quality of financial products and services has
become a policy priority in Morocco. Over the past several years, considerable efforts have been made
to ensure that the inclusiveness of Morocco’s financial sector matches its relatively advanced depth and
diversification. In line with its Strategic Plan 2013-2015, Morocco’s Central Bank, Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM),
has developed an Inclusion Action Plan which sets a target of 67% financial inclusion by the end of 2014
and outlines reforms for improving financial education, expanding branchless banking, and promoting
consumer choice and product quality.

BAM’s vision for expanding financial inclusion incorporates conventional commercial banks,
microfinance institutions, the postal bank, and Islamic banks. In recognition that improved financial
access cannot be achieved without the support of the dominant banking sector, BAM has asked banks to
develop products for low-income clients, and since 2012, has issued requirements mandating that banks
offer more than a dozen different free services, including zero-cost saving accounts. BAM has also
introduced new bank reporting requirements in order to measure (i) the access to financial services, (ii) the
use of these services and (iii) the efficiency of financial inclusion strategies and policies. Another prong in
Morocco’s efforts to expand financial inclusion is the 2010 launch of a postal bank (Al Barid). The bank,
which now has over 1,800 branches and offers financial services previously offered by the postal network,
is estimated to reach about five million customers in areas where brick-and-mortar banks have traditionally
been scarce. Having moved past its early focus on basic savings and payment products, ABB now offers
overdraft products and mortgage lending, though it maintains its mission to serve low-income borrowers.
And while several banks in Morocco do offer Shari’ah compliant financial products, efforts are also
underway to create a framework for Islamic banking to further expand the range of affordable and
appropriate financial products for unbanked adults who may prefer wholly Shari’ah compliant financial
institutions to conventional banks. 6 Finally, BAM has taken important steps in improving the enabling
environment for financial inclusion, including establishing a foundation to coordinate financial education
activities and promote best practices, establishing a banking ombudsman to strengthen third-party dispute
resolution systems, and establishing a secured transaction framework, which is done in collaboration with
the Ministry of Economy and Finance.

The Moroccan microfinance sector also maintains a strong presence despite its crisis in 2009 and
an evolution away from viewing financial inclusion through the lens of microcredit. According to
latest available data, there are approximately 800,000 active microfinance clients representing US$ 540
million in loans outstanding. And the industry has set ambitious goals for itself, recently issuing a white


6The phrase ‘unbanked’ is used interchangeably with financial exclusion in this report, and refers to usage of formal financial
products and services generally, not just those offered by banks.

                                                              24
paper that set a target of reaching 3.2 million borrowers by 2020, a four-fold increase from current levels.
The government supports an expanded microfinance sector and in 2012 amended the 1999 MFI law to
institutionalize a framework for the resolution of weak associations through take-overs or mergers and allow
MFIs to transform into finance companies.

According to this 2013 Financial Capability Survey, the relative depth of the Moroccan financial
sector and efforts to expand financial access are indeed associated with broad-based usage of
financial services among Moroccan adults. As compared to other North African and Middle Eastern
economies, Morocco has a relatively high rate of financial inclusion. Data from the 2013 Financial
Capabilities Survey shows that 41 percent of Moroccan adults use a formal financial product or service. 7,8
In comparison, according to 2011 Global Findex data, 18 percent of adults throughout the entire MENA
region report owning a formal account, as do 28 percent of adults living in lower-middle income countries,
the group that includes Morocco according to World Bank classifications. This relatively high rate of
financial inclusion is in line with data that shows Morocco also having above-average bank branch
penetration and credit to GDP ratio when lined up against comparator countries (Table 1).

Yet there are nontrivial variations across socioeconomic and demographic categories – particularly
gender, income, and urban/rural residence - in this broad measure of financial inclusion. Men are
twenty percentage points more likely than women to be financially included, a difference that remains
statistically significant even after controlling for income, education, and a range of other individual
characteristics. The gender differential varies little across income levels, with approximately the same
gender gap among the bottom 25 percent and top 25 percent of the income distribution. There is also stark
inequality of financial inclusion across urban and rural lines. The gap between the poor and the rich is
larger still, accordingly to regression analysis (see Table 4). While 61 percent of those in the top quartile of
the income distribution use a formal financial product, just 25 percent of those in the bottom quartile percent


7 This includes deposit and checking accounts, credit from banks, payment services such as internet banking and Western
Union, microfinance institutions and credit cards, insurance products, and investment and pension products.
8 Global Findex data indicates that 39 percent of Moroccan adults used a formal financial product or service in 2011.



                                                                          25
report the same. Simple averages also show variation across education and employment categories and
these differences are statistically significant even when controlling for a range of other demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics in regression analysis (see Table 4).

There is significant variation in financial inclusion across regions and rural/urban lines within
Morocco. While approximately 60 percent of adults living in the Casablanca (city) and Rabat-Sale-
Mennour-Zaer region report using a formal financial product or service, only about 25 percent of adults in
Gharb-Chrarda-Beni-Hssen and Chaouia-Ouardigha do the same. 9 More generally, Moroccans living in
urban areas are significantly more likely to be financially included: 52 percent of these adults report using a
formal financial product compared to 19 percent of their rural counterparts.

The next sections dig deeper into the types of institutions and specific products used by Moroccan
adults, both within and outside the formal financial system. The analysis is organized by type of
financial institution. Each section first documents overall awareness of a given institution (banks, for
example) among respondents, then explores patterns of historical usage, i.e. whether a respondent has
ever used that institution, and finally the analysis looks at variations in current usage of range of products
for that institution (a bank account or bank loan, for example). The analysis begins with banks and details
the degree to which Moroccans are aware of, have ever used, and currently use banking products and
services. This is followed by a subsection on the usage of Shari’ah compliant products offered by banks.
Next, the microfinance institutions and insurance companies are discussed.




9Due to low population and therefore low sample sizes, it is not possible to present statistically robust financial inclusion
estimates for every region.

                                                             26
1.2 Banks
The strength of Morocco’s banking sector is matched by high awareness of these institutions
among Moroccan adults.10 The banking sector dominates Morocco’s financial system and is one of the
largest in the region, with domestic credit providing by the banking sector reaching 115% of GDP. Not
unsurprisingly then, approximately 90 percent of adults report being familiar with the products offered by
banks. While awareness of banks is relatively high among the poorest segment of the population (83
percent), it is essentially universal among the richest quartile of adults (96 percent). Similarly, only about
three in four adults with little or no schooling report being familiar with the services offered by banks but
awareness increases with each successive level of education. Each of these differences is statistically
significant even when controlling for a range of other demographic and socioeconomic characteristics in
regression analysis (see Table 5).

While nine in ten adults reports being aware of banks, data on the usage of bank products tells a
markedly different story: only 53 percent of Moroccan adults report ever having used a bank
product or service, a value which varies widely across different segments of the population.
Although there is no statistically significant gender gap in awareness of banks, men are eight percentage
points more likely than women to report having patronized a bank, a difference that is statistically significant
even after controlling for a range of other individual and regional characteristics in multivariate regression
analysis (figure 2; Table 5). Usage of bank products also varies widely by income: while 79 percent of
adults in the richest 25 percent of the income distribution report having used a bank product, just 33
percent of the poorest 25 percent of adults report the same. Adults to who live in urban areas are also
significantly more likely than their rural counterparts to have used a product from a bank.

                                                          27
A deeper exploration into the type of bank services that Moroccans currently use reveals that the
most common product are bank accounts, followed by money transfer services, loans and
mortgages. Approximately 28 percent of Moroccans report currently using a deposit or checking account.
Regression analysis again reveals nontrivial disparities in the usage of bank accounts across individual and
regional characteristics (see Table 5). Men are more than 12 percent more likely than women to use a bank
account (33 percent vs. 21 percent), a difference that holds even after controlling for other socioeconomic
and demographic characteristics. Income is another important determinant of bank account usage: the rich
are more than five times as likely as the poor to have an account at a bank. Where adults live is also
significantly associated with their likelihood to have an account. Those living in urban areas are more likely
to use a bank account: 37 percent of urban residents have an account compared to just 10 percent of
adults living in rural areas.

Approximately 12 percent of Moroccan adults report using a money transfer service, a category that
includes some non-bank services. Internet banking, debit cards, and Western Union-type services are all
ways to transfer money more efficiently and safely than cash. This data is consistent with results from the
2011 Global Findex survey which showed that 14 percent of adults in Morocco use a formal financial
institution to send money to or receive money from family living elsewhere. Supply-side data indicates that
ABB (the postal bank) has been particularly successful in offering payment services, capturing
approximately 80 percent of the domestic transfer market (CGAP 2012). These services are not used
equally among different segments of the population however: 30 percent of adults in the richest quartile of
the income distribution report using money transfer services, but just 3 percent of those in the poorest
quartile do.

11 percent of adults report having formal credit from a bank, credit card, or through consumer
credit, with men, the wealthy, and urban residents again being particularly likely to report doing so.
This value is on par with data from other developing countries: 2011 Global Findex data reveals that eight
percent of adults in the developing world report having borrowed from a formal financial institution in the
past year.11 In Morocco, Approximately 13 percent of men report currently having formal credit, compared
to 10 percent of women. The rich are also more than five times likely as the poor to report having formal
credit: 19 percent of the richest quartile of adults report having formal credit, as compared to 3 percent
among the poorest quartile.

Though above-average for the region, housing finance remains a relatively underdeveloped sector
in Morocco with only three percent of adults currently having a mortgage product. With the
introduction of some mortgage lending by the postal bank in 2012, this sector may increase in future years.
Similarly, investments (such as stocks, bonds, FCP, OPCVM, SICAV, etc.) and private pension products
are reported by less than three percent of the population each.



11The 2011 Global Findex value for formal credit for Morocco was 4 percent though it did not explicitly include credit cards or
consumer credit.

                                                              28
1.3 Usage of Products from Other Financial
Institutions
1.3.1 Microfinance Institutions
The microfinance sector has grown quickly in Morocco and remains large despite a recent crisis.
For several decades the concept of financial inclusion in Morocco was view almost entirely through the lens
of microcredit. Indeed, from its inception in the early 1990s through the mid-2000s, Morocco’s microcredit
sector was considered an international model for its high penetration and low sector-wide credit risk. By late
2007, the sector’s portfolio totaled US$ 733 million with 1.35 million loans outstanding. Yet in retrospect
there is little doubt that the sector grew too far too fast. Beginning in 2007, it became clear that the credit
risk had been underestimated and by 2009 it was valued at 14 percent nation-wide, up from estimates of
0.4 percent in 2005. This was largely due to levels of multiple borrowing, with an estimated 40 percent of
clients holding multiple loans in 2007. Following concerted efforts to reign in excesses by a range of public
and private stakeholders, multiple lending had fallen to 15 percent by 2012 yet credit risk remained high at
9.6 percent. The crisis and still-fragile recovery demonstrate that high growth in the microcredit sector can
come with high risk and that contagion dynamics cannot be ignored. As well as the value of strong
governance, well-developed market infrastructure such as a credit information sharing platform, made it
clear that market-wide risk can be nontrivial especially when rates of multiple lending are high. There are
now approximately 800,000 active clients representing US$ 540 million in loans outstanding.

There is strong awareness of microfinance institutions in Morocco though only about one in ten
adults report having ever used a microfinance product or service. 68 percent of adults report knowing
about MFIs, perhaps reflecting the large amounts of attention given to the industry during its fluctuations
over the past several years. Yet only 13 percent of adults report ever having used these institutions. Given
the traditional focus of MFIs on poor clients, it is not surprising that those in the lower quartiles of the
income distribution of Morocco are significantly more likely to have used a microfinance product in the past.
Approximately 16 percent of those in the poorest two income quintiles report having used a microfinance
product as compared to 11 percent among the rest of the population, a difference that remains significant
even after controlling for other individual characteristics. Adults living in urban areas are also more likely to
have used a microfinance product in the past.




                                                       29
Figure 3. Knowledge and Usage of Microfinance Institutions by Individual Characteristics

Current usage of microfinance products is significantly lower, consistent with the recent shrinking
of the industry to more sustainable levels. Five percent of adults report having credit from a
microfinance institution, consistent with supply-side data that estimates 800,000 active clients in the
microcredit sector. Women are significantly less likely than men to report having a loan outstanding from
an microfinance institution (2 percent vs. 7 percent), even after controlling for other individual
characteristics. As with patterns of historical usage, poorer Moroccans and those living in urban areas are
most likely to have a current loan from an MFI.

It is clear from the data that MFIs target a different set of clients than do banks or other providers of
formal credit. Figure 5 illustrates the differences in profiles between these two set of clients along income
lines. With respect to banks, the wealthiest Moroccans are more than five times as likely as the poorest
Moroccans to have credit from banks or credit card companies, yet credit from microfinance institutions is
most commonly reported among the poor, and quite rarely among the rich. Yet the higher levels of
microcredit among poorer Moroccans is driven almost entirely by men: only about 3 percent of women
report having a microfinance loan across all income quartiles, while the value rises dramatically for men
towards the lower end of the income scale. Clients of microfinance institutions are also unlikely to also
patronize banks. Just two percent of adults with an outstanding loan from a MFI report also having credit
from a bank, and only eight percent of these adults have a savings or deposit account with a bank.

Recent evidence from a randomized-controlled trial in rural Morocco suggests nontrivial benefits of
expanded access to microfinance institutions. Examining the effects of the expansion of Al Amana, the
country’s largest microfinance institution, researchers found that the main effect of improved access to
credit was the expansion of self-employment activities of households, including both keeping livestock and
agricultural activities. This leads to increases in sales among both livestock-rearing households and
agricultural households, as well as an increase in profits for the latter (Crepon et al. 2013).

1.3.2 Insurance
Just under half of Moroccan adults report being aware of the services offered by insurance
companies. Unlike banks and microfinance institutions, awareness is closely linked to usage: 45 percent of
Moroccans are familiar with insurance companies and 41 percent have used an insurance product at some
point (figure 6). Historical usage of an insurance product varies mostly sharply along gender, urban/rural,
and income dimensions, similar to patterns observed for usage of banks and microfinance institutions.

Insurance is relatively common in Morocco which is mainly due to mandatory insurance classes.
Around 24 percent of adults report currently having an insurance product. This is consistent with supply-
side data that suggests the Moroccan insurance market is the third largest within the Arab world. 12 Data
from the Financial Capabilities Survey suggests that the vast majority of insurance holders (over 90
percent) report using a form of general insurance such as car, property, or building insurance. Just two
percent of the adult population reports using self-initiative take up types of insurance, such as private health
or life insurance. According to the data, insurance remains a product used mostly by wealthier, urban
Moroccans: among the poorest 20 percent and those living in rural areas, only 13 percent and 11 percent
report using an insurance product, respectively. Supply-side data indicates that with 17 licensed insurance
companies, the Moroccan market spent over US$ 3 billion on premiums in 2013, with approximately a third
associated with car insurance premiums and a third associated with life insurance. 13 The government has
also shown interest in supporting the development of the insurance sector under its 2011 ‘Contrat
Programme’ initiative which sought to introduce compulsory natural catastrophe risk insurance and set
targets for insurance take-up among several subpopulations.


1.3.3 Patterns of Formality and Informality in Savings and Credit
Moroccan adults frequently use informal systems to save in addition to or instead of the formal financial
system. 14 percent of adults report using community savings and credit self-help groups such as “daret”14 to
save, and 33 percent of adults report saving at home. There is considerable variation in the degree to which
Moroccans merge formal and informal savings methods or whether they save at all. Just under half of adults
report using neither informal or formal methods to save, about a third saving using informal methods only, ten
percent use formal methods only, and another ten percent mix informal and formal methods.

each member contributes the same amount of money at each meeting and one member takes the whole sum once.

Moroccans also use a range of formal and informal systems to borrow, though virtually no one
mixes the two and the vast majority do not borrow at all. 18 percent of adults use some type of formal
credit product (bank loan, microfinance loan, credit card, mortgage, etc.) and 8 percent of adults report
borrowing from an informal source such as a money lender, family member, or friend. Yet, fewer than one
percent of adults report both types of borrowing, suggesting that those who can get formal credit see little
benefit in also borrowing from informal sources. However, almost three quarters of adults do not report
using any of these sources.

1.4 Islamic Finance
Long dormant in Morocco and other North African countries, Islamic finance – the provision of
financial products and services that comply with Shari’ah law – has begun to develop. In 2007, BAM
began to allow lenders and insurers to offer three Islamic products15 and in January of 2014 Morocco’s
cabinet approved a draft Islamic finance bill which would facilitate the establishment of full-fledged Islamic
banks. Though it appears that few Moroccans exclude themselves from the formal financial sector in
Morocco because of religious reasons, the further development of Shari-ah compliant financial industry and
the establishment of Islamic banks may indeed broaden the range and quality of financial products for the
country’s overwhelmingly Muslim population.

When asked if they use any Islamic financial products, 18 percent of Moroccans report that they do.
While there is generally little meaningful variation across individual characteristics in reported use of Islamic
financial products, an exception is that between urban and rural residents. Twenty-one percent of urban
residents report using an Islamic financial product and just 12 percent of those in rural areas do the same,


15   Murabaha, Ijara, and Musharaka.

                                                       33
a difference that is statistically significant even after accounting for a range of other demographic and
socioeconomic characteristics. Of course, self-reported data on the use of Islamic banking products is
inherently difficult to analyze given the social biases involved, and inability for interviewers to verify whether
the banking products used by a respondent are truly Shari’ah compliant. 16 Indeed, this is further
compounded by the fact that many adults are not familiar with the specifics of Islamic finance principles.17
In practice, the processes by which a product is deemed Shari’ah compliant ca n vary widely across
institutions.18

Seventy-nine percent of those who report using a Shari’ah compliant financial product report using
a murabaha product. A murabaha product is a partnership asset financing arrangement wherein the
financial institution purchases the desired good for the client and then sells it to the client in monthly
installments at the original price plus an agreed mark-up. In contrast to a conventional interest payment, the
monthly installments remain fixed at the initial amount even in the case of delayed payment. The popularity
of the Murabaha product in Morocco is consistent with research that estimates that 70 to 80 percent of
commercial Islamic lending products are Murabaha -based. Other Islamic financial products, such as ljara
and a mousharaka, are hardly used at all.

Lack of demand for, knowledge about, and local availability of Shari’ah compliant financial
products are the most commonly reported reasons for not using them. 80 percent of Moroccan adults
who do not use an Islamic banking product report not doing so because they have no need for one.
Interestingly, this value is higher among those who don’t use banks of any kind (84 percent), suggesting
that it could also apply to financial services more broadly. The second most commonly reported reason for
not using a Shari’ah compliant product is lack of knowledge: 69 percent of non -users report that they don’t
know about Islamic products. Sixty-five percent of those who don’t use Shari-ah compliant banking
products report that they do not do so because these products are not available where they live. Concerns
about the products themselves also appear to be a nontrivial barrier to usage. Forty-eight percent of non-
users say they that Islamic products are more expensive than conventional ones, thirty-six percent say that
these products give a lower return on investment, and thirty-two percent say that these products are risky
as a reason for not using them. Doubts about the authenticity of Shari’ah compliant financial products do
not appear to be a major constraint, with only one in ten non-users identifying this as a reason for not using
them.




16 It is possible that practicing Muslims would be reluctant to state that the financial services they use do not comply with
Shari’ah, particularly if the interview is conducted in the presence of family members or friends. Therefore, the measured
penetration rate of Islamic Finance products should be considered as an upper bound estimate for the proportion of Moroccans
who are using a Shari’ah compliant product.
17 Naser et al. (1999) found a high level of ignorance among Muslim respondents in Jordan with regard to what constitutes

acceptable Islamic finance principles.
18 El-Zoghbi and Tarazi (2013) note that the relationship between a given method of Sharia certification and customer

perceptions and uptake of a product is an almost completely unresearched area

1.5 The Unbanked & Barriers to Owning a formal
account
The approximately 13 million financially excluded adults – those who use no formal financial
products or services - in Morocco are disproportionately female, poor, and living in rural areas. 69
percent of Moroccan women do not currently use a formal financial product or service. Nor do 75 percent of
the poorest quartile of Moroccan adults, or 81 percent of adults living in rural areas. Yet, as stated in the
Global Financial Development Report 2014 (World Bank, 2013a), lack of usage of financial products does
not necessarily mean lack of access. While some people may have access to financial services at
affordable prices and may decide not to use them, others may lack access because of constraints such as
excessively high costs, or unavailability of the services due to regulatory barriers or other factors. The
Financial Capability Survey asked respondents who do not have a formal account to report why.

Figure 9. Reasons for not having a formal account (% of unbanked Moroccans)

                                                       35
The most commonly reported obstacle to formal account ownership is lack of enough money to use
one. While this answer could suggest voluntary exclusion from the formal financial sector, it does not
necessarily imply that these adults are unbankable. Instead, it may reflect a cost-benefit analysis on the
part of these adults and demonstrates that many adults perceive banking services to be of little value, not in
absolute terms, but for current levels of income and the quality of banking products. This could be because
of the nontrivial costs associated with owning a formal account, from explicit costs like minimum balance
requirements and withdrawal charges to implicit costs such as transportation costs, but it suggests that, for
many adults, formal institutions do not offer sufficiently valuable services for day-to-day transactions or
savings, particularly those involving small amounts. Another significant subset of unbanked adults explicitly
cites the costs associated with a formal account: 24 percent of the unbanked report not having an account
because they are too expensive.

Many adults, however, do give a clearer indication that they are not interested in the basic savings
and payment services offered by the formal financial sector. Demonstrating that lack of usage does
not necessarily imply lack of access, 27 percent of those who lack accounts state that they do not need
these products (see Figure 9). While lack of trust is not a widely reported reason for not having an account
among the general unbanked population, those who have used bank services in the past but report not
currently having a formal account are particularly likely to cite lack of trust: 13 percent of these adults report
trust as a reason for not having a formal account, as compared to three percent among those with no
previous banking relationship.

2. Financial Capability

 Financial Capability is the internal capacity to act in one’s best financial interest, given socioeconomic
 environmental conditions. It therefore encompasses the knowledge, attitudes, skills, and behaviors of
 consumers with regard to managing their resources and understanding, selecting, and make use of
 financial services that fit their needs.



2.1 Knowledge of Financial Concepts and Products
The recent global financial crisis has highlighted the importance of financial knowledge and skills
(financial literacy) for peoples’ ability to take sound financial decisions and to benefit from the
financial services they use. It is a well-accepted hypothesis that limitations in consumers’ ability to fully
understand the financial products and risks they had taken on, contributed significantly to the worst
financial crises since the great depression (Geradi et al. 2010; Klapper et al. 2012). Thanks to Low Income
Banking services offered by large banks, the establishment of the postal bank Al Barid in 2010, a
microfinance industry which is slowly recovering from its six years lasting crisis, as well as the launch of
mobile banking services such as Mobicash, financial products and services are becoming available to
populations which have been formerly disconnected from the formal financial system. While these
developments provide benefits, they also bear risks which may be unfamiliar to existing and new
customers. To be able to benefit from these new opportunities without being exposed to undue risks, a
certain level of financial knowledge and skills is required. This chapter identifies gaps in financial
knowledge that need policy attention as well as vulnerable groups that display limited knowledge and
understanding of concepts and products.

2.1.1 Knowledge of financial concepts
To assess respondent’s financial knowledge and their basic numeracy skills, 7 questions were
added to the 2013 Morocco Financial Capability Survey, covering basic calculus and financial concepts
such as interest rates, inflation, compound interest, risk diversification, and the main purpose of insurance
products. These questions have been asked because they capture financial concepts and skills which are
widely considered as being crucial for informed savings and borrowing decisions as well as for being able
to manage risks more effectively and or to take advantage of investment opportunities. We construct a
financial literacy index based on the number of correct responses provided by each survey participant to
the seven financial literacy questions. This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who
struggle the most with correctly answering any of these questions, while a score of 7 indicates survey
participants with good understanding of fundamental financial concepts and the ability to perform simple
mathematical calculations.

Figure 10. Distribution of financial literacy scores




Source: WB Financial Capability Survey, Morocco 2013

The survey results suggest that on average respondents were able to correctly answer 3 out of 7
questions on financial literacy. Figure 10 reveals that the majority of survey participants were able to
provide between 2 and 4 correct answers. 14 percent of the sample was able to answer 5 questions
correctly. Giving correct responses to 6 or more questions seemed, however, to be a challenging task
which was only achieved by 5 percent, while no one was able to provide correct responses to all 7 financial
literacy questions. A more concerning finding is, that a significant proportion of respondents, around one
fifth, was not able to provide more than 1 correct answer, while 4 percent of the sample had difficulties in
answering any financial literacy questions correctly.

One can conclude that whilst most can perform simple financial calculations, they may lack the
numeracy skills needed to identify better bargains as well as the specific knowledge required to
make informed savings and borrowing decisions. As can be seen in Figure 11, almost all respondents
were able to perform simple divisions (90 percent). By contrast, half or larger parts of the sample struggle
to understand fundamental financial concepts and to solve slightly more difficult numeracy tasks. In
particular, around 50 percent of the sample demonstrates understanding of simple interests and the main
purpose of insurance products. Slightly less, around 43 percent of the respondents know how inflation
affects their savings. Around a third of the surveyed population understands the working of compound
interest. One of the most notable knowledge gaps which deserve most policy attention is that only around a
fifth of the survey participants seem to be comfortable in solving simple numeracy tasks in order to identify
better bargains. A similar small fraction of the sample is familiar with the concept of risk diversification and
understands that holding stocks from different companies can usually be associated with less risky returns
than holding stocks from a single company.

   Question 1 Imagine that five brothers are given a gift of 10,000 MAD. If the brothers have to divide
   the money equally, how much does each one get?

   Question 2 Now, imagine that the five brothers have to wait for one year to get their part of the
   10,000MAD and inflation stays at 10%. In one year’s time will they be able to buy:
    More with their share of money than they could today
    The same amount
    Less than they could buy today
    It depends on the types of things that they want to buy (do not read out this option)

   2% per year. You don’t make any further payments into this account and you don’t withdraw any
   money. How much would be in the account at the end of the first year, once the interest payment is
   made?

Financial knowledge and awareness levels are a significant challenge in Morocco, as well as in
many countries across different income levels. Table 2 shows for 22 countries the proportion of adults
with understanding of basic concepts such as inflation, simple and compound interest and who are able to
perform simple divisions. As can be seen, for most financial literacy measures survey participants in
Morocco perform near the middle of the pack. In terms of their understanding of what inflation is Moroccans
seem, however, to lack behind the survey participants of most other countries. A plausible explanation for
this phenomenon could be that the inflation rate in Morocco remained stuck on low levels in the past
decade19.

Vulnerable groups who struggle the most in understanding basic financial concepts are more likely
to live on lowest incomes, to have low educational attainment, and they are less likely to be
formally employed. Figure 12 reveals, those survey participants who provided 2 or less correct responses
to the financial literacy quiz-type questions are more likely to belong to the lowest income segments
compared to their counterpart group with better understanding of financial concepts. For instance, while 58
percent of those who reach a score higher than 2 on the financial literacy quiz belong to the upper middle
and highest income group, only 44 percent of those who answered 2 or less questions correctly can be
found in the lowest income segment. Likewise, regression analysis shows (see Table 6) that even after
controlling for socioeconomic and demographic factors those who fail to understand basic financial
concepts are also less likely to have high educational attainment and to be formally employed compared to
those who achieve higher scores on the financial literacy quiz.

In contrast, a better understanding of financial concepts is strongly correlated with individual
characteristics such as higher income, higher education, and usage of print, broadcast, and
internet media at a regular basis. As may be expected, regression analysis reveals (see Table 6), that
higher financial literacy scores correlate with higher educational attainment, even after controlling for other
individual characteristics. Likewise, the knowledge gap between those who are formally employed and
those who are not employed is significant. Notably, more active media consumers score on average
significantly higher on the financial literacy quiz than their counterparts who do not use print, broadcast or
internet media on a regular basis.

Box 2. Media Consumption Overview


   While almost every adult in Morocco watches TV and around two thirds uses a mobile phone
   at a regular basis, print media and internet usage rates are highest among urban, more
   affluent, and highly educated segments of the population. As shown in Figure 13, TV usage is a
   nearly universal phenomenon, even among those at the bottom of the pyramid. Despite mobile
   phone subscriptions of 120 per 100 people in 2012, mobile phones usage rates are relatively lower
   (65 percent), suggesting that a substantial proportion of adults may own more than one mobile
   phone. Slightly less, around 53 percent of the surveyed adults listen to the radio regularly, but usage
   patterns are very similar for mobile phones and radio, both of which show little variations among
   different subgroups of the population. A gap in connectivity and usage of mobile phones exists,
   however, between groups with highest and lower educational attainment. While 71 percent of highly
   educated adults seem to use a cell phone at a regular basis, mobile phone usage among those
   without school drops to 62 percent. Looking into other media types and their usage rates it becomes
   apparent that people at the bottom of the pyramid are less likely to read local or national newspapers
   or to use internet regularly compared to high income earners, urban dwellers, and highly educated
   adults. Notably, higher education and urban locations are key drivers of internet connectivity, while
   characteristics such income or gender play a much less important or no role at all in explaining this
   digital divide.

Moreover, higher levels of financial knowledge relate to enabling environmental factors such as the
proximity to MFIs and the development level of the location people live in. The longer it takes to get to
the next MFI branch, the less likely it is that survey participants are familiar with basic financial concepts,
even after controlling for other characteristics by means of regression analysis (see Table 7). Similarly,
indicators which proxy for the socio-economic development of the location, such as low criminal rates,
seem to matter for better understanding of financial concepts. As compared to those residents who live in
safe areas, those who live in areas with high criminal rates are less likely to answer more financial literacy
questions correctly.

2.1.2 Knowledge of financial products
In order to assess survey participants’ awareness levels of financial products the financial
capability survey captured information peoples’ familiarity with financial products offered by
different types of formal and informal providers. In particular, survey participant were asked if they are
familiar with products offered by banks, MFIs, insurance companies, money changers, money transfer
operators, brokerage houses, and community savings and credit self-help groups. We construct a financial
products awareness index based on the number of financial products known, as indicated by each survey
participant. This index ranges from 0 to 7, whereby 0 indicates respondents who are not familiar with


                                                           43
products offered by any type of provider. Respondents with a score of 7 on the other hand stated familiarity
with products offered by the seven providers that the survey asked about.

Figure 14. Overview of Financial Product Awareness Scores

As far as the average number of financial products known is concerned, respondents are familiar
with products provided by 4.3 different types of providers. As can be seen in Figure 14, around two
thirds of the sample indicated to be familiar with between 3 to 5 products, while 13 percent are familiar with
financial products provided by 6, and around 10 percent with products offered by 7 different providers. Only
1 percent of the sample is not aware of financial products provided by any type of provider.

A deeper exploration into the type of financial products known reveals that survey participants are
mainly familiar with bank products (90 percent), followed by products offered by savings and credit
self-help groups (89 percent), MFIs (68percent) and money transfer operators (65 percent). Money
changers and their products are known by slightly less (58 percent), whereas insurance products are
known by less than half of the sample (45 percent). Much less, only 16 percent indicate to be familiar with
the products offered by brokerage houses, which is most likely due to the fact that the capital market in
Morocco is currently in a nascent stage, as is the case in many countries at a similar income levels.

Respondents who are the least familiar with financial products offered by financial providers tend
to be young, do not have any educational attainment, and are out of labor force. In comparison to
seniors (55 years or older) and middle-aged adults (between 36 and 55 years), young adults (35 years or
younger) demonstrated a lower awareness of the different providers and their products (see Figure 16).
Similarly, while highly educated Moroccans were on average familiar with 4.5 providers and their offered
products, those without any educational attainment indicated to be familiar with fewer different providers
and their products (3.9). Regression analysis suggest that even after controlling for other socioeconomic
and demographic factors, young adults, those without any education, and out of labor force populations are
significantly less likely to be familiar with products offered by more than 2 different providers (see Table 6).

                                                       45
Another pattern which emerges is that those who began savings habits as children demonstrate
better awareness of financial products offered by different financial institutions in comparison to
those who did not save in their childhood. According to regression analysis (see Table 6), even after
holding income, and other characteristics constant, compared to learned savings practices as children,
respondents who did not save in their childhood tend to be less familiar with financial products offered by
different providers.

Living in rural habitats seems to be a strong predictor for being less aware of insurance products.
Figure 17 reveals a gap in awareness of products from a variety of financial providers, including banks,
MFIs, insurance companies, and brokerage houses. Given that insurance products could enable rural
dwellers to smooth seasonal variations in their incomes, the most concerning finding is, that only 23
percent of respondents living in rural neighborhoods are familiar with insurance products as compared to
56 of urban residents. Even after controlling for various socioeconomic and demographic characteristics,
living in a rural environment is an important factor in explaining lack of awareness of insurance products
(see Table 8).

2.2 Financial behavior and attitudes
Even if people possess knowledge of basic financial concepts and products they may struggle to
translate it into action. To identify the role that attitudes play in shaping individuals' financial decisions
and to see if and how attitudes translate into financial behavior, the survey contains questions on different
aspects (components) of financial capability that include attitudes/motivations and behaviors. This chapter
gives an overview of strengths and areas for improvements surveyed Moroccans show regarding relevant
financial behaviors and attitudes.


                                                       46
In the Morocco data set, 9 main components of financial capability can be identified, some of which
refer to behaviors, and others to attitudes or motivations. Each financial capability component is
measured through a combination of relevant questions. These are identified by using a statistical technique
called principal component analysis (PCA). PCA is a data reduction method that finds a small number of
linear combinations of those variables that explain most of the variance in the data. The method is used to
aggregate the variables that measure different nuances of the same component in order to obtain a single
indicator (or score) for that component. Each component score ranges between 0 (lowest score) and 100
(highest score).

The following seven components measure behaviors related to financial capability: budgeting, not
overspending, living within means, monitoring expenses, planning for unexpected expenses,
making provisions for old age, and choosing products. More specifically, ‘budgeting’ measures the
extent to which people plan how to use their money and whether they adhere to the plan; ‘not
overspending’ assesses whether people have money left over after buying essentials and if yes, if they
refrain from spending it on non-essentials; ‘living within means’ measures whether adults run short of
money after buying essentials and why, their level of borrowing and whether people borrow to buy food or
to repay other debt; ‘monitoring expenses’ measures the ability to track expenses; ‘planning for unexpected
expenses’ indicates whether people could cover an unexpected expense equivalent to a month's income
and whether they worry about it; ‘planning for old age expenses’ indicates whether people have strategies
in place that allow them to cover for expenses in old age; and ‘choosing products’ indicates whether people
search for alternatives, check terms and conditions, get information before selecting financial products, and
search until they found the best products for their needs. The last score is only calculated for those who
have personally chosen a financial product in the past five years.

Two financial capability components refer to attitudes and motivations, such as farsightedness,
and attitude towards saving. In particular, ‘farsightedness’ measures whether people agree or disagree
with statements such as ‘I live for today’, ‘The future will take care of itself’, ‘I only focus on the short term’.
The attitude towards score on the other hand is based on agreement or disagreement with statements
about trying to save for the future, trying to save for emergencies, trying to save even if a small amount,
and about being disciplined.

Compared to other aspects of financial capability, survey participants show strengths in areas
related to choosing financial products and services, thinking about the future, and putting funds
aside for unexpected expenses. Figure 18 shows all scores for different aspects of financial capability in
increasing order. As can be seen, the highest average score (89) is obtained for choosing financial
products, followed by scores related to farsightedness (78) and to coping with unexpected shocks (67). The
highest score in the area of choosing financial products is based on the fact that 93 percent of those who
have personally chosen a financial product in the past 5 years indicated that they were searching for
information from a range of resources. The same proportion of the surveyed adults indicated that they
considered many alternatives before deciding which product to get and that they searched until they found
a product which met their needs best. These survey results suggest that Moroccans master the task of

                                                        47
choosing financial products which fit their needs best. However, in light of the difficulties respondents faced
in solving simple numeracy tasks during the financial literacy quiz in order to identify better bargains, it may
be questionable if people end up selecting those products which meet their needs best.

Financial attitudes and behaviors on the other hand, which relate to day-to-day money management
and savings, seem to be a challenge in Morocco. Figure 18 further reveals that compared to their three
main areas of strengths, respondents score on average much lower in areas related to managing their day-
to-day finances, such as living within their means (57), monitoring expenses (54), or not overspending (38)
and budgeting (38). Digging deeper in the variables used to create the budgeting score reveals that that
almost half of the sample (45 percent) reported that they do not plan at all how to spend the money they
receive. Moreover, a quarter of those who plan never adhere to the plan. Similar to weaknesses observed
in Morocco in areas related to daily money management, survey participants score lower with respect to
their attitude towards savings than they do in their three main areas of strength. The low savings attitude
score is based on the fact that between 58 and 64 percent of respondents disagreed with statements such
as “I try to save money for the future’, ‘I try to save money regularly, even if it is only a little’, and ‘I try to
have some provisions for emergencies’.

By far the lowest score is, however, found for behaviors that relate to long-term financial decision
taking, such as making provisions for old age expenses. Even though survey results suggest that
participants in Morocco have a high inclination to think about the future, their forward-looking attitudes
towards savings seem to translate into action and sound long-term decision taking. The lowest overall
financial capability score indicates that Moroccans ability to pay attention to long-term considerations and
cover for expenses in their old age may be sincerely constrained. This is a worrisome finding given its
implications for Moroccan’s long-term wellbeing.

An international comparison to respondents in ten countries confirms that Moroccans master the
task of choosing financial products and tend to be far-sighted, but they are among the most
challenged with respect to managing their day-to-day finances and planning for old age expenses.
Table 3 compares the financial capability scores Moroccans achieved in eight different areas to the ones of
respondents in various countries in which a similar survey has been conducted. As can be seen, Moroccan
survey participants outperform respondents from seven other countries in the area of choosing financial
products and in their propensity to think about the future. The comparison to survey participants in other
countries further confirms that Moroccan respondents struggle with their daily money management and
achieve relatively lower scores for their attitudes towards savings. The most concerning finding is, however,
that respondents in Morocco lack far behind survey participants in other countries in their ability to make
provisions for their old age expenses.

An important personal characteristic which is found to be strongly associated with higher scores in
several financial capability areas is higher income. Faced with small income streams, low income
populations seem to have less financial control and struggle more than high income earners with setting up
a budget and adhering to it which is reflected in a remarkable difference of 36 points in their budgeting
scores (see Figure 19). As compared to affluent segments of the population, those living on the lowest
incomes are also more inclined to overspend and they are found to experience more difficulties living within
their means. As would be expected, daily hardships of low income segments constrain their ability to cope
with unforeseen events in comparison to high income groups, resulting in a difference of 15 points in their
respective scores for planning for unexpected events.

Another pattern which emerges is that living in a rural environment is related with lower financial
capability scores. Figure 19 reveals a wide gap between rural and urban populations in their propensity to
think about the future. More specifically, while urban dwellers achieved a score of 72, rural residents scored
90 in the area of farsightedness. However, despite having longer time horizons, respondents who live in
rural neighborhoods tend to be more challenged in terms of budgeting, refraining from overspending, and
monitoring their expenses. Further, regressions analysis suggest that holding income and other individual
characteristics constant, rural dwellers are less inclined to save as compared to their urban counterpart
group (see Table 9).

Starting early pays off since having saved as a child correlates with a higher ability to budget, to live
within means, to refrain from overspending, and to cover for unexpected expenses. Starting to save at
an early age has value. As shown in Figure 20, respondents who already saved as a child score on average
slightly higher than their counterpart group who did not save in their childhood with respect to financial
behaviors such as budgeting, living within means, not overspending, and covering for unexpected expenses.
Regression analysis confirms that these observed differences remain significant even after controlling for
other socio-economic and demographic factors (see Table 10). Interestingly, those who began saving habits
as children and those who did not are not distinguishable in terms for their attitudes towards savings.

3. Relationship between Financial Inclusion
and Financial Capability
There is little doubt that financial capability and financial inclusion influence each other. While lack
of knowledge about financial products may hinder their use, it may also be the case that as people begin
using financial services, they become more familiarized with them and knowledgeable about them, in a
“learning by doing” fashion. While disentangling a causal link between financial inclusion and financial
capability is beyond the scope of this report, this chapter presents an overview of who the financially
excluded in Morocco are and how their financial knowledge, attitudes and behaviors compare to financially
included segments of the population.


3.1 Financial literacy and financial inclusion
Financial illiteracy is usually cited as an explanation of the limited demand for financial services in
developing countries. If people do not understand financial concepts and lack basic numeracy skills, they
may not feel comfortable in choosing financial products and hence will not demand them, or perhaps even
more alarming, they will choose products which do not fit their needs best or use them in the wrong way.
For instance, in a study in India and Indonesia, Cole and others (2009) found financial literacy to be an
important factor in determining the demand for financial products, especially among uneducated and
financially illiterate segments of the population.

Data from the Financial Capability Survey indicates that in Morocco, differences in financial literacy
levels among users and non-users of formal financial products and services are not substantial.
Using the financial literacy index discussed in chapter 2.1.1 and categorizing respondents into 5 groups
according to the number of financial literacy questions they answered correctly, it can be seen in Figure 21,
that there are hardly any differences between the performance of Moroccans who currently use formal
financial products and those who do not. This finding is validated by regression analysis, which suggests
that there is no significant correlation between financial literacy and the participation in formal financial
markets (see Table 11).

ownership

Even Moroccans who use formal savings or borrowing instruments appear to have low
understanding of fundamental financial concepts. In Figure 22, we present the financial literacy index
of Moroccans who save and borrow by tapping into formal, informal sources, and those who do not save or
borrow at all. As seen from the figure, half of the Moroccans who save formally are not able to answer more
than three out of the seven quiz-like questions correctly. Moroccans who do not save, or who save in
savings and credit self-help groups or other informal sources, perform slightly worse. A similar pattern is
found among borrowers. While respondents who hold a formal credit score marginally higher in their
financial literacy assessment than respondents without or with informal credit, there is a substantial portion
of Moroccans using credit from banks who answered more than half of the financial literacy questions
incorrectly.

products

These low levels of understanding of basic financial concepts may be of concern, particularly
among the active users of financial products. In order for financial products to provide maximum
benefits, their users need to know and understand how to use them. Experience (as with the microcredit
crisis in Morocco and in several other countries) has shown that using financial products without fully
understanding them could do more harm than good (see box 3). As with the case of financial awareness,
there seems to be room for policies aimed at enhancing financial literacy levels and numeracy skills among
Moroccans, both for users of formal financial products as well as for Moroccans who are currently excluded
from the formal financial system but might eventually become more integrated.

Box 3. Financial literacy and attitudes towards debt



   Most evidence on the effects of financial literacy on debt comes from studies in developed countries.
   In the U.S., Lusardi and others (2009) found that debt literacy (measured by questions evaluating
   debt related concepts) is on average low, and is positively associated with higher debt loads, fees
   and borrowing costs. Perry (2008) found that in the U.S. a substantial fraction of people (32 percent)
   tend to overestimate their credit ratings, being also less financially literate, less likely to plan their
   expenses and to save or invest.




3.2 Knowledge about financial products and
financial inclusion
It is difficult to establish a causal relationship between financial inclusion and financial product
awareness with this survey, studies in various settings have found, however, that enhanced
financial awareness may in turn lead to higher product up-take. In the U.S., for instance, information


                                                       54
about a retirement plan was randomly provided to a group of university employees. Workers who received
the information were substantially more likely to enroll in the retirement plan than those who did not obtain
the information, suggesting that individuals are more likely to use a financial product once they learn about
it and its benefits (Duflo and Saez, 2003). In a similar vein, Giné and others (2011) found that in rural India
lack of understanding of insurance products is the second most stated reason for households not to use
purchase rainfall insurance. Overall, evidence of these studies suggests that lack of usage of products may
be reflecting a lack of awareness about them.

While it is the case that not everyone should (or needs to) use financial products, lack of awareness
can prevent people from using financial products that could potentially benefit them. As discussed in
chapter 1.5, most financially excluded Moroccans state they do not have formal accounts because they
lack the money to maintain the accounts or because they have no need for them. Only a small fraction of
Moroccans report that they do not know how to use them (4 percent) or that they do not trust them (5
percent), suggesting at first glance that in Morocco, barriers related to lack of knowledge about financial
products are not substantial. However, when analyzing how informed Moroccans without formal accounts
are about services of various financial providers, their awareness level appears to be low. Using the
financial product awareness index discussed in chapter 2.1.2, Figure 23 suggests low awareness levels
even among non-formal account users who state reasons not related to financial awareness barriers.20
Regression analysis suggests that even after controlling for socioeconomic and demographic
characteristics of Moroccans, awareness of financial products and the likelihood of owning a formal product
or service are strongly linked (see Table 11).

As people’s awareness of financial products increases, they are more likely to rely on products
from formal providers. As Figure 24 indicates, Moroccans who save and borrow from formal sources are
more aware of various financial institutions and their products than those who tap into informal sources, or
those who do not save or borrow at all. If formal financial providers offer services of higher quality, this
pattern may suggest that Moroccans with more information of the financial sector, select better products
and institutions than those with less information.21

While financially excluded Moroccans are familiar with services from less regulated providers, they
are less aware of products offered by formal financial institutions. As compared to survey participants
who own formal financial products, Moroccan respondents without formal products are familiar with


20 In the 2013 Financial Capability Survey, respondents were asked if they knew about the products of seven financial institutions
that are: commercial banks, insurance companies, brokerage houses, microfinance organizations, other non-banking financial
institutions, money changers and money transfers. The financial awareness score ranges from 0 to 7. A score of 0 corresponds
to a respondent who is not aware of any of the listed institutions, whereas a score of 7 corresponds to a respondent aware of the
products of the 7 financial institutions.
21 Table 12 presents the results of a regression analysis that compares the correlations of having a formal product/service and

being aware of formal or informal financial institutions. Insurance companies, brokerage houses and microfinance organizations,
were classified as formal financial institutions, while savings and credit self-help groups, money changers and money transfer
operators were classified as informal financial providers. Awareness about commercial banks was not included in the regression
analysis because it perfectly correlates with having a formal account.

                                                               55
products offered by fewer financial institutions. Notably, the financial providers that Moroccans without
formal products were less likely to be familiar with are formal ones, such as commercial banks, insurance
companies, microfinance institutions, and brokerage houses (see Figure 25). Knowledge about financial
products offered by less regulated providers (such as savings and credit self-help groups, money changers
and money transfer operators) was not related to owning a formal product.

3.3 Financial attitudes/behavior and financial
inclusion
Attitudes and behaviors are another relevant dimension when analyzing financial inclusion. In
developed and developing countries, households and firms are frequently excluded from accessing
financial products because of inadequate credit history, irresponsible financial behavior, poor business and
accounting records, etc.22

22For instance, a recent survey of firms in Zambia found that about 73 percent of micro entrepreneurs found it difficult to obtain
loans for these reasons (World Bank 2013).


                                                               57
Interestingly, in Morocco there are no substantial differences in the financial behaviors and
attitudes of respondents with and without formal financial products, as well as users and non-users
of Shari’ah compliant products. Using the same financial capability scores which have been described in
chapter 2.2, Figure 26 shows that little differences arise between Moroccans with formal financial products
and those without in terms of their financial attitudes and behaviors. Likewise, regarding their financial
behaviors and attitudes, they are hardly distinguishable between those Moroccan respondents who report
using and not using Shari’ah-compliant products.

4. Financial Consumer Protection
In addition to peoples’ ability to take sound financial decisions, the recent financial crisis has
highlighted the importance of financial consumer protection to protect consumers from abusive
sale practices and to level the playing field between providers and consumers of financial services.
Financial consumer protection is about ensuring a fair interaction between providers and consumers of
financial services. A consumer protection regime is essential in counterbalancing the inherent disadvantage
of financial service consumers vis-à-vis the power, information, and resources of their providers. Without
basic protective measures, consumers may find it difficult or costly to obtain sufficient information or
adequately understand the financial products that they use.

Thus, financial consumer protection is necessary to ensure stable financial markets in Morocco
while ensuring that expanded access benefits consumers and the overall economy. As outlined in
chapter 1.1, a number of initiatives are planned or already underway in Morocco to increase financial sector
outreach to formally excluded populations. Increased access to finance can result in substantial positive
effects, both on the macro level as well as on the level of individuals. However, it can be harmful if
inexperienced consumers are not protected against fraud or unfair business practices.

In addition, effective financial consumer protection frameworks are critical for instilling confidence
in the financial system and for promoting financial sector outreach. A high incidence of conflicts with
providers of financial services or low levels of satisfaction with financial products used could undermine the
trust in the financial system. Despite making existing consumers worse off, it can also discourage potential
new consumers to enter the market. This section investigates if the products that financially included
individuals use are effectively meeting their needs. In particular, it identifies segments which are more likely
to have encountered a financial service provider conflict in the past three years and who seem less likely to
be satisfied with the products they use.

In order to measure whether products that financially included individuals use are effectively
meeting their needs, the financial capability survey captured if survey participants are in general
satisfied with different types of products they ever used. More specifically, respondents were asked if
they are satisfied with products they used from by banks, MFIs, insurance companies, community savings
and credit self-help groups, money changers, money lenders, and brokerage houses.

Despite serving more customers, banks and their products seem to meet the needs of their clients
less as compared to six other types of providers and the products they offer. Figure 27 presents the
satisfaction rates for different providers. As can be seen, the highest satisfaction rates are achieved by
savings and credit self-help groups, money transfer operators, money exchange offices, and microfinance
institutions which seem to meet the needs of around 70 percent of their client base. Banks on the other
hand achieve the lowest satisfaction rate among all seven financial providers. While 53 percent of the
population have been using banks at some point in their lives (see chapter 1), only 43 percent of their

                                                      59
clients indicated to be satisfied with their products. Only brokerage houses whose products reach a
relatively small fraction of adults appear to have a similar proportion of customers who claim to be satisfied
with the products they offer.

Figure 27. Financial Institutions Client Satisfaction Rate

Among those who ever used banks, informally employed and low income segments are less
satisfied with their products than their counterpart groups. Whereas 44 percent of formally employed
adults indicated that they are satisfied with the products offered by banks, the corresponding number for
informally employed Moroccans is 39 percent. Another important predictor for people’ s satisfaction with
bank products is income. While half of the highest income earners who ever used bank products reported
to be satisfied with them, only 40 percent of the lowest income group indicated to be satisfied with the bank
products they used.

Figure 28. Bank Usage and Client Satisfaction Rate by Employment, and Income

Another interesting finding is that although a substantial portion of respondents (25 percent)
experienced a financial service provider conflict, the majority did not try to solve conflicts they

                                                       60
encountered. As shown in Figure 29, a quarter of the sampled respondents stated, that they experienced
a conflict with a financial service provider in the past three years. This incidence rate of reported financial
service provider conflicts is much higher in Morocco than in the few countries for which a comparable
indicator is available. For instance, the portion of people who encountered a conflict in the past three years
is 15 percent in Mozambique, 5 percent in Mongolia, and only 1 percent in Tajikistan. However, less than
half of those Moroccan respondents who encountered a dispute (43 percent) took actions to try to solve it.
Even less, 38 percent of those who did not experience a conflict stated that if they faced a conflict they
would try to solve it.

A closer look at the characteristics of those who encountered a dispute reveals that women and
rural populations are among those who were more likely to have faced a financial service provider
conflict. Compared to 24 percent of men, 26 percent of all women who used a financial product in the past
three years reported to have faced a financial service provider conflict. Likewise, the survey findings
suggest that 24 percent of urban dwellers faced a conflict with a financial service provider in the past three
years as compared to 26 percent of rural residents. Regression analysis shows that these differences
matter even after controlling for other socioeconomic and demographic factors (see Table 13).

Figure 29. Approaches to deal with financial service provider conflicts

In terms of actions taken in the event of a dispute, redress systems such as the respective
regulatory government agency or legal courts were barely sought by those who experienced a
conflict with their financial service provider. Figure 30 highlights the approaches followed in trying to
resolve the conflict. As can be seen, the most common actions taken to try to resolve disputes were to
approach the service provider through friends and family (69 percent), to stop using the services before the
contract expired (50 percent), or to approach the service provider through community elders (35 percent). A
grievance to the company which sold the product was submitted by 11 percent of those who experienced a
conflict. The appropriate government authority and legal courts were only sought as systems of redress in 1



                                                       61
percent of all conflict cases. The latter can most likely be explained by perceived high costs and lengthy
time of proceedings.

Figure 30. Actions Taken to Redress Conflicts with Financial Service Providers

The main causes for inertia are either related to perceived power imbalances between financial
providers and their clients or they relate to lack of trust in or lack of awareness of respective
government authorities which can be approached in the event of a dispute. More than two thirds of
those who did not take any actions to solve a dispute reported as main reason for their inertia that they
perceived financial institutions as being too powerful. Slightly less, 62 percent indicated that they think the
government authorities do not work properly, followed by 52 percent who were not aware of any
government agencies they can approach for help which helps to explain why only 1 percent of respondents
submitted a claim to the appropriate government authority when they faced a financial dispute. 27 percent
of those who did not try to solve a conflict mentioned that they did not take any actions because they think
the law does not adequately protect consumers (Figure 31).
