I. Objectives
This survey was designed to assist the World Bank Group (WBG) in gaining a better understanding
of how stakeholders in Botswana perceive the WBG. The survey explored:
     General Issues Facing Botswana
     Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
     World Bank Group’s Effectiveness and Results
     The World Bank Group’s Knowledge Work and Activities
     Working with the World Bank Group
     The Future Role of the World Bank Group in Botswana
     Communication and Information Sharing
     Background Information


II. Methodology
From November 2015 to February 2016, 300 stakeholders of the WBG in Botswana were invited
to provide their opinions on the WBG’s work in the country by participating in a country opinion
survey. Participants were drawn from the office of the President/Prime Minister, office of a
Minister, office of a Parliamentarian, employees of ministries/ministerial departments/
implementation agencies, Project Management Units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of
WBG projects or consultants/contractors working on WBG-supported projects/programs, local
government office or staff, bilateral/multilateral agencies, private sector organizations, private
foundations, the financial sector/private banks, NGOs/community-based organizations (CBOs),
the media, independent government institutions, trade unions, faith-based groups, youth groups,
academia/research institutes/think tanks, and the judiciary branch. A total of 256 stakeholders
participated in the survey (85% response rate).

Respondents received the questionnaires via post and returned it accordingly. Respondents were
asked about: general issues facing Botswana; their overall attitudes toward the WBG; the WBG’s
effectiveness and results; the WBG’s knowledge work and activities; working with the WBG;
the WBG’s future role in Botswana; and the WBG’s communication and information sharing.

Every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey must include specific indicator
questions that will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.
These questions are identified throughout the survey report.

The results of this year’s Country Survey were compared to those in the Country Survey
conducted in FY ’13 (response rate is 80%, N=241). The data were weighted to reach similar
stakeholder compositions across the two survey years, allowing for more statistically reliable
comparisons. There were too few respondents from local government in either year to be
included and stakeholders who identified themselves as “Other” in the stakeholder category
options also were not included in these comparisons. As a result, mean ratings, percentages of
respondents, and the total number of respondents in both years are slightly different from those
of the original data reported in the FY ’13 COS report and the non-weighted data presented in
this report. For the weighted stakeholder breakdown and year comparison results, please refer to
Appendix D (see page 99).

III. Demographics of the Sample
Current Position
      For further analyses, the small number of respondents from the financial sector/private
       banks were combined with those from private sector organizations. The few respondents
       from youth groups and trade unions were combined with those from NGOs/CBOs to
       form a “Civil Society” category. The few respondents from local government were
       included in the “Other” category for all further analyses.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)
Familiarity with the World Bank Group
        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey indicated significantly
         lower levels of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents from the FY ’13
         Country Survey (weighted mean in FY ’16 = 5.1; weighted mean in FY ’13 = 5.7)1.
        Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
         ratings of familiarity with the WBG compared to respondents who do not collaborate
         with the WBG.
        Impact of Familiarity: Respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the WBG were
         significantly, strongly correlated with their ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in
         Botswana, and moderately, significantly correlated with the extent to which the WBG
         plays a relevant role in development in Botswana.

IV. General Issues Facing Botswana
Headed in the Right Direction
      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey similarly indicated that
       Botswana was headed in the right direction (percentage of respondents = 60%), with few
       indicating the wrong direction (14%) or not sure (26%).

      Stakeholders: The majority of respondents from the office of the President, employees
       of ministries, and civil society, along with a plurality of those from PMUs/Consultants on
       WBG-supported projects indicated that Botswana is headed in the right direction. In
       contrast, the majority of respondents from the media and independent government
       institutions indicated that Botswana is headed in the wrong direction.

Development Priority
     Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that the most
      important development priority in Botswana was job creation/employment (percentage of
      respondents = 37%), followed by poverty reduction (31%) and education (30%).

IV. General Issues Facing Botswana (continued)
Factors Contributing to Poverty Reduction
      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that job creation/
       employment would contribute most to poverty reduction in Botswana (percentage of
       respondents = 51%), followed by agricultural and rural development (44%), economic
       growth (36%), and education (34%).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group
Attributing Failed/Slow Reform Efforts

      Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that they most
       often attributed failed or slow WBG assisted reform efforts to an inadequate level of
       capacity in Government (percentage of respondents = 33%), inadequate level of civil
       society participation (30%), reforms not being well thought out in light of country
       challenges (28%), and the government working inefficiently (26%).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)

As noted in the “Methodology” section, the indicator questions referred to throughout the survey
report are questions that are asked in every country that engages in the Country Opinion Survey.
These will be aggregated for the World Bank Group’s annual Corporate Scorecard.


The World Bank Group’s Overall Effectiveness (Indicator Question)

        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey had statistically similar
         ratings for the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Botswana (weighted mean = 5.8)
         compared to respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean = 5.7)2.

        Collaboration: Respondents who are collaborating with the WBG gave significantly
         higher ratings for the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Botswana (mean rating = 6.2)
         compared to respondents who are not collaborating (mean rating = 5.6).

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Achieving Development Results (Indicator Question)

        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey gave statistically similar
         ratings for the extent to which the WBG achieves development results (weighted mean =
         6.4) compared to respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean = 6.2) 3.

        Stakeholders: Employees of ministries gave significantly higher ratings for the extent to
         which the WBG achieves development results compared to respondents from other
         stakeholder groups.




WBG Staff Preparedness

        Year comparison: Respondents in this year’s Country Survey gave statistically similar
         ratings for the WBG’s staff being well prepared (weighted mean = 6.3) compared to
         respondents from the FY ’13 Country Survey (weighted mean = 6.3)3.

V. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank Group (continued)
Overall Ratings for Indicator Questions by Stakeholder Groups
      Stakeholders: Respondents from bilateral/multilateral agencies, PMUs/Consultants on
       WBG-supported projects, and the office of the President had the highest mean ratings for
       the aggregated responses to the twenty-five COS indicator questions whereas respondents
       from academia, the media, and the private sector/financial sector/private banks had
       significantly lower mean ratings. Responses for individual indicator questions by
       stakeholder groups can be found in Appendix B (see page 69).
      Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG had a significantly higher
       mean rating for the aggregated responses to the twenty-five COS indicator questions
       (mean rating = 6.6) compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG
       (mean rating = 5.8). Responses for individual indicator questions by exposure to the
       WBG can be found in Appendix E (see page 105).

Greatest Value
     Year comparison: Respondents in the FY ’13 Country Survey indicated that the WBG’s
      greatest value to Botswana was its technical assistance (percentage of respondents =
      40%), its financial resources for budget support to the government (34%), its financial
      resources for investment lending (34%), training/capacity building (28%), and policy
      advice (26%).

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Importance of WBG’s Support in Sectoral Areas (continued)
     Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across all but four of
      these twenty-nine development areas (refer to Appendix B, page 69, for a complete
      breakdown). For the most part, respondents from academia tended to give the highest
      ratings of importance for these areas whereas respondents from the private sector/
      financial sector/private banks, bilateral or multilateral agencies, independent government
      institutions, and PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects tended to give
      significantly lower ratings. Those development areas which did NOT have significant
      stakeholder group differences were:
          “Trade and exports”;
          “Private sector development”;
          “Foreign direct investment”; and
          “Job creation/employment”.


     Collaboration: Respondents who collaborate with the WBG gave significantly higher
      ratings for the importance of the WBG’s involvement in “Education” (mean rating = 8.7)
      compared to respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG (mean rating = 8.2).
      In contrast, respondents who do not collaborate with the WBG gave significantly
      higher ratings for the importance of the WBG’s involvement in “Urban development”
      (mean rating = 7.2) compared to respondents who collaborate with the WBG (mean
      rating = 6.6).

Effectiveness of WBG’s Support in Sectoral Areas (continued)

      Stakeholders: There were significant stakeholder group differences across all but six of
       these twenty-five development areas (refer to Appendix B, page 69, for a complete
       breakdown). For the most part, employees of ministries and respondents from
       PMUs/Consultants on WBG-supported projects tended to give the highest ratings for the
       WBG’s effectiveness in these areas whereas respondents from the private sector/financial
       sector/private banks, the media, and the office of the President tended to give
       significantly lower ratings of effectiveness. Those development areas which did NOT
       have significant stakeholder group differences were:
            Gender equity;
            Information and communications technology;
            Poverty reduction;
            Anti-corruption;
            Foreign direct investment; and

VI. Sectoral Importance and Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall
effectiveness and ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Botswana, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-five specific
areas of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the World Bank Group’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the WBG’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development
results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one
specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness
or perceptions of the WBG’s ability to help achieve development results.

      Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
       correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the WBG’s
       overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
       drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s overall effectiveness in Botswana. The areas
       determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
              The WBG’s effectiveness at anti-corruption;
              The WBG’s effectiveness at water and sanitation; and
              The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity.

      Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
       Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
       WBG’s ability to help achieve development results in Botswana, suggesting that ratings
       of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the WBG’s ability to
       help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
       analyses were:
            The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at private sector development;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at equality of information and communications
             technology;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at job creation/employment;
            The WBG’s effectiveness at trade and exports; and
            The WBG’s effectiveness at health.

Appendix D: Responses to Select Questions by Year16
Comparing responses across Country Surveys reflect changes in attitudes over time, but also changes in respondent
samples and changes to the survey instrument itself. To reduce the influence of the latter factor, only those
questions with similar response scales/options were analyzed. Although the FY13 and FY16 samples were fairly
similar, the samples from both years were weighted to have equivalent stakeholder groups.

The World Bank Group is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Botswana or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey will give the World Bank Group’s team that works in Botswana, greater insight into how the Bank’s work is
perceived. This is one tool the World Bank Group uses to assess the views of its stakeholders, and to develop more
effective strategies that support development in Botswana.

A local independent firm has been hired to oversee the logistics of this survey. This ensures anonymity and
confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid.

Finally, the survey relates to the World Bank Group’s work. The World Bank Group consists of IBRD, IDA, IFC,
MIGA, and ICSID. When responding to the survey, please consider the area of the World Bank Group with which
you are most familiar.

To complete the survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion.
If you prefer not to answer a question, please leave it blank. If you feel that you do not have an
adequate amount of information on a subject, please check “Don’t know”.


PLEASE NOTE: IN SOME CASES THE SURVEY WILL ASK FOR A SPECIFIC NUMBER OF
RESPONSES. PLEASE DO NOT CHOOSE ANY MORE THAN REQUESTED. IF MORE
