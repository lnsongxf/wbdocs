  Key Policy Areas for Student Assessment                                                                                       Status
  1.     Classroom Assessment
         Samoa’s ‘Making Assessment Work: Classroom Assessment Manual’ provides guidelines for classroom
         assessment activities and their uses. There are also official documents that specify what students are
         expected to learn in different subject areas and years, and teachers are provided with a variety of training
         opportunities to ensure they develop competencies in classroom assessment. Overall, classroom
         assessment practices in Samoa are perceived as being of moderate quality. Consistent feedback on
         student learning and performance is provided to the students and their parents through school report
         cards which must be disseminated at least twice per year.

  2.     Examinations
         The Samoa Secondary Leaving Certificate examination is administered annually to Year 13 students in
         English and optional subjects. While government resources constitute the most significant source of
         funding for the examination, students are required to pay a small examination fee. There are some formal
         mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of the examination, including the ‘Examination, Assessment,
         and Certification: Rules and Procedures’ document, which provides standardized instructions for
         examination administration and data processing.

  3.     National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA)
         The Samoa Primary Education Literacy Level (SPELL) assessment was first introduced in 1993 and has been
         implemented every year since then to all students in Years 4 and 6 in Samoan, English, and Numeracy.
         Although there is no policy document pertaining to SPELL, the National Exam Calendar specifies the timing
         of future assessment rounds, as well as the subject areas and year levels to be assessed. National results
         and information are disseminated through an annual SPELL report and a Statistical Digest. Results are
         used to track the impact of reforms on student achievement levels and to inform curriculum
         improvement, teacher training programs, and resource allocation.

  4.     International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA)
         In 2012, Samoa took part in the Pacific Islands Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA) for the first
         time. Fourteen countries in the Pacific region participated. Minimal quality problems were identified with
         the carrying out of PILNA in Samoa. The country complied with all technical standards required for the
         exercise, and therefore it is expected that the country’s results will be presented in the main section of
         the PILNA international report.

Quality drivers of an assessment system
                                                             Table 1: Framework for building an effective assessment

The key considerations when evaluating a student
assessment system are the individual and combined
quality of assessment activities in terms of the adequacy
of the information generated to support decision
making. There are three main drivers of information
quality in an assessment system: enabling context,
system alignment, and assessment quality.

the assessment activity takes place and the extent to

mechanisms to monitor and support the improved
quality of classroom assessment practices. For example,
commission a national review of education in Samoa that
includes a component on the quality of classroom
assessment and recommendations for how to improve it.

3. Require schools to report classroom assessment
information to key stakeholders, including MESC
officials. Introduce a schedule at the ministry level to
which schools must adhere in communicating
assessment results to key stakeholders.

meetings.

A National Coordinator was appointed to implement
PILNA. In addition, a School Coordinator was identified to
manage administration at the school level for the
selected schools. Test Supervisors (teachers)
administered the assessment at the classroom level in
the selected schools. For each assessment area, literacy
and numeracy, a panel was responsible for marking the
papers. Although the 2012 PILNA was the first time that
the PILNA team in Samoa was in charge of an ILSA, there
were minimal problems in carrying out the assessment.
While there were some delays in data processing and
scoring, these were largely due to Cyclone Evan, which
struck in December 2012.

The MESC held presentations on the PILNA for ILSA team
members and assessment specialists. Key personnel also
participated in workshops organized by EQAP for all
PILNA-participating countries. In addition, EQAP
provided in-country training on scoring the test items to
the selected panel of markers.

The PILNA was sufficiently aligned with Samoa’s learning
goals. Classroom lessons, textbooks, and learning

the rubrics:


    x   Latent = 1 score point
    x   Emerging = 2 score points
    x   Established = 3 score points
    x   Advanced = 4 score points

3. The score for each quality driver is computed by
aggregating the scores for each of its constituent
dimensions. For example:


The quality driver, ‘Enabling Context,’ in the case of ILSA,
has 3 dimensions on which a hypothetical country
receives the following scores: Dimension A = 2 points;
Dimension B = 2 points; Dimension C = 3 points. The
hypothetical country’s overall score for this quality driver
would be: (2+2+3)/3 = 2.33


4. A preliminary level of development is assigned to each
quality driver.


5. The preliminary development level is validated using
expert judgment in cooperation with the country team
and The World Bank Task Team Leader.


For scores that allow a margin of discretion (i.e., to
choose between two levels of development), a final
decision has to be made based on expert judgment. For
example, the aforementioned hypothetical country has
an ‘Enabling Context’ score of 2.33, corresponding to a
preliminary level of development of ‘Emerging or
Established.’ Based on qualitative information not
captured in the rubric, along with expert judgment, the
country team chooses ‘Emerging’ as the most
appropriate level.

Classroom Assessment: Development-level rating justifications

1. In Samoa, the Ministry of Education, Sport, and Culture (MESC) establishes the framework for classroom assessment, which is aligned with the Samoa National
Assessment Policy Framework and the National Curriculum Policy Framework. The Making Assessment Work: Classroom Assessment Manual document,
authorized in March 2011 by the MESC, provides the framework and a comprehensive overview of classroom assessment use in Samoa. The document, which
contains three sections, Guide to Assessment Literacy; Best Practices for Classroom Assessment; and Classroom Assessment Techniques, is publicly available and
disseminated to all schools. While the MESC establishes the framework for classroom assessment in the country, schools have the authority and responsibility to
design and implement classroom assessment.

2. Documents that outline student learning and performance expectations by year and subject are available to teachers in Samoa. For example, the Samoa
Primary School Curriculum documents articulate the strands, achievement objectives, learning outcomes, and key ideas for each year in each subject area for
Years 1 through 8. Similarly, the Samoa Secondary School Curriculum documents are available for each subject area and are complemented by the Teacher
Development Series documents which provide teachers with guidelines, practical resources, practice assessment materials, and professional development
support. In addition, at the secondary level, the Teacher Development Series includes rubrics and scoring guidelines for each subject. Textbooks or workbooks
are also available to teachers to provide support for classroom assessment at the secondary level, and computer-based testing is available at the secondary level
in computer studies courses. However, item banks and online assessment resources specific to supporting classroom assessment activities are not available to
teachers.

3. An official curriculum or standards document specifies what students are expected to learn and the desired level of performance for each subject area at the
primary and secondary levels.

4. A variety of formal level mechanisms are in place to ensure that teachers develop competencies in classroom assessment. For example, pre- and in-service
teacher training address competencies in classroom assessment. There are two specific courses that address classroom assessment in pre-service training: (i)
Assessment Techniques and Training Strategies and (ii) Primary Teacher and Classroom Assessment (only available at the primary level). In addition, while there
are some online resources for teachers on the MESC "Teaching Resources Link List” webpage, the information provided is not specific to classroom assessment.
Further, many teachers cannot access the online training resources as they have limited connectivity to the internet. However, depending on available
resources, the MESC affords teachers the opportunity to participate in national, regional, and international workshops on topics including classroom assessment.
Also, teachers have opportunities to participate in item development or scoring of test questions for large-scale assessments or exams, and school inspection or
teacher supervision includes a component focused on classroom assessment.

5. Classroom assessment practices are known to be of moderate quality. For example, the use of multiple-choice/selection type questions is very common. It is
also common for classroom assessment activities to be mainly about recalling information and for teachers to not use explicit or a priori criteria for scoring or
grading students' work. However, it is rare that parents are poorly informed about students' grades and that classroom assessment activities provide little useful
feedback to students. It is also rare for classroom assessment activities to be mainly used as administrative or control tools rather than as a pedagogical resource
and to not be aligned with a pedagogical or curricular framework.

6. Classroom assessment is a required component of a teacher's performance evaluation and school inspection or teacher supervision. At the school level, the
head teacher is responsible for evaluating other teachers, including on their use of classroom assessment. In addition, the School Review Officer spot-checks
classroom assessment in each school at the district level. Also, the Monitoring and Evaluation Unit within the MESC is a central level authority whose primary
focus is to review classroom assessment for each teacher at the primary and secondary level.

Government funding allocated towards education research at the discretion of the MESC is available for research on the quality of classroom assessment
activities and how to improve classroom assessment. However, other mechanisms, such as an external moderation system that reviews the difficulty of
classroom assessment activities and appropriateness of scoring criteria or national reviews of the quality of education which include a focus on classroom
assessment are not available in Samoa.

7. In Samoa, classroom assessment is required to be used in diagnosing student learning issues, providing feedback to students on their learning, informing
parents about their child's learning, planning next steps in instruction, grading students for internal classroom uses, providing input for selection or certification,
and informing teachers on specific areas of support required.

8. The Samoa National School Assessment Policy Framework and the National Curriculum Policy Framework both state that schools are required to report on
individual student performance to parents, students, school committees (which are tasked with developing the three-year School Improvement Plans that
establish the strategic vision for the school), and other educational institutions, such as the secondary and tertiary schools that students attend. However,
schools are not required to report on individual student performance to school district or MESC officials.

9. In addition to student performance or grades in Mathematics, Language, and other areas, student performance or grades relative to other students and
student progress in performance are required to be reported. This information is required to be reported to students and parents in informal meetings or in
school report cards (which must be disseminated at least twice per year).

Examinations: Development-level rating justifications

1. The Samoa Secondary Leaving Certificate was first implemented as the Pacific Senior Secondary Certificate in 1989 and became a national examination and
known as the Samoa Secondary Leaving Certificate in 2013. It is administered every year to Year 13 students in English and other optional subjects, which
include Samoan, History, Biology, Chemistry, Physics, Mathematics, Accounting, Economics, Agricultural Science, Computer Studies, Geography, Food & Textiles,
Design Technology, Physical Education & Health, Arts, and Music.

2. The Samoa National School Assessment Policy Framework document, authorized in 2010 by the MESC, authorizes the Samoa Secondary Leaving Certificate.
This document is available online and copies are disseminated to schools.

3. The examination is fully standardized. Assessment design, administration, scoring, and reporting are the same for all students taking the examination. In
addition, there are a variety of procedures in place to ensure the standardization. For example, examination papers or tasks are the same or are equivalent for
all students and the same scoring criteria are used to correct the examination papers and tasks.

4. The MESC, which consists of a permanent body of stakeholders, provides leadership for the examination. The MESC has pushed for the development of the
examination and has influence and power in determining the examination agenda in the country.

5. There is regular funding for the examination allocated at the discretion of the government or donors.

6. Government resources constitute the most significant source of funding for the examinations. In addition, there is a small student fee for the examination.

7. Funding allocated for the examination covers examination design and administration and data analysis. The CMAD annual budget covers staff salaries,
research and development, and data reporting.

8. The Curriculum, Materials, and Assessment Division (CMAD) within the MESC has had full control of the Samoa School Leaving Certificate since 2013 and
partial control since 2010.

9. The examination unit is accountable to a National Assessment Council that belongs to the same broader institution as the examination unit.

10. The examination unit has up-to-date computers for all technical staff, top-level security for its building, top-level storage facilities, and up-to-date computer
servers and communication tools.

11. According to a recent study, the "Institutional Capacity Analysis of Samoa Assessment and Examinations Unit," conducted by the Australian Council for
Educational Research (ACER), the Assessment and Examinations Unit (AEU) requires higher staff numbers to strengthen the research and training function of
their unit.


                                                                                                                                                                    28

12. The country offers some annual opportunities to learn about examinations. For example, there are specific courses in pre-service teacher training which
cover all areas of assessment, including learning specifically about the examinations used in Samoa. In addition, the MESC hosts annual workshops for Year 12
and Year 13 teachers which include some focus on examinations. In addition to the examination unit, university teachers and students, teachers or educators,
and assessment specialists benefit from opportunities to learn about examinations.

13. Teachers have opportunities to learn about the content and skills measured by the examination as well as other aspects. For example, at the beginning of
each academic calendar year, the MESC hosts a workshop for all Year 12 and Year 13 teachers to review the previous year's exams, discuss exam preparation,
and improve pedagogical practices. In addition, teachers are involved in most examination-related tasks, including selecting or creating examination questions
and scoring guides, administering and scoring the examination, supervising examination procedures, and resolving inconsistencies between examination scores
and school grades.

14. The examination is strongly aligned with the content and skill areas of the learning goals or curriculum. In addition, the examination is aligned with
pedagogical approaches or activities compatible with the learning goals or curriculum. For example, in order to ensure alignment with the official learning goals
or curriculum, the Chief Examiner is instructed to use the curriculum as the key reference tool for setting the exam. In addition, there are regular internal
reviews to assess that the examination is aligned with what it is intended to measure.

15. Comprehensive materials to prepare for the examination, such as examples of the types of questions that are on the examination and information on how to
prepare for the examination, are available and accessible to all students. In addition, the framework document explaining what is measured on the examination
is available. An examiner report is also prepared after each exam and submitted to schools.

16. It is not possible to tell whether the School Leaving Certificate is consistent with the national and international large-scale assessments that the country has
carried out because the examination is administered at the secondary level, while the large-scale assessments are administered at the primary level. At the same
time, since classroom assessment practices are varied across schools in Samoa, it is unclear whether the examination is consistent with such practices.

17. There are some formal mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of the examination. For example, all proctors or administrators are trained according to a
protocol. In addition, the "Examination, Assessment, and Certification: Rules and Procedures" document provides standardized instructions for administration
and data processing of the examination. There is also double data scoring, and double processing of data. In addition, scorers are trained to ensure high
reliability and the MESC AEU staff act as internal observers for the examinations.

18. There is a comprehensive technical report, the Examiner’s Report, for each subject, which is sent to schools and made available at the MESC offices.
According to policy, the report is supposed to be made available online.

19. Regardless of background, location, and ability to pay, all students may take examination.

20. Only the student and persons with a legitimate, professional interest in the test taker can know the results. There is no inappropriate behavior surrounding
the examination. For example, copying from other candidates and intimidation of examination supervisors, markers, or officials do not occur during the
examination process.

21. Results are perceived as credible by most stakeholder groups.

22. Students who do not perform well on the examination may opt for less selective schools, universities, or tracks or repeat the school year. Student may retake
the examination once they have repeated the school year. However, students do not have the option to attend remedial education or take preparatory courses.

23. The National Assessment Council is in place to monitor the examination in terms of impact, acceptance, and credibility. In addition, conferences are in place
to discuss the examinations. However, there is no permanent oversight committee or funding for independent research on the examination. There are no
studies that are updated regularly, or regular focus groups or surveys of key stakeholders.

National (of System-Level) Large Scale Assessment (NLSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. The Samoa Primary Education Literacy Level (SPELL) was first introduced in 1993 and is implemented every year to all students in years 4 and 6. The
assessment is administered to monitor education quality at the country level, support schools and teachers, hold governments or political authorities
accountable, and inform policy design, evaluation, or decision making. The assessment covers English, Samoan, and Numeracy.

2. Although there is no stand-alone policy document pertaining to SPELL, the assessment is referenced in the National School Assessment Policy Framework.

3. The National Exam Calendar specifies the year of future assessments, years to be tested, and subject areas. The National Exam Calendar is provided to schools
and is available online.

4. The MESC, and particularly the Chief Education Officer and the assistant Chief Education Officers, represent the recognized leaders for SPELL.

5. There is regular funding for SPELL allocated based on a law or regulation through the MESC's examination budget.

6. The funding for SPELL comes primarily from the country's internal funding sources.

7. Funding for SPELL covers data analysis. While the cost of assessment design is considered an initial investment cost, administration and reporting are the
responsibility of the AEU within the CMAD and are covered within their budget.

8. CMAD, within the MESC, nationally recognized as an authority in student assessment in Samoa, is in charge of the SPELL. The CMAD has been in charge of the
SPELL since 1993.

9. The NLSA unit, which is the AEU, was not accountable to a clearly recognized body. AEU is accountable to the MESC Core Executive and the National
Assessment Council.

10. The AEU has up-to-date computers for all technical staff, top-level security for the building, top-level storage facilities, up-to-date generation computer
servers, and up-to-date communication tools.

11. The AEU has an inadequate number of staff to carry out national large-scale assessments. The Australian Council for Educational Research (ACER) recently
conducted an "Institutional Capacity Analysis of Samoa's Assessment and Examinations Unit" and found that the AEU requires a higher number of staff to
strengthen the research and training functions of its unit. However, there were no quality problems identified with the performance of the team responsible for
the NLSA.

12. There are courses in pre-service teacher training on assessment, which cover assessments administered in the country. In addition, the MESC hosts
workshops for Year 4 and Year 6 teachers and principals on the SPELL. These opportunities are available to CMAD employees and assessment specialists, School
Review Officers, university students, and school principals and teachers.

13. In workshops hosted by the MESC, Year 4 and Year 6 teachers had opportunities to learn about the content and skills measured by the NLSA, as well as other
aspects of the assessment.

14. Samoa introduced a new primary curriculum for the 2013 academic year. Therefore, SPELL does not align with the content, skill areas, and pedagogical
approaches of the new official learning goals or curriculum.

15. Textbooks or other learning resources, as well as teachers, covered content and skills similar to those covered by the NLSA. Further, students were exposed
to more basic content and skills in class than those covered by the NLSA.

16. SPELL is consistent with the international large-scale activities in Samoa. However, it is unclear whether SPELL is consistent with classroom assessment since
classroom assessment is diversely practiced across schools. It is also unclear whether SPELL is consistent with examinations since there are none administered at
Year 4 or 6, the levels at which the SPELL is administered.

17. Accommodations or alternative assessments are provided for students with disabilities. For example, SPELL has been administered at special schools for
children with vision and hearing impairments. In addition, special plans were made to ensure that SPELL was administered to students in hard-to-reach areas
and offered in the language of instruction for almost all student groups.

18. There are some formal mechanisms in place to ensure the quality of SPELL. For example, there is a standardized manual for large-scale assessment
administrators, double data scoring, double processing of data, and internal reviewers or observers.

19. There is a comprehensive technical report for SPELL which is sent to schools. In addition, copies are available at the MESC office.

20. Country results and information are disseminated through an annual SPELL report and a Statistical Digest (available online). The annual SPELL report and the
Statistical Digest are also sent to schools and available from the MESC office. In addition, results are presented during teacher and principal workshops.

21. SPELL results and information are not usually covered by the media. However, there are infrequent op-eds about the results in newspapers.

22. Results from SPELL are used for tracking the impact of reforms on student achievement levels. In addition, results are used to inform curriculum
improvement, teacher training programs, resource allocation, and other assessment activities in the system.

23. There were some formal mechanisms in place to monitor the SPELL, including an expert review group and a Literacy Task Force. Teacher and principal
workshops provide an opportunity to monitor SPELL on an annual basis and gauge efficacy in terms of impact, acceptability, and credibility. In addition, there is
funding for independent research on the SPELL.

24. There are some data demonstrating that children at risk have improved outcomes in later years, which likely has some correlation with SPELL and other
related interventions.

International Large Scale Assessment (ILSA): Development-level rating justifications

1. Samoa has participated in an ILSA in the last 10 years, but has not completed the entire assessment round. It has not completed an ILSA through to the final
phase of reporting and communicating the assessment results to stakeholders.

2. Samoa participated in the Pacific Island Literacy and Numeracy Assessment (PILNA) for 2012, in which 14 countries in the Pacific region participated.

3. There was no country-level policy document in Samoa that addressed participation in the ILSA; however, the Secretariat of the Pacific Board for Educational
Assessment (SPBEA), a regional body, received a regional mandate from the Pacific Forum Education Ministers Meeting (FEdMM) in 2006 to develop the PILNA.

4. There was funding allocated by donors.

5. Funding was allocated by the Australian Aid Programme and Secretariat of the Pacific Board for Educational Assessment (SPBEA).

6. The ILSA funding covered most core items, including implementation of the assessment exercise in the country, and processing and analyzing of data collected.
In addition, funding covered reporting and disseminating the assessment results in the country and attendance at international meetings. ILSA funding did not
cover international participation fees, research and development, or staff salaries.

7. There was a national coordinator for the PILNA in Samoa, a School Coordinator who managed the administration at the school level for selected schools, and
Test Supervisors, teachers who administered the assessment at the classroom level in selected schools. In addition, for each assessment area, literacy and
numeracy, there was a panel responsible for marking the assessments. Although this was the first time that this team was in charge of an ILSA, there were minimal
quality problems identified with carrying out the PILNA in Samoa. For example, it was noted that there were delays in data processing and scoring which was
largely due to Cyclone Evan, which struck in December 2012.

8. The ILSA unit had up-to-date computers for all technical staff, top-level security and storage facilities, and up-to-date computer servers and communication
tools.

9. ILSA team members and assessment specialists were able to benefit from opportunities to learn about the PILNA during presentations held at the MESC. Key
personnel also participated in workshops organized by the SPBEA for all PILNA participating countries. In addition, the SPBEA provided in-country training on
scoring to scorers.

10. The PILNA was aligned with content and skills areas of Samoa's official learning goals or curriculum. In addition, the PILNA was aligned with pedagogical
approaches or activities compatible with Samoa's official learning goals or curriculum.

11. In Samoa, textbook and learning resources, as well as teachers, cover content and skills similar to those covered by the PILNA. Furthermore, students are
exposed to content and skills more advanced than that covered by the PILNA.

                                                                                                                                                              46

12. It is unclear whether the ILSA is fully consistent with classroom assessment practices since they are conducted at the school level and can be diverse across
schools. However, the ILSA was fully consistent with the national large-scale assessment in Samoa.

13. Samoa has complied with all technical standards, and it is expected that its results will be presented in the main section of the PILNA international report.

14. Since PILNA results have not yet been approved by the FEdMM, they have not been disseminated in Samoa.

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative
     produces comparative data and knowledge on education policies and
     institutions, with the aim of helping countries systematically strengthen
     their education systems. SABER evaluates the quality of education
     policies against evidence-based global standards, using new diagnostic
     tools and detailed policy data. The SABER country reports give all parties
     with a stake in educational results—from administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policymakers and business people—an accessible, objective
     snapshot showing how well the policies of their country's education
     system are oriented toward ensuring that all children and youth learn.

     This report focuses specifically on policies in the area of student
     assessment.
