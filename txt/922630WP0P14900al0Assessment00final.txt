I. Program Description
A. Summary Description of the Government Program
a. PFM
1.      Building on progress made in the PFMRS in 2008–12, the Government crafted the
PFM SSP 2013–18. It consists of 7 programs and 23 subprograms (table 1Error! Reference
source not found.), each based on analyses of challenges. Each program identifies expected
outcomes (see annex table 1-8), as well as specific actions and outcome indicators; the
accompanying PFM sector implementation plan provides indicative costings. Emerging priorities
identified in the PFM SSP are (a) increased resource mobilization; (b) scaling up of the
implementation of IFMIS; (c) strengthening PFM systems at the subnational level; and (d)
enhancing training, professionalization, and capacity building across all PFM disciplines.

2.      The PFM SSP identifies key challenges and proposes solutions in each program that
are translated into a foundation for defining sector priorities and outcomes through
FY2017/18 (see annex table 1.8). Improving coherence between national strategies, the Medium
Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF), and the annual budget process has been identified as an
area for improvement under the first program, on economic planning and budgeting. In the
second program, on resource mobilization, key challenges are inadequate resource mobilization,
resulting in aid dependency at the national level and lack of discretionary revenues at the

subnational level. 1 Across the PFM sector, particularly under program 7, on PFM sector and
coordination, capacity and skill shortages are identified as key bottlenecks. Capacity and skill
shortages are more pronounced at the subnational level, especially on core PFM areas such as
accounting, auditing, budgeting, and reporting.
b. Statistics
3.       The overarching objectives of NSDS 2 are to produce relevant, reliable, and timely
statistics to monitor the progress of EDPRS 2 and to strengthen the NSS . Six strategic
objectives and 19 strategies/outputs are structured to achieve the overarching objectives (table
2Error! Reference source not found.). NSDS 2 supports the changing requirements in terms of
the nature and periodicity of data as Rwanda approaches middle-income status, which it aims to
achieve by 2020. The expected outcome of NSDS 2 is a strengthened and well-coordinated NSS
that is able to constantly monitor development outcomes and spur effective decision making and
public accountability.

4.      NISR made significant progress in the quality, timeliness, and dissemination of data,
mainly in the social and demographic domain, under the first NSDS (2009 –14). It
implemented the main social surveys and the 2012 Population and Housing Census according to
a timetable. In addition, solid progress was made on data access and dissemination through the
creation of a National Data Archive (NADA), in which survey microdata can be readily
downloaded for further analysis, and the establishment of an Open Data Portal, which has greatly

  The fiscal and financial decentralization program in the Governance and Decentralization SSP has also identified
revenue mobilization challenges at the local level.

improved citizens’ access to statistical information. Under NSDS 1, Rwanda moved up 20 places
on the World Bank’s Statistical Capacity ranking, from 73rd (of 149 countries with valid data) at
the end of 2008 to 53rd at the end of 2013.2 Within sub-Saharan Africa, Rwanda ranked 6th in
2013 (fifth excluding South Africa), up from 10th in 2008.
5.       NSDS 2 needs to address important gaps, related in particular to the dearth of
economic statistics (data on agriculture, businesses, and labor market activity) and the low
capacity of the NSS. In addition, efforts to improve the frequency and quality of certain types of
statistics need to be accompanied by improved access to data by users of statistics. The bank’s
open data readiness assessment (prepared for the Government of Rwanda in July 2013)
concluded that improving data dissemination by expanding NISR’s ongoing Open Data agenda
would result in better and more use of data.
6.     NISR was established in 2005 as the coordinating agency of the NSS, including all
agencies and ministries that provide statistical information to the public for planning and
decision making. It is governed by a board of directors, which determines its priorities and
approves the action plan of the NSS. Since 2007 the Government and a multidonor basket fund
development partners including the European Union, the European Union, and the Bank have
funded NISR. All plans and activities of NISR need to be approved by its steering committee,
which is chaired by the Government’s Chief Economist and includes representatives from the
Government, civil society and academia, and development partners. The steering committee
meets every quarter. The Bank is an active member of the steering committee.

B. Definition of the Program Boundaries and the Rationale for It
7.      The Program supports a subset of the Government’s own programs, articulated in
the PFM SSP and NSDS 2. The Program will support selected programs, subprograms and
strategic areas essential to achieve the Program Development Objective (table 3). The boundaries
of the Program were defined based on strategic relevance, government demand, and the support
of other development partners.
8.     All program and subprograms in the PFM SSP as well as the strategic objectives of
NSDS 2 are interrelated and constitute an important element of the PFM cycle (figure
6Error! Reference source not found.). The Program covers almost all programs and subprograms
of these strategies. However, some subprograms were excluded, based on the Bank’s
comparative advantage or the involvement of other development partners and the lead
government agencies managing them. For example, the Ministry of Public Service and Labor
(MIFOTRA) has been effectively managing Subprogram 5-2 (on IPPIS).3 NISR will be able to
cover SO5 of NSDS 2 (on consolidating coordination within NSS) and SO 6 (on improving
resource mobilization and building strategic partnerships with support from the statistics basket
fund).
9.    MINECOFIN, RRA, RPPA, OAG, and NISR are the implementing agencies of the
Program. Table 3 summarizes their roles.

II. Description and Assessment of Program Strategic Relevance and Technical
Soundness
A. Strategic Relevance
11.    Rwanda has made remarkable progress in rebuilding core public sector institutions
since the 1994 genocide. Its leadership has demonstrated strong commitment and resilience
despite a difficult environment. It has made significant progress in achieving peaceful political
settlement and national security, with dividends to citizens in terms of increased access to
services and poverty reduction. The Government has established its legitimacy and authority and
maintained the rule of law. Rwanda has very robust anticorruption laws and oversight institutions
for controlling corruption, and its leadership is committed to the fight against corruption. The
Government’s efforts have been so effective that Rwanda has remained a low corruption country.
12.     These achievements are extraordinary, but Rwanda still faces significant capacity
weaknesses and shortages in core skills and competencies needed to meet its ambitious
development objectives under EDPRS 2. The Government believes that it must implement
ambitious public sector reforms to deliver results. It radically restructured the administration
early on in the recovery phase in 1998–99, through a downsizing that dismissed more than 6,000
unqualified civil servants and removed more than 6,500 ghost workers from the payroll. To
eliminate the incentive to supplement income through petty corruption and moonlighting, it then
raised salaries for the much smaller number of staff by 40 percent. In 2012 the Government
supported these civil service reforms by implementing the pay and retention policy, 4 following
the prime minister’s order to establish a performance appraisal and promotion process for public
servants in 2010.5 Introduction of an Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPIS) in 2010
has also supported implementation of the civil service reforms. 6 Beginning in 2000, in tandem
with significant fiscal, political, and administrative decentralization reforms, central government
ministries have been unbundled to create flatter and smaller structures and bring service delivery
closer to the grassroots, in order to improve performance and accountability.
13.     Public sector reforms have improved governance. Rwanda’s performance significantly
improved in all six dimensions of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) between 1996
and 2012 (figure 1Error! Reference source not found.).7 It rose from the 20th percentile rank
on control of corruption in 1996 to the 27th percentile in 2005 and the 73rd percentile in 2012.
Government effectiveness rose from the 11th percentile in 1996 to the 53rd percentile in 2012.
For some dimensions, Rwanda’s rankings are now close to the average for middle-income
countries (figure 2Error! Reference source not found.). Three dimensions—government
effectiveness, regulatory quality, and rule of law—are almost at the middle-income country
averages, and the ranking for control of corruption is much higher than the middle-income

14.    Among the range of actions needed to improve accountability, better PFM is
particularly central. The literature confirms a positive relationship between PFM and
accountability. Effective PFM systems can help strengthen democratic influence, oversight, and
accountability in the decision-making processes related to the state budget. It can greatly enhance
transparency, by making well-structured information available on the ways in which public
resources have been used and the results that have been achieved, significantly strengthening the
accountability process in parliament and public audit institutions.8
15.     The Government regards PFM systems and processes as key to the effective and
efficient functioning of the public sector, because they underpin the performance of all sectors
and different levels of government.9 The Government has defined the main objective of PFM
reforms as “to ensure efficient, effective, and accountable use of public resources as a basis for
economic development and poverty eradication through improved service delivery”. It first
embarked on comprehensive PFM reforms in 2008, with the comprehensive Public Financial
Management Reform Strategy (PFMRS) for 2008–12. Building on progress under the PFMRS,
in 2013 it formulated the PFM Sector Strategic Plan (SSP) 2013–18.
16.    Rwanda has made significant progress in PFM reforms. The Public Expenditure and
Financial Accountability (PEFA) report documents this improvement at the national level.
Scores in all but one category improved between 2007 and 2010 (figure 3Error! Reference
source not found.). Other assessments, such as an independent evaluation of the PFMRS, also
show improvement. At the subnational level, the 2010 PEFA report assessed four districts. It

 For example, EDPRS 2 states that “Rwanda’s public finance management system is the platform for the efficient
management of the nation’s resources. Its reporting, audit and oversight functions are essential elements in
providing effective Accountable Governance” (Para 6.27).

genocide.
18.    There is a need to consolidate the achievements made and to address other
challenges. Effective PFM is very important in Rwanda, because the central government budget
represents a large share of GDP (29 percent), a share similar to that in Kenya and Tanzania (table
4). Rwanda’s tax revenue to GDP ratio (14.2 percent) is slightly lower than the average for E ast
African countries. The combination of high expenditures and low tax revenues has made Rwanda
more aid dependent than its neighbors.

19.    In addition to addressing these challenges, PFM systems in Rwanda have to keep up
with the country’s rapid development as well as changes in technology. Nominal GDP
almost tripled between 2006 and 2013, and the national budget almost doubled between
FY2009/10 and FY2013/14. As part of decentralization, subnational governments were
completely restructured in 2005. The availability of new technology offers an opportunity to
enhance PFM systems and procedures. Advancing and implementing PFM reforms, including
capacity building and institution strengthening, is an important component of Rwanda’s
development agenda, as reflected in the importance given to this area in both the country’s
medium-term plan and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
20.     Statistics are critical for supporting Rwanda’s development agenda. They facilitate
evidence-based policy making and support more efficient and effective use of public
resources. A regular flow of good-quality, comparable data on Rwanda’s evolving social and
economic conditions is fundamental for continuously improving the understanding of the
country’s development challenges, informing the design of well-targeted interventions to address
them, measuring their impact on national poverty and social goals, and using that information to
calibrate policy design and further improve the allocation of scarce public resources. Statistics
arguably play a foundational role in PFM, particularly by informing policy analysis and strategy
formulation and supporting adjustments in planning and budgeting in light of information on the
development results achieved through public sector programs.
21.    Rwanda’s first National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS 1), covering
2009–14, helped establish a foundation for the development of the statistics sector. Building on
successful implementation of the NSDS 1, the Government formulated NSDS 2, which covers
2014–19. Recognizing the important roles of statistics in the PFM cycle, NSDS 2 seeks to
improve statistical advocacy and integrate the use of statistics in decision making.
22.     This Program for Results (PforR) operation (henceforth referred to as “the
Program”) intersects with Government programs in many ways (figure 6Error! Reference
source not found.). For example, the Government program on economic planning and budgeting
(P1) and resource mobilization (P2) contribute to policy analysis, strategic formulation, and
planning and budgeting elements of the PFM cycle. The government program on electronic
service delivery and IFMIS (P5) cuts across all elements of the PFM cycle. The strategic
objectives on strengthening civil registration system, administrative records, surveys, censuses,
and other sources of data (Strategic Objective [SO] 1) and developing capacities within the
National Statistical System (NSS) (SO4) contribute to creating good-quality and timely statistics
that can inform policy and strategy formulation and evaluation. The programs to improve the
quality and dissemination of statistics and public statistical literacy (SO3) and improve statistical
advocacy and integrate the use of statistics in decision making (SO4) are also expected to
contribute to improved policy analysis and planning/budgeting.

23.     The Government has made progress on gender issues in both PFM and statistics
reforms. It introduced gender-responsive budgeting in five ministries in 2003, and fully
operationalized it in 2008. Currently, all ministries and districts are required to submit gender
budget statements and the gender distribution of employment during budget formulation. The
National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) started producing gender statistics in 2011; it
currently covers both national and subnational levels. The Program will support government
efforts to further enhance the mainstreaming of gender issues in both PFM and statistics
programs.
24.     Enhancing PFM will contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. EDPRS
2 defines PFM as the platform for the efficient management of the nation’s resources to achieve
the EDPRS 2 goal of accelerating private sector–led growth and further reducing poverty,
including extreme poverty. This idea mirrors the Bank’s view that poverty reduction is not
merely a question of spending more but also of using resources more effectively. Key to doing so
is effective PFM systems.10 Further enhancing PFM will allow the government to better allocate
its scarce financial resources to achieve national development goals. It will also enable the
government to become more accountable to Rwanda citizens on how public expenditures are
executed in accordance with development goals.

25.    Good-quality statistics are key for making more effective use of existing resources.
NSDS 2 focuses on producing good-quality statistics relevant to poverty reduction and shared
prosperity, such as household surveys, labor statistics, and agriculture survey. The systematic
production and dissemination of economic and social statistics is fundamental for assessing the
impact of expenditures on national poverty and social goals and informing adjustments in
planning, budgeting, or both that improve the allocation of public funds.
26.      The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) is leading PFM
reforms. Several ministries and agencies are engaged in PFM as a foundational issue (table 5).
MINECOFIN, the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA), the Rwanda Public Procurement
Authority (RPPA), and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG) are the implementing agencies
for this Program.

27.    Progress and key issues on PFM reforms have been discussed under the PFM
Coordination Forum, which the Bank co-chairs. The Forum includes relevant ministries and
agencies as well as key development partners supporting PFM reforms, including the Bank; the
Government of Belgium; the Department for International Development (DFID); the European
Union (EU); the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW),
the German development bank.
28.     NISR is leading the statistics agenda. It plays a coordination role in the NSS and is the
implementing agency of the Program. NSS stakeholders include other data producers (for
example, line ministries) and users. The Statistics Steering Committee is made up of government
stakeholders and development partners (the European Union, DFID, and the Bank). It functions
as a discussion forum for key statistics issues. Although there is currently no formal institutional
mechanism to discuss PFM and statistics reforms jointly, preparation of the Program has
stimulated coordination between the two areas.

B. Technical Soundness
29.     Technical soundness of the Program has been confirmed based on following criteria11: (i)
credibility of both PFM SSP and NSDS 2; (ii) adequacy of the Program activities to reach the
Program’s objectives against international experience and good practice.
a. Credibility of the Government Programs
30.     Ensuring credibility of the overall government strategies on PFM and statistics is
essential to conduct of programs under the strategies. Therefore, assessments of the credibility
of the strategies are conducted based on 7 features of a credible reform program including (i)
government-led (ownership); (ii) realistic and achievable; (iii) comprehensiveness; (iv) relevance
and sustainability; (v) development of local capacity; (vi) demand for change and (vii) inclusion
of performance indicators12.
31.    Both PFM SSP and NSDS 2 are assessed as credible to be supported by the Program.
The assessment tables (table 6 and annex 3) show that both PFM SSP and NSDS 2 fully or
mostly meet the seven features. For example, both strategies were formulated under strong
ownership of the government with strong alignment with EDPRS 2.

PEFAs have been under an internationally recognized framework and methodology 14 , and
development partners (including the World Bank) provided inputs in formulating the PFM SSP.
Therefore, programs and sub-programs under the PFM are considered to hold technical
soundness. Detailed descriptions of programs are as follows.
34.      Program 1 Economic Planning and Budgeting: On national development planning
(Sub-Program 1.1), national development planning process has been defined through the
implementation framework for the EDPRS 215. Accompanying sector strategic plans (SSPs),
other strategies such as the NSDS 2 and district development plans (DDPs) function as
implementation tools for the EDPRS 2. While the mechanism have been operationalized, it is
essential to strengthen capacity at both central and subnational governments. On public
investment programming (Sub-Program 1.3), public investment management (PIM) plays an
essential role in planning and budgeting. Development budget accounts for about 45% of the
total in the 2013/14 revised budget, and also pubic investment has a medium/long term
implication through future operational and maintenance costs. The government policy on PIM is
defined in the National Public Investment Policy in 2009. Despite the policy, its implementation
and application of the policy was weak until recently. For example, the public investment
committee had not been operationalized until 2013. While public investments have future
recurrent budget implications through operation and maintenance costs, these were not taken into
consideration in formulating the MTEF. On policy-based budgeting (Sub-Program 1.4), the
MTEF introduced in 2002 has been fully incorporated into the budget cycle at the both national
and subnational levels. Despite the progress, the multi-year fiscal management framework and
procedures are not yet effective. The MTEF is merely indicative rather than binding. For
example, budget figures in the second year (t+1) under the MTEF prepared for year (t) are not
well referred from the annual budget of the following year. The gap between the budget and
MTEF for selected sectors is described in table 7. There are a lack of fully costed sector
strategies, an insufficient incorporation of information on aid, and a weak link between sector
strategies and budget, which result in limited relevance and use of the MTEF by stakeholders.
Investment planning and its budgetary impact are not fully captured in current medium-term
fiscal framework.

35.     Program 2 Resource Mobilization 16 : Increasing domestic revenues to expand fiscal
space is one of the most important policy priorities in Rwanda. The tax revenue to GDP ratio
increased from 12.0% in FY2009/10 to 14.2% in FY2012/13. Significant progress has been
made in tax policy, tax administration and tax systems in the past few years. In the previous
fiscal year alone, the government introduced various tax policy and administrative measures such
as an introduction of a new VAT law in Dec 2012, an introduction of a new tax system for SMEs
in Sep 2012 and an introduction of electronic billing machines (EBM). Despite the progress, the
tax revenue to GDP ratio is one of the lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa whose average rate is 18%.
Domestic revenue mobilization is the most important subject of the IMF’s new Policy Support
Instrument (PSI) starting in 2014, and the government showed its strong commitment to this
subject in the accompanying Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies17. In order to
operationalize the commitment, the MINECOFIN has developed the Medium-Term Tax
Reforms Plan 2013-16 which identifies tax policies and administrative measures aimed at
broadening the tax base, including reducing exemptions; improving taxpayers’ compliance;
further strengthening tax administration, including e-filing; and strengthening risk management18.
In order to improve transparency, the government plans to publish tax expenditures to be
incorporated into the national budget to further transparency19.
36.     Program 3 Budget Execution, Accounting and Reporting: On budget execution (Sub-
Program 3.1), significant variation between the budget and execution means that public resources
are not spent as expected to achieve national objectives. As one of elements in reducing the
variation, a close link between the budget and planning is required (refer to Program 1 on
Economic Planning and Budget). On improving availability of budget information to the citizen,
at the national level a citizen guide to the national budget has been published on MINECOFIN
website 20 . On treasury management (Sub-Program 3.2), A Treasury Single Account (TSA)
concept is in place. Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) uses commercial banks as collection
agents with a requirement to transfer collections to the central bank within 3 days and payments
by MDAs are made from the central bank TSA and a Sub District Entities Accounting &
Reporting System (SEAS) has been piloted to facilitate accounting, execution and reporting by
the sub district entities. The Auditor General’s report notes that delayed banking of revenue

   The government received technical assistance from the IMF in March 2014 to review the current tax policies in
the agriculture and the mining sector and to advise on improving tax collections from those sectors.

   “In FY2014/15, the emphasis will be on broadening the base for VAT through a revision of the schedules for
exemptions and zero-ratings; and preparing a review of tax expenditures to be submitted jointly with the budget”
(p.13 of the IMF’s 7th review).

collections are still persistent in many public entities, especially districts. Transfers to districts
are processed directly by the Treasury to improve cash management. However sub district
entities (sectors, pharmacies, schools etc.) receive transfers as grants, which are expensed at the
point of issue. Consequently, the actual expenditures are not captured by the Government’s
accounting system, although they are reported separately and provided as summary annexed on
the respective Districts’ financial reports. There are challenges in tracking some transfers to and
through the districts which should net off on consolidation due to mishandled accounting entries
by some districts. A detailed assessment will evaluate whether adequate and timely funds are
available to finance program implementation. On internal audit (Sub-Program 3.3), initiatives
are in the pipeline to address the internal audit structure with a view to enhancing effectiveness
and efficiency of internal audit functions. On audit committees21, in July 2012, MINECOFIN
published a model Audit Committee Charter and followed by a Handbook in 2012 that provides
broad guidelines that can be used in by the Audit Committees in Ministries, Districts, Agencies
and Government Businesses. All 30 District Councils have Audit Committees since 2011 and
submit reports to Council (83% by December 2013). In the central government, 14 out of 21
MDAs have established Internal Audit Committees but very few have held meetings. With only
2 internal auditors per district of about 200 subsidiary entities, capacity is seriously constrained.
Internal audit reports cite control weaknesses, poor records management and non-compliance
with procurement rules. On internal control, a number of issues cut across both central and
subnational levels. The government has developed a financial management manual as the
guideline that lays out the requirements of an internal control system, and it is used at both the
national and subnational levels. There are some weaknesses within the internal control systems
that cut across reporting entities such as the inaccurate and incomplete financial statements, non-
compliance to procurement rules and regulations, over expenditures, irregular expenditures, mis-
posting of financial records when posting to IFMIS etc.
37.     Program 4 External Oversight and Accountability: Timely and quality external audit
is also an integral part of improving transparency and accountability. The Office of Auditor
General has been playing a key role in external audit. Its new organizational structure was
approved in 2012, and the new law on OAG was enacted in late 2013 22. The scope and coverage
by external audits has been improved in recent few years with the increase in coverage from 60%
in 2007 to 79% in 201323. Despite the increase in the coverage, only 32% of the 139 audit
reports obtained an unqualified (clean) audit opinion, while the remaining 68% obtained
qualified audit opinion. None of 30 districts and Kigali City obtained unqualified audit opinion,
although three districts (Kamonyi, Ruhango and Gakenke) improved their performance by
receiving “except for” opinions. Factors affecting the high qualified audit are, among other
things, failure to implement some prior year audit recommendation, omitting balances of non-
budget agencies from financial statements of in districts, and non-compliance with existing law
and regulations. Furthermore, the capacity of the relevant Parliamentary Committees and
District Councils is still inadequate to exercise effective external oversight on the use of public

finances. To address these challenges, the PFM SSP aims to (i) Ensure full compliance with
government rules on procurement; (ii) Introduce more modern audit techniques to improve
internal audit standards, and (iii) Address the weaknesses of the current Internal Audit structure.
38.    Program 5 Electronic Service Delivery and IFMIS: The capability and performance of
the IFMIS is critical to the Government’s ability to deliver improvements in every aspect of the
PFM cycle, including improving the timeliness and quality of financial reports, improving the
availability of information required by managers for decision making purposes, and ensuring
transparency and accountability for the use of public resources. The SmartFMS system is a
custom developed financial management information system that supports budget preparation,
expenditure management and financial reporting. It began operating in 2010 and has been
implemented at 275 sites, including all of the line Ministries, all 30 districts and Kigali City, and
various other government funded bodies. The Government plans to add to the functionality of
the Smart FMIS software, fixed assets management and management of external funding
sources. The Smart FMIS upgrade will also build interfaces to the Central Bank, the Rwanda
Revenue Authority and numerous other bodies. In addition, it is planned to integrate the IFMIS
system with an e-Procurement system. The current plan is to fully develop the system upgrade
by June 2015 and then to roll it out across government between 2015 and 2018.
39.      Program 6 Fiscal Decentralization: On resource mobilization by decentralized entities
(Sub-Program 6.1), strengthening revenue mobilization at the subnational levels is a core
objective of the government. Considerable efforts have been undertaken to mobilize local
revenues including a strengthened legal framework 24 . Nevertheless, the utilization of local
governments’ revenue sources is sub-optimal and uneven across districts, which in addition to
fiscal sustainability raises issues on unequal treatment of tax payers. In FY2013/14 budget of the
districts, the share of own revenues in the total ranged between 4 and 49% (on average 17%),
and the remainder was financed by transfers from the central government. Increase in local
revenues will reduce the dependence of subnational governments on transfers from the central
government and consequently strengthen the fiscal space for central government budgets and it
will also imply an increase in share of discretion of districts budgets. In order to strengthen
revenue mobilization at the subnational level, the government commissioned the Local
Government Revenue Potential Study 25 . Among other things, the study finds weak revenue
administration capacity at the subnational level. Consequently, in combination with devolution
of three tax sources to the districts, the government has decided to transfer local revenue
collection responsibilities from districts to the RRA. On facilitation of fiscal transfers (Sub-
Program 6.2), in the area of revision of expenditure responsibilities MINECOFIN in
collaboration with Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) developed a draft Prime Minister Order to
guide the line ministries in the implementation of sectoral decentralization. Furthermore, legal
and regulatory framework was assessed to determine the status quo in terms of expenditure
responsibilities. A draft revised block grant formula was developed to improve allocation

and Applicable Thresholds in 2012.

   Local Government Revenue Potential in Rwanda (2013) pointed out among other things the lack of district
capacity to collect taxes.

efficiency to districts considering their fiscal capacity. Every year MINECOFIN issues the
earmarked transfer guidelines. These earmarked transfer guidelines are designed to guide the
decentralized entities in the implementation of earmarked transfers from the central government.
The specific purpose of these earmarked transfers guidelines is to provide terms under which the
earmarked funds are allocated, transferred, spent and accounted for between the parties involved.
The format of submission of the earmarked transfer guidelines was modified to gather for the
Budget System Improvement Programme (BSIP) and to operationalize performance based
budgeting and funding approach. On strengthening PFM systems and capacity at subnational
level (Sub-Program 6.3), at the subnational level, timely and transparent financial information at
the subnational level is a key ingredient for improving effective and efficient use of public
resources not only at the subnational level but also at the national level (about 80% of district
budgets are financed by the transfer from the central government). However, financial
information below the district level (i.e., sub-district, cell, hospital and school) is in practice non-
existent. In order to address the issue, the government developed a simplified accounting, and
financial reporting application (SEAS) for the subnational entities below the district level, and
commenced a pilot of the application in December 2013. As of April 2014, among 416 sub-
districts, 88 had completed the pilot. An initial assessment of implementation experience
indicated substantial success in five out of seven districts. Roll out to an additional 10 districts
was due to be completed by June 2014. The initial evaluation identified problems of limited
access to IT at sub-district offices and excess numbers of Bank accounts at sub-district level.
Improving subnational PFM such as local revenue mobilization is one of key priorities in the
government’s decentralization strategy, and the Bank has been supporting the efforts26.
40.      Program 7 PFM Sector Coordination and Management: On coordination of HR
training and capacity building (Sub-Program 7.1), Capacity constraints (organizational,
institutional and human) are prevalent across the government programs to be supported by the
PforR and skills levels will need to be raised significantly as part of the implementation of the
Program. Currently, staffs who are recruited to financial management positions are required to
have a bachelors degree in accounting or finance, but few have any type of professional
qualification. None of the internal audit staff, for example, are professionally qualified auditors.
The capacity of universities and post graduate training institutions appears to be a constraint on
improving skills levels and delivering professionally qualified staff. The certification body for
accountants in Rwanda (Institute of Certified Public Accountant of Rwanda (ICPAR)) has been
established, but no institutions have yet been certified to provide professional training in
accounting and audit. On monitoring and evaluation (Sub-Program 7.3), Progress of the PFM
SSP has been regularly monitored through annual and quarterly progress reports on the PFM
basket fund. PEFA assessments have been used to measure the overall progress of the PFM
sector. Thus far, two assessments were conducted in 2007 and 2010, and the 2010 assessment
includes subnational assessment of 4 districts. The next PEFA assessments at the national and
subnational levels (including 8 districts) are scheduled to be completed in the second half of
2014.

  Decentralized Service Delivery Development Policy Operation in 2013 (P145114) supports the Presidential Order
establishing the List of Fees and Other Charges Levied by Decentralized Entities and Applicable Thresholds in 2012
to clarify district powers to impose a range of fees and charges and determine the rates, and the focus on local
revenue mobilization in the proposed operation gives continuity with earlier Bank support.

NSDS 2
41.      The NSDS 2 has been developed taking into account lessons learnt from NSDS 1. It
consolidates the gains of NSDS 1, mainly related to social and demographic data production and
dissemination, while addressing its shortcomings, mainly related to the dearth of economic
statistics, low quality of administrative statistics, and capacity constraints within the NSS. The
NSDS 2 is fully aligned with EDPRS 2 and seeks to provide data required for the monitoring and
evaluation of EDPRS 2.
42.      In line with the NSDS 2 priorities, the Program seeks to address data production,
dissemination, and quality enhancement needs in several priority areas while promoting
sustainability by strengthening statistical skills within the NSS. More specifically, the
Program will support the development of agricultural statistics, business and labor market
statistics and the upgrading and updating of the system of national accounts, improved data
dissemination and statistical advocacy, and the development of skills within the NSS.
43.     Program 1: Strengthen civil registration systems, administrative records, surveys
and other sources of data. Under this Strategic Objective, the Program will support the
development of agricultural, business and labor market statistics and the upgrading of the system
of national accounts.
   Agricultural Statistics: The process of agricultural planning, strategy, design, policy
    formulation and analysis, budget preparation, project implementation, appraisal, monitoring
    and evaluation requires a large volume of agricultural statistical information. To address
    these needs, the NISR will produce agricultural statistics through the detailed design and
    execution of comprehensive annual agriculture surveys. This process started in 2012/13 with
    the design and implementation of an experimental survey. The experimental survey
    introduced a novel best practice approach to agricultural surveying. This consists of the use
    of both area and list frames (so-called “mixed frames”) instead of traditional household
    frames. Area frames allow mapping land use and management practices using aerial satellite
    photos and demarcating land for agriculture in small pieces (segments) that are used as an
    exhaustive sample frame for subsequent segment-level sampling (for smallholders). The list
    frame involves listing large farmers and covering them all. The combination of area and list
    frames provides estimates that are very close to reality and are superior to the traditional use
    of household frames, which implicitly assumes each household has equal weight. The
    Program will support the roll-out of annual agricultural surveys, as of 2014/15, based on the
    lessons learnt from the experimental survey. The survey instrument will include several
    modules and sections that target land use (e.g. crops, grazing, forest, etc.); size of land
    holdings; livestock (e.g. total number of, products and byproducts, poultry, fish, beehives,
    etc.); seasonality and productivity of individual crops; farm management practices/inputs and
    irrigation systems; area and production of main and short rain seasons; crop forecasting and
    patterns, among other features. The agriculture survey will be mainstreamed in NISR’s
    statistical activities to provide a constant stream of data on the performance of the
    agricultural sector.
   Business and Labor Statistics: Data on businesses and labor supply and demand will be
    generated through a three-step process whose frequency will be gradually enhanced to inform
    decision makers more effectively. First, a business establishment census will be carried out to
    serve as the basis for the downstream design and implementation of a detailed business


                                                22
       enterprise survey. This process will comprise of creating a comprehensive sampling frame
       for formal and informal business entities, and obtaining some basic information on these
       entities. Once this census—a key milestone for labor market statistical development—is
       completed, an integrated business enterprise survey will be designed and implemented in
       light of international good practices such as the WB BEEPS, which systematically captures
       data on enterprises in Europe and Central Asia to guide policy decisions on private sector
       development and labor market dynamics. The integrated business enterprise survey will be
       implemented in the second year to collect data on formal and informal businesses and assess
       supply and demand side factors for labor policy development and private investment
       promotion and priority setting. After the enterprise survey, and to complete the three-stage
       process, a labor force survey will be conducted to more clearly outline employment levels,
       unemployment, underemployment, wages, skills availability, and other important labor
       market statistics. Overall improvements in business and labor statistics are expected to
       improve and facilitate an enabling environment for business development, local and
       international investment promotion, revenue management, and long term plans for job
       creation and expansion of private sector participation in development.
      National Accounts: Rwanda’s current system of national accounts is broadly in line with the
       United Nations System of National Accounts 1993 (SNA1993) standards and was rebased in
       2014 with base year 2011 together with adopting Revision 4 of the International Standard
       Industrial Classification (ISIC) 27 . Under the Program, the National Accounts will be
       upgraded to the latest SNA2008 standard (which includes important changes related to the
       classification of economic activity, the recording of informal economic activities) and will be
       rebased again in 2016/17 with base year 2014. The rebasing in 2016/17 will benefit from
       better economic source data provided by updated agricultural and business statistics. An
       upgraded and updated system of national accounts will allow a closer monitoring of
       economic performance.
44.     Program 2 Improve quality and dissemination of statistics and public statistical
literacy, and, Improve statistical advocacy and integrate use of statistics in decision
making: During NSDS 1, NISR has organized several high-profile and publicized events on the
availability of statistics and their importance for decision-making. The most-known and most
attended event is the annual interuniversity infographics competition, for which students from
different higher-learning institutes submit thematic infographics based on a recent survey dataset
in celebration of African Statistics Day. All submissions are rated by a jury, after which
infographics are exhibited and prizes awarded to the winning submissions. The infographics
competition gains in importance and visibility each single year and has raised awareness among
students on the easy access and availability of quality data in Rwanda. NISR has also organized
workshops in PhD departments throughout the country to highlight the availability of data and
boost the use of national survey data by local PhD researchers.
45.    Program 3 Improve statistical advocacy and integrate use of statistics in decision
making: All statistical advocacy activities so far have been ad hoc. NSDS 2 aims to address this
by developing and implementing an integrated advocacy strategy. The strategy will be geared
both towards stimulating use of statistics by decision-makers and by researchers and civil

     Only half of countries in Africa are in compliance with SNA1993 (Devarajan, 2013).

society. The technical soundness of the strategy will be examined once the strategy will have
been developed by NISR (planned for the first year of the Program).
46.      Program 4 Develop capacity within NSS: Under this Strategic Objective, the Program
will support the establishment and operationalization of a statistical training center within the
existing premises of NISR. With support from the Program, NISR will prepare a master plan for
the set-up of the training center, including its design and construction arrangements. NISR
already conducted a skills training needs analysis of government officials in NSS institutions and
will develop courses (including e-learning modules) based on the results of the needs assessment.
The NISR will utilize its senior officials and other experts in the NSS to provide courses and
serve as trainers. For statistical skills of lesser complexity, NISR will organize training for
trainers, who then can train officials within their respective organizations using the tools and
infrastructure available in the training center. For more complex statistical trainings (sampling
for instance), multimedia tools will be used to link to international experts so that they can offer
courses. The center is expected to be established and made operational by the end of the project’s
second stage. E-Learning and other outreach measures will also be used to offer courses to
district statisticians and other NSS stakeholders. Various dissemination mechanisms will be used
to raise awareness about the center while building a culture of evidence-based decision making
in the public sector. Once fully operational, the center could offer courses at the EAC level to
promote statistical literacy and expertise on a cost sharing basis. The use of modern tablet and
mobile technologies and tools will be piloted to gauge their usefulness in improving timeliness
and quality of data.
C. Institutional Arrangements
47.     On PFM, preparation of the Program was coordinated by the MINECOFIN SPIU,
which will take the lead in implementing, monitoring, and reporting on the Program. Rwanda has
taken a positive step following Cabinet resolution of February 11, 2011, regarding the formation
of the SPIU28 across Line Ministries and Public Agencies, with overall objective of creating an
effective institutional framework that will guide the process of designing and implementing
projects that are earmarked to fast track realization of development targets envisaged in the
various sector strategic plans. However, there are challenges of multiplicity of processes,
procedures and information systems resulting from the requirements of individual donors. This
in turn doubles the work load of the accountants, creates silos and does not encourage
strengthening of country systems. It is therefore important for the efficiency of the SPIU to
harmonize and have a single system applicable to all projects under the SPIU irrespective of the
donor. While in the long-run, using country systems by development partners is expected to
increase capacity to handle multiple tasks, in the short-run, the Bank through the Program
Implementation Support Plan will work with the SPIU to ensure effective implementation of the
Program.
48.    NISR will lead the implementation of the statistical component under the proposed
Program. NISR has solid program implementation capacity. NSDS 1 was implemented
according to schedule, with all major surveys and censuses conducted according to a pre-
determined timetable. An NSDS coordination team (NCT), consisting of procurement, financial
management, M&E, and planning staff, is already in place and have been trained by World Bank

procurement and financial management specialists in the framework of the Bank’s investment
project support to the previous NSDS 1.
49.     Reporting arrangement. As the existing M&E framework does not cover all key
information for effective implementation of the Program, the MINECOFIN SPIU will separately
report the following information.
    progress on DLIs and PAPs: twice a year, by February and August
    progress on expenditures by programs and subprograms, as identified in the expenditure
     framework: twice a year, by February and August
    audited financial statements of implementing agencies: annually29.
50.   The Government and the Bank will discuss other reporting issues that arise during
implementation.

III. Description and Assessment of Program Expenditure Framework
51.    Expenditure framework (table 8). Building on costing exercises of PFM SSP, NSDS 2
and MTEF, the total expenditure framework was formulated. Total expenditure for the Program
is US$172 million, to be disbursed between FY2014/15 and FY2017/18. The PFM component
accounts for 65 percent (US$113 million), and the statistics component accounts for 35 percent
(US$59 million) of the Program. Almost all expenditure activities are less than US$5 million;
exceptions include activities in e-procurement, IFMIS, and the fifth household survey (EICV 5).
Formulation of the total expenditure framework built on costing exercises of the PFM SSP,
NSDS 2, and the MTEF. With the support of US$100 million from the Program together with
contributions from the government (US$41 million) and other development partners (US$30
million), the PFM and statistics programs will be fully funded.
52.      Given the importance of addressing capacity constraints, the Government plans to
conduct capacity-building activities amounting to US$37 million (22 percent of total
expenditures) during the Program implementation period. According to the economic
classification, 30 the Government plans to spend US$2 million (1 percent of the total) on
compensation of employees in the MINECOFIN SPIU, US$122 million (71 percent of the total)
on goods and services, and US$47 million (28 percent of the total) on fixed capital. Construction
of the statistics training center is the Program’s only physical activity. It was addressed in the
environmental and social systems assessment (ESSA) (see annex G). Other fixed capital
activities include the purchase of software and related activities for e-procurement and the future
IFMIS. Procurable items (total minus compensation of employees) account for 99 percent of
total expenditures. Section IV of the Fiduciary Assessment analyzes the strengths and
weaknesses of the procurement systems and practice. Weakness identified will be addressed
through the Program (including through DLI and PAPs).

  The audit shall cover all the implementing agencies (RRA, RPPA, OAG, NISR and MINECOFIN (with an annex
to the MINECOFIN notes to the financial statements that will contain such information deemed classified
expenditure which shall remain confidential to the government). The Terms of reference for the audit will be agreed
upon with the Association.

A. Program Budget Structure and Classification
55.    The budget classification system is comprehensive and consistent with international
standards. The budget is prepared in compliance with the IMF’s Government Finance Statistics
Manual (IMF-GFSM 2001) 32 . The Chart of Accounts is also comprehensive to allow for
preparation of full set of financial statements in accordance with the International Public Sector
Accounting Standards (IPSAS) (figure 9). Budget programs and sub-programs have been
mapped to the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) standards 33. The Financial
statements accounting policies note that the financial statements are prepared on a “modified
cash basis” whilst the budget is prepared on cash basis. For further improvement, the Chart of
Accounts will be updated to accommodate new changes in the public sector accounting and
reduce various accounting posting errors (the first year DLI in DLI 4).
56.     The expenditure program is based on the approved MTEF covering FY2014/15-
2016/17, but two challenges remain 34 . The MTEF includes information on program, sub-
program, project/output and activity. However, it is not classified based on SSPs or other sector
strategies under the EDPRS 2. Therefore, in order to translate the information in the MTEF into
the PFM SSP and NSDS 2, the government has manually reclassified the MTEF (Annex 7).
Also, while the MTEF covers until FY2016/17, the Program aims to provide financing resources
until FY2017/18. Therefore, based on the assessments provided by MINECOFIN, expenditures
in FY2017/18 are obtained by extrapolating the growth rate in the previous fiscal year.

   Article 33 of the OBL dealing with “format of revenue budget appropriation” requires that “the revenues of
Central Government or decentralized entities shall adhere to internationally accepted standards of classification of
revenues”. http://www.minecofin.gov.rw/uploads/media/Official_Gazette_no_Special_of_05_11_2013_06.pdf
33
   OBL Article 34 “Expenditure estimates of each public entity shall be organized in a programmatic, economic and
functional classification, in line with international accepted classification standards of expenditures ”.
34
   The MTEF is currently the best medium-term expenditure plan of the government. Some weaknesses of the
MTEF will be addressed through the Program.

57.     The budget classification, in theory, allows the tracking of expenditures according to the
five segments. However, in practice, the tracking of expenditures by programs is challenging.
For example, wages and salaries are not included in programs or sub-programs but are
consolidated under ministries and agencies. In addition, budget presentation does not clearly
show how specific SSP pillars link to EDPRS 2 at the implementing agency level. Furthermore,
the summary financial information in the audit report does not provide detailed actual
expenditure in the same format as the approved budget to allow direct comparison of budget out-
turns vis-à-vis original policy intent. Therefore, until the program structure described in the
following paragraph is operationalized, the Program will rely on the matching table in annex 7.
58.    The Program supports government efforts in improving the program structure. The IMF
has been supporting this area through its technical assistance of the budget system improvement
programme, and the Program support the implementation of it. DLI 1 includes design and pilot
of a draft consolidated programme template to assist FY2015/16 budget preparation and
monitoring and evaluation processes in identified pilot MDAs.

B. Program’s Financial Sustainability and Funding Predictability
59.     Program’s financial sustainability and funding predictability are considered to be
appropriate. According to the latest IMF/Bank Joint Debt Sustainability Analysis (DSA),
Rwanda’s risk of debt distress rating has improved from moderate to low in the latest DSA in
response to a broadened export base. The total public debt outstanding at the end of 2012 stood
at 26% of GDP and the DSA shows that Rwanda’s external debt remains below the indicative
thresholds under all scenarios examined. The DSA further acknowledges that the authorities
have made progress on enhancing their debt management capacity. A major development was
the preparation and presentation by the authorities of their own DSA in October 201235.
60.    The execution ability measured by the deviation between the budget and actual
needs to be improved. The execution rates of the PFM program in the past two years are on
average 80 percent (table 9). On the contrary, the rates of the statistics program were 88 percent
in FY2011/12 and 94 percent in FY2012/13. By directly supporting the PFM sector, the
Program itself is expected to address execution capacity of the government.

61.    The expenditure framework does not include non-discretionary items such as wages
and salaries for two reasons. First, the budget classification does not allow capturing wages
and salaries by the specific programs. Second, the government considers that wages and salaries
should be financed by their own revenues 36 . In order to address these issues, the Program
supports improving the program structure through the first year DLI under DLI 1on
improvement of multi-year fiscal management framework.
62.    There is good track record of predictability of donor financing. On PFM, developing
partners participating in the PFM basket fund (UK, Germany and EU) have good track record of
channeling financial resources in the past several years. The new Memorandum of
Understanding (MoU) covering FY2014/15 and FY2017/18 has been signed.

C. Efficiency of Program Expenditure
63.     Institutional Arrangements and Expenditure Execution Incentive Mechanism.
Rwanda has a very good track record of results-based development management. For example,
Rwanda was one of two countries whose national development strategy was rated “A” in the
2010 Paris Declaration survey among 77 countries surveyed 37. The results-based aspect was
strengthened further in EDPRS 2 38 and SSPs. Results-based management has also been
operationalized at the ministerial, agency, units, and staff levels, which has created strong
incentive mechanism to achieve results.

IV. Description and Assessment of Program Results Framework and M&E
A. Program’s Results Framework
64.     The Program Development Objective (PDO) of this Program is enhancing Public
Financial Management and statistics systems to improve transparency and accountability in the
use of public funds, revenue mobilization and the quality and accessibility of development data
for decision making. The Program aims to achieve the following results:
      Increased efficiency in national and subnational revenue collection;
      Improved national and subnational transparency and accountability in the use of public
       funds; and
      Improved use of development data for decision-making.
65.     In order to achieve the results and the PDO, Program’s results framework has been
formulated based on government’s own results frameworks such as the result frameworks of
PFM SSP and NSDS 2, and PFM SSP sector implementation plan. Furthermore, Program’s
results framework supplemented additional information in the MTEF and other items deemed
important.

66.     The results framework for the Program (Annex 8) represents a consistent results
chain to achieve the PDO): The results framework has three key results areas which form
integral parts of the PFM cycle such as (i) increased efficiency in national and subnational
revenue collection; (ii) improved national and subnational transparency and accountability in the
use of public funds; and (iii) improved use of development data for decision-making. Each
results area is reflected in disbursement linked indicators (DLIs), program action plans (PAPs)
and program implementation support plan.
67.      Results Area 1, Enhanced National and Subnational Revenue Collection: The main
indicator of the results area is the tax to GDP ratio with Subindicator 1-(1) on “Hours per year
for paying tax”; Subindicator 1-(2) on “the number of districts using automated revenue
collection system” and Subindicator 1-(3) on “proportion of active small and micro taxpayers
filing tax declarations using e-tax Internet portal. The targeted outcomes in this results area will
be achieved by DLI 2 centralization of subnational revenue collections, PAPs under PFM SSP
program 2 on resource mobilization, activities supported by the Program under PFM SSP
Program 2 on resource mobilization and sub-program 6.1 on resource mobilization by
decentralized entities.
68.     Results Area 2, Improved National and Subnational Transparency and
Accountability in the Use of Public Funds: The main indicator of the results area is “percent of
entities submitting monthly statements by the due date and make them publically available”
accompanied by Subindicator 2-(1) on “proportion of MDAs receiving unqualified audit
opinions”; Subindicator 2-(2) on “percent of subdistricts using a simplified accounting and
financial reporting application.” And Subindicator 2-(3) on gap between annual budget and
second-year MTEF formulated previous year. The targeted outcomes in this results area will be
achieved by DLI 3 on e-procurement, DLI 4 on percent of MDAs receiving unqualified audit
opinion, DLI 5 on percent of subdistricts using a simplified accounting and financial reporting
application. Relevant PAPs and government activities under PFM SSP P3 (budget execution,
accounting and reporting), P4 (audit and legislative oversight), P5 (electronic service delivery
and IFMIS), P6 (fiscal decentralization) will also contribute to this results area.
69.      Results Area 3, Improved Use of Public Data for Decision Making: The main
indicator of the results area is “the share of MDAs for official statistics using both (a) Analysis
of current developments for short-term decision making and (b) Analysis of trends for longer-
term policy formulation”39 accompanied with Subindicator 3-(1) on “Annual national agricultural
survey conducted and disseminated” and Subindicator 3-(2) on “Annual labor market statistics
collected and disseminated.” In addition, inputs/activities, outputs and intermediate outcomes in
Strategic Objective 1 (Strengthen civil registration system, administrative records, surveys and
censuses and other sources of data), Strategic Objective 2 (Improve quality and dissemination of
statistics and public statistical literacy), Strategic Objective 3 (Improve statistical advocacy and
integrate use of statistics in decision making); and Strategic Objective 4 (Develop capacities
within NSS) under the NSDS 2 will help achieve the outcome targets.

B. Assessment of Program Implementing Agencies’ M&E System
70.     Building on already established M&E frameworks in the government’s PFM and
statistics programs, the MINECOFIN SPIU will take a coordination role in the Program
M&E. The SPIU is the main interface in preparing and implementing the Program. It will keep
coordination roles in implementation and M&E. The SPIU has a track record of managing
externally funded projects and program including the PFM Basket Fund.
71.    On PFM, the Program will draw on the existing M&E framework of the PFM SSP. The
SSP includes a section on Monitoring and Evaluation Plan describing how progress of the PFM
SSP will be monitored. The section also includes several monitoring tools such as Joint Sector
Review of the sector, PEFA and midterm/end of terms reviews. The SPIU has made progress on
M&E of the PFM SSP. In the first year of the implementation of the SSP (FY2013/14), the SPIU
consolidated three quarterly progress reports and one annual report for FY2012/13 with inputs
from other units of MINECOFIN and other agencies (for example, RRA, RPPA and OAG),
which are the implementing agencies of the Program.
72.     On statistics, the Program will draw on the existing M&E framework of NSDS 2 to
monitor progress toward milestones. NSDS 2 includes a comprehensive logical framework with
output and outcome indicators at each of the six strategic objectives it aims to accomplish. The
results framework for the Program is a subset of the NSDS 2 logical framework. During NSDS
2, NISR will report on progress through quarterly, six-monthly, and annual progress reports. In
addition, an independent consultant will be sourced to carry out annual, midterm, and final
reviews of the progress on NSDS 2. An independent user satisfaction survey will be conducted
every two years to gauge use of and satisfaction with data produced and disseminated by the
NSS among a wide variety of stakeholders (government, local and international organizations,
research institutes, civil society, and so forth) to measure PDO Indicator 3.

V. Disbursement Linked Indicators
A. Disbursement Linked Indicators
73.    Building on the results framework, the DLIs were selected to represent one or both
of the following criteria: (a) DLIs signal and monitor a milestone along the results chain
without which the PDO cannot be achieved and (b) DLIs signal incentives for rewarding
performance (Outputs, outcomes) to encourage the practice of managing for results (table 10). 40
Given the link between the DLIs and Program results areas (see the summary results framework
in Annex C), attaining the DLIs will contribute to the Bank’s twin goals through the above-
mentioned links with the three Program results areas.
74.    The DLIs are combinations of outputs and intermediate outcomes; almost all of them
meet the two criteria above. For example, an increase in the proportion of MDAs receiving
unqualified audit opinions directly contributes to the second results area of improved national
and subnational transparency and accountability in the use of public funds. The first- and second-

outcome, the percentage increase in unqualified audit reports.

75.     DLI 1 (Improved public investment): The DLI focuses on public investment
management. In Rwanda where the share of capital expenditures accounts for 45% of the total
budget, improving public investment management is critical. In this regard, the DLI is “Number
of pilot ministries submitting investment plan in which feasibility studies are conducted for new
projects exceeding US$1 million have, per instructions in budget call circular”. The baseline is
zero and DLI targets are 1 pilot ministry in year 1; 3 in year 2 and 5 in year 3. A proposed
revision of the national investment policy is expected to contribute to improving public
investment management.
76.      DLI 2 (Centralization of subnational revenue collection): Building on the study on
local government revenue potential in late 2013, the government decided to enhance local
revenue-administrative capacity by facilitating collaboration between the RRA and districts. The
collaboration covers the installation of new automated revenue systems and procedures, together
with staff on-boarding, training and other forms of capacity building. A pilot project on the new
automated revenue systems funded by the African Development Bank will be carried out in three
districts in Kigali. Also, the government has formulated a specific action plan to follow up on
the government’s decision to delegate the tax collection function to RRA on behalf of the
districts. Phase 1 includes RRA support to all districts in collecting tax revenues of three tax
sources, using existing systems and in collaboration with staff at the districts. Phase 2, planned to
be launched in January 2015, is intended to have RRA taking over all functions on revenue


                                                         33
mobilization, including taxes and fees collection, tax audit, enforcement, objections and appeals
against assessed taxes. This new mandate for RRA requires a review of the existing legal
framework in the second half of 2014. The Program supports the automated revenue systems
and key output in the action plan. The DLI is the number of districts using automated local
government revenue management system. DLI targets are 3 districts in year 1, 6 in year 6 and 11
in year 3.
77.     DLI 3 (E-Procurement implemented): Under the Medium-Term Strategic Plan on
Public Procurement for 2012/13-2014/1541, the introduction of E-Procurement is identified as
one of the key activities for transparent and efficient public procurement systems. With the
assistance of the World Bank, the Government has carried out the feasibility study. The study
also recommends that the e-Procurement system be developed along a close integration with
other existing systems such as IFMIS and the Business registry at Rwanda Development Board
(RDB). Linking the e-Procurement system with other systems will help exchange data and cross-
check compliance with procurement rules. The DLI in the first year is an approval of technical
proposal, financial proposal and roadmap by the minister of MINECOFIN. The second year DLI
is functioning of IFMIS and E-Procurement interface protocols. These DLIs are expected to
enable pilot government entities to start using e-Tendering and application of IFMIS and E-
Procurement interface protocols. This is the third year DLI.
78.     DLI 4 (Proportion of Ministries, Districts and Agencies (MDAs) receiving
unqualified audit opinion): Increasing the proportion of MDAs 42 is critical to enhance
transparency and accountability. For FY2012/13, 45 of 139 MDAs (32 percent) received
unqualified audit opinions. Government efforts supporting this area include update PFM pocket
booklet43 disseminated to Chief Budget Managers and training conducted in the first year. This
booklet will contribute to improved compliance of government officials with government rules,
as the booklet will summarize the whole PFM cycle information and references to the legal
regulations governing the PFM Cycle. This helps the any staff from the top management to the
lower accountant to be easily guided by the pocket note and know where to read/refer further.
To address some weakness of the current internal audit structure (e.g., staffing), the government
plans to issue a Ministerial Order on a revised internal audit structure. Key milestones to address
challenges on internal audit are operationalizing automation of internal audit through Electronic
Working Papers (EWP) and, training of records management and procurement 44 training
conducted and a study on Risk profile of budgeting entities. Furthermore, capacity development
as well as quality staff is key to achieving this DLI. DLI 6 on the number of Government
sponsored PFM staff with at least foundation-level professional finance qualifications will
contribute to this area. The first year target is 37 percent to be increased to 42 percent in year 2
and 47 percent in year 3.

79.     DLI 5 (% of Subsidiary entities using a simplified accounting and financial
reporting application): The Program plans to support the operationalization of the simplified
accounting system at the sub-district level with DLIs of the share of the sub-districts using the
simplified accounting and financial reporting application at 30% in the first year, 60% in the
second year and 80% in the third year. In recognition of capacity constraints at the subnational
level, milestone in the first year is a provision of training for end-users and system
administrators. The second year milestone is posting of consolidated quarterly budget
performance reports (revenue and expenditure) by District Executive Committee on a notice
board in a conspicuous place on the premises of the Council followed by posting of quarterly
budget performance reports (revenue and expenditure) disaggregated by sectors and place on
notice board in a conspicuous place in each sector in the third year.
80.     DLI 6 (number of Government sponsored PFM staff with at least foundation-level
professional finance qualifications): The technical and fiduciary assessments point of that
enhancing capacity is key for successful PFM reform. As of September 2014, 294 staff or 27%
of the total government staff working on financial management has at least foundation-level
qualification. Also, there is no tuition providers accredited to provide professional accountancy
training in Rwanda. Building on the current situation, the first year DLI is 350 government staff
acquires at least foundation level qualification to be increased to 400 staff in year 2 and 450 in
year 3. To address, the government plans that two Rwandan educational institutions accredited
to provide professional training under ICPAR, ACCA, and AAT.
81.     DLI 7 (Increased production of economic statistics): The first year DLI is the
implementation of a best-practice National Agriculture Survey (NAS) and the release of the
results by May 2015. The NAS will build on lessons learnt from the experimental agricultural
survey which was piloted in 2013. The second year DLI is the implementation of the Integrated
Business Enterprise Survey (IBES) and the release of the results by May 2016. The IBES will be
based on the sample frame of the Establishment Census, which will be implemented in the first
year of the Program concurrently with the NAS. The third year DLI is the rebasing of national
accounts with base year updated to 2014, with the rebased and updated GDP figures released by
end-of-April 2017. The updating of the system of national accounts will include new economic
source data provided by the NAS and the IBES, among others.
82.    DLI 8 (Open data): The first year DLI is the release on NADA, by June 2015, of the
micro-data of the experimental agricultural survey (2012/13) and at least 5 percent of the data of
the 2012 Population and Housing Census45. The second year DLI is the release on NADA, by
June 2016, of micro-data of the EICV4 poverty survey. The third year DLI consists of the release
on NADA, by June 2017, of data from the fifth Demographic and Health Survey and the
extension of open data to the administrative records of at least one of the main line Ministries
(the Ministry of Health or the Ministry of Education, which already have Management
Information Systems in place). This needs to be achieved by June 2017. This will mark an
important milestone in extending the open data initiative across government.
83.     In light of the fact that each DLI constitutes an important part of the PFM cycle and
interlinks between the DLIs, the disbursement amounts are almost equally distributed across the
DLIs.

45
     For reasons of confidentiality and anonymity, census data do not get released in full.




                                                            35
B. Verification Protocol
84.      On disbursement arrangements, DLI targets are given in an indicative annual time frame
(Annex D in the PAD). Confirmation that an indicator has been achieved/completed will be
based on the agreed verification protocols. Once an indicator is achieved/completed, the
Government can make a disbursement request up to twice a year. In order to implement
activities to achieve DLIs, the Government has requested that 25 percent of Program proceeds be
paid as an advance. In addition, if the Government achieves the first-year DLI 3 on E-
Procurement before the signing of the legal agreement, the Bank will disburse an additional 5
percent of the Program proceeds as prior results.46 (See Annex Table D-1.)
85.     For selected DLIs, the Bank will apply for scalability for disbursement. For example, for
the DLI 6 (government PFM staff working in financial management with at least foundation-
level professional finance qualification), actual disbursement will be calculated based on the
ratio between the gap between the actual number and baseline and the gap between the target and
baseline.
86.     In order to conduct the verification protocol, the MINECOFIN SPIU will be responsible
for gathering all data, information, and evidence of completion of the DLIs from the
implementing agencies, which it will deliver to the Bank and an independent body, such as
OAG, for verification.47 The Bank or the OAG, or both will conduct onsite visits. The financial
resources required for verification have been included in the expenditure framework. 48
Verification is thus fully funded. The contents and quality of verification will have to be
satisfactory to IDA.

VI. Program Economic Evaluation
A. Rationale for Public Provision and/or Financing
87.      Public provision in PFM and statistics has a strong rationale. PFM is core public
goods underlining all government activities. Each element of the PFM cycle (figure 6) has been
managed by the central and subnational governments. As improving the PFM is expected to
create spillover effects to the rest of the economy, the public provision is justifiable. On
statistics, the process of planning, policy-making, and monitoring and evaluation of government
policies require a wide variety of development statistics, which only public investment can
provide. While the private sector can and does collect specific statistics, they are unlikely to
invest in a complete statistical system. Left to the market there would likely be significant
underinvestment in statistics, hereby foregoing the benefits of better statistics. In addition,
statistics are a public good. Once produced, statistics can be used by different levels of
government, citizens, and businesses to facilitate evidence-based decisions in their spheres of
interest. Public provision in statistics thus creates positive externalities.


46
   Paragraph 14-16 of BP 9.00 – Program-for-Results Financing
47
   If OAG takes the verification role, it will not conduct verification of DLIs that they are in charge for data
collection and provision. In this case, the Bank will hire an external consultant.
48
   In case the OAG will have to hire a consultant, based on the past experience, US$70 thousands (annual) are
included in the expenditure framework.



                                                      36
B. Economic Impact of the Program
88.    Improving the whole PFM cycle through the PFM and Statistics Programs are likely
to gain efficiencies of the whole government expenditures. EDPRS 2 expects that the public
sector will play a catalytic role in promoting private sector-led development. Focusing on the
whole PFM cycle will enhance the public sector’s role. Also, in Rwanda where the share of
government expenditures in the economy (30%) is relatively higher than other developing
countries, economic impacts of improved PFM system (including statistics) would be significant.
89.    A literature supports positive relationship between PFM and development
objectives (table 11). However, the extent of the contribution of PFM to development
objective differs.49
     Macroeconomic Stability: The ability of PFM systems to provide relevant information on
      status of, and risk to, debt and deficits is its most significant contribution.
     Efficient Allocation of Resources: PFM systems which focus on providing relevant
      information on available resources, and a timely budget preparation process that involves all
      stakeholders, can contribute to the right allocation. However, ‘efficient’ allocation can only
      be done in light of a pre-existing, politically determined expenditure strategy that chooses
      between various public spending priorities.
     Service Delivery: The link between PFM functions and service delivery is less clear. Regular
      payment of staff salaries is likely to be important to all public service delivery, but beyond
      this the relevant prioritization of PFM functions to contribute to service delivery will depend
      on the nature of the sector being considered.
     State Building: The relationship between PFM functions and state-building is particularly
      complex, given that each of the three other development objectives are themselves theorized
      to contribute, to a greater or lesser extent, to an effective state.

Application to Rwanda’s Context
90.    Good track record of PFM improvement in Rwanda: An international comparison
using CPIA Indicator 13 (quality of budgetary and financial management rating) in 2013 shows
that Rwanda’s score (4.0) ranks 4th among 82 countries. Also, Rwanda’s score exceeds the
average score of middle income countries (3.3) (figure 6). Furthermore, among 73 countries
where the comparison between 2005 and 2013 is possible, only one third of the countries
improved the score (another one third deteriorated, and the remaining one third remained the
same). Rwanda is one of the countries having experienced the improvement. Rwanda’s progress
is remarkable given the fact that there seem to be no functioning PFM systems after the 1994
genocide. This proves that Rwanda has effectively improved PFM in the past two decades.
91.     Macroeconomic stability: One of the most important structural problems is high aid
dependency. In FY2014/15 budget, foreign grants accounts for 36% of the total revenues. The
importance of PFM, especially domestic resource mobilization, is evident in the 2012 aid
decline. In the first half of FY2012 (July-Dec 2012), budget support turned out to be less than
the original budget by 3% of GDP (US$230 million). The aid decline is the main cause of the
growth deceleration from 8.8% in 2012 to 4.7% in 2013. If 2013 growth was the same as the one
in 2012, GDP values (2011 constant prices) would have been higher by US$242 million.
Domestic resource mobilization (Program 2 of PFM SSP) supported by the Program is expected
to reduce high aid dependency, which will lead to enhance macroeconomic stability.
92.     Rwanda is on the right track to improve the PFM functions contributing to
macroeconomic stability in table 11. Government programs 3 (budget execution, internal
control, accounting and reporting) and 5 (electronic service delivery and IFMIS) to be supported
by the Program are expected to improve ‘timely and reliable fiscal and financial information’.
Sub-program 3.6 (fiscal risk management in public enterprises) is expected to reduce risks
associated with public enterprises through improved corporate governance and risk management.
Debt management (sub-program 1.2) has been improved in recent years. This is evident in
improved CPIA indicator 3 on debt policy and management. The rating improved from 3.5 in
2012 to 4.0 in 2013.
93.     Efficient allocation of resources: Given   Figure 10: Gross Fixed Capital Formation
low domestic resource mobilization and             as % of GDP
resulting high aid dependency, efficient
allocation of resources, as rightly described as
the main goal of PFM SSP, is essential for
Rwanda. Among the PFM functions in the table
a well-structured budget preparation process is
underway through government program 1
(economic planning and budgeting). The
program includes improved coherence between
strategies/planning and budgeting, and the
government has made some progress in this
regard during the formulation of FY2014/15
budget.                                            Source: World Development Indicators

94.    On efficient allocation of resources, improving public investment management is
especially important for Rwanda. In FY2014/15 budget, development budget accounts for 45%


                                              38
of the total. The share of public investment in the economy is higher than neighboring countries
(figure 10). An IMF paper 50 argues that “while the literature suggests that a scaling-up of
investment in low-income countries is vital, the link with development outcomes depends
critically on the quality and efficiency of public investment”. The study produced composite
score from four aspects (strategic guidance and project appraisal, project selection and
budgeting, project implementation and project evaluation and audit) of 71 countries (40 low-
income, and 31 middle-income countries) for the period between 2007 and 2010. Rwanda
ranked 12th among 71 countries and 4th in low-income countries. Among the four aspects, scores
of project selection and budgeting, and project evaluation and audit had lower scores than others.
The Program, for example, supports the government in carrying out annual post-evaluation
report for the closed projects. Thus, it is expected that public investment management will be
more efficient and effective.
Cost-Benefit Consideration
95.    Returns to investment in PFM and statistics are likely to be high. Improving PFM is
expected to bring effective and efficient allocations of public resources 51. In the PFM cycle, the
planning and budgeting element is key in bring national development priorities and allocation of
nation’s resources together. Planning and budgeting element includes public investment
management. In FY2014/15 budget, the government plans to spend US$1.1 billion for
development budget, which accounts for 45% of the total budget.
96.     Public procurement plays a critical role in effective public expenditure management. In
Rwanda with annual procurement amount of about US$0.8 billion, introducing e-Procurement
would offer a huge potential for increased efficiency in addition to transparency and compliance.
According to a feasibility study commissioned by the Bank, “Using a very conservative 1% of
cost savings (including time’, lower transaction costs, paper, travel and other) we estimate e-GP,
will save the country $8 million a year. The actual savings, based on other known cases with
carefully planned implementations of e-GP, should be significantly higher with a quick return on
investment” 52 . The amount is almost equivalent to the planned expenditure to design and
implement e-procurement. The cost saving impact of e-procurement is to be observed at least in
the medium-term suggests that supporting e-procurement is well justified.
97.     The future IFMIS constitutes one of the largest spending items in the expenditure
framework (US$16 million out of US$171 million or about 9% of the total). According to an
internal World Bank note53, the difficulties in measuring the benefits of Financial Management
Information System (FMIS) vary a great deal among projects in various regions and a
comprehensive quantification of costs and benefits is generally not possible for large scale PFM
projects. At the same time, in all completed projects, client countries have reported

WP/11/37)
51
   ODI (2013) “Linking PFM Dimensions to Development Priorities” (Working Paper 3 80), for example, analyzed a
relationship between PFM and development objectives such as macroeconomic stability, efficient allocation of
resources, service delivery and state building. The paper finds that positive relationship with macroeconomic
stability and efficient allocation of resources, however relationships with service delivery and state building are less
clear and complex.

improvements, including in revenue collection, cash forecasting, debt management, reduction of
payment processing times, greater reliability and transparency in public accounts, better
procurement and payroll management, tracking of assets, and the publication of more accurate
and timely reports on budget execution performance, in addition to improved operational
efficiency and reduced recurrent costs for the ICT infrastructure.
98.     In the case of Rwanda, the main cost items on the future IFMIS are software acquisition /
development (US$4 million) and implementation (US$8 million). The government has decided
that the future IFMIS will build on the current IFMIS, and therefore it is likely that the costs will
be much smaller than acquiring a new system. In the future IFMIS, the government plans to
supplement new modules such as asset management, inventory management, procurement
interface, and project management. Also, the future IFMIS will have interface with other
systems such as e-procurement and donor assistance database. Establishing interface with other
systems is expected to potentially increase benefits of the future IFMIS. The government plans
to roll-out the future IFMIS between FY2015 and FY2017. If the same savings ratio of 0.5%
was applied to the entire budget for Rwanda (about US$3 billion a year) the annual saving would
be US$15 million. As the future IFMIS builds on the current IFMIS, the cost saving impact
would be lower due to possible diminishing rate of return. Nevertheless, even if a very
conservative assumption (0.1% saving ratio) is applied, the annual saving would be US$3
million and it would take 5 years to reach the breakeven point.
99.     On statistics, most arguments for investment in statistics argue that good statistics bring
tangible benefits in the form of improved policy and better development results and reduce waste
due to misallocation of resources. A concrete application of the value of statistics is its use in
targeting of social programs: having good statistics to guide targeting leads to large effectiveness
gains and significantly reduces misallocation of resources 54. This is particularly important in
Rwanda where a large body of social benefits (health insurance, cash transfers, participation in
public works) are provided by the Government based on a household’s social and economic
status. Quality statistics are also important to the financial system, as according to a recent IMF
study, they tend to reduce the cost of borrowing from private capital markets. The study indicates
that countries that subscribe to the IMF Special Data Dissemination Standard (SDDS) and
participate in the General Data Dissemination System (GDDS) initiatives registered a positive
impact on their sovereign borrowing in private capital markets—that is, they experienced a
reduction in the launch spreads of sovereign borrowing by 0.2 to 0.5 percentage points. These
positive impacts or discounts are also evident when launch yields are analyzed in sovereign bond
issues.55
C. World Bank Value Added
100. The Bank has a comparative advantage in supporting PFM and statistics, and it has
been engaged in public sector reforms in Rwanda for almost two decades. In the late 1990s
and early 2000s, the Bank helped Rwanda build capacity in the public sector through trust-
funded activities such as Institutional Strengthening Initiatives for the Legal Advancement of

Women (TF050066) and Public Procurement Management Project (TF063056). The Multi
Donor Trust Fund for Rwanda Public Financial Management (TF070485) was implemented in
the second half of the 2000s. More recently, the Bank provided support to these areas through the
Poverty Reduction Support Financing (PRSF) series and the Statistics for Results project
(P124129). The Bank also implemented the Quality of Decentralized Service Delivery support
Development Policy Operation (DPO) (P145114), which included national and subnational PFM.
The Bank has also been one of the leading development partners in PFM and statistics, co-
chairing the PFM Coordination Forum and serving as a core member of the Statistics Steering
Committee. Consolidating the Bank’s engagements into the Program is likely to achieve results.
101. The Program builds especially on the Bank’s 2013 Quality of Decentralized Service
Delivery budget support operation. The development objective of the DPO is to support the
Government in clarifying “institutional roles and responsibilities for decentralized service
delivery” and enhancing “public transparency, fiduciary accountability, and local government
capacity for improved access to quality services.” It focuses on national/subnational PFM issues,
including capacity building at the subnational level. During the dialogue on the DPO, the Bank’s
shareholders requested that the Bank remain engaged in (a) gender mainstreaming; (b) the
quality of data; (c) budget execution, reporting, and auditing; (d) revenue mobilization at the
subnational level; (e) capacity building; and (f) donor coordination. The Program responds to this
request.
102. In addition to linking with past Bank operations, the Program is expected to
complement other ongoing and planned Bank operations. As PFM cuts across all sectors,
enhancing PFM at the national and subnational levels benefits other Bank operations. For
example, the Program will augment the fiduciary aspects of a planned development operation.
Improved PFM, especially at the subnational level, will contribute to implementation of the
Transformation of Agriculture Sector Program Phase 3 PforR (P148927). Improved quality and
availability of statistics will benefit results frameworks of all Bank operations.
103. On statistics, global knowledge and expertise is the value-added and comparative
advantage of World Bank participation. The World Bank’s international experiences would be
leveraged for the benefit of NISR, to design and implement economic statistics and build the
statistical skills of NSS officials. The Program will support the design and roll-out of specific
types of economic surveys in which the World Bank has demonstrated comparative advantages.
Through the Living Standards Measurement Study-Integrated Surveys on Agriculture
(LSMS/ISA) program, the World Bank is at the forefront of designing and testing improvements
in agricultural data collection. The Bank’s wide expertise in this field can be tapped to improve
the quality of agricultural data that will be collected under the Program. In a similar fashion, the
World Bank’s Labor Markets team has a long-standing expertise in the design and
implementation of enterprise and labor force surveys around the world, which can be exploited
to produce high-quality labor statistics in Rwanda.

VII. Inputs to the Program Action Plan
104. The selections of the Program Actions Plans (PAPs) of the Program are based on the
Program’s results framework (Annex 8) building on this technical assessment as well as the
fiduciary assessment given the fact that the main subject of the Program (i.e., PFM at the
national and subnational levels) and fiduciary aspects are closely linked.


                                                41
105. The PAPs for the Program are grouped into three types: (i) Changes to the technical
dimensions of the Program and to the formal rules and procedures governing the organization
and management of the systems used to implement the Program; (ii) Actions to enhance the
capacity and performance of the agencies involved; and (iii) Risk-mitigating measures to
increase the potential for the Program to achieve its results and to address fiduciary, social, and
environmental concerns56. Detailed PAPs are described in (Annex 12).

VIII. Technical Risk Rating
106. The overall technical risk rating of the Program is substantial. On PFM, the
technical risk rating is substantial. The main risks include (i) need for coordination among
government leadership such as collective agreement on e-Procurement model; (ii) human
resource capacity challenges in implementing the wide ranging reform program; and (iii) The
districts’ credibility vis-à-vis citizens may be weakened, due to a move to centralized revenue
collection systems. These technical risks can be mitigated through (i) the preparation of the
Program has contributed to improve coordination among key government agencies leading PFM,
and the implementation of the Program is expected to further consolidate the coordination; (ii)
having in place Chief Finance Officers (CFO) and Internal Auditors who are at least Accounting
Technicians depending on the budget size and risk environment together with knowledgeable
and experienced Budget Officers and Procurement Officers would improve the quality of the
PFM functions; (iii) Local governments scheme of service for Chief Finance Officers,
Procurement Officers, Planners and Budget Officers established; and (iv) technical assistance to
strengthen the districts’ role and capacity on revenue management, including tax payer
compliance, will mitigate the risk
107. On statistics, the technical risk rating is moderate. During NSDS-1, NISR has
showcased its implementation capacity and its technical capability to conduct complex statistical
undertakings such as the Population and Housing Census. Several new surveys will be
introduced during NSDS-2 while the frequency of existing surveys will be increased. This means
that NISR will need to manage an increased number of often simultaneously running surveys
while also addressing the need to improve the quality of administrative statistics. The successful
accomplishment of NSDS-2 and of the Program will require a significant number of new staff,
both in the core technical fields and in the support services. Delays in hiring additional staff
could cause delays in Program implementation, negatively affecting progress and attainment of
results measured against the DLIs.

IX. Inputs to the Program Implementation Support Plan
108. The implementation support plan is based on the Interim Guidance Note on the Technical
Assessment 57 , adapted to the design and risk profile of the Program in Rwanda. While the
borrower is responsible for the Program’s overall implementation, the Bank and the borrower
have agreed that the Bank would offer support to implementation in the areas of (i) Reviewing
implementation progress and achievement of Program results and DLIs; (ii) Helping the client to

the performance of Program systems, including the implementation of the PAP; and (iv)
Monitoring changes in Program risks as well as compliance with the provisions of legal
covenants. Details of the Program Implementation Support Plan are described in annex 14.

Annex 1: The Government PFM Program58
Program 1: Economic Planning and Budgeting
1.      Outcomes: Program 1 has six expected outcomes: (a) stronger links between the budget
allocation and strategic planning processes, leading to a sharper focus on the Government’s
policy priorities; 59 (b) significant improvement in the preparation of the MTEF, so that it
becomes an effective planning tool; (c) inclusion of funding from donor partners in budget
documentation; (d) changes to ministerial budgets so that they reflect sector priorities; (e)
stronger risk management in the budget planning area; and (f) maintenance of government debt
at sustainable levels.
2.     Subprograms: Program 1 is divided into four subprograms, each of which has specific
outputs and priority actions (annex table 1-1).
Annex Table 1-1: Outputs of Program 1 (Economic Planning and Budgeting), by Subprogram
         Subprogram                                                    Output
1.1 National development         1: Strategic planning in line with EDPRS 2 priorities strengthened
planning
1.2 Economic policy              1: Macroeconomic framework improved
formulation                      2: Debt management practices improved
                                 3: Capacity in revenue forecasting, tax policy, and negotiation skills built
1.3 Public investment            1: Public investment programming strengthened
programming
1.4 Policy-based budgeting       1: Realism of MTEF projections improved
                                 2: Reporting on externally financed projects improved
                                 3: Effectiveness of gender budget statements enhanced
3.      Priority actions and outputs: In order to strengthen strategic planning in line with
EDPRS 2 priorities (Output 1 under Subprogram 1.1), the Government plans to conduct
capacity-building activities for planners at both the central and district levels and to reinforce
data-collection systems through electronic M&E system. Recognizing that economic policy
formulation (Subprogram 1.2) is a foundation for development planning, the Government aims to
improve the macroeconomic framework (Output 1), debt management (Output 2), and revenue
forecasting (Output 3) through capacity-building activities, including through the use of a
technical advisor on the macroeconomic and fiscal framework. On public investment
management (Subprogram 1.3), the policy framework, formulated in 2009, is outdated. To
strengthen public investment management, the Government will revise the public investment
policy to incorporate public-private partnership (PPP). Together with public investment
management, policy-based budgeting (Subprogram 1.4) is a key component of the program. To
improve the realism of the MTEF (Output 1), the Government plans to conduct an analysis and
implement reforms, with support from the IMF. Improvement in reporting on externally financed
projects (Output 2) is essential to improve the MTEF. The Government has implemented gender
budgeting and plans to enhance it (Output 3) by training planning and budget officers.
4.      Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.

58
  These programs and sub-programs are formulated based on analyses of challenges and proposed solutions, and
each program has expected outcomes (Annex table 1-1).
59
   In the PFM SSP, the Government describes this outcome as “increased emphasis on performance -based budgeting
to enforce accountability and facilitate prioritization.”

     Subprogram 1.1: National Development Planning. The national development planning
      process is defined by the implementation framework for EDPRS 2 (annex figure 1-1). 60
      Accompanying the SSPs, other strategies, such as NSDS 2 and district development plans,
      function as implementation tools for EDPRS 2. The SSPs and other strategies are reviewed in
      backward-looking Joint Sector Reviews conducted few months after the end of the fiscal
      year. These reviews are updated in forward-looking Joint Sector Reviews produced a few
      months before the beginning of each fiscal year. The mechanism has been operationalized,
      but capacity at both the central and subnational levels needs to be strengthened. It is also
      essential to establish a clear link between the SSPs and district development plans and to
      establish the budget (see Subprogram 1.4, on policy-based budgeting).

     Subprogram 1.2: Economic Policy Formulation. Economic policy formulation is the
      foundation for PFM, as governments allocate financial resources based on their economic
      policy. The macroeconomic unit of MINECOFIN has improved the macroeconomic policy
      framework, debt management, and domestic revenue mobilization policies (related to
      Subprogram 2.1, on tax policy) through the IMF’s Policy Support Instrument (PSI). For
      example, the medium-term macroeconomic framework is described in the budget framework
      paper. 61 Debt management and macroeconomic policies are well coordinated. An annual
      borrowing plan for government financing informs the medium-term debt management
      strategy. The annual borrowing plan forms part of the budget framework paper. Domestic
      revenue mobilization is a core theme for the new IMF PSI, which commenced in 2014.
      MINECOFIN has formulated a medium-term tax reform plan for 2013–16, which will be
      regularly updated with support from the IMF (for more details, see the discussion of Program
      2, on Resource Mobilization).

    Subprogram 1.3: Public Investment Programming. Public investment programming plays
     an essential role in planning and budgeting. Rwanda’s development budget accounts for
     about 45 percent of the FY2014/15 budget. Public investment also has medium-to long-term
     implications, through future operational and maintenance costs. The policy on public
     investment management is defined in the National Public Investment Policy of 2009, but
     implementation and application of the policy was weak until recently. For example, the
     Public Investment Committee, which has decision-making authority over the public
     investment program (that is, the development budget), was not operationalized until the
     formulation of the FY2014/15 budget. Public investment projects were discussed without
     feasibility studies. Future budget implications were not taken into consideration in
     formulating the MTEF. Although leveraging the private sector is a key principle of EDPRS
     2, the National Public Investment Policy does not cover PPP. To address these issues, the
     Government made some reforms in preparing the FY2014/15 budget operationalizing the
     Public Investment Committee, for example.62 New investment project proposals now need to
     be accompanied by project profile documents, three-year investment plans, and feasibility
     studies. The Government also plans to revise the National Investment Policy (covering both
     public investment and PPP).
    Subprogram 1.4: Policy-Based Budgeting. A multiyear perspective is expected to improve
     fiscal management by (a) improving control over the aggregate fiscal position, (b) allocating
     expenditure across sectors and policy priorities more effectively, and (b) using public
     resources more effectively and efficiently. These benefits are especially important for
     Rwanda, which is aiming to reduce its aid dependency. The MTEF introduced in 2002 has
     been fully incorporated into the budget cycle at both the national and subnational levels.
     Despite progress, however, the multiyear fiscal management framework and procedures are
     not yet effective. Fully costed sector strategies are not in place, and the link between sector
     strategies and budget is weak, resulting in limited use of the MTEF by stakeholders.
     Investment planning and its budgetary impact are not fully captured in the current MTEF.
     Tighter integration of taxation and expenditure formulation is needed, so that tax expenditure
     decisions are included in the budget cycle. Although the budget framework paper plays a
     critical role in linking planning and budgeting, in practice budgeting and planning are
     separate processes. Additional challenges include the need to include external sources in the
     budget, link the budget and policy priorities, cost sector strategies and programs, and
     improve the availability of key statistics (for example, labor statistics) to measure
     performance. Because of these limitations, Rwanda’s performance on multiyear fiscal
     management is relatively weak, and the last two PEFA assessments improvements identified
     no improvements.63 In 2001 the Government initiated gender-responsive budgeting. In 2003
     it piloted it in five ministries; it fully operationalized the practice in the FY2010/11


62
  Details are found in the first and second planning budgeting call circulars for the 2014/15 fiscal year (October
2013 and February 2014).
63
   Rwanda’s score on the 2010 “PEFA PI-12 on Multi-Year Perspective in Fiscal Planning, Expenditure Policy and
Budgeting” was C+, unchanged from 2007. The assessment states that “the failure of the MTEF (see PI-12) to
deliver its true objective of linking policy targets with actual budget allocations and thus ensure at the same time a
strategic allocation of resources and fiscal sustainability, is also especially costly in Rwanda, given the vast amount
of capacity invested in the multiyear planning process, which is very extensive and involves a large variety of
activities throughout the budget preparation cycle, across all sectors” (pp. 27–28).

       budget.64The first evaluation, conducted in FY2013/14, identified key areas for improvement,
       including high staff turnover of budget and planning officers and the lack of gender statistics.
       The Program will support a gender-responsive budgeting training program for planning and
       budgeting officers. NISR has started producing national and subnational gender statistics. To
       strengthen the M&E of gender-responsive budgeting implementation, the 2013 Organic
       Budget Law includes a clause requesting an annual activity report on plans for gender
       balance (part of the PAPs).65 Annex figure 1-2 displays the planning and budgeting process.

Program 2: Resource Mobilization
5.      Outcomes: Program 2 has five expected outcomes: (a) significantly higher domestic
revenue collection; (b) transparent, simple, and understandable tax policies and efficient tax
collection; (c) greater Government capacity to access international markets to raise additional
finance; (d) exploration of nontraditional sources of finance; and (e) increased use of country
systems in the management of external aid.
6.     Subprograms: Program 2 is divided into three subprograms, each of which has specific
outputs and priority actions (annex table 1-2).

2.2 Tax administration      1: Tax revenue mobilization maximized
                            2: Service delivery to external and internal customers improved
2.3 External finance        1: External resources mobilization strategy produced and implemented
                            2: Coordination of development partners enhanced
                            3: Development assistance database upgraded
7.      Priority Actions and Outputs: Outputs under Subprogram 2.1 focus on developing a
new strategy (for example, Output 1, on new tax reform strategy) and reforming regulatory
frameworks (for example, Output 2, on revising the investment code and outputs 4 on the revised
mining law). Domestic revenue mobilization is expected to be achieved not only by reforming
the regulatory framework but by improving applications of the framework (Subprogram 2.2., on
tax administration). Therefore, Output 1, on maximizing tax revenue mobilization, includes
priority actions such as e-tax filing and payment and implementation of electronic billing
machines. Although reducing aid dependency is an important medium-term goal, achieving the
development objectives in EDPRS 2 depends on external finance at least in the short term
(Subprogram 2.3). In order to improve the use of aid, this subprogram aims to formulate an
external resource mobilization strategy (Output 1); better coordinate development partners
(Output 2), through organizing forums; and upgrade the development assistance database
(Output 3).
8.      Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.
      Subprograms 2.1 and 2.2: Tax Policy and Tax Administration. Increasing domestic
       revenues to expand fiscal space is one of the most important policy priorities in Rwanda. Tax
       revenue as a share of GDP increased from 12.0 percent in FY2009/10 to 14.2 percent in
       FY2012/13. Significant progress was also made in tax policy, tax administration, and tax
       systems in the past few years. The Government introduced various tax policy and
       administrative measures, including a new VAT law (introduced in December 2012), a new
       tax system for small and medium-size enterprises (introduced in September 2012), and
       electronic billing machines. Despite progress, the tax revenue to GDP ratio is one of the
       lowest in Sub-Saharan Africa, where the average rate is above 18 percent. 66 Domestic
       revenue mobilization is the most important subject of the IMF’s new Policy Support
       Instrument, which began in 2014. The government showed its strong commitment to revenue
       mobilization in the accompanying Memorandum of Economic and Financial Policies.67 To
       operationalize the commitment, MINECOFIN developed the Medium-Term Tax Reforms
       Plan 2013–16, which identifies tax policies and administrative measures aimed at (a)
       broadening tax bases (including by reducing exemptions and improving compliance), (b)
       further strengthening tax administration (including e-filing), and (c) strengthening risk

66
     According to the IMF’s Regional Economic Outlook (October 2013), the average ratio was 26.6 percent in 2012.

     management. To improve transparency, the Government plans to publish tax expenditures to
     be incorporated into the national budget.68 Improving subnational PFM, such as local revenue
     mobilization, is a key priority of the Government’s decentralization strategy. The Bank has
     been supporting these efforts.69
    Subprogram 2.3: External Finance. The External Finance Unit (EFU) serves as the main
     interface between the Government and development partners on all issues of external
     support. It is responsible for coordinating aid to Rwanda so that it best supports the
     Government’s socioeconomic policy objectives. The EFU plays a leading role in the strategic
     cooperation framework for donors, mobilization of external resources, management of
     development partnerships, appraisal of financing agreements/projects agreements,
     assessment of the quality and effectiveness of aid, and overall review of the country
     cooperation portfolio. It is the central interface on information on aid flows. A key challenge
     is aid data for macroeconomic forecasting model and the MTEF. Staff capacity is a concern.
     Achievements made may be difficult to sustain unless it increases.
Program 3: Budget Execution, Accounting, and Reporting
9.      Outcomes: Program 3 has seven outcomes: (a) budgets that reflect sectoral and
ministerial priorities and budget execution that reflects the budget plan, (b) higher-quality and
more timely in-year budget monitoring reports, (c) higher-quality and more useful financial
reports produced for public consumption, (d) better cash flow management procedures, (e) full
compliance with government rules on procurement, (f) a stronger internal audit structure, and (g)
more modern audit techniques to improve internal audit standards.
10.    Subprograms: Program 3 is divided into six subprograms, each of which has specific
outputs and priority actions (annex table 1-3).

Subprogram
      Subprogram                                                      Output
3.1 Budget execution        1: Sectoral performance of the budget improved
                            2: Public awareness of the budget improved

management                   2: Timely processing of payment from Treasury achieved
                             3: Timely and accurate production of Treasury reports achieved
                             4: Recording and reporting of public debt and guarantees enhanced
                             5: Capacity in Treasury management operations and the debt management and financial
                            management system (DMFAS) developed
3.3 Internal audit           1: Internal audit structure enhanced
                             2: Internal audit coverage and quality of internal audit function improved
                             3: Internal audit skills improved
                             4: Follow-up of audit recommendations improved

  “In FY2014/15, the emphasis will be on broadening the base for VAT through a revision of the schedules for
exemptions and zero-ratings; and preparing a review of tax expenditures to be submi tted jointly with the budget” (p.
13 of the IMF’s seventh review).
69
  The Decentralized Service Delivery Development Policy Operation 2013 (P145114) (2013) supports the 2012
presidential order establishing the List of Fees and Other Charges Levied by Decentralized Entities and Applicable
Thresholds. It clarifies district powers to impose a range of fees and charges and determine rates. The focus on local
revenue mobilization in the proposed operation gives continuity to earlier Bank support.

11.     Priority Actions and Outputs: Subprogram 3.1, on budget execution, aims to improve
the sectoral performance of the budget (Output 1) by developing a strategy and guidelines to
minimize the risks of variation from the budget as well as improve public awareness of the
budget (Output 2) by making simplified budget information available to citizens. Subprogram
3.2, on Treasury management, attempts to further improve cash management (Output 1), timely
payment processing (Output 2), timely Treasury and debt report production (Outputs 3 and 4),
and capacity development on debt management (Output 5). Internal audit function has much
room for improvement; Subprogram 3.3 aims to address key issues of internal audit structure
(Output 1), coverage and quality (Output 2), capacity (Output 3), and implementation of audit
recommendations (Output 4), mainly through capacity-building activities. Subprogram 3.4, on
accounting and reporting, focuses on refining process and procedures (for example, updating
financial reporting templates to improve monthly financial statement [Output 1]); the legal
framework (for example, revision of the Organic Budget Law to strengthen legal and regulatory
framework [Output 3]); and capacity building (for example, providing training for all cadres of
accounting officers [Output 5]). Subprogram 3.5, on public procurement, focus on refining the
processing, legal, and regulatory framework and building capacity to achieve/improve monthly
procurement reporting (Output 1). To improve PFM of a broader public sector, Subprogram 3.6
focuses on management of public enterprises. Activities under this subprogram include
publishing policy guidelines and a simplified booklet on financial management as well as
providing training for directors general and board members) of public enterprises.
12.     Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.
   Subprogram 3.1: Budget Execution. Variation between budgeted and actual spending
    means that public resources are not spent as planned to achieve national objectives. To
    reduce the variation, a tighter link is required between the budget and planning (see Program
    1, on economic planning and budget) as well as between the budget and cash flow.
    Significant improvements have been made in linking planning and budgeting recently.
    MINECOFIN drew up a report on alignment with EDPRS 2 and national budget programs to
    harmonize planning priorities with expenditure priorities. A costing guidance for the MTEF
    has been drafted. The objective of the guideline is to enhance efficient and effective resource
    utilization and reduce variations between budgeted and actual spending. A draft execution
    report guideline and template were developed, with the objective of integrating performance




                                                     50
      and budgeting reporting. At the national level, a citizen guide to the national budget is now
      available on the MINECOFIN website.70At the subnational level, although some initiatives
      have been taken (for example, the Joint Action Development Forum), citizen participation in
      the budget formulation process remains challenging.71 Districts have started producing annual
      local government budget books, which increase fiscal and financial transparency and citizen
      engagement at the local level.
     Subprogram 3.2: Treasury Management. A Treasury Single Account (TSA) concept is in
      place. The RRA uses commercial banks as collection agents, requiring them to transfer
      collections to the central bank within three days. Payments by MDAs are made from the
      central bank TSA. The Auditor General’s report notes that delayed banking of revenue
      collections is still persistent in many public entities, especially districts. For example,
      banking of cash collections totaling Rwf 380 million was late, with delays ranging from a
      few days to almost a year (330 days in the Gicumbi District). Transfers to districts are
      processed directly by the Treasury to improve cash management. However, subdistrict
      entities (sectors, pharmacies, schools) receive transfers as grants, which are expensed at the
      point of issue in the district’s books. Consequently, the Government’s accounting system
      does not capture actual expenditures by nonbudget agencies. There are challenges in tracking
      transfers to and through the districts.
     Subprogram 3.3: Internal Audit. Effective internal audit is essential for improved
      transparency and accountability. The 2010 PEFA assessment gave PI-(21) (on effectiveness
      of internal audit) a C rating. The key constraint is that the existing structure of internal audit
      inhibits the attraction of people with the right capacities. Initiatives are in the pipeline to
      address the internal audit structure, with a view to addressing staff turnover and retention. In
      July 2012 MINECOFIN published a model audit committee charter, followed by a handbook
      that provides broad guidelines that can be used by audit committees in MDAs and
      government businesses. All 30 district councils have had audit committees since 2011; by
      December 2013, 83 percent of them were submitting reports to councils. The status of the
      implementation of audit recommendations is being monitored quarterly; improvement in
      implementation has been observed at both the central and subnational levels. During the first
      quarter of 2014, 75 percent of audit recommendations were implemented at the central level,
      and 67 percent were implemented at the subnational level. A new chief internal auditor was
      appointed in March 2014. Seventeen of 21 MDAs have established internal audit committees,
      but very few have held meetings.72 With only 2 internal auditors per district of about 200
      subsidiary entities, capacity is tightly constrained. Internal audit reports cite control
      weaknesses, poor records management, and noncompliance with procurement rules. On
      internal control, a number of issues cut across both central and subnational levels. The
      Government has developed a financial management manual, which lays out the requirements
      of an internal control system. It is used at both the national and subnational levels. The team
      noted weaknesses within the internal control systems that cut across reporting entities, such

71
   According to the 2012 Citizen Report Card, 38 percent of citizens participated in the budget formulation process
in 2011.
72
   The Government recently established the Audit Committees of the national police, the Ministry of Internal
Security (MININTER), and the National Women’s Council established. Other institutions have been reminded to
create audit committees and are looking for suitable candidates.



                                                         51
     as inaccurate and incomplete financial statements, noncompliance with procurement rules
     and regulations on expenditures, irregular expenditures, and inaccurate posting of financial
     records to IFMIS. Various interventions are being implemented to strengthen the systems.
    Subprogram 3.4: Accounting and Reporting. The quality and timeliness of financial
     reporting is essential to improve transparency and accountability at both the national and
     subnational levels. Progress has been made, especially at the national level. At the national
     level, in-year budget reports are prepared quarterly, with reasonably accurate data broken
     down to at least the program or functional level. Reconciliation of banking and fiscal records
     is comprehensive and timely. The roll-out of IFMIS has contributed to progress. However,
     several challenges remain. A consolidated government statement is prepared annually within
     three months of the end of the fiscal year, but essential information is missing, giving rise to
     a disclaimer audit opinion on the consolidated government statement. At the subnational
     level, in-year financial reporting is nonexistent, and the quality of the annual report remains
     weak.
    Subprogram 3.5, Public Procurement: Public procurement in Rwanda is about US$0.8
     billion a year. It plays a critical role in effective public expenditure management. Introducing
     e-procurement could increase efficiency in addition to transparency and compliance. 73 E-
     procurement would be a timely addition to the progress achieved so far in public
     procurement, which includes establishment of the Rwanda Public Procurement Agency
     (RPPA) and enactment of the Law on Public Procurement. The public procurement function
     was fully decentralized in February 2011. Accordingly, the RPPA focuses on control and
     monitoring of the decentralized procurement functions. Despite progress, especially in setting
     up procurement systems, challenges remain. 74 The filing system is poor; nontransparent,
     noncompetitive methods are used; and monthly procurement reports are not submitted on
     time.
    Subprogram 3.6: Fiscal Risk Management in Public Enterprises. Public enterprises play
     significant roles in Rwanda. As of July 2014, there were 12 public enterprises across 5
     sectors (finance and services, transportation, infrastructure, mining, and agriculture).The
     Government has significant investment in public enterprises (RF 700 billion [US$1 billion]
     in mid-2014). Efficient management of these enterprises is therefore essential for the PFM
     sector. Management of public enterprises by the government in general and MINECOFIN in
     particular is described in Policy Guidelines on Management of Business Portfolio. 75 The
     guidelines define the roles of portfolio line ministries and provide guidance on boards,
     financial management, reporting, risk management, and financial returns to the
     government/dividend policy. In order to strengthen the legal framework for managing public


73
  The PFM SSP was formulated in July 2013. E-procurement is not thus included. However, the Government has
been developing e-procurement as an essential part of PFM reforms.
74
  RPPA conducted procurement audits of 57 entities (including 13 districts). It identified areas for improvement in
the RPPA Annual Activity Report 2012–13
(http://www.rppa.gov.rw/fileadmin/files/docs/RPPA_Activity_Report/RPPA percent20Annual percent20Activity
percent20Report percent202012-2013.pdf).
75
  The guidelines were validated in September 2010 and updated with the new Law on State Finance and Property in
February 2014.



                                                         52
     enterprises, the Government is drafting a law on public enterprises. MINECOFIN has been
     taking the lead in capacity building of boards of public enterprises.
Program 4: External Oversight and Accountability
13.    Outcomes: Program 4 has two expected outcomes; (a) greater scope and coverage of
external audits and (b) achievement of the highest standards of external audit, through a
professionally qualified staff at OAG using modern audit techniques and facilities.
14.     Subprograms: Program 4 has two subprograms, with specific outputs and priority
actions (annex table 1-4). However, the Program covers only Subprogram 4.1.
Annex Table 1-4: Outputs of Program 4 (External Oversight and Accountability), by Subprogram
            Subprogram                                                    Output
 4.1 External audit                  1: Independence of the OAG enhanced
                                     2: Institutional capacity strengthened, in line with the OAG mandate
                                     3: Professional audit capacity built and strengthened
                                     4: OAG’s capacity to engage stakeholders strengthened
                                     5: Coordination, implementation, and monitoring enhanced
 4.2 Legislative Oversight           1: Secretariat established
                                     2: Capacity for the secretariat and committee members built
                                     3: Improved follow up of budget execution and implementation of
                                     resolutions
15.     Priority Actions and Outputs: Program 4 consists of external audit by the Office of
Auditor General (OAG) (Subprogram 4.1) and legislative oversight by Parliament (Subprogram
4.2). To improve the scope and coverage of high-quality external audit, the Government aims to
ensure independence of the OAG (Output 1) through operationalization of the new public audit
law and capacity building of stakeholders (Outputs 2, 3, and 4). As external audit involves
multiple ministries and agencies, coordinating external audit is essential (Output 5). Similarly,
sub-program 4.2 focuses on capacity building of the secretariat and committee members (Output
2) followed by establishing the secretariat (Output 1).
16.     Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of Subprogram 4.1 and 4.2 are summarized below.
    Subprogram 4.1: External Audit. Timely and quality external audit is an integral part of
     improving transparency and accountability. OAG has been playing a key role in external
     audit. Its new organizational structure was approved in 2012, and a new law on OAG was
     enacted in late 2013.76 The scope and coverage of external audits has been widened in recent
     few years, with coverage increasing from 60 percent in 2007 to 79 percent for the fiscal year
     ending June 2013.77 Despite the increase in coverage, only 32 percent of the 139 audit reports
     obtained an unqualified (clean) audit opinion; the remaining 68 percent received qualified
     audit opinions. None of the 30 districts or Kigali City obtained an unqualified audit opinion,
     although 3 districts (Kamonyi, Ruhango, and Gakenke) improved their status from an
     adverse to an “except for” opinion. Factors affecting the high proportion of qualified audits
     include the failure to implement some prior year audit recommendations, the omission of

    balances of nonbudget agencies from financial statements in districts, and noncompliance
    with existing law and regulations. The capacity of the relevant parliamentary committees and
    district councils is still inadequate to exercise effective external oversight over the use of
    public finances. To address these challenges, the PFM SSP aims to (a) ensure full compliance
    with government rules on procurement, (b) introduce more modern audit techniques to
    improve internal audit standards, and (c) address the weaknesses of the current internal audit
    structure.
   Sub-Program 4.2 Legislative Oversight: In steps to support the role of Parliament in
    enhancing oversight and accountability for public spending, the Parliament formed the Public
    Accounts Committee (PAC) in April 2011. The PAC seeks to strengthen accountability
    between different parts of government and between the state and its citizens. Still in its
    infancy, PAC is developing its oversight functions. PAC has been working closely with OAG
    to understand external audit work and how PAC could participate in making audit work more
    effective and ensure that the Executive implements the PAC recommendations. The PAC
    has a secretariat, which it shares with other committees of Parliament. To execute their duties
    effectively, PAC would need a strong Secretariat with the relevant skills to provide the
    committee with required technical support. The PAC would need to conduct a training needs
    assessment to establish the kind of support they need from their secretariat and the best
    model to deliver it effectively. The PAC may also need to prepare their own strategic plan on
    accountability during their term in office. As part of capacity building initiative of this newly
    formed parliamentary committee, the PAC may need to pay visit to other PACs in
    neighboring countries to learn how their colleagues conduct their oversight roles. After the
    study tours, the PAC could prepare their own working modality, to fit their environment and
    political set up.
Program 5: Electronic Service Delivery and IFMIS
17.   Outcomes: Program 5 has three expected outcomes: (a) the roll-out of the current version
of SmartFMS to the remaining entities, (b) determine the long-term IFMIS requirements for the
Government, and (c) implement IFMIS that will meet the Government’s needs into the 2020s.
18.    Subprograms: Program 5 has one subprogram, with specific outputs and priority actions
(annex table 1-5).
Annex Table 1-5: Outputs of Program 5 (Electronic Service Delivery and IFMIS), by Subprogram
             Subprogram                                                   Output
5.1 Integrated Financial               1: Current IFMIS core modules implemented in all budget agencies and
Management System (IFMIS)              projects
                                       2: Full-fledged IFMIS with appropriate interfaces with identified subsidiary
                                       systems of government designed and implemented
5.2 Integrated Personnel and Payroll   1: A fully Integrated personnel and payroll system to support human
System (IPPIS)                         resources management in public sector and strengthen payroll processing
                                       and controls
19.     Priority Actions and Outputs: Subprogram 5.1 aims to stabilize the current IFMIS
(Output 5.1) and ensure a seamless transition by the future IFMIS (Output 5.2). Priority actions
include system enhancement, maintenance, and support, as well as roll-out to budget entities not
yet connected to IFMIS. Priority actions under Subprogram 5.2 are processes to develop the
future system such as functional and technical design, software development and training for the
new system. IPPIS has been operationalized since 2009, and priority actions under this sub-

program focuses on enhancement and maintenance of the current system, and rolling out to
additional government entities.
20.    Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.
   Subprogram 5.1: IFMIS. The capability and performance of IFMIS is critical to the
    Government’s ability to deliver improvements in every aspect of the PFM cycle, including
    the timeliness and quality of financial reports, the availability of information required by
    managers for decision-making purposes, and transparency in and accountability for the use of
    public resources. The SmartFMS system is a custom-developed financial management
    information system that supports budget preparation, expenditure management, and financial
    reporting. It began operating in 2010 and has been implemented at 262 sites, including all
    line ministries, all 30 districts and Kigali City, and various other government-funded bodies.
    Limited expansion of the system is planned. A number of government bodies with
    specialized functions will continue to run on separate systems.
   Sub-Program 5.2 IPPIS: MIFOTRA takes the lead in this sub-program. With a key
    objective of delivery of an integrated HR/payroll solution that provides the tools to enable the
    MDAs to better manage personnel budgets and to respond to evolving HR and organization
    requirement to support the objectives of the government, the IPPIS has been operationalized
    since 2009. The IPPIS has been rolled out in four phases between 2009 and 2012. The
    number of entities rolled-out with the IPPIS increased from 25 in August 2009 to 124 in July
    2012. During the period, the number of civil servants paid through the IPPIS increased from
    1,700 to 87,000. In the future priorities will be provided for stability of the IPPIS and
    training for IPPIS users.
Program 6: Fiscal Decentralization
21.    Outcomes: Program 6 has five expected outcomes: (a) strengthened PFM systems at
subnational service delivery units, (b) increased revenue collections at the subnational level and
the accounting for of all revenues, (c) a more equitable and realistic distribution of central
government funds at the subnational level, (d) stronger budget planning capacity at the
subnational level, and (e) the long-term aim of enabling senior managers at the subnational level
to assume responsibility for making devolved financial decisions.
22.    Subprograms: Program 6 is divided into three subprograms, each of which has specific
outputs and priority actions (annex table 1-6).

23.      Priority Actions and Outputs: Subprogram 6.1 (resource mobilization by decentralized
entities) aims to achieve two outputs: (a) enhanced revenue collection and administration
performance of decentralized entities (Output 1) and (b) improved access to decentralized
entities’ borrowing and investment for financing local capital infrastructures and getting
dividends from investments in companies (Output 2). Priority actions for Output 1 include
implementation of a study on local government revenue potential and automated revenue
collection systems. Subprogram 6.2 (facilitation of fiscal transfers) focuses on enhancing
accountability through clarification of functional assignment (Output 1) and improvement of
transparency of intergovernmental fiscal relations (Output 2). The Government aims to produce
these outputs through a series of assessments and reviews (of the current functional allocation
and review of intergovernmental fiscal transfers, for example). Subprogram 6.3 (strengthening
subnational PFM systems and capacity) aims to improve key aspects of PFM, such as budget
execution, accounting, and reporting, and to develop capacity through reviews of existing
systems, implementation of a simplified accounting systems, and capacity development
activities.
24.     Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.
    Subprogram 6.1: Resource Mobilization by Decentralized Entities. Strengthening
     revenue mobilization at the subnational levels is a core objective of the Government.
     Considerable efforts have been made to mobilize local revenues, including through a
     strengthened legal framework.78 Nevertheless, the utilization of local governments’ revenue
     sources is suboptimal and uneven across districts, which in addition to weakening fiscal
     sustainability raises issues of unequal treatment of taxpayers. In the FY2013/14 budget, the
     share of own revenues in the total ranged from 4 percent to 49 percent (on average 17
     percent); transfers from the central government financed the remainder. Increasing local
     revenues would reduce the dependence of subnational governments on transfers from the
     central government, strengthen the fiscal space for central government budgets, and increase
     the discretionary share of districts’ budgets. To strengthen revenue mobilization at the
     subnational level, the Government commissioned the Local Government Revenue Potential
     Study, which found weak tax administration capacity at the subnational level. In combination
     with devolution of three tax sources to the districts, the Government has decided to transfer
     collection responsibilities for local revenues (business license, property, and rental income
     taxes) from districts to the RRA.

    Subprogram 6.2: Facilitation of Fiscal Transfers. MINECOFIN, in collaboration with the
     Rwanda Governance Board, developed a draft Prime Minister Order to guide line ministries
     in implementing sectoral decentralization. 79 The legal and regulatory framework was
     assessed to determine the status quo in terms of expenditure responsibilities. A draft of the
     revised block grant formula is being developed to improve allocation efficiency to districts
     taking their fiscal capacity into account. Every year MINECOFIN issues guidelines on the
     earmarked transfers that provide the terms under which the earmarked funds are allocated,
     transferred, spent, and accounted for by the parties involved. The format of submission of the
     earmarked transfer guidelines was modified under the Budget System Improvement Program.
    Subprogram 6.3: Strengthening PFM Systems and Capacity at the Subnational Level .
     Timely and transparent financial information at the subnational level is key to improving the
     effective and efficient use of public resources not only at the subnational level but also at the
     national level (about 80 percent of district budgets are financed by transfers from the central
     government). Financial information below the district level (subdistrict, cell, hospital, school)
     is nonexistent. To address the issue, the Government developed a simplified accounting and
     financial reporting application (SEAS) for subnational entities below the district level. It
     launched a pilot of the application in December 2013. As of April 2014, 88 of 416
     subdistricts had completed the pilot.
Program 7: PFM Sector Coordination and Management
25.     Outcomes: Program 7 has seven expected outcomes: (a) strengthened PFM management
and coordination mechanisms; (b) effective M&E of the PFM SSP; (c) a communications
process that informs all stakeholders on progress in implementing the SSP and reform strategy;
(d) increases in the number and quality of staff with professional qualifications, including
through ongoing financial support for the Institute of Certified Public Accountant of Rwanda
(ICPAR); (e) improvements in the capacity of all staff working within PFM areas; (f) effective
incentive schemes where it is considered desirable to improve capacity; and (g) training in PFM
systems and procedures of all relevant staff.
26.    Subprograms: Program 7 is divided into three subprograms, each of which has specific
outputs and priority actions (annex table 1-7).

Subprogram
            Subprogram                                                    Output
7.1 Sector coordination and             1: SPIU well-functioning and strengthened
management                              2: Coordination of PFM development partners and stakeholders improved
                                        3: Visibility of PFM sector improved
7.2 Coordination of human resource      1: PFM consolidated sector capacity-building plan developed and validated
training and capacity building          2: Internship and secondment program established
                                        3: Partnerships with education institutions and professional bodies
                                       established and strengthened
7.3 Monitoring and evaluation           1: M&E framework for sector elaborated and operationalized
                                        2: Detailed PFM SSP implementation plan formulated



79
  Given the fact that most of the district budget is centrally financed (own revenues are less than 20 percent), the
current administrative decentralization is considered “deconcentration,” which implies the outsourcing of central
government functions to local or regional offices.



                                                        57
27.    Priority Actions and Outputs: The three outputs of Subprogram 7.1 are expected to be
achieved through capacity building of the SPIU and facilitation of the sector working group.
Capacity building and training are included in all programs under the PFM SSP. Subprogram 7.2
coordinates training and capacity building in the sector by, for example, developing a
consolidated capacity development plan (Output 1) and partnering with other institutions and
bodies. Subprogram 7.3 includes priority actions to operationalize M&E, including Joint Sector
Reviews and PEFA assessments.
28.     Rationales, Challenges, and Progress to Date: The rationales, challenges, and progress
to date of each subprogram are summarized for each subprogram.
   Subprogram 7.1: Sector Coordination and Management. This subprogram supports
    various functions of the SPIU in MINECOFIN, the main coordination unit implementing the
    PFM SSP, including sector coordination (for example, facilitation of the PFM
    COORDINATION FORUM) and capacity building.
   Subprogram 7.2: Coordination of Human Resources Training and Capacity Building .
    Capacity constraints (organizational, institutional, and human) are prevalent across the
    programs to be supported by the PforR. Skills levels will need to be raised significantly as
    part of the implementation of the Program. Staff recruited for financial management
    positions are required to have a bachelor’s degree in accounting or finance, but few have any
    professional qualifications. None of the internal audit staff, for example, are professionally
    qualified auditors. The capacity of universities and postgraduate training institutions appears
    to be a constraint on improving skills levels and delivering professionally qualified staff. The
    certification body for accountants in Rwanda (ICPAR) has been established, but no
    institutions have yet been certified to provide professional training in accounting or auditing.
   Subprogram 7.3: Monitoring and Evaluation. Progress of the PFM SSP has been regularly
    monitored through annual and quarterly progress reports on the PFM Basket Fund. PEFA
    assessments have been used to measure the overall progress of the PFM sector. Assessments
    were conducted in 2007 and 2010; the 2010 assessment included assessment of four districts.
    The next PEFA assessments at the national and subnational levels (including eight districts)
    are scheduled to be completed in the second half of 2014.

Annex 2: The Government Statistics Program (NSDS 2)
1.      Strategic objective 1 (Strengthen civil registration systems, administrative records,
surveys and other sources of data) focuses on the design and progressive roll-out of priority
economic surveys related to agriculture, private sector activity, and the labor market. Despite the
importance of agriculture in employment (70 percent of households depend on agriculture) and
poverty reduction, agricultural statistics are scarce and infrequent, constraining agricultural
policy-making. This strategic objective aims to address this gap by supporting the design and
roll-out of an annual best-practice agricultural survey. Support to business and labor force
surveys is highly strategic given Rwanda’s demographic developments: both in absolute and
relative terms, working-age population will grow rapidly over the coming decade, opening up the
opportunity of a demographic dividend80. Taking advantage of this demographic opportunity will
require substantial job creation to accommodate the growing labor force. The formulation of
effective employment policies is however hampered by lack of data. The increased availability of
economic source data will also feed into the system of national accounts, which will be upgraded
and rebased more frequently.
2.       On strategic objective 2 (Improve quality and dissemination of statistics and public
statistical literacy), the consolidation and expansion of NISR’s Open Data initiative is one of
the key areas. During NSDS 1, NISR made solid progress on data dissemination through the
establishment of a National Data Archive (NADA), where micro-data from surveys and censuses
can be easily downloaded by everyone free of charge. This flagship initiative has greatly
facilitated access to data: the 2012 User Satisfaction Survey showed that accessibility of official
statistics has greatly improved since the start of NSDS 1 in 2009. While making more and more
data easily accessible (“open”) will not by itself increase the use of data for decision -making, it
is a necessary condition for achieving this goal.
3.       On strategic objective 3 (Improve statistical advocacy and integrate use of statistics
in decision making), this strategic objective mainly consist of awareness raising and outreach
activities to highlight the easy access to statistical data and to emphasize the importance of data
for better decision-making. Greater and easier accessibility of data must be accompanied by
measures to promote the use of data for purposes of decision-making and policy-formulation.
Though data in Rwanda is widely available and easily accessible, the actual use of data is
hampered by the lack of awareness on this among policy-makers, researchers, and civil society.
4.       On strategic objective 4 (Develop capacity within NSS), use of statistics for decision-
making is also constrained by the low level of statistical skills within the NSS. The final review
of NSDS-1 identified important statistical capacity gaps within the NSS, resulting from a limited
number of trained statisticians and the absence of appropriate training infrastructure. The low
capacity within the NSS constraints not only the demand-side of statistics (its use in decision-
making), but also the supply-side: quality of statistics produced by line Ministries, the so-called
administrative statistics, is highly variable. Development of skills within the NSS through the
design, construction and operationalization of a statistical training center within NISR is one of
the key activities. Once operational, the training center will offer hand-on courses in operational
statistics and promote a culture of evidence-based decision-making among public sector officials
within the NSS.

5.      On strategic objective 5 (Consolidate coordination within NSS), the law on the
organization of statistical activities in Rwanda 81 designates NISR as the coordinator of NSS.
Under this strategic objective, NISR aims to achieve (i) improved coordination of statistical
concepts and methods, and (ii) strengthened coordination of statistics activities. The first aim is
expected to be achieved through updating the standard classifications and instruction manuals, as
well as conducting regular dialogues with data producers and users.
6.      On strategic objective 6 (Improve resource mobilization and build strategic
partnerships), investments in statistics are essential “to enhance capacity for statistics to
monitor progress, evaluate impact, ensure sound, results-focused public sector management, and
highlight strategic issues for policy decisions"82. Lack of sufficient financial resources would
risk successful implementation of NSDS 2. In this regard, NISR aims (i) to mobilize resources
sufficient to activities NSS through holding consultation with partners; (ii) to manage resources
efficiently through adhering to best practices of financial management and maintaining
appropriate financial planning and reporting; and (iii) building strategic partnerships.

performance indicators       output and outcome indicators at each of the six strategic objectives it aims to
                             accomplish. Due to the nature of statistical activities though, most indicators
                             are output-based (production of priority data and statistics).

Annex 4: Rwanda’s 2007 and 2010 PEFA
1.      Overall, the PEFA assessment for found a marked improvement in external audit (PI-26)
and legislative scrutiny of audit reports (PI-28). Weak PFM performance remains concentrated in
three areas, first in regard to the multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and
budgeting (PI-12) and composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved
budget (PI-2), second in regard to quality and timeliness of reporting of in-year budget reports
(PI-24) and annual financial statements (PI-25); and, finally, in regard to effectiveness of internal
audit (PI-21).
2.      When comparing the 2007 and 2010 ratings it should be noted the previous PEFA may
have under-scored or over-scored some of the ratings for indicators or individual dimensions.
Thus a simple comparison of the overall scores between two assessments at different times, not
detailed by dimension, and with no analysis of change, can suggest deterioration, improvement
or stagnation of indicators, which is in fact not the case. In the case of Rwanda there was real
progress despite the appearance of stagnation, if an indicator was over-scored by the previous
assessment, as the PEFA team found to be the case for PI-11. Similarly, in the case of PI-21 and
PI-25 there is the appearance of deterioration as indicators or dimensions were highly over-
scored in the PEFA 2007. Also, there was progress for PI-18 but less so than indicated by a
simple comparison of the overall scores, as the indicator was over-scored by the previous
assessment.
3.      The CG assessment found that the areas of PFM performance that were already at a very
satisfactory level of performance (A) in 2006 and have remained such are: PI-3 Aggregate
revenue out-turn compared to original approved budget (A); PI-5 Classification of the budget
(A); PI-13 Transparency of taxpayer obligations and liabilities (A).
4.      The areas of PFM performance that have improved and achieved a very satisfactory (A)
or acceptable (B) level of performance are: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn compared to
original approved budget (A); PI-4 Stock and monitoring of expenditure payment arrears (B); PI-
6 Comprehensiveness of information included in budget documentation (A); PI-8 Transparency
of inter-governmental fiscal relations (A); PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-
11 Orderliness and participation in the annual budget process (B+); PI-14 Effectiveness of
measures for taxpayer registration and tax assessment (A); PI-16 Predictability in the availability
of funds for commitment of expenditures (B+); PI-17 Recording and management of cash
balances, debt and guarantees (B); PI-18 Effectiveness of payroll controls (B+); PI-19
Competition, value for money and controls in procurement (A); PI-20 Effectiveness of internal
controls for non-salary expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts
reconciliation (B); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external audit (B+); PI-28 Legislative
scrutiny of external audit reports (B); D-1 Predictability of Direct Budget Support (A).
5.      The areas of PFM performance that are showing some improvement, yet remain weak,
are: PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to original approved budget (D); PI-7
Extent of unreported government operations (D+); PI-9 Oversight of aggregate fiscal risk from
other public sector entities (C); PI-21 Effectiveness of internal audit (C); PI-25 Quality and
timeliness of annual financial statements (D+); D-2 Financial information provided by donors for
budgeting and reporting on project and program aid (D+).
6.     The areas of PFM performance that are not showing much improvement and remain
weak are: PI-12 Multi-year perspective in fiscal planning, expenditure policy and budgeting
(C+); PI-15 Effectiveness in collection of tax payments (D+); PI-23 Availability of information

                                                 66
on resources received by service delivery units (D); PI-24 Quality and timeliness of in-year
budget reports (D+); PI-27 Legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law (C+); D-3 Proportion of
aid that is managed by use of national procedures (D).
7.      Ratings that have remained unchanged since the 2007 PEFA, and are difficult to justify
are: PI-7 (ii), PI-23, and D-3 at D; PI-15 and PI-24 at D+; PI-12 and PI-27 at C+. For PI-7 (ii),
more information on donor assistance than what is included in fiscal reports is available within
MINECOFIN, for PI-15, effectiveness in collection of tax payments, unchanged at D+ since the
2007 PEFA, despite Domestic Revenue Generation being a component of the Government
PFMRS under Pillar 1, Economic Management and Budget; for PI-24, as in-year budget
reporting did take place in 2007 and 2008; and in-year reporting just ceased.
8.      Regarding the others, it can be noted that: D-3, proportion of aid that is managed by use
of national procedures, shows that donors are not sufficiently relying on country systems for the
channeling of donor assistance, and have not increased their reliance since 2006, despite the
constant and coordinated presence of donor support in Rwanda, an overall improvement in PFM
processes, and the general objective under the Paris Deceleration and the Accra Agenda to
increasingly rely on national systems; The failure of improvements in the availability of
information on resources received by service delivery units (PI-23) is surprising especially give
the fiscal decentralization process underway, and the stated objectives of the National
Decentralization Policy. Regarding legislative scrutiny of the annual budget law (PI-27), the
indicator rating cannot improve as long as the current situation, of no limit in place for the size of
supplementary budgets, reflected under dimension (iv), continues. The failure of the MTEF (see
PI-12) to deliver its true objective of linking policy targets with actual budget allocations and
thus ensure at the same time a strategic allocation of resources and fiscal sustainability, is also
costly in Rwanda, given the vast amount of capacity invested in the multi-year planning process,
which is very extensive and involves a large variety of activities throughout the budget
preparation cycle, across all sectors. Regarding the implementation of IFMIS/SmartGov, which
is part of the official PFM Government Reform Program, under Pillar 2, component 3, it has
fallen behind schedule. Its delay is at the root of the fact that the quality of financial statements
(PI-25 (i)) has not improved as much as its potential, as it is hampered by the continued
coexistence of two different systems, SagePastel and SmartGov. Overall, not enough effect has
trickled to PFM systems in the area of accounting, recording and reporting despite it being one of
the main reform pillars.

Annex 5: 2010 PEFA Assessment at the District Level
1.      The PEFA 2010 SN Assessment found a satisfactory nature and scope of the
external scrutiny of SN governments (see SN PI-26, rated at A for nature and scope and B
overall). The OAG in fact audits all SN governments on a yearly basis and issues the results of
the audit as part of the Annual Report presented to Parliament, under Volume III. Also in parallel
with CG, and also probably as a result of an acceptable level of external oversight, including on
the implementation of audit recommendations, the SN Assessment found that controls on both
salary and non-salary expenditure are at an acceptable/satisfactory level, with PI-18 and PI-20
both rated at B+. At the SN level, the core dimension transparency and comprehensiveness was
assessed only on the basis of two indicators (PI-8 and PI-10), one of which was found not
applicable (PI-8). On the basis of PI-10 only, which assesses public access to key fiscal
information, transparency at the SN level is satisfactory (A). The core dimension accounting and
reporting, assessed at the SN level on the basis of the availability of funds for commitment
expenditures (PI-22) and in-year budget reporting (PI-24), shows acceptable to good results (B+),
and a more positive status of processes than for CG.
2.      By indicator, the SN Assessment found that the areas that are at a good or
acceptable level of performance are: PI-2 Composition of expenditure out-turn compared to
original approved budget (B,B,A,B); HLG-1 Predictability of transfers from higher levels of
Government (B+, B+, B+, A), PI-10 Public access to key fiscal information (A); PI-16
Predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of expenditures (B+); PI-18
Effectiveness of payroll controls (B+); PI-20 Effectiveness of internal controls for non-salary
expenditure (B+); PI-22 Timeliness and regularity of accounts reconciliation (B+); PI-24 Quality
and timeliness of in-year budget reports (B+); PI-26 Scope, nature and follow-up of external
audit (B+).
3.     The following areas were found to be weak: PI-1 Aggregate expenditure out-turn
compared to original approved budget (D,B,D,D); PI-11 Orderliness and participation in the
annual budget process (D+).

  Annex 6: Revenue Mobilization
  Government Program
  1.       The government’s strategy to improve revenue mobilization through a broad set of
  initiatives is prioritized in PFM SSP and other strategies83. For example, in its Strategic Plan
  2013/14–2015/16, the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) identifies the efforts to “maximize
  revenue mobilization” as the overarching direction for the plan period, supported by
  enhancements and specific initiatives to improve RRA performance on the areas: (i) enhance
  service deliver to meet customer needs; (ii) ensure maximum compliance with tax legislation;
  and (iii) further strengthen the capacity of the organization.
  2.       The reform program on tax policy and administration consists of a broad array of
  initiatives, spanning from a comprehensive review of loopholes and foregone tax revenues under
  current tax codes, to initiatives to strengthen and improve all tax administrative areas, from
  registration and filing compliance, over tax payer services and education, returns processing and
  payment, arrears collection, audit and investigations to improvements on tax appeals. The major
  elements of the reform program and recent years’ accomplishments are illustrated in annex table
  6-1).

3.      In addition to the current tax policy and administration reform plan, the
government has prepared a draft catalogue of medium-term tax reform proposals, to
eventually reinforce efforts to ensure revenue mobilization targets. In connection with this
plan, in April 2014, the IMF provided technical assistance on domestic revenue mobilization.
The results of the technical assistance described in the first review under the PSI includes84:
-      Revise legislation on taxation of property (Dec 2014);
-      Prepare legislative proposal for new tax regime for agriculture (Dec 2014);
-      Prepare legislative proposal for new tax regime for mining (Dec 2014);
-      Streamlining incentives and exemptions based on the draft investment code approved by
       Cabinet in March 2014;
-      Tax expenditure assessment;
-      Enforcement of tax payer compliance (e.g., use of electronic billing machines); and
-      Amending the VAT laws to reduce exemption.

PforR Program
4.     The PforR covers three critical areas towards ensuring revenue mobilization. The
Government has established tax revenue mobilization targets on public sector for the period
FY2013/14–2016/17. With a baseline on 2013/14 at Rwf 782.5 billion, the targets on revenue
mobilization are set at Rwf 906.8 billion in 2014/15, Rwf 1,111.2 billion in 2015/16 and Rwf
1,291.1 billion in 2016/1785. The targets represent a nominal increase in revenues of 64% in
2016/17, as compared to 2013/14.
5.      In consultation with the Government, the World Bank team has identified three critical
areas towards achieving these ambitious targets, as follows:
(1) Broadening the tax base, in particular by registration of new tax payers on national and
    subnational tax sources; by improved registration of new tax payers, as part of the
    centralization of collection of the district’s revenues; and by a comprehensive assessment and
    action plan on broadening the VAT tax base (broader base coverage and reduction in
    exemptions).
(2) Continued modernization of tax administration, in particular by increasing the uptake of eTax
    services. The usage of electronic tax filing and payments will be expanded and eTax systems
    will be upgraded, by developing and integrating various modules on tax audit, tax account-
    and refund management, and enforcement planning.
(3) Improving compliance: Enhancing management of arrears and non-compliance procedures,
    in particular by a VAT gap analysis, to identify compliance issues and ways to addressing
    these. Improved up take in use of EBM by tax payers would also contribute, as would a risk-

Program Assessment: Strategic Relevance and Technical Soundness
6.       EDPRS 2 theme on “Economic Transformation for Rapid Growth” is supported by the
improved revenue mobilization for public sector activities and finance. Ensuring fiscal space is
critical to achieve the country’s aspiration to reduce aid dependency in the medium-term. The
PFM SSP relates to this objective, by “promoting mobilization of resources and prioritization of
expenditures for maximum impact on economic growth and poverty reduction.”
7.      While there was progress over recent years, the tax to GDP ratio in Rwanda remains
relatively low. The tax to GDP ratio in FY2012/13 stood at 14.2%, with the Sub-Saharan African
(SSA) Countries average at 18%. Government efforts over recent years have resulted in an
increase of 1 percentage point in GDP, up from 13.2% in FY2010/11, with the major increase
being observed in Direct taxes which went up from 39% to 43% of total tax revenue, while the
proportion of indirect taxes, in particular excise taxes, reduced over the period. The proportion of
revenues collected from VAT, which is the single most important tax source, was unchanged over
the period, but with the revenue forecasts on VAT suggesting an increased share in FY2013/14,
with 32.9% of the overall tax revenues in FY2013/14, as compared to 30.6% in FY2012/13 (annex
table 6-2).

  8.     Compared to other countries in East Africa and SSA, some margin for tax-to-GDP
  improvements in Rwanda seems to be prevalent. Rwanda’s tax to GDP ratio is on an average 2
  percentage points behind East African peers, and 5-6 percentage points behind Kenya and
  Malawi (annex table 6-3). The ‘gap’ to peer countries is approximately the same on direct taxes
  as on indirect taxes. It is worth noting that the revenue profile in Kenya and Malawi, the
  countries with the highest tax-to-GDP ratio, is pretty even across direct and indirect taxes, while
  Rwanda, Uganda and also Tanzania is seeing indirect taxes take a higher share of the overall tax
  revenues.

9.      In the short to medium-term, the tax-to-GDP may potentially be improved by 4-5%
points, according to a recent IMF study. Estimations of tax revenue gap across countries
usually require a high degree of contextualization, to ensure that structural determinants are
taken into account in the comparison. In a recent Article IV consultation on Uganda, the IMF
estimated the tax gap in East African countries, by relating tax-to-GDP to structural variables,
such as the proportion of rural population, and the share of manufacturing in the GDP. The
results of the estimation appear in Annex figure 6-186. While the interpretation of such model
results always should be made cautiously, the Rwandan’ governments revenue targets for the
next few years match or even exceed the requirements to close the tax revenue gap, as indicated
below.




10.      The government’s targets on tax revenue collections FY2013/14 to 2016/17 are
witness to the high priority the government allocates to this area. The government’s targets
on tax revenues/GDP ratio are provided in the Budget Framework Paper87. The government
aims at increasing tax revenue collections as follows: Tax revenue collections, which will reach
15.3 percent of GDP in 2013/14, are projected to rise to 15.8% of GDP in 2014/15, 17.2% of
GDP in 2015/16 and 17.7% of GDP in 2016/17. The improved tax revenue to GDP will
compensate partly for a projected reduction in aid grants (down by 50% over the four years’
period), and for a reduction in domestic financing to cover balance. Over four years, the tax to
GDP will be improved by 1.9 percentage-points, which, as mentioned above, in nominal terms
represents an expansion of about 64 percent in total tax revenues for the period. The projections
in total tax revenues by tax types are provided in annex table 6-4.

  Please note that the level of tax-to-GDP ratios in annex table 6-3 calculations are based on more recent data than
the ones in annex figure 6-1.

11.    In addition, the improvements in subnational tax revenues, resulting from the
centralization of local government taxes, are not included in the target of the medium-term
tax-to-GDP ratio88. The centralization of revenue collection is estimated to yield a cumulative
2.3% of GDP between FY2014/15 and FY2016/17 (0.5% in FY2014, 0.9% in FY2015 and 0.9%
in FY2016). In summary, the combined efforts on national and subnational revenue mobilization
may imply an estimated 20% of tax-to-GDP in FY2016/17
12.    The RRA has a strong performance record in revenue mobilization, with the annual
performance rates above targets. In annex table 6-5, the actual tax revenue collections in
FY2012/13 exceeded performance targets by 1.7%, and over two years, the revenue collection
showed an overall increase of more than 17%. Strong performance was seen across tax types,
although performance on indirect taxes (including VAT) was less prominent than on direct taxes.

13.   In terms of the relevance and technical soundness of the specific areas under this
Program, the following assessment is provided on each area:
1) Increase tax registration and tax bases – national and subnational tax collection
 Taxpayer registration has been increased significantly over recent years. Annex table 6-6
  provides development from 2010/11 to 2011/12, by segments.
Annex Table 6-6: Tax Payer Registration 2010/11– 2011/12.

Reform, December 2012, p 15.
 RRA is undertaking efforts to further increase registration of tax payers. The efforts include
  (i) continuous taxpayer sensitization in collaboration with PSF and Local government. RRA
  will further take advantage of the database to be developed through a registration exercise for
  the three local government taxes to do registration; and (ii) increase in number of field visits
  for particular types of businesses. This helps RRA get feedback on various services and to
  identify the unregistered taxpayers; and RRA also identifies the relevant topics for taxpayer
  education.
 Furthermore, tax payer registration is a core initial step of the reform plans on improving
  revenue collection of sub central governments. While the potential yield from the business
  license tax, the property tax and the rental income tax as recently devolved to decentralized
  entities is significant, collections over recent years have been minimal (tax revenue out of
  total revenue in the districts stood at 8% in 2011), owing primarily to efficiency issues in the
  tax collection but also to incomplete and inaccurate supporting systems, such as land
  management and cadastre information. In addition to enhanced local revenue collection, the
  centralization of tax collection is expected to provide RRA with important information on tax
  payers in the districts, (in particularly local businesses), currently unknown to the agency, and
  a revenue yield improvement on national tax sources, such as CIT, may eventually follow.
 The RRA has established a two-staged plan on how to improve revenue collection at the
  districts. In the first stage, covering the period March–December 2014, RRA is collecting
  revenues on the three devolved tax sources (trading license tax, rental income tax and
  property tax) in all districts. In some districts, RRA has taken over the management of
  district’s tax administration staff, while in others, RRA is assisting the districts own staff in
  improving revenue collection. In the second phase, starting January 2015, RRA will fully take
  over all functions in revenue mobilization at the district’s level, in charge of all administrative
  processes related to the collection of tax and non-tax revenues. In preparation for the second
  phase, during the 2nd half of 2014, the RRA will complete a database on all tax payers at the
  district level, by tax type, acquire revenue software and IT equipment to support the tasks, and
  recruit and deploy staff, including establish a separate unit on ‘subnational revenues’, to be
  headed by a Deputy Commissioner. This new and widely enhanced mandate for RRA on
  subnational revenues requires amendment of legislation, which will be presented to
  Parliament in due time. In parallel to the administrative re-organization and strengthening of

                                                   76
     the subnational revenue collection, the government is also working on improving the policy
     framework and administration on property taxation and rental income taxation. Any policy
     change is likely to be contemplated in 2016 at the earliest (i.e.,at least one full year after RRA
     has fully taken over the administration of local government taxes).
 As appears from annex table 6-7, improvement in tax revenue in 2011/12 due to new
  registered tax payers amounted to Rwf 3.9 billion representing an important part of total tax
  revenue. As appears, the yield increase from PAYE and VAT explains the major part of the
  revenue increase.

2) Developments in arrears call for strengthened tax administrative systems and
   procedures, all the way from filing over collection of arrears and tax audit.
 As illustrated in annex table 6-8 on the profile of tax arrears, arrears went up by 21% in
  FY2012/13 from the previous year. In terms of structure of arrears, short-term arrears were
  reduced by almost 40%, while arrears of 3-12 months of age went up by some 60%. The
  increase in medium-term arrears, from 3-12 months of age, represents 1.4% of the total tax
  revenues in 2012/13 The stock of +12 months old arrears increased by Rwf 10.4 billion,
  representing an additional 1.6% of total tax revenues. The size of arrears, including recent
  year’s increase, calls for intensified compliance efforts. A great part of +one year overdue
  arrears will not result in any recovered tax revenue and should preferably be written off89.
  However, at this point in time, no explicit policy on old arrears has been established by RRA.
  In the context of this operation, the RRA is encouraged to prioritize the management of
  arrears, including establish an action plan on collectable tax arrears, with performance metrics,
  targets and reporting attached. Metrics could include “Total value of arrears attached”; “total
  number of collection cases closed”; total number of taxpayers in arrears as contacted” and
  “average annual arrears collection per staff per year”.

 The importance and relevance of initiatives to further improve tax administrative procedures,
  including further introduction of e-tax solutions, is stressed by this development in arrears.
  The scale-up of eTax systems and their interconnectedness include further development of
  modules on audit, tax account and refund administration, enforcement, and objections and
  appeals. Such integrated single tax account window on all tax payers, independent of size, and
  tax obligations will allow RRA to establish a holistic strategy on any non-compliance or
  arrears issues, enabling timely enforcement actions and broad compliance efforts, including
  risk-based audit strategies. The focus will be on increasing the take-up rate of e-filing covers
  in particular micro and small-sized tax payers, where the rate still is rather low90. Current
  status on e-filing and –payments systems is provided in annex box 6-1.
Annex Box 6-1: E-tax filing and payment systems
The implementation of the e-filing system started in November 2011. As of March 2014, 32,722
taxpayers filed their tax returns electronically. This includes all large and medium sized taxpayers and
53% of small active taxpayers. This compares to the numbers of tax payers in June 2012, where 1,016
VAT, PAYE, Excise, Income tax Quarterly Prepayment and Withholding tax returns for 551 taxpayers
were submitted online. Active taxpayers are defined – an administrative definition for RRA use -- as
those taxpayers that have filed at least one tax return in the last 6 months for VAT and PAYE, and in the
last 3 years for PIT/CIT.
E-payment systems were launched in April 2012 with one of the commercial banks (BCR) using mobile
banking, internet banking and site to site electronic tax payment mechanism. Bank of Kigali joined in July
2012, and As of April 2014, 10 banks are using the e-payment platform. Training on the system is
provided to Government institutions and different taxpayers and sensitization campaigns using different
media are continuously being conducted.
 The Rwandan authorities have come a long way in recent years to ensure tax returns filing on
  time, including support by e-tax opportunities. On average, in 2011/12 about 75-77% of tax
  returns were filed, either on time or with delays. The variances by tax segments are large, with
  small and medium term tax payers filing less frequently than large taxpayers (see annex table
  6-9). Compliance issues on filing have impact on tax arrears, which usually are expensive to
  recover, and which requires the elaboration of a risk-based tax audit strategy and plan.

3) An apparent need for further strengthening VAT compliance and eventually, a
   broadening of the tax base on VAT
 As indicated above, the VAT is the single most important tax source, and, as expressed by the
  government 91 , there seems to be a potential for additional revenue on areas of base
  broadening; reductions in exemptions and zero-rated items and improved compliance efforts,
  supported by the e-based “tax payers’ integrated account” solution.
 As a means of identifying and interpreting the space for VAT revenue improvements, various
  aspects of VAT design and performance in Rwanda, and in East African peer countries, is
  summarized in annex table 6-10. In terms of design, the VAT rate of 18% in Rwanda is
  currently considered adequate by the government, and as appears, two other countries in the
  region have established the rate at 18%, and with the remainder three countries at 15-16%.
  The VAT threshold amount as another design parameter may eventually need further review
  as part of the planned VAT analysis. Countries like Kenya and Malawi have a higher
  threshold, which may be an element behind a much better performance (compliance rate) than
  in Rwanda. Similarly, countries such as Ethiopia and Uganda have lower threshold value than
  Rwanda, and with overall performance rates at a lower level or at par with Rwanda. The
  performance of a VAT tax scheme is expressed by the two metrics – VAT Productivity and
  VAT Gross Compliance Rate. The findings in annex table 6-10 are meant as an initial
  illustration of areas to further look into, as the VAT revenue improvement work moves
  forward. It appears from annex table 6-10, that the countries seem to fall into two clusters –
  relatively high performing countries as Kenya and Malawi with gross compliance rates
  between 45-65% 92 and VAT productivity rates between 0.4–0.5%. Rwanda, together with
  Uganda, and Ethiopia, demonstrate somewhat lower VAT productivity and with the gross
  compliance rates between 15-26%. The specific explanations behind this lower level of VAT
  buoyancy will require further review and analysis, which the government plans to undertake
  (see right below), but some explanation may be found in a combination of (i) potentially too
  few economic sectors are included in the VAT tax base ; (ii) too many broad and/or specific
  exemptions, which, in addition to erosion of the tax base, may create compliance issues and/or

91
  “VAT collections stood at 29.9% of total tax revenue in 2011/2012, which is still low. International
benchmark is that a VAT should generate around 35% of total revenues” RRA, Activity Report on
2011/12, p 10.
92
  A compliance rate of 65% is a relatively high rate, as compared to other LIC/MIC countries. The average of VAT
compliance in the ECA region is 66% (Tax at a Glance for ECA countries, September 2013). An IMF report
mentions that Indonesia in 2010 provided a productivity rate of 50-60. “Revenue Mobilization in Developing
Countries”, Cottarelli et al, IMF, 2011, 9. See also Castro et al, p 9.To reach a VAT productivity of 100% would
require that the entire consumption base is taxed, no exemptions to the base, and full compliance of all tax payers.

      take up too much administrative staff time and efforts; and (iii) compliance issues, including
      tax evasion efforts by specific sectors or sub-sectors.

 VAT Rate= It is the general rate at which most goods and services are taxed under the value added tax. Most
 countries have a variety of reduced rates for certain basic goods, such as basic food stuffs.
 VAT collection= It is the level of net VAT collections as a percent of
 GDP.
 VAT productivity= VAT receipts as % of GDP divided by the standard VAT rate.
 VAT gross compliance rate= It is a measure of how well the VAT produces revenue for the government. It is
 more refined than VATPROD, since it takes into account the fact that VAT is mostly only applied to final
 consumption by households and individuals. The VAT gross compliance ratio is actual VAT collections divided
 by potential VAT collections, expressed as a percentage.
 VAT Threshold= It indicates the amount of annual turnover, or supply/import of goods and services, above
 which taxpayers must file regular VAT returns. It is expressed in current US Dollars ($).
 The government – MINECOFIN and RRA – have outlined a number of initiatives to support
  improved revenue mobilization under VAT:
      A comprehensive analysis and assessment of the VAT tax gap issue: size, composition and
       eventual drivers. IMF will provide TA to support the analysis. The outcome of the analysis
       will be an informed VAT compliance strategy as well as indications of areas for tax policy
       improvements, by base broadening.
      Review of the VAT tax code to reduce exemptions, including to further streamline the
       remaining exemptions
      Further improvement of tax procedures and systems, including eTax to maximize compliance
       and manage arrears. This includes to expand the usage of electronic billing machines (EBM);
       ensure strict compliance with EBM requirements; and to more closely and rapidly follow-up
       and to take immediate actions on filing, payments and arrears, by tax type and client
       segments. In the BFP from April 201493 the government indicates that the implementation of
       EBM recently has been slow to take up amongst tax payers, which underlines the importance
       of the efforts under this operation.

Institutional Capacity
14.     In line with international good practice, a number of important tax administrative
features may be highlighted 94 . The RRA is guaranteed a certain level of autonomy, since
organized as a ‘semi-autonomous body’ outside MINECOFIN. RRA Board of Directors set the
organization, staffing, including strategic staffing, and salary structure of the revenue authority,
within the approved budget.
15.    The RRA integrates the collection of direct and indirect taxes, together with
additional tasks of non-tax revenue nature. Modern tax management principles are applied,
including a clear vision for the agency, medium-term strategy, which is cascaded to operational
business line targets and reporting. The revenue departments are organized by tax payer
segments, but unfortunately and out of touch with international practice, the tax payer services
functions are run by a centralized department, and hence not integrated with the revenue
department’s client profiles. The introduction of IT- and eTax solutions have been
comprehensive, and applied with increase in revenue yield as a result. Since 2007, Performance
Management contracts have been in place for quite a period now where the RRA Board
Chairman commits to performance targets for the organization on an annual basis.
16.     These aspects of tax administration in Rwanda have contributed solidly to the track
performance record as indicated in earlier section, with strong increases in revenue mobilization
in recent years.
17.     It is at the same time clear though that recent changes in the tax regime, tax system
and the significant uptake in registration of tax payers put pressure on compliance and
audit function. The tax management tasks are quite demanding, balancing compliance roles and
tasks related to existing tax payers, including collection of arrears, and the integration of new
segments of tax payers, and new functions related to these segments. In more specific terms, as
highlighted in an assessment report from a development partner in March 2014, the RRA faces
    the capacity constraints related to absence of coherent medium-term IT strategy;
    staff retention issues, with high proportion of technical/auditor staff having left for the
     private sector
    insufficiently detailed business planning, including costing, on core areas, in particular on
     new business lines such as the centralization of revenue collection at the districts; and
    fragmented and apparently insufficient funding of core business.
18.     In addition to these areas, a need to build internal tax policy and –analysis functions at
the MINECOFIN and RRA is present. This includes tax lawyers, and tax economists, and
analysts to prepare tax gap analysis on all tax types, including tax modelling and forecasting on
revenues and tax expenditures, and capacity to review tax policy implications of legislation on
sector areas.
