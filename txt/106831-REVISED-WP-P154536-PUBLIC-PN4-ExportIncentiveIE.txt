Executive Summary
In 2010/2011, Nepal set up a cash incentive scheme for exporters aimed at reducing its trade
deficit and vulnerability to external shocks, by promoting export growth and diversification for
its firms. Under the cash incentive scheme, firms were eligible to receive 2, 3 or 4 % of their
export value as an incentive conditional on exporting to countries other than India, and adding
domestic value by 30, 50 or 80%. The scheme was modified with the budget announcement of
2013.First, the incentive value was reduced to 1 or 2 % of export value. Second, a fast track
system was established for selected products specified under Nepal’s National Trade Integration
Strategy. The Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice has been partnering with the
Government of Nepal to assess the impact of the cash incentive program on export growth and
diversification. This note presents the main results of the analysis.

Making the support to firms’ internationalization a policy priority is commendable Countries
around the world, and many countries in the South Asia region have incentives in place to help
firms become exporters and succeed in diversifying their export markets. There are many reasons
why Governments may use public funds for these purposes. Information is crucial for exporting,
and obtaining it is costly. Exporters need information about the specificities of selling to a
particular destination (standards, market access conditions, etc), about consumer tastes in the
foreign destination, or about pricing strategies. Obtaining this information is costly, but once it is
obtained, it is difficult to exclude third parties from using it (it is ‘non -excludable). In addition,
firms that enter export markets may be better positioned to increase productivity through
reaping the benefits of scale, or through learning from increased competition and demanding
foreign clients, and this may have spillovers to other firms in the country. Different Governments
choose to support these efforts through different policy interventions. Nepal, or Bangladesh, for
example choose to provide a cash incentive. Other countries focus on subsidizing the provision
of information, or helping firms build their managerial or other capabilities needed for exporting.

  To date, and to the best of our knowledge, there are no rigorous impact evaluation of the cash incentive schemes
for exporters of the type that is applied in Nepal, and that is also applied in other countries of the South Asia region
(e.g. in Bangladesh). Impact evaluations have focused on other type of internationalization support consisting of
information provision, or of building firms capabilities needed for the export process (for results, see Cadot et al
2011). For a description of some key export promotion activities with positive impact see Policy Note 5 of this report.

                                                                                                                      2
But not all interventions designed to support firms’ internationalization work, so, evaluating
impact is crucial. The design and implementation of these interventions is necessarily an
experimental process. This is why it is also important to (i) keep channels of communication with
the private sector open, (ii) rigorously evaluate the impact of the interventions, and (iii) be ready
to change the course of action if the interventions show no effect on the targeted variables.

The program is not reaching the firms it is meant to support. High fixed costs of filing, due to a
lengthy and complex filing procedure, couple with limited resources and a first-come first-serve
allocation mechanism have been impediments for exporters (and particularly for new exporters)
to claim the incentive. In 2012, only 3.3% of eligible firms actually received the incentive. This
increased to above 6% in 2013 and 14% in 2014, as more funds were made available, but it
remained low: most firms exporting eligible products do not receive any incentive. And those
that are receiving it tend to be substantially larger, and also tend to find it easier to receive it
more than once. In fact, the conditional probability of receiving the incentive given that the firm
had managed to receive it the year before was in the range of 50-70% (compared to the
unconditional probability of 3-14%).

Some of the planned changes in the scheme introduced in 2013 revealed public-private
dialogue. However, many of these changes have not been fully implemented. The fast-track
system introduced in 2013, and by which, firms exporting priority products would not need to
certify domestic value addition reflect the systematic feedback of the private sector on the
complexity of proving value added content. On one hand, the changes reveal that communication
channels between the private and the public sector exist and that feedback is incorporated into
policymaking, which is commendable. On the other, both field-level interviews, and systematic
data analysis suggest that the ‘alleged’ change was not fully implemented, or at least did not
result in a reduction in the fixed costs of filing (in fact these have increased over time). The
change involving the reduction in incentives’ rates, however, did materialize, with median
effective incentive rates having fallen from 2.9% to 2.1%.

Has the incentive had any effect on export growth and diversification?

The incentive does not seem to have had had any effect on export growth or diversification. To
answer the question, the note looks at export performance at different levels of aggregation: at
the macro level, at the product level, and at the firm level.

At the aggregate level we find no conclusive evidence of the incentive program having affected
export growth or diversification away from India. Instead, India appears to be growing as a
destination market after the implementation of the incentive, likely due to the fact that during
the period of analysis, India grew faster than the rest of the world, and therefore it increased
demand for imports at a relative faster rate than the rest of the world did.

                                                                                                   3
At the product level there are mixed patterns of diversification. Readymade garments, polyester
yarn and carpets, three of the largest traded eligible products in terms of value for Nepal, display
noticeable export growth; however, only half of all eligible products diversify away from India.
Those products that did diversify away from India went to the United States, the Czech Republic,
Turkey, Malaysia and Australia. In any case there is no evidence showing that when diversification
was observed, it was due to the cash incentive scheme.

At the firm level there is no evidence showing a clear link between the effective incentive rates
received and export performance, or the changes in the export incentive scheme and
performance. There is some evidence that firms that received the incentive diversified both
product and market offerings. However, these firms that consistently received the incentive are
special in the first place – that is, they have unique characteristics, and their different
performance is likely related to them: they tend to be larger than those that did not receive the
incentive, for example. Once firm-specific characteristics are controlled for, we find no effect of
either the change in the incentive scheme in 2013, that made the incentive less generous, or of
the effective incentive rate, on export levels, growth and diversification patterns.

The main policy conclusion that emerges from this analysis is that the current incentive scheme
needs to be revised. In the process of revision it is important to carefully consider what the main
objective of the incentive is and why public support is needed. If, for example, the incentive aims
at helping firms financing the informational costs at the beginning of the process (the so called
‘discovery costs’) it is important that the incentive targets new firms, or new export flows, rather
than existing, well-established ones. In any case, the filing process needs to be streamlined so
that the fixed costs a firm faces when filing for the incentive fall substantially, and smaller firms
are better positioned to obtain it. This will also reduce the cost of administering the scheme for
the government. More generally, resources that are currently committed to this export incentive
scheme could be put to a better use to finance policy interventions that would help a wider
universe of firms to be more competitive. An example is a reform to the tariff code that seems
to penalize exporters that rely on imported intermediates. A second example is the streamlining
of the duty-drawback system for exporters.

Introduction
Governments all over the world support firms’ internationalization plans through different
interventions. They do so in the understanding that entering and thriving in highly demanding
export markets is crucial for gaining from economies of scale, but also from learning, leading to
productivity gains that often spill over to the rest of the economy. Also, in small economies,
reaping these gains from economies of scale through export market participation is crucial for
growth and job creation

In 2010/11 the Government of Nepal introduced a cash incentive scheme to stimulate export
growth and diversification away from India. The program’s stated objectives included
“enhancing exports, reducing the trade deficit and improving the balance of payments situation”,
and applied to exporters that, complying with a certain domestic value added threshold,
exported to countries other than India (thus obtaining ‘convertible currency’). Under this
scheme, exports to countries other than India and containing more than 30, 50 or 80% of
domestic value addition were entitled to an incentive that amounted to 2, 3 and 4% of the export
value in fob terms.

In April 2013, the Government of Nepal modified the cash incentive scheme. This modification
had two components. First, it reduced the subsidy to 1 and 2% rates from 1, 2 and 4% rates.
Second, it introduced a fast-track for a number of products – mostly identified as priority
products under Nepal’s National Trade Integration Strategy – by which firms would not need to
prove domestic value addition, but instead would be automatically eligible.

This note attempts to look at the overall performance of the mechanism and at the effects of
its change in 2013. It examines the design and implementation of the incentive scheme as well
as its impact on exports and diversification patterns in Nepal. On design and implementation, the
note attempts to answer the following question: is the incentive reaching the firms it is aiming at
supporting? And: are there substantial fixed costs associated with filing the incentive and how
have these been evolving over time? On impact, the note attempts to answer the following
question: is the incentive scheme inducing an increase and diversification in exports that we
would have not observed in its absence? Of course, answering the latter question is challenging
as we do not observe the counterfactual (what would have happened had the incentive scheme
not been in place). Our approach goes in a crescendo of granularity. We start by comparing
aggregate export trends of Nepal to India and to the rest of the world (excluding India) before
and after the introduction of the incentive scheme in 2010/11 and the change in the scheme in
2013. Second, we examine the performance of exports at the product level, comparing growth
and diversification patterns of eligible exportable products with those of ineligible ones (same
products, but exported to India). Third, and relying on firm-level data on exports matched with
data also at the firm-level on incentive claims we compare the export levels and diversification

                                                                                                 5
performance of firms that receive the incentive with that of firms that don’t and export eligible
products. Fourth, we look at the effect of the change in the cash incentive mechanism of 2013,
by comparing the growth and diversification patterns before and after the change for recipients
and non-recipients of the incentive (through a difference in difference model). Finally, we look at
the overall impact of the incentive rate on export growth, levels and diversification (through a
fixed effects model).

The initiative of the Government of Nepal to evaluate the impact of this intervention goes in
the right direction. Any policy intervention attempting to support firms in covering part of the
‘discovery costs’ associated with new export activities is subject to success or failure. The design
and implementation of these initiatives is inevitably an experimental process, and not all
interventions will pay off. This is why two elements are crucial. First, to keep channels of
communication with the private sector, to better monitor and evaluate the functioning of the
scheme. The changes in design introduced in 2013 seem to reflect that these channels were
active. Second, that the interventions are subject to rigorous impact evaluations and that the
course of action is altered in response to the results of these evaluations, if need be. The main
messages that emerge from this note are key inputs to the stock of knowledge on which policy-
making is based in Nepal.

The rest of the note is structured as follows. Section 2 discusses aspects of the design of the
allocation mechanism of the incentive. Section 3 shows the impact of the incentive program from
the aggregate level, at the product level and at the firm level.

       1. Design of the Incentive

       Background and changes to the scheme
The budget speech of June 2010 introduced a cash incentive scheme to exporters with the
objectives of enhancing exports, reducing the trade deficit and improving the balance of
payments. This scheme consisted of 1, 2 or 4 percent of the FOB export value rebate to exporters,
paid to them through Nepal’s National Rastra Bank on the condition of: (i) exporting to countries
other than India, and (ii) adding 30, 50 or 80 percent of value added domestically.

Private sector feedback after the scheme had been in place for some time focused on the length
and complexity of certifying domestic value addition.

Partly as a response to this feedback, the system was modified with the budget speech of June
2013. The Government of Nepal introduced a fast-track for priority products included in the NTIS
that would not need, in principle to prove domestic value addition. In addition to this, the



                                                                                                  6
incentive tiers moved from 1, 2 and 4% to 1 and 2% of FOB export values, thus becoming less
generous (see Figure 1).

If the scheme was effective, the introduction of the fast-track should have helped exporters,
while the reduction in the incentive rates should have harmed them.

The fast-track system is unlikely to have affected the speed or ease with which incentives were
received. Evidence suggests that (a) the fast-track has not been fully implemented yet, (b) the
private sector interviewed for the preparation of this note did not perceive any changes in the
procedures, and when it did, it was an increase in the process complexity, and (c) our estimates
on the fixed costs of filing suggest an increase, rather than a reduction in these fixed costs when
comparing the before and after of the budget announcement of 2013.

    The reduction in the incentive rates, Figure 1: Distribution of effective incentive
    instead, did fall upon a substantial rates in 2012 (blue) and 2014 (red)

          Implementation and Reach of the Incentive Scheme
The implementation and allocation design of the cash incentive scheme is crucial for the
incentive to have any effect on firms’ decisions. This is why, before assessing the impact on the
recipients of the incentive, we need to answer the following question: is the incentive reaching

  We test the significance of this shift of the distribution using a Kolmogrov-Smirnoff test of stochastic dominance.
Results suggest that the 2012 distribution is different from that of 2014 at the 15% significance level. The small
number of firms that receive the incentive, that constitute the basis of the distributions plotted in Figure 1 needs to
be taken into account when considering the acceptable threshold for significance (Wooldridge xx). The comparison
of position indicators is also revealing of a displacement of the distribution to the left after the incentive change.
The first quartile of the distribution in 2012 was at 0.014, while it was at 0.008 in 2014. The median was at 0.029 in
2012 and at 0.021 in 2014, while the third quartile was at 0.04 in 2012 and 0.034 in 2014.

  This may be reflecting data reporting mistakes.

the firms it intends to be supporting? If the answer is ‘no’ as it seems to be in this case, the natural
follow up question is why?

Not all eligible transactions received the cash incentive. When measured in export values, only
the 35% of the value of eligible transactions received the cash incentive in 2014. This percentage
increased from 13.6% and 20.5% in 2012 and 2013 (see Error! Reference source not found.).

Why is take up so low? The reason for this low take up of the program is threefold: first, the
resources devoted to the cash incentive fund are disbursed on a first-come first-serve basis, and
they are limited, although increasing over the period (by 51.5% in 2013 and by 82% in 2014).
Second, not all eligible firms that apply for the incentive successfully complete the necessary
administrative procedures to receive the incentive. Third, some eligible firms may not apply in
the first place, either due to lack of knowledge about the scheme or due to the high costs of filing
for the incentive. As filing costs are mostly ‘fixed’ (that is, unrelated with the quantities exported),
the cost-benefit ratio is larger, the smaller the export flow is (and the smaller the firm is).

Given the ad-hoc allocation system, the majority of the increase in claimed incentives in values
is due to firms that were exporting an eligible transaction the previous fiscal year but were
unable to benefit from the incentive. These firms presumably applied for the incentive when
there was no enough money left for the incentive the previous year. Table 2 decomposes the
claimed transactions for fiscal years 2013 and 2014 into incumbent firms, previous non-claimants
and entrants. An incumbent firm is a firm that received the incentive the previous year and is
receiving it again in the current year. A previous non-claimant is a firm that exported an eligible
product to an eligible destination in the previous year and for whatever reason did not receive
an incentive but is now receiving it. An entrant is a firm that did not export an eligible product in
the previous year, but is now exporting an eligible product in the current year and is also receiving
the incentive. The share of export value belonging to previous non-claimants increased from
52.1% in 2013 to 63.1% in 2014. Incumbent firms saw a decrease in export share from 47.5% to
36.4%, respectively. Entrants constituted a very small share of export value in both fiscal years.

What if we change the focus of analysis from the share of eligible export values that are
reached by incentives to the share of eligible firms? What proportion of firms actually obtain
the cash incentive out of all the eligible ones? How many firms are obtaining it, year after year?
What is the probability of obtaining it, given that you have obtained it the year before? These
questions are addressed below.

In 2012, the probability of obtaining the cash incentive for firms that were eligible was 3.3
percent and it has been increasing ever since. That year, 24 firms obtained the incentive. In 2013,
the probability of obtaining the cash incentive increased to 5.1%, while in 2014 increased to
14.8% (see Table 3).

There are substantial fixed costs associated with filing for the cash incentive, which makes it
easier for firms that have already obtained the cash incentive at least once, to obtain it again.
The high fixed costs of filing for the cash incentive have been brought up by exporters from
different sectors. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the process to file is not only burdensome
but it is also lengthy in terms of the time it takes from filing until receiving the cash.4 A proxy for
these fixed costs is the conditional probability of obtaining the incentive in a year, given that you
had obtained it a year before. In fact, in 2013, the probability of obtaining the incentive given
that the firm had obtained the incentive the year before was 50%.5. That is, while the
unconditional probability of obtaining the incentive for eligible firms was 5.1% in 2013, those
firms that received it the year before found it ten times easier to receive it again in 2013. One
interpretation of this result is that there are substantial fixed costs associated with filing for the
cash incentive and so, after a firm does it once, it is much easier to do it again (see Table 3).

  In fact, when we interviewed exporters in 2013, for the preparation of a Trade Competitiveness Diagnostic in Nepal,
one exporter referred to complexity of obtaining the cash incentive in the following way: “it is as if they invited you
for dinner, but when you knocked on the door, they asked you to enter climbing through the roof”.

   The conditional probability of an event happening, say, receiving the incentive in 2013 (R13), given that it has
happened in 2012 (R12) equals the ratio of the joint probability of R13 and R12 happening to the probability of R12
happening. Plugging in these probabilities: P(R13|R12)=P(R13∩R12)/P(R12)=1.6%/3.3%=50%.

Has the fast-track reduced the fixed costs of filing?

As mentioned, in addition to making the incentive scheme less generous, the changes introduced
to it in 2013 brought in a ‘fast-track’ for selected products. The fast-track aimed at reducing the
costs of filing in principle allowing firms exporting the selected products to claim the incentive
without proving local content in their exports. The results from field-level interviews suggest that
the fast-track did not reduce the costs of filing. This anecdotal evidence is supported by an
examination of the evolution of our proxy for fixed costs: the conditional probability of a firm
obtaining the incentive given that it had obtained it in the past.

The conditional probability of a firm obtaining the incentive given that it had obtained it before,
increased rather than fall. The probability of receiving the incentive in 2014 given that the firm
had received it in 2013 is 62%, 12 percentage points up from the year before. And the probability
of receiving it in 2014 given that you received it in 2012 is 70%. This adds to the evidence
suggesting that fast-tracking did not reduce the fixed costs of claiming.

         2. Incentive Impact Assessment
The four subsections below approach the question of how impactful the cash incentive has been
on export growth and diversification at different levels of disaggregation (Figure 2 shows the four
different levels of analysis).

         Impact at the aggregate level
A first pass to understand whether the cash incentive has had any effect on export performance
is to look at aggregate export trends before and after the scheme was introduced in 2010/11.
One of the main goals of the incentive regime was to increase market diversification, specifically
away from India. Figure 3 shows that exports to India increased by $44 million from the beginning
of the incentive program in 2010 to 2011. Exports to countries other than India were steadily
declining from 2009 to 2012. It is not until 2013 that exports to other countries begins to increase,
at which point the incentive program has become less generous. In addition, exports to India do
fall but remain larger than their pre-program levels.

India maintains a very large share of the destination market for Nepal’s exports. Figure 4,
confirms the points made above that the influence of the incentive program cannot be seen at
the macro level. We would have expected to see India’s share of exports to decrease after the
incentive program began, but the opposite is observed at the macro level. India’s share as a
destination for Nepal exports is increasing from 2009 until 2012 (likely driven by relative faster
growth of India versus the rest of the world during that period). Nepal exports begin diversifying
away from India in 2013, the year in which the incentive regime became less generous.

             Impact at the Product Level
This section looks at the relative performance of products that were targeted by the export
incentive versus that of products that were not targeted. Employing highly detailed export
information obtained from the Nepalese Customs Administration, this section provides an
overview of the impact of this policy on export flows and, more importantly, on export
diversification. The analysis is performed at the product level (i.e. export performance of eligible
products vis-a-vis ineligible products). Later in the document, the performance of firms that
received the incentive will be compared with that of firms that did not receive it.

There are 30 categories of products that were deemed eligible by the government of Nepal to
receive the cash incentive. In 2012, these 30 product categories represented 40% of the value
of total exports. These categories include 362 products at the highest level of disaggregation of
the HS classification (6-digits). Carpets, polyester yarn, and herbs are the most important
products, accounting for 25% of total export value. Readymade garments, lentils, tea, semi-
processed skins are less important products representing altogether around 12% of total export
value. The other 23 product categories represent merely 3% of total exports, including 5
categories where no exports are recorded in the data.6 There were 952 firms exporting eligible
products, which account for 72% of the total number of exporters. Table 4 shows how important
the eligible product categories were in 2012.

  The data includes solely formal export transaction recorded by customs offices during the period 2012-2015.
Informal trade between India and Nepal is pervasive. Taneja et al. (2015) estimates that its size is almost as large as
that of formal trade. Therefore, the analysis presented in this section regarding the importance of India is just the
lower bound of total bilateral trade.

                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 12
Although products exported to India were ineligible to receive an incentive, in 2012 India was
the most important destination for eligible product categories, representing 46% of all exports
of eligible products. Total exports to India accounted for 70% of Nepal’s total export value;
however, India’s importance as a destination greatly varies among eligible product categories.
For example, while exports of carpets to India, the most important eligible product category,
represented merely 1% of total exports, almost all exports of polyester yarn, herbs, vegetable oil,
fruits and turmeric were directed to India.

The export performance of eligible transactions slightly outperformed that of ineligible
transactions. Eligible transactions are defined as an export of an eligible product to any
destination other than India. Even though the incentive scheme became less generous in 2013,
                                                                                                                                     13
the values of eligible transactions grew by 0.4% in 2013 and 8.2% in 2014. The value of ineligible
transactions decreased in 2013 by 6.8% and increased by 7.7% in 2014. Eligible transactions
represented around 31% of total eligible and ineligible transaction values in 2014 (Table 5).

Looking at overall export shares…

When comparing 2012 with 2014, exports of readymade garments, polyester yarn and carpet
products to markets other than India increased noticeably at the same time as the incentive
value in percentage terms was reduced. Export shares of eligible transactions of these products
grew by 0.8, 0.6, and 0.3 perceptual points, respectively (Figure 5). These increases in export
share are remarkable because these products accounted for 25% of Nepal’s total exports in 2012.
However, only exports of polyester yarn were highly concentrated to the Indian market in 2012
– the other two were already diversified away from India (see Table 4). Eligible transactions of
other mid-important products (such as semi-processed skins and tea) did not gain export share
after the policy was implemented. Lentils, whose exports accounted for 3% of total Nepalese
exports in 2012, were highly concentrated in the Indian market and became more so in 2014.

For those eligible products whose exports were originally highly concentrated in India, there is
mixed evidence about market diversification. Within the set of eight products categories for
which India accounted for at least 50% of total export value in 2012, only four items show a
diversification away from India. These products are herbs, polyester yarn, fruits, and ready-to-
eat chow-chow. Fourteen of the thirty product categories diversified away from India (Table 6).

Note: This tables show the market concentration indexes for eligible product categories in 2012
and in 2014. The table is sorted by the degree of export concentration of each product in the
Indian market in 2012. The HHI is the Herfindahl–Hirschman Index, which is used to measure
the concentration of exports across markets incorporating the importance of each destination
in the aggregate exports of the product. The value of the index is monotonically decreasing in
concentration and therefore, higher values are associated with higher levels of export
concentration.

                                The United States, the Czech Republic, Turkey, Malaysia and Australia are the emerging
                                destinations for products that show diversification away from India. Figure 6 compares the
                                average growth rate of Nepal’s exports to its top 10 destinations between 2012 and 2014 versus
                                the same measure for the world (excluding Nepal). The bundle of products considered are those
                                whose exports to India represent at least 50% of total export value and that experienced a
                                diversification away from India after the change in the incentive scheme. These products are
                                herbs, polyester yarn, fruits, and ready to eat chow-chow (see Table 6). If a destination is above
                                (below) the 45-degree line, exports from Nepal grew at a higher (lower) rate than export from
                                the rest of the world, indicating that Nepal gained (lost) market share in that particular market.
                                The size of the bubble indicates the relative importance of each destination in the considered
                                export bundle. As expected, Nepal has lost market share in India in those products where market
                                diversification has been observed. The United States, the Czech Republic, Turkey and Malaysia
                                are the emerging markets where Nepal has gained market share. For instance, between 2012
                                and 2014 Nepal’s exports of these products to Turkey grew by 22% whereas the exports of the
                                same products from the rest of the world grew by only 5%.

                                Impact of the Incentive at the Firm-Level



                                                                                                                               17
To understand the impact at the firm level we proceed in two stages . First, we compare the
performance in terms of export growth and in terms of export diversification of firms that claim
the incentive, and firms that do not claim the incentive but export eligible products. Now, firms
that claim the incentive may be ‘special’ and therefore may be performing differently than others
for reasons other than receiving the incentive. For example, firms receiving the incentive are
much larger than those that do not receive it but are in principle eligible. Firms that received the
incentive consistently throughout the period, exported in median, $88,000 in 2014, while those
that never received it while being eligible exported a median of $4,000 in the same year (Table
7). This is just one aspect by which these firms may have special traits.

For these reasons we use an approach that allows us to eliminate any time-invariant factor that
makes these claimant firms ‘special’. We rely on the fact that the incentive conditions changed
in June 2013 – the incentive was reduced – and test the difference in the change in performance
before and after that change in mid-2013 between firms that claimed the incentive and firms
that did not claim the incentive (both for all firms, and for eligible firms only). 7


Performance of recipients versus performance of non-recipients
In 2014 firms that export an eligible transaction but do not claim the incentive performed
better than firms that systematically claimed the incentive. Exports of eligible transactions
increased $16.5 million from $201.3 million in 2013 to $217.8 million in 2014 (Table 5). Assigning
firms to different cohorts based on whether they claimed or did not claim an incentive, the $16.5
million increase in eligible transactions is mainly attributed to firms that did not receive the
incentive. Table 7 displays statistics for three cohorts of firms, those that always claimed at least
one transaction for every fiscal year, those that received at least one eligible transaction for one
or more fiscal years, and those that never received for any of the fiscal years. The export value of
eligible transactions of firms that received the incentive for every year decreased about $5.8
million in 2014; however, the export value of eligible transaction for firms that never received
the incentive increased about $21 million during the same fiscal year. Therefore the $16.5 million
increase in overall eligible transactions is mainly accounted for by firms that never received an
incentive.

Despite the reduction in the incentive, firms that received the incentive consistently diversified
their product and destinations. Table 7 shows that the median number of products receiving the
incentive and exported by firms that received the incentive consistently actually grew from 3 in
2012 to 5 in 2014. Firms that received the incentive at least once throughout the sample period
increased the median number of products exported shortly in 2013 from 5 to 7; however, in 2014,
these firms were back to exporting 5 products per firm. Market level diversification is fairly similar
between firms that consistently receive the incentive and those that receive it at least once. Firms
that consistently received the incentive saw an increase in the median number of destination

Firms that received the incentive outperformed other firms exporting the same product to the
same destination in the same year. We find that, on average, the export value of exporters that
received the incentive is 2.2 times greater than exports from similar firms that do not receive the
incentive. As expected, there is some heterogeneity in this impact across eligible product
categories. Figure 7 shows the estimated coefficients and their confidence intervals for the most
important eligible categories. Exporters that claimed the incentive for ready to eat chow-chow,
tea, handicraft and wooden craft, ready-made garments, and carpet products statistically
outperformed their counterparts by a factor of 57.6, 21.3, 3.8, 2.9, and 2.3, respectively.

Using a difference-in-difference strategy to test the impact of the change in the incentive
scheme on exports growth, levels and diversification


                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                20
Firms that receive the incentive are likely to be ‘special’. As mentioned, they are systematically
larger than those that, exporting an eligible product, do not obtain the incentive (either because
they don’t file for the cash incentive or because they cannot obtain it) (see Table 7). They may
also have other unobservable characteristics that make them better positioned both to claim and
obtain the incentive and to grow and diversify. If that’s the case, just comparing the performance
of recipients and non-recipients may not be a good indicator of the impact of the incentive
scheme on export performance because there are omitted variables that play a role and are
unobservable.

An alternative approach helps to obtain a more accurate answer to the question: how effective
has the cash incentive been in encouraging export growth and diversification? We take
advantage of the fact that the incentive regime was modified in June 2013.8 As long as what
makes these firms special is constant over time and reduction in the incentive is present in the
data, a ‘double comparison’ is helpful. As stated earlier in this note, we tested the data to see if
there was an actual reduction in the incentive and found evidence suggesting there was This
double comparison involves comparing the performance in terms of growth or diversification
‘before and after’ this incentive modification for firms that do get the incentive with firms that
do not (both for the groups of eligible firms, and for all firms in the dataset). By comparing these
two differences: the before and after of recipients with the before and after of non-recipients,
we eliminate all firm-specific factors that do not change over time. For the purposes of these
comparisons, we look at fiscal years 2012 and 2014

Two models were estimated using this method. The first uses all observations while the second
drops outliers in terms of effective incentive rates received.9 The first model keeps all
observations regardless of the amount of incentive the firms received relative to exports (i.e.:
does not drop outliers). The second model keeps only firms that received up to 4 percent of the
cash incentive relative to exports and treats the rest as outliers that we then drop. Results are
presented in Table 8 and Table 9 in Appendix 1.

EFFECTS ON FIRMS ’ RATE OF GROWTH OF EXPORTS
There is no evidence of the change in the incentive regime having effect on export growth.

  As mentioned in the introduction, the modification implied the introduction of a fast-track for products in the NTIS
so that local content need not to be certified, as well as a reduction in the cash incentives. Evidence reported in this
note, both from field-interviews and from data analysis, suggest the fast-track had no effect on the fixed costs of
filing (see Section 1 of this note).

   To detect outliers we calculated the ‘effective incentive rate received’ as the quotient of the incentive value
received by a given firm due to an eligible product/transaction and the value exported by that firm in that eligible
product/transaction. For some firms, the effective incentive rate was as large as 20 – that is, 2000%. For about 25%
of firms the effective incentive rate was above the 4% defined as the maximum possible rate. We attribute that to
misreporting, either of the incentive data or of the export transaction data and drop it from the dataset.

                                                                                                                    21
demand shocks and product-specific shocks to domestic supply conditions, results show no
effects of the change in the incentive regime on the rate of growth of exports (columns 1 & 2 of
Table 8 and Table 9), That is, making the incentive scheme less generous did not affect the
performance of firms that were receiving the incentive. Take for example the first two columns
of Table 8. They show the results of estimating the impact of the incentive change on export
growth both on all firms (column 1), and on the subset of firms that are in principle eligible to
receive the incentive (column 2). Results show that among eligible firms only, export growth was
significantly greater after the change in the regime (2014, that is, when it became less generous)
than before (2012). There is no difference in growth for firms that receive the incentive and those
that do not receive it once the other controls are incorporated. More important is the
interpretation of the coefficient on the variable ‘Incentive*Before/After’. This coefficient
captures whether the export growth of firms that were receiving the incentive reacted any
differently to the change in the incentive scheme from that of firms that were not receiving the
incentive. If the incentive mattered for export growth, we would expect that the growth rate of
exports of those firms receiving the incentive would be particularly affected by the incentive
scheme becoming less generous. In other words, when we compare the difference in growth
before and after the change in the incentive between recipients and non-recipients of the
incentive, we find none. The change in the incentive regime had no effect on growth.

EFFECTS ON FIRMS ’ EXPORT LEVELS
Evidence is mixed on whether the change in the incentive scheme had any effect on the level
of firm exports depending on whether we control for outliers or not. We look at the reduction
in the incentive on the level of firm exports for both models. The first model does not drop
outliers – that is keeps all firms regardless of whether data suggests they receive more than the
maximum incentive rate allowed. In that case we see that the reduction in the incentive scheme
is associated with a decrease in export levels (columns 3 and 4 of Table 8). When we control for
outliers (model reported in Table 9) we see that the reduction in the incentive scheme is
associated with no change in the level of exports (columns 3 and 4). Therefore, no definitive
conclusion can be drawn from these results. Interestingly, and as argued before, the results
confirm that firms receiving the incentive are larger than those not receiving it, all other things
held constant.

EFFECT ON FIRMS’ EXPORT BUNDLE CONCENTRATION
There is no evidence of the reduction in the incentive having increased firms’ concentration of
their export bundles. Similarly, we looked at the effects of the change in the incentive on
concentration (the Herfindahl index) at the market (columns 5 and 6 in Table 8 and Table 9) and
at the product level (columns 7 and 8 in Table 8 and Table 9). Results show, as shown above in
this document, that firms that receive the incentive have less concentrated export bundles in
terms of destinations they reach. Also, we do find, when looking at the subset of eligible firms,

                                                                                                22
that those firms that received the incentive reduced the concentration of their export bundles
faster than those that did not receive the incentive after the incentive actually shrank, these
results are consistent throughout both models. They suggest that the incentive itself was not
behind a process of diversification. On product diversification, we find evidence that firms that
received the incentive became more significantly concentrated; however, these results may be
affected by outliers and do become insignificant when outliers are removed.

Using a fixed effects model to test for the effect of the effective incentive rate on the export
growth, levels and diversification

Not all firms may have experienced a reduction in the incentive rate received after the policy
change in June 2013. Take a firm that was already receiving 1% before June 2013. The change in
the upper tier of the incentive will not have any effect on this firm that, if continued producing
eligible products and claiming and receiving the incentive, will continue receiving 1% after June
2013. For this reason, it is important to complement the approach discussed above, with another
one that takes into account how much of the incentive firms were actually receiving.

This complementary approach answers the following question: For a given firm, how does
export growth, levels or diversification changes, as the amount of incentive received changes?
Similarly to the double difference models discussed above, here we also control for time-
invariant firm-specific characteristics along with time-varying product-specific world demand
shocks and shocks to domestic supply conditions. We also look at whether the effects of the
incentive on firms’ performance is heterogeneous by firm size . As before, we estimate two
models: one that uses all observations available, and one that drops outliers as defined above.
Results are presented in Table 10 and Table 11 in Appendix 1

There is no evidence the incentive received in a given year affected export growth, levels or
product and market concentration. Columns 1 through 4 of Table 10 show the amount of
incentive received the previous year did not have a significant effect on firm exports, looking at
the universe of all firms (column 1) and at that of eligible firms only (column 2). Similarly, there
is no evidence of different effects by exporter size (columns 3 and 4). The effect on the growth
rates of exports is also insignificant from a statistical point of view, both when looking at all firms
(columns 5 and 6) and when looking at the effect by size class (columns 7 & 8). The effect on
market concentration (columns 9 through 12) was insignificant and so was the effect on product
concentration (columns 13 through 16). These results are consistent with both samples used.
(Please see Appendix 1). We conclude that most of the evidence indicates that the overall impact
of the incentive on exports and concentration was insignificant.
