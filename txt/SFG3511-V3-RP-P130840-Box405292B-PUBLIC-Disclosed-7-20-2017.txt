                                   Executive Summary

ES 01 Background
Considering the intensifying impact of floods and urgent need for an integrated and long-
term solution to flooding in the city, the Oyo State Government has requested the World
Bank's support to finance a flood management project in Ibadan. So far, the responses to
the past flooding events have been piecemeal; mainly focusing on alleviating immediate
and short-term needs such as rebuilding of destroyed assets.
Consequently, the World Bank is supporting the Oyo State Government to implement the
Ibadan Urban Flood Management project (IUFMP) that aims at developing a long-term
flood risk management framework by initiating risk assessment, community awareness,
and providing enough flexibility in the project design to make changes based on learning.
The project also supports capacity building for flood risk management in the city of
Ibadan. It reinforces Oyo State government’s early warning and response capabilities
and leverages existing World Bank projects in Oyo State in support of the IUFMP.
This Omiri Culvert Civil Works project has triggered the OP 4.12 policy from the social
issues identified. The Involuntary Resettlement policy of The World Bank safeguard
policies have a provision for the preparation of an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan
(instead of a Resettlement Action Plan-ARAP) if there is no physical and economic
displacement and less than ten percent of their assets are lost or fewer than 200 people
displaced during the course of the project, as is the case in the Omiri Culvert Priority Site
of the IUFMP.
This ARAP has been carried out by identifying the primary set of activities that underpin
the accomplishment of the specific deliverables in the scope of work, to ensure
achievement of project outcomes as defined in the Terms of Reference (TOR) for this
project.

Project Area
The project area is the Omiri Priority Culvert along Adekola road. The Omiri Culvert –
Omiran (Omi River) priority site is located in Egbeda Local Government Area. The site falls
within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y coordinates N7.37441 and E3.9966
and at altitude 195msl. Omiri River flowing through Adekola community is channeled by a
dilapidated culvert with no protective barriers on both sides of the culvert.

Methodology
This study employed the use of both primary and secondary sources of data which
includes desk review of the existing relevant project documentation; Resettlement Policy
Framework (RPF), the World Bank procedural manual on Involuntary Resettlement (OP
4.12 “Involuntary Resettlement”)
Field survey and site visits were carried out, in addition to undertaking Public
Consultations, by community engagements and Key Informant Interviews, which
underpinned the aim of having a general and detailed understanding of the nature of the
environmental and social concerns of the project area. Consequently, this facilitated the
decisions made in the preparation of this ARAP.

Public Consultation
Commencement of the process of identification and subsequent census of the current
occupants of the affected area or assets is the basis for design of the ARAP. Also,
meetings were held with the IUFMP Project Coordinator (PC) and Project Livelihood

ES. 02. Policies and Regulatory Framework
The World Bank has operational safeguard policies, which apply to various development
projects, which the bank is either implementing or funding. The objective of these
policies is to prevent or at least minimize social and environmental risks, while increasing
socio-economic benefits of the approved projects. The key policy framework that
underpinned this ARAP includes but is not limited to:
(i)     The World Bank Environmental and Social Safeguards policies (OP 4.01, OP 4.04,
        4.12 and OP 17.50), (ii) Land Use Policy 1978 (amended 1992).
The Involuntary Resettlement Policy (OP 4.12) lays emphasis on the preparation of
Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) or an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for
World Bank funded projects that trigger involuntary resettlement.

ES. 03 Overview of the Project Environment
The Omiri culvert priority site of the IUFMP is located in Ibadan, situated in southwestern
Nigeria and is the capital of Oyo State. Ibadan is centered about latitude 7o 25I North and
longitude 3o 5IEast (Figure 2.1) and is located approximately 145 km north of Lagos.

Population and Housing Patterns
Egbeda is a Local Government Area in Oyo State, Nigeria. Its headquarters are in the
town of Egbeda. The housing patterns observed especially along the road up to and
beyond the priority site showed that majority of the houses in the project area are
concrete buildings. The Egbeda LGA has an area of 191 km² and a population of 281,573 at
the 2006 census.

Project Affected Persons (PAPs)
The project area is predominantly homogeneous and mainly persons that have shops
along the road on which the culvert is located. 58 PAPs were identified out of which 3
PAPs were of the vulnerable groups. The negative impact that has affected these persons
has been from the design concerns involving drainage works 250m before and after the
Omiri Priority Culvert. The scope of the project activities, assets and magnitudes of
impacts is shown in table ES.02.

Socio economic characteristics of these PAP’s are:
The PAPs comprise of 23 male (100%) persons with majority (68%) falling within the age
band between 35 – 59 year age brackets. About 89% of the PAPs are married with about
same proportion (88%) family size between 1 – 6 family size. 79% are Christians, while 21%
are Muslims.

ES 04.Eligibility, Valuation and Compensation
Since the project entails the rehabilitation of existing road network, new land take is not
anticipated and as such will not attract land displacement. The following types of
compensation and rehabilitation measures would guide eligibility of PAPs and their
entitlements:

PAPs with Permanent Structures Affected
Compensation will be considered for the structures and other assets (such as fences) of
PAPs on the ROW of project corridor. PAPs will be compensated for loss of livelihood
income due to loss of business days.

PAPs with Moveable Structures
These include all the PAPs whose trading tables and goods are displayed along the road
thereby encroaching into the setback for the ROW. PAPs will not be given financial
assistance to shift-back from the ROW. This is only a social responsibility measure to
persuade PAPs to move backward. There will be no income restoration compensation.
However, compensation will be offered for disturbance to access.

Disturbance allowance
The civil works that will be carried out on this project shall not cause permanent or
temporary loss of income. However, PAPs will be compensated with cash for disturbance
as a consequence of the temporary loss of access to their businesses or homes. For the
purpose of this ARAP, it has been assumed that 26 working days shall be enough time
required for completion of specific portions of civil works on drainage basins that impact
each individual PAP.

Cut – off Date
The cut of date for determining eligibility for compensation and resettlement assistance
was slated from 28th June 2016.

                                   CHAPTER ONE

1.0     Introduction

Considering the intensifying impact of floods and urgent need for an
integrated and long-term solution to flooding in the city, the Oyo State
Government has requested the World Bank's support to finance a flood
management project in Ibadan. So far, the responses to the past flooding
events have been piecemeal; mainly focusing on alleviating immediate and
short-term needs such as rebuilding of destroyed assets.

However, in line with the global focus on disaster prevention following
Hyogo Framework of Action, the Oyo State Government has realized the
importance of moving from merely responding to pro-actively managing
and preventing flood risk in the city. The Global Facility for Disaster
Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR)’s support following 2011 floods, primarily
a small training and awareness exercise, also recommended the need for
urban flood risk assessment and an urban flood risk management program.
Building on these recommendations, the Government of Nigeria and Oyo
State Government requested the World Bank's support to finance a flood
management project in Ibadan.

Consequently, the World Bank is supporting the Oyo State Government to
implement the Ibadan Urban Flood Management project (IUFMP) that aims
at developing a long-term flood risk management framework by initiating
risk assessment, community awareness, and providing enough flexibility in
the project design to make changes based on learning. The project also
supports capacity building for flood risk management in the city of Ibadan.
It reinforces Oyo State government’s early warning and response
capabilities and leverages existing World Bank projects in Oyo State in
support of the IUFMP.


This ARAP has been carried out by identifying the primary set of activities
that underpin the accomplishment of the specific deliverables in the scope
of work, to ensure achievement of project outcomes as defined in the
Terms of Reference (TOR) for this project.


1.1     Conditions for Preparation of ARAP

This intervention of the Ibadan Urban Flood Management Project (IUFMP)
at Omiri Culvert Priority Site has triggered the OP 4.12 policy from the social

                                                                                     1
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


issues identified. A review of the safeguard instruments revealed that the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) for the IUFMP identifies social
impacts arising from the culvert rehabilitation and civil works will not
necessarily lead to physical displacement.
The RPF instrument earlier prepared provides a holistic framework for
compensation of various categories of project-affected persons (PAP’s),
which can include property owners, residential, and business tenants,
encroachers and squatters.
Fundamentally, the Involuntary Resettlement policy of The World Bank has
a provision for the preparation of an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan
(instead of a Resettlement Action Plan-ARAP) if there is no physical and
economic displacement and less than ten percent of their assets are lost or
fewer than 200 people displaced during the course of the project.


1.2     Project Rationale

As part of the credit agreement with the World Bank, projects supported by
Bank’s funding are usually subjected to safeguard screening to determine
the environmental and social risk before approval. For this IUFMP sub-
project, two World Bank Operational Policies are triggered, namely the
(OP/BP 4.01, Environmental Assessment and OP/BP 4.12, Involuntary
Resettlement).

This ARAP is expected to establish the overall principles of identifying and
addressing social impacts of the project related to physical and economic
displacement resulting to the relocation or loss of shelter; loss of assets or
access to assets; loss of source of income and implementation, where
affected.


1.3     Project Objectives

The objective of this Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) is to
identify and assess the human impact of the proposed works at the priority
site as described above, and to prepare an Action Plan to be implemented
in coordination with the civil works in line with World Bank Policy (4.12) on
involuntary resettlement and Nigeria policies and laws.

Specifically, this ARAP shall determine the following:
 Decide issues of Involuntary resettlement that may lead to loss of
   income, assets, and community ties that, especially among the poor, can
   be essential for survival and well-being, or in extreme cases, involuntary

                                                                                     2
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


      resettlement can lead to the dissolution of families, impoverishments
      and health problems.

 The Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan will identify the project
  affected persons (PAPs), engage them in participatory discussions
  regarding the plan and formulating a plan of action to adequately
  compensate people for their losses.

 To prepare this ARAP consistent in policy and context to the laws,
  regulations, and procedures adopted by the Government of country, the
  World Bank’s operational policy on involuntary resettlement (OP 4.12)
  covering displacement, resettlement, and livelihood restoration. This
  ARAP will address the following:
     o Conduct of consultations with identified project affected persons
        (PAPs), based on a census of the affected sites;
     o Establish local decision making bodies who will be part of ARAP
        implementation of valuation and compensation approaches;
     o Develop in a participatory manner the proposed grievance
        redress mechanism to be covered in the ARAP


1.4      Scope of Work

This ARAP shall address the following areas as established in the TOR:

Description of the project: General description of the affected areas.

Potential Impacts: Identification of the:
(i) Components or activities that require resettlement or restriction of
access;
(ii) Zone of impact of components or activities;
(iii) Alternatives considered to avoid or minimize resettlement or restricted
access; and
(iv) Mechanisms established to minimize resettlement, displacement, and
restricted access, to the extent possible, during project implementation.

Objectives: The main objective of the resettlement program as these apply
to IUFMP shall be described in relation to the project.

Socio-economic studies: The findings of socio-economic studies to be
conducted with the involvement of potentially affected people will be
needed. These generally include the results of a census of the PAPs
covering:


                                                                                     3

        to measure impacts (or changes) in their livelihood and living
        conditions.

Legal Framework: The analysis of the legal and institutional framework in
Nigeria should cover the following:
(i) Scope of existing land and property laws governing resources, including
      state-owned lands under eminent domain and the nature of
      compensation associated with valuation methodologies; land market;
      mode and timing of payments;

criteria for determining their eligibility for compensation and other
resettlement assistance, including relevant cut-off dates.

Valuation of and compensation for losses: The methodology to be used for
valuing losses, or damages, for the purpose of determining their
replacement costs; and a description of the proposed types and levels of
compensation consistent with national and local laws and measures, as
necessary, to ensure that these are based on acceptable values (e.g. market
rates).

Resettlement Measures: A description of the compensation and other
resettlement measures that will assist each category of eligible PAPs to
achieve the resettlement objectives. Aside from compensation, these
measures should include programs for livelihood restoration, grievance
mechanisms, consultations, and disclosure of information.

Site selection, site preparation, and relocation: If a resettlement site is an
option, describe the alternative relocation sites as follows:

(i)   Institutional and technical arrangements for identifying and preparing
      relocation sites, whether rural or urban, for which a combination of

Community Participation: Consistent with the World Bank’s policy on
consultation and disclosure, a strategy for consultation with the
participation of PAPs and host communities, shall include:

(i)   Description of the strategy for consultation with and participation of
      PAPs and hosts in the design and implementation of resettlement
      activities;
(ii) Summary of the consultations and how PAPs views were taken into
      account in preparing the resettlement plan; and
(iii) Review of resettlement alternatives presented and the choices made by
      PAPs regarding options available to them, including choices related to
      forms of compensation and resettlement assistance, to relocating as
      individual families or as parts of pre-existing communities or kinship
      groups, to sustaining existing patterns of group organization, and to
      retaining access to cultural property (e.g. places of worship, pilgrimage
      centers, cemeteries); and
(iv) Arrangements on how PAPs can communicate their concerns to project
      authorities throughout planning and implementation, and measures to
      ensure that vulnerable groups (including indigenous peoples, ethnic
      minorities, landless, children and youth, and women) are adequately
      represented.

The consultations shall cover measures to mitigate the impact of
resettlement on any host communities, including:

     Arrangements for prompt tendering of any payment due the hosts for
      land or other assets provided to PAPs;
     Conflict resolution involving PAPs and other stakeholders; and
     Livelihood restoration and any additional services.

Grievance procedures: The ARAP shall provide mechanisms for ensuring that
an affordable and accessible procedure is in place for third-party settlement
of disputes arising from resettlement. These mechanisms should take into
account the availability of judicial and legal services, as well as community
and traditional dispute settlement mechanisms.

ARAP implementation responsibilities: The ARAP should be clear about the
implementation responsibilities of various agencies, offices and local
representatives. These responsibilities should cover (i) delivery of ARAP
compensation and rehabilitation measures and provision of services; (ii)
appropriate coordination between agencies and jurisdictions involved in
ARAP implementation; and (iii) measures (including technical assistance)
needed to strengthen the implementing agencies’ capacities of


                                                                                     6
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


responsibility for managing facilities and services provided under the
project and for transferring to PAPs some responsibilities related to ARAP
components (e.g. community-based livelihood restoration; participatory
monitoring; etc.)

Implementation Schedule: An implementation schedule covering all ARAP
activities from preparation, implementation, and monitoring and evaluation
should be included. These should identify the target dates for delivery of
benefits to resettlers and hosts and a clearly defined closing date. The
schedule should indicate how the ARAP activities are linked to the
implementation of the overall project.

Costs and budget: The ARAP for the specific sub-projects should provide
detailed (itemized) cost estimates for all ARAP activities, including
allowances for inflation, population growth, and other contingencies;
timetable for expenditures; sources of funds; and arrangements for timely
flow of funds. These should include other fiduciary arrangements
consistent with the rest of the project governing financial management and
procurement.

Monitoring and evaluation: Arrangements for monitoring of ARAP activities
by the implementing agency, and the independent monitoring of these
activities, should be included in the ARAP section on monitoring and
evaluation. The final evaluation should be done by an independent monitor
or agency to measure ARAP outcomes and impacts on PAPs livelihood and
living conditions.

The World Bank has examples of performance monitoring indicators to
measure inputs, outputs, and outcomes for ARAP activities; involvement of
PAPS in the monitoring process; evaluation of the impact of ARAP activities
over a reasonable period after resettlement and compensation, and using
the results of ARAP impact monitoring to guide subsequent
implementation.

After completion of the review of the draft ARAP, including consultations
with PAPs and communities on the main finding of the ARAP, a final ARAP
will be disclosed by the implementing agency. During the review process,
the Consultant is expected to make the necessary changes to the ARAP.

1.5.    Project Area

The project area is the Omiri Culvert. The Omiri Culvert – Omiri (Omi River)
priority site is located in Egbeda Local Government Area. The site falls
within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y coordinates
N7.37441 and E3.9966 and at altitude 195msl.

Omiri River flowing through Adekola community is channeled by a
dilapidated culvert with no protective barriers on both sides of the culvert.

The area receives surface water (upstream) from Omi River and discharges
at Christ Power - Olode. Vegetation in the area is composed mainly of few
trees, high shrubs and grasses. However, the original vegetation has been
undergoing modifications due to urban expansions and human activities.
Diagram is shown below:




Fig 1. Sketch showing Omiri Priority Culvert




The proposed priority works are to include:
   (i) Replacement of the existing culvert with a larger capacity with
          preference given to providing a single opening to minimize the
          potential for debris blockage.
   (ii) Construction of appropriate bed scour (upstream and downstream)
          and side protection to prevent outflanking
   (iii) Construction of formal roadway approaches and associated
          drainage (for the full width of the floodplain). The ancillary
          drainage and upstream structures (see below) should be
          reviewed and where necessary replaced or removed.



                                                                                     8

1.6. Methodology of Study
In order to realize the goals and objectives of the Scope of Works of the
Terms of Reference (TOR’s), the following method was adopted:

 A desk review of background documentation and safeguard instruments
  such as the Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF),
  and the Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), while the land laws of
  Oyo State was also obtained to enable a proper understanding of
  project requirements as contained in the TOR. These documents
  offered more detailed background information on:

    o Land tenure, property, and transfer systems, including an inventory
      of common property natural resources from which people derive
      their livelihoods and sustenance, non-title-based usufruct systems
      (including fishing, grazing, or use of forest areas) governed by local
      recognized land allocation mechanisms, and any issues raised by
      different tenure systems in the sub project area;

    o Patterns of social interaction in the affected communities, including
      social support systems, and how they will be affected by the sub-
      project;

    o Public infrastructure and social services that will be affected; and
      social and cultural characteristics of displaced communities, and their
      host communities, including a description of formal and informal
      institutions. These may cover, for example, community
      organizations; cultural, social or ritual groups; and non-governmental
      organizations (NGOs) that may be relevant to the consultation
      strategy and to designing and implementing the resettlement
      activities

Subsequently, consultant proceeded to site on the 8th and 9th of June 2016
and carried out the following:




                                                                                     9
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


 A reconnaissance survey of the project area followed by site visits was
  carried out. Activities commenced with a boundary setting exercise and
  establishing a project corridor, to determine which people or assets has
  been affected by project. This was aimed at carrying out an on the spot
  general assessment of the projects impact on the people, a necessary
  pre-requisite to identifying Project Affected Persons (PAP’s).

 Commencement of the process of identification of the current
  occupants of the affected area or assets as a basis for design of the
  ARAP.

 Meeting with the IUFMP Project Coordinator (PC) and Project Livelihood
  Specialist and other key project staff/stakeholders on the 8th of June to
  set a date of for the Stakeholders Meeting for Omiri Community.

 The stakeholders meeting was held on Tuesday 14th of June 2016 and
  parties in attendance comprised of the IUFMP representatives such as
  the social safeguards specialist and the project engineers. Also in
  attendance were representatives from the Omiri community such as the
  landlords association, NGOs such as the Red Cross, and other residents
  from Omiri.


 Cutoff date was fixed for the 28th June 2016 for the purpose of which is
  to exclude subsequent inflows of people from eligibility for
  compensation and resettlement assistance.

Following the stakeholders’ meeting/public consultation, the following
were carried out:

    o Gathering of information directly from PAPs on issues relating to the
      project implementation. Consultations that will be held shall
      generally be in the form of community engagements through Focus
      Group Discussions and Key Informant Interviews, which shall be
      carried out with the objective of identifying various categories of
      PAPs (property owners, residential and business tenants,
      encroachers and squatters) according to the Entitlement Matrix of
      the RPF document




                                                                                     10
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


    o Collection of primary data, using questionnaire administration to
      undertake a proper enumeration or census of the PAP’s, and to
      determine standard characteristics of affected persons or
      households, including a description of production systems, labor,
      and household organization; and baseline information on livelihoods
      (including, as relevant, production levels and income derived from
      both formal and informal economic activities) and standards of living
      (including health status) of the PAPs. Also, this shall enable the
      assessment of:

(vi)           Magnitude of the expected loss, total or partial, of assets, and
       the extent of displacement, physical or economic;
(vii)          Information on vulnerable groups or persons, for whom
       special provisions may have to be made; and
(viii)         Provisions to update information on the displaced people’s
       livelihoods and standards of living at regular intervals so that the
       latest information is available at the time of their displacement, and
       to measure impacts (or changes) in their livelihood and living
       conditions.
(ix)           Socio-economic studies: The findings of socio-economic
       studies of the PAPs shall also be conducted.

 With the information gathered, the preparation of this abbreviated
  Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) was carried out that ensured the
  following issues were addressed:
  o                                Provide a definition of displaced persons
      and compensation eligibility criteria
  o                                Valuation of and compensation for
      losses
  o                                Provide a description of resettlement
      assistance and restoration of livelihood activities
  o                                Provide a detailed budget and
      implementation schedule
  o                                Provide description of provisions for
      redress of grievances
  o                                Provide a description of organizational
      responsibilities and,
  o                                Provide a framework for monitoring,
      evaluation and reporting




                                                                                     11

CHAPTER TWO
2.0. Institutional and Legal Framework for Involuntary Resettlement
2.1 World Bank Safeguard Policies
The World Bank has operational safeguard policies applying to various
development projects, which the bank is either implementing or funding.
The Bank’s safeguards policies include:
      OP 4.01 Environmental Assessment
      OP 4.04 Natural Habitats
      OP 4.09 Pest Management
      OP 4.10 Indigenous Peoples
      OP 4.11 Physical Cultural Resources
      OP 4.12 Involuntary Resettlement
      OP 4.36 Forests
      OP 4.37 Safety of Dams
      OP 7.50 Projects in International Waterways
      OP 7.60 Projects in Disputed Areas


2.1.1 World Bank Safeguard Policy- Involuntary Resettlement OP 4.12
This Policy lays emphasis on the preparation of Resettlement Action Plan
(ARAP) or an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for World Bank
funded projects that trigger involuntary resettlement.
The World Bank policy categorizes the project-affected persons (PAP’s) into
four major groups depending on the resettlement or compensation as:
   PAPs with legal rights of land use
   PAPs that are partially affected by the project
   PAPs without legal rights of land use; and
   PAPs losing businesses.


2.1.2. Displaced Persons (DPs)
Displaced persons are persons within the project area that are directly
affected in the following ways:
a) The involuntary taking of land resulting in:
(i) Relocation or loss of shelter;
(ii) Loss of assets or access to assets; or
(iii) Loss of income sources or means of livelihood, whether or not the
affected persons must move to another location; or

(b) The involuntary restriction of access to legally designated parks and
protected areas resulting in adverse impacts on the livelihoods of the
displaced persons.
                                                                                     12
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


2.1.3. Criteria for Eligibility

Displaced persons may be classified in one of the following three groups, as
categories A, B & C. They are:
(a) Those who have formal legal rights to land (including customary and
traditional rights recognized under the laws of the country);
(b) Those who do not have formal legal rights to land at the time the
census begins but have a claim to such land or assets--provided that such
claims are recognized under the laws of the country or become
recognized through a process identified in the resettlement plan
(c) Those who have no recognizable legal right or claim to the land they are
occupying.
2.2 Legal Framework
2.2.1 Nigerian Land Use Act of 1978
The act vested all land in the hands of Governors, through relevant
sections. According to the Land Use Act of 1978, the administration of land
is categorized into urban land and non-urban land. Urban land is under the
control and management of Governor of each State and non- urban land, is
under the control and management of Local Government. The Act specifies
that the State or Local Government should pay compensation to the owner
or occupier base on the improvement on the land. Thus, the Act has no
provision for resettling people without legal rights.

This ARAP for Omiri Culvert Priority Site of the IUFMP has been conducted
in accordance with the World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12). The policy
indicate the best practice approach for comp ensation of the PAP’s before
the commencement of the project. Wherever there is conflict between
Nigerian or Oyo State Laws and the World Bank Policy, this World Bank
Resettlement policy (OP4.12) on Involuntary Resettlement shall take
precedence.




                                                                                     13

                                    CHAPTER THREE


3.0 Description of Project Environment

The Omiri culvert priority site of the IUFMP is located in Ibadan, it is
situated in southwestern Nigeria and it’s the capital of Oyo State. Ibadan is
centered about latitude 7o 25I North and longitude 3o 5IEast and is located
approximately 145 km north of Lagos. It is situated close to the boundary
between forest and grassland, which makes it a melting point for people
and products of both the forests and grassland areas. Ibadan is regarded as
the largest indigenous city in tropical Africa.

Since it’s founding in the 1800s, Ibadan has played a prominent role for
people living in the southwest of Nigeria. (Map of Nigeria showing position
of Oyo State, with Ibadan as the State Capital is presented in plate 3.1.) It
was the capital of the old Western Region, when Nigeria had only three
regions. The territory of the old Western Region has since been divided into
seven states and a sizeable part of the present Lagos State belonged to the
old Western Region. Location of the priority site in Ibadan is contained in
Plate 3.2.

3.1 Baseline Socio-economic conditions

Omiri Culvert Priority site is located along Adekola road in the Egbeda LGA
of Ibadan in Oyo State, which comprises 11 wards and this project area falls
within the Oyo Central senatorial district of the State.

Egbeda local government area is further subdivided into 11 wards: Erunmu,
Ayede/Alugbo/Koloko,         OwoBaale/Kasumu,           Olodan/Ajiwogbo,
Olodo/Kumapayi I, Olodo II, Olodo III, Osegere/Awaye, Egbeda,
Olode/Alakia, and Olubadan Estate.


3.1.1. Population and Housing Patterns
According to Wikipedia, Egbeda is a Local Government Area in Oyo State,
Nigeria. Its headquarters are in the town of Egbeda. The housing patterns
observed especially along the road up to and beyond the priority site
showed that majority of the houses in the project area are block buildings.
The Egbeda LGA has an area of 191 km² and a population of 281,573 at the
2006 census.

3.2     Identification of Project Affected Persons (PAPs)
Cutoff date of 28th June 2016 was to ensure that during the identification of
the PAPs there is an exclusion of subsequent inflows of people from
eligibility for compensation and resettlement assistance.

Consequently, the approach to identifying the PAP’s, adopted the following
outline:
        A revised census that enumerates project affected persons
         (PAPs) in comparison with the previously prepared ARAP and
         registers them according to locations
        An inventory and categorization of the PAPs and assets to be
         affected;
        Socio-economic assessment of PAPs;
        Analysis of surveys and studies to establish compensation
         parameters, to design appropriate income restoration,
         monitoring, grievance redress mechanism and sustainable
         development initiatives;
        Assessment of the compensation for the impact of the project;
        Identify baseline monitoring indicators;

Right of Way (ROW) Considerations
The right of way (ROW) has been given as 7.3m for road carriageway with
1m on each side for the drainage considerations. Furthermore, the corridor
accommodates the rehabilitation of road up to 250m before and after the
Omiri culvert.
3.3 Discussion of Project Impacts
The project has both positive and negative impacts. The positive impacts
are:improved commerce due to the influx of workers into project area, which
would also create additional job opportunities for women and youths,
improved quality of life, improved drainage, thereby eliminating the civil
problems causing flooding events. However, focus here is more on the adverse
impacts, which must be mitigated to ensure project sustainability.
3.3.1. Negative impacts in the Project Area
The Omiri culvert civil works will generally be performed within the existing
right-of-way, while the drainage works may require that some minor
realignment be carried out along the existing road corridor. The matrix of
categorization of inventory of affected assets is shown in Table 3.1.

3.3.2 Impact Avoidance Measures Undertaken
With the identification of adverse impacts above road re-alignment is
necessary to minimize the negative impacts on people and assets, while
selection of alternative route and reduction of road width was also given
due consideration, where necessary. However, major where impact

                                                                                         17
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


avoidance will affect the integrity of the work, consultations were carried
out with stakeholders and affected persons to ensure appropriate
mitigation measures. The measures undertaken towards mitigation are;

3.3.3. Mitigation Measures
       • Maintaining the alignment of the previous road to avoid major
           damage
       • Consider the safe use of heavy equipment or alternately use of
           lighter equipment in sensitive areas
       • Ensuring adequate notice/notification for potential blockages of
           routes and access.
       • Create alternative access road
       • Create awareness and conduct pre-construction meetings to
           inform road users about temporary changes in access routes.
       • Create awareness among construction workers when civil works
           commence on HIV/AIDS and use of condoms.

3.4. Categories of Project Affected Persons (PAPs)
According to Chapter Four of the RPF, categories of PAPs are as follows:
1.     Affected Individual – An individual who suffers loss of assets or
investments, land and property and/or access to natural and/or economical
resources as a result of the project activities and to whom compensation is
due. For example, person who has built a structure (or has a structure) on
land that has been demarcated as a suitable site that may be affected by
the reconstruction of drainage channels and therefore may be needed by a
sub project activity.

2.     Affected Household – A household is affected if one or more of its
members is affected by sub project activities, either by loss of property,
loss of access or otherwise affected in any way by project activities. This
provides for:
       (a) Any members in the households, men, women, children,
           dependent relatives and friends, tenants
       (b) Vulnerable individuals
       (c) Members of households who cannot reside together because of
           cultural rules, but who depend on one another for their daily
           existence
       (d) Members of households who may not eat together but provide
           housekeeping, or reproductive services critical to the family’s
           maintenance, and
       (e) Other vulnerable group members who cannot participate for
           physical or cultural reasons in production, consumption, or co-
           residence.
                                                                                     18
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP



In local cultures, members of production, consumption, and co-resident
groups form overlapping, often incongruent sets of people who may
exchange domestic or farming services on a regular basis even though
living separately.

Compensation will not be limited to people who live together in a co-
resident group, since this might leave out people whose labor contributions
are critical to the functioning of the “household”. For example, among
polygamous settings, each wife has her own home.

3. Vulnerable Households – Vulnerable households could be owners of
compound walls or shops/room that will be partially demolished during sub
project activities. Partial demolition of houses will lead to congestion and
possible voluntary termination of tenancy. These negative impacts of
partial demolition will deprive landlords of important rent income. Other
vulnerable groups are:

(a) Elderly – With age limiting them in terms of productivity, they will have
    cash or in-kind replacements to exchange. For future production they
    need access to only a small parcel of land. What would damage their
    economic viability is resettlement that separates them from the person
    or household on whom they depend for their support. The definition of
    household by including dependents avoids this.

(b) Women including unmarried women and widows – may depend on
    husbands, sons, brothers or others for support. In many cases too,
    women are the main breadwinners in their household. They need
    relatively easy access to health service facilities, as mothers and wives.
    Some women live in a polygamous situation in Nigeria and this requires
    special attention, as women are central to the stability of the household.
    For example, where a woman uses the land being acquired with no
    formal rights to it or a woman who is dependent on a man other than
    her husband for her primary income. These women should not be
    resettled in a way that separates them from their households as the
    very survival of their households may depend on them. Their
    compensation must take into account all these factors.

(c) Income related poverty – that is the poorest households are also
    vulnerable.

(d) Orphans-Those without parents and are under aged



                                                                                     19
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


(e) The infirmed/ill- Those suffering one disability or another serious illness.

Special attention would be paid to these groups by identifying their needs
from the socio-economic and baseline study so that (i) they are individually
consulted and given the opportunity (i.e. not left out) to participate in the
project activities, (ii) that their resettlement and compensation is designed
to improve their pre-project livelihood (iii) special attention is paid to
monitor them to ensure that their pre-project livelihood is indeed improved
upon (iv) they are given technical and financial assistance if they wish to
make use of the grievance mechanisms of the project and (v) decisions
concerning them are made in the shortest possible time.

The major impact of this civil works project on the PAPs is in the
interruption of their access. Categories of PAP’s are shown in Table 3.2.

Housing costs in the Omiri priority culvert area ranges from a thousand
naira for accommodation to three and a half thousand naira every month
and the highest proportion of twenty seven percent of PAPs pay a rent of
between a thousand six hundred and two thousand naira, monthly. Other
proportions are as shown in the pie chart above.
3.5. Grievance and Appeals Procedure

The main goal of having in place a grievance and appeals procedure is
fundamentally to ensure a system is in place to respond to complaints or
grievances from PAP’s. These shall be implemented through the Grievance
Redress Mechanism.
3.5.1 Grievance Redress Mechanisms (GRM)

All attempts would be made to settle grievances and this will be community
based. Those seeking redress and wishing to state grievances would do so
by first notifying their traditional ruler or the local chief representing them
in the traditional ruling council or the community head. He/she should also
send a copy of his petition to the administrative head of their respective
local governments, while the GRM should allow for illiterate PAPs to be
able to report grievances orally and in their local languages. Also, the
mechanism should include complaint boxes and toll free numbers where
possible that allows PAPs to freely call the project GRM officer to report
complaints. It should also include proper documentation in logbooks, which
in turn is monitored and reported periodically to the Bank .

After the report, the traditional council with representatives of CDA and
CDCs, to be referred to as Resettlement and Compensation Committee, will
meet and consider the validity of the claim. If in their judgment the claim is
valid, they will then consult with the PMU, the Federal and State Ministry of

                                                                                     25
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


Environment and FMWR, Oyo State Ministry of Water Resources and other
records to further determine claims validity. If valid, the community
leader(s) and PMU will notify the complainant and s/he will be settled.
Unresolved issues are thereafter referred to the local and state courts.

                                Pictoral Depiction of Process


Commonly, contentions of omissions and other displeasures may arise
during the ARAP implementation process. Typical complaints that arise
include:
     PAP’s not enlisted;
     Losses not identified correctly;
     Inadequate assistance or not consistent with the entitlement matrix;
     Dispute about ownership;
     Delay in disbursement of assistance and
     Improper distribution of assistance

     A Resettlement Action Plan must provide an avenue for complaints,
     which provides simple, accessible, prompt, just and fair resolution of
     grievances, preferably at local and state levels.

     A sequence of four steps has been prepared in this Grievance Redress
     Mechanism (GRM) to give aggrieved PAPs easy access to redress. The
     4- step sequence is further elaborated as follows:




                                                                                          26
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


Step 1: Referral to GRC Secretary
Complaints arising from site /community level are directed to the secretary
of the Site-Community GRC. Normally, issues of lack of information are
resolved by the GRC secretary at this stage. However, if further
confirmations are required, then the secretary will arrange for a meeting
with the chairman and a minimum of two other members of the
Community GRC within 7 days. However, if the issue goes beyond
correcting misinformation and requires arbitration, the Community GRC
secretary refers straight to the Community Mediation Session, involving the
full GRC.

Step 2: GRC Mediation Session
Step 2 is the treatment of the case by the Community GRC and referral to
the IUFMP within 20 days if the case is not resolved. The GRC mediation
sessions are expected to resolve issues of exclusion claims, opportunities
for employment and other early grievances before they escalate into full
confrontation.

Steps 3: Referral to IUFMP Team
Typical cases that go beyond the GRC could involve actions for (i)
regulation of contractors’ activities and (ii) resettlement and compensation
for damages by the IUFMP. Steps 3 take place within government/project
jurisdiction to get approvals and quick action for regulation of contractors’
activities and arrangements for resettlement and compensation for
damages by the IUFMP. The involvement of the Project PC, Special Advisers
and members of the Board of Trustees could be necessary when there is a
need to get quick approvals and enforce contractor compliance in
situations of contractor impunity and untouchability.

Step 4: Oyo State Mediation Centre (OYMC)
Step 4 involves dispute resolution at the Oyo Mediation Centre. These are
usually cases of (i) land dispute that could not be settled locally; (ii)
reparation and compensation for physical abuses and harassment.
The last resort is referral to the law court. However, chances of shortening
these steps are as follows:

         Complainants could go straight to register a case at the
          Community Mediation Session, involving the full GRC
         The company secretary would only invest time in preliminary
          steps 1 activity, if the case is classified as a misinformation case
          that can be settled at that level. If not, it is referred to (i) the GRC
          if it is a community based arbitration case, or (ii) straight to the
          IUFMP Team if it requires government or company correction.

                                                                                     27

Grievance Redress Services
Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected
by a WBG supported program, may submit complaints to existing program-
level grievance redress mechanisms or the WBG‘s Grievance Redress
Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly
reviewed in order to address program-related concerns.

The Grievance Redress Service (GRS) ensures that complaints are being
promptly reviewed and addressed by the responsible units in the World
Bank.   The objective is to make the Bank more accessible for project
affected communities and to help ensure faster and better resolution of
project-related complaints.


World Bank Inspection Panel
Program affected communities and individuals may also submit their
complaint to the WBG‘s independent Inspection Panel, which determines
whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WBG non-compliance
with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time
after concerns have been brought directly to the WBG‘s attention, and
WBG Management has been given an opportunity to respond.

The Inspection Panel is the World Bank’s independent complaints
mechanism. Its mandate is to ensure that the voices of people who may be
adversely affected by Bank-financed projects are heard, and to
promote accountability at the Bank. The Inspection Panel is a non-judicial
body that acts independently, impartially and objectively in evaluating the
process followed by the Bank. The Panel does not investigate unless it
receives a formal, written Request for Inspection.

                                     CHAPTER FOUR
8.0      Objectives of Consultation

Public consultation is an important tool in design of an ARAP as it aligns the
plan with the social development philosophy, which situates people at the
center of development. Therefore, this tool was used amongst other things
to identify the population affected by the project. It also served the
purpose of creating an enabling environment for input and feedback
mechanism among the stakeholders. The principal outcome of the public
consultation process was:

       The identification of PAPs;
       Identification of concerns of the affected persons and community;
       Communication of project objective to the concerned communities,
        and
       Identification of indicators for measuring performance of the ARAP
        implementation based on the socio-economic peculiarities of the
        affected project communities.


4.1      Scope of the Consultation Meeting

The following were taken into full account:

       Discussions highlighted the fact that the project will be a civil works
        and culvert construction project that will on the also install 1x1m
        drainage basins of 25om before and after the culvert and that due to
        the magnitude of the project, there will be foreseeable involuntary
        resettlement concerns, especially on both the people and structures
        during the civil works.
       That the project aims at impacting more positively on the
        environment and social conditions, and will devise suitable,
        practicable mitigation measures through an ARAP to reduce or
        eliminate negative impacts on the people
       That positive impact of sub-project activities will be enhanced; and
       The priority concerns raised by project-affected persons (PAPs) and
        other relevant stakeholders are taken into account and incorporated
        in project planning.

                                         2.   Trust issues have been identified as a barrier
                                              to progress on this project due to years of
                                              unfulfilled promises of construction of
                                              affected culvert/bridge. Hence there is need
                                              to build trust across project sites.
                                         3.   Communities had utilized self-galvanized
                                              efforts in reducing adverse impacts of the
                                              sites on their livelihoods through periodic
                                              contributions.
                                         4.   There was a suggestion that earlier attempts
                                              on the project suffered failures due to quality
                                              defects. The community representatives will
                                              not want quality compromised on this project.
                                         5.   Communities request a right to grievance and
                                              petitions.
                                         6.   There was demand for provision of formal
                                              garbage and sewage disposal sites to stop
                                              dumping of waste in rivers.
                                         7.   Communities demand for alternative routes
                                              during construction of the new bridge/road
                                              infrastructure.

 Clarifications,   Questions    and Clarifications to Questions
 concerns                           1. On project quality, the project engineer responded
                                    by assuring those in attendance of the durability of
                                    the project to be constructed. He stated that the
                                    starting time depends on the completion of necessary
                                    studies, which he believes would be soon.
                                    2. On the suggestion of previous likelihood of fraud,
                                    there was a re-assurance that this project will be
                                    transparently handled while the local government
                                    shall also play relevant roles in the project execution.

 Recommendations & Remarks           It is expected that the issues raised by stakeholders
                                     will be taken into consideration during the
                                     implementation of this project. Issues of trust,
                                     corruption    and     poor    communication      from
                                     government to the beneficiary of projects need to be
                                     addressed. Trust can be built when communities see
                                     execution of projects within the timeframe stipulated
                                     and when they are involved in the conception,
                                     planning and execution. This is essential for
                                     projection development and implementation and
                                     gives the feeling of ownership of projects to
                                     community. It also has implication for security.


4.3.    Disclosure of ARAP

The ARAP has been prepared in consultation with the IUFMP and in
conjunction with the Omiri Community along Adekola road. Following
completion of this ARAP, ARAP shall be submitted through the PMU of the
IUFMP for the review and clearance by the World Bank, upon which it will
be disclosed at the National and local levels by the IUFMP, and this process
shall include display at the FMEnv Zonal Office in Ibadan and on the World
Bank website by the World Bank, to ensure compliance with relevant
legislations and OP4.12.

The final version of the ARAP at the evidence of the in-country disclosure
should be provided to the World Bank for disclosure on the World Bank
website to ensure compliance with relevant legislation and OP 4.12.

                                   CHAPTER FIVE

5.1 Nigerian Land Use Act of 1978

The act vested all land in the hands of Governors, through relevant
sections. According to the Land Use Act of 1978, the administration of land
is categorized into urban land and non-urban land. Urban land is under the
control and management of Governor of each State and non- urban land, is
under the control and management of Local Government. The Act specifies
that the State or Local Government should pay compensation to the owner
or occupier base on the improvement on the land. Thus, the Act has no
provision for resettling people without legal rights.


5.2 Comparison between the Land Use Act of 1978 and World Bank
Safeguard policy

The Land Use Act of 1978 provides for payment of compensation based on
right of ownership. This is also the same position at Adamawa State level in
the Ministry of Lands and Housing. The World Bank policy state that,
people are entitled to certain form of compensation whether or not they
have legal document if they occupy the land and are available to present
their claims on or before a cut-off date.




                                                                                     35

Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


This ARAP for the IUFMP prioritized culverts project for Omiri has been
conducted in line with the World Bank Operational Policy (OP 4.12). The
policy indicates the best practice approach for compensation of the PAP’s
before the commencement of the project. Wherever there is conflict
between Nigerian or Adamawa State Laws and the World Bank Policy, this
World Bank Resettlement Policy (OP4.12) shall take precedence.
5.3     Entitlement Policy and Matrix

The Entitlement Policy and Matrix as stated in the IUFMP Resettlement
Policy Framework considers the magnitude of the project and categories of
PAPs affected, and compensation, as shown in table 5.2.

6.1.      Eligibility

Under the WB's OP 4.12, PAPs are defined as those who are affected by
project activities, which result in:

           Relocation or loss of shelter
           Loss of assets or access to assets;
           Loss of income source, business or means of livelihood, whether or
       not affected - person must move to another location

The PAPs covered under a) and b) above are to be provided compensation
for the land they lost, and other assistance in accordance with the policy.
Persons covered under c) above are to be provided with resettlement
assistance in lieu of compensation for the land they occupy, and other
assistance, as necessary, to achieve the objectives set out in this policy, if
they occupy the project area prior to a cut-off date established by the
participating state utilities in close consultation with the potential PAPs and
the respective state environmental agencies and acceptable to the Bank.
Persons who encroach on the area after the cut-off date are not entitled to
compensation or any other form of resettlement assistance. All persons
included in a), b) or c) above are to be provided with compensation for loss
of assets other than land.

Therefore, it is clear that all project affected persons irrespective of their
status or whether they have formal titles, legal rights or not, squatters or
otherwise encroaching illegally on land, are eligible for some kind of
assistance if they occupied the land before the entitlement cut-off date.
Persons who encroach on the area after the socio-economic study (census
and valuation) are not eligible for compensation or any form of
resettlement assistance.

The sub projects likely impacts and their mitigating measures have been
discussed extensively in the ESMF. Within the context of the IUFMP, the
eligibility matrix next page reflects sub project activities likely to trigger OP
4.12.

6.1.1. Entitlement
The design features of the construction work that will be carried out on the
priority culvert projects show that the portion of the land to be used during
the civil works will follow the existing road and culvert infrastructure. Also,
the land is owned by either the Oyo State Government or by the community
benefiting from the project and subsequent upon the planned civil works
on the priority culverts, the ownership of the land reverts to the community
in which these roads are located once project is completed.
Road alignment will be carried out in portions or areas, where the drainage
will compromise initial road carriageway considerations in the design and
this will ensure minimum land take concerns on the project. The
entitlement matrix for this project is shown in table 6.1.

(ROW) of the road corridor and those whose fences, trading tables, kiosks
and balconies intercept the ROW of the project.
In view of this consideration, PAPs will not be entitled to land resettlement
or compensation as they have originally encroached on the statutory
setback portion of 10ft from the road drainage/carriageway.

As a result, in view of the resettlement measures considered in the
Eligibility Matrix, PAPs would be entitled to the following types of
compensation and rehabilitation measures:
Eligibility for Community Compensation
Communities permanently losing land and/or access to assets and or
resources under customary rights will be eligible for compensation and
example of community compensation could include those for public toilets,
market place, taxi parks, schools and health centers. The rationale for this is
to ensure that the pre-project socio-economic status of communities where
adversely impacted is also restored. The local community leaders will play a
crucial role in identifying users of land.

PAPs with Permanent Structures Affected
Compensation will be considered for the Loss of Structure or Business and
other assets (such as fences) of PAPs on the ROW of project corridor. The
compensation will be based on the approach presented in the
Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF) and the market price for restoring or
reconstructing/replacing such structures or assets as detailed in the RPF.
PAPs will be compensated for loss of livelihood income due to loss of
business days.

Disturbance allowance
The civil works that will be carried out on this project shall not cause
permanent or temporary loss of income. However, PAPs will be
compensated with cash for disturbance as a consequence of the temporary
loss of access to their businesses or homes. For the purpose of this ARAP, it
has been assumed that 26 working days shall be enough time required for
completion of specific portions of civil works on drainage basins that
impact each individual PAP.

PAPs with Moveable Structures
These include all the PAPs whose trading tables and goods are displayed
along the road thereby encroaching into the setback for the ROW. PAPs will
not be given financial assistance to shift-back from the ROW. This is only a
social responsibility measure to persuade PAPs to move backward. There



                                                                                     40
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


will be no income restoration compensation. However, compensation will
be offered for disturbance to access.


6.1.2. Eligibility
All PAPs that have been identified, irrespective of their status or whether
they have formal titles, legal rights or not, squatters or otherwise
encroaching illegally on land, are eligible for some kind of assistance if they
occupied the project area before the cut-off date. Persons who occupy the
area but were initially unavailable during the census and valuation have
been re-visited to gather information through proxies with a view of
ascertaining their eligibility status.

All persons residing, conducting activities or earning income within these
project affected areas on the last day of inventory of loss, which is the cut-
off date (28th of June 2016). To determine their eligibility, PAPs are classified
as follows:

      Person who have formal right to land (including customary and
  traditional rights recognized under Nigerian law);
      Persons with temporary or leased rights to use land; and Persons
  who do not have formal legal right to lands or other assets at the time
  of the census, but who have claim to such legal rights by virtue of
  occupation or use of those assets.
      Those who do not have the legal title to land but reside in the
  affected area before the cut-off-date will be compensated for properties
  such as houses and other investment on the land, but will not be
  compensated for the land.
 Planning permits, business operating licenses, and utility bills among
  others: unprocessed/unregistered formal legal documents will be
  established in the ARAP.

 PAPs with no formal or recognized legal rights-criteria for establishing
  non-formal, undocumented or unrecognized claims to eligibility shall be
  established paying particular attention to each situation and its
  peculiarities. Alternative means of proof of eligibility will include:

            o Affidavit signed by landlords and tenants; and
            o Witnessing or evidence by recognized traditional authority,
              customary heads, community elders, family heads and elders
              and the general community.




                                                                                     41
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


     These affected persons shall be provided and are expected to
      produce an individual reference number, which the SPIU will be send
      to the PAP’s through their mobile phone lines.
     Community leaders shall identify the affected persons that do not
      possess a mobile phone.
6.1.2.4.          Notification

All PAPs have been enumerated during the census carried out, which also
determined the type of assets affected by the project.

Owners of affected properties have been notified in several ways. These
included one on one notification during this survey, through the
stakeholders meeting held on the 14th of June 2016, by phone contact and
also during community engagements. A compensation valuation of all
affected properties was carried out to assess commensurable values.


6.2. Assets Valuation and Methodology

Assets valuation was guided by the World Bank Policy 4.12 on involuntary
resettlement has been carried out by utilizing the general principle adopted
in the formulation of the compensation valuation that lost income and
asset will be valued at their full replacement cost such that the PAPs should
experience no net loss and has been conducted using the current market
prices in this project area.
6.2.1. Valuation for Loss of Access

An assessment of the loss of access to business and residence is shown in
Table 6.2.

6.2.3. Valuation methodology for compensation

Land acquisition is not anticipated in this IUFMP Project for Omiri Priority
Site and as such land resettlement will not be carried out. Therefore,
valuation of assets for this project is concerned with compensation of loss
of assess to permanent/immoveable and temporal/moveable assets of
PAPs due to the project.

Replacement Cost Method
The Replacement Cost Method, which is used in estimating the value of the
property/structure, is based on the assumption that the capital value of an
existing development can be equated to the cost of reinstating the
development on the same plot at the current labor, material and other
incidental costs. The estimated value represents the cost of the property as
if new.

According to the RPF, in ensuring that during the project implementation,
PAPs will be provided full replacement cost of lost structures and other
impacted assets and are able to rebuild or replace their structures/assets
without difficulties. The valuation will estimate asset compensation rates
based on full replacement without depreciation.

Land Resettlement
Owners of land are provided with an area of land equivalent to their
displaced land. Land restoration should be in a location that has similar
value as the one displaced to the project. Compensation relating to land will
cover the market price of labor invested as well as the market price of the
land lost. Nonetheless, for this project there will be no land displacement.

Disturbance and Other Incidental Contingencies
Affected business premises, which will have to close shop or be relocated,
will be given compensation for loss of business time or assistance for
transportation.

Vulnerable & Marginalized Groups
The kind/cash assistance for vulnerable groups and PAPs in general shall be
administered by the proponent SPIU through the resettlement committee
in consultation with the PAPs. To ensure that disturbance allowance and
other ARAP recommended measures are effective all the articulated
resettlement measures will be carried out prior to the project
implementation.



                                                                                     43
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


Mitigation measure for the persons in the vulnerable groups identified is
that the payment for compensation shall be undertaken in the respective
houses of these vulnerable persons. Payment of compensation shall be
guided by table annex 6, while annex 2 contains picture identification of
PAPs met during the study.

6.2.4. Payment of Compensation

Compensation under this ARAP will be considered for land, assets or
livelihoods.

Compensation to Owners of Movable and Immovable Structures
The compensation for PAPs with movable and immovable structures has
taken into consideration the fact that the project has no impact on the
income loss, no loss of livelihoods, or assets and no temporary losses of
access.

Owners of immovable and movable structures will be paid compensation
by disturbance allowances for the impact of the civil works to businesses or
residences of PAPs and will be based on average cost of rent in the
community over the period for which this disturbance shall persist. Fences
that have been observed close to the drainage basins will be maintained
and care will be made to ensure they are not affected by ensuring road
alignment.

6.2.5. Entitlement Matrix

The RPF clearly articulates the basis of what is to be paid as compensation
by properly identifying the most suitable entitlement for all typical loss
categories that may be encountered on this project. Therefore, the
entitlement matrix presented in table 6.3 offers a framework for this ARAP
for bridging gaps between requirements under the Nigerian Law and the
World Bank Policy on Resettlement, OP.4.12.

Consequently, in order to bridge the gap between both requirements under
Nigeria Law and the World Bank OP4.12, it is emphasized that the higher of
the two standards/instruments (the more beneficial to the project affected
persons) should be adopted as it also satisfies the requirements of the
lesser standard.

 The entitlements, as the case may consist of replacement housing,
 replacement land, building lots, or cash compensation. Under the World
 Bank Policy, cash compensation is only appropriate when there is an active
 market in land or housing and where such assets are actually available for
 purchase.

 Communal rights to land and other assets are recognized. Clans, lineages
 and other community property have been subjected to the same
 procedures as for privately held land. In such cases, traditional law may be
 taken into account.

 Tenants may be granted resettlement entitlements along with owners or
 they may be given a subsidy to find a new rental property. Entitlements
 shall include transitional support such as moving expenses, assistance with
 food and childcare during a move and other needed support.

 All PAPs irrespective of their status, whether they have formal titles, legal
 rights or not, squatters or otherwise encroaching illegally on land, are
 eligible for some kind of assistance if they occupied the project area before
 the cut-off date.
 All persons residing, conducting activities or earning income within the
 project affected areas at the cut-off-date, which is the last day of inventory
 of loss will be entitled to compensation and resettlement assistance. To
 determine their eligibility, PAPs are classified as follows:

      Person who have formal right to land (including customary and
       traditional rights recognized under Nigerian Law
      Persons with temporary or leased rights to use land; and
      Persons who do not have formal legal right to lands or other assets
       at the time of the census, but who have claim to such legal rights by
       virtue of occupation or use of those assets.

                                                                                            46

     Businesses within the community

Those who do not have the legal title to land but reside in the affected area
before the cut-off-date will be compensated for properties such as houses
and other investment on the land, but will not be compensated for the
land.




                                                                                     47

                                  CHAPTER SEVEN
7.0     Monitoring and Evaluation

Monitoring and evaluation (M&E) activities under this ARAP shall ensure
that compensation, resettlement and development investments are on
track to achieve sustainable restoration and improvement in the welfare of
the affected people. Furthermore, M&E verifies that entitlements are
delivered promptly and complaints and grievances are followed up with
appropriate corrective action.
Monitoring will provide both a warning system for the project sponsor and
a channel for the affected persons to make known their needs and their
reactions to resettlement execution.
The objective for the monitoring plan is as follows:
        1) To alert project authorities as well as provide timely information
           about the success or otherwise of the Environment and Social
           Management process outlined in the ESMF. This is to enable
           continuous improvement to the process.

        2) To enable project authorities determine whether the mitigation
           measures designed into the PMU’s project activities (s ub
           projects) have been successful or otherwise. This is by indicating
           that the pre- project environment and social condition has been
           restored, improved upon or become worse than before and to
           determine what further mitigation measures may be required.

Consequently, the arrangementforin placeformonitoring will include both
internal and external monitoring. Internal monitoring, will involve
reporting by government officials and field consultants, community
participatory monitoring; while external monitoring, will involve NGOs and
journalists providing independent monitoring. Monthly monitoring plans
will be prepared by the PMU. Quarterly and annual reports will be
submitted to the Oyo State Ministry of Environment andWater Resources,
andtootherappropriateagencies.

All monitoring components will besubject to audit, internally by the PMU
and externallyby the Oyo State Ministry of Environment and Water
Resources, and the PMU at FMEnv. Each monitoring programme will follow
the established schedule; monitoring may be performed daily, weekly,
quarterly, semi-annually, annually, biennially, or continuously, depending
upon the resource, regulatory requirements for regulatory monitoring,
andtheproject-specific requirements for other monitoring.


                                                                                     48
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


Monitoring results will becompiledwhen due and communicated to the
Cabinet Department of Governor’s Office, Oyo State Ministry of
Environment and Water Resources, Oyo State Ministry of Physical Planning
and PMU as appropriate. Table below shows the variables to be monitored
routinely by the project during implementation of the resettlement issues.

Monitoring and Evaluation Unit responsibilities

The IUFMP PMU, through its monitoring and evaluation unit will be
responsible for:
 Monitoring the environment and social impacts and mitigation
  measures resulting from the action of their contractors, subcontractors,
  transporters, suppliers and all other third parties in the course of their
  duties under the subproject.

 Therefore, wherever environment and social impacts are attributable to
  their sub project activities the appropriate mitigation measures will
  apply consistent with the sub project ESMP, and SPIU would be
  responsible for monitoring and evaluating the and social impacts are
  attributable to their sub project activities

 Consistent with the ESMF, the Monitoring and Evaluation Officer, the
  Environmental and Social Safeguards Specialist attached to the PMU
  and their counterpart in the environment agencies would be responsible
  for periodically transferring the information compiled at the state level
  to the FMEnv so that it is alerted in a timely manner to any difficulties
  arising at the local level.


According to the RPF, indicators to monitor and evaluate the
implementation of resettlement and compensation plan are shown in table
7.1.




                                                                                     49

Monitoring Framework

It is normal that some compensation procedures and rates may require
revision at some time during the project cycle. The IUFMP, Oyo State
Ministry of Environment and Water Resources, Ministry of Women Affairs,
Local Governments and PMU at the FMEnv will implement changes through
the Change Management Process in the Monitoring and Evaluation manuals
of the project, which will require feedback from:

-       Indicators monitored by the Oyo state government to determine
        whether goals are being met, and
-       A grievance procedure for the local community to express
        dissatisfaction about implementation of compensation and
        resettlement.

Consequently, the M&E framework, including the performance indicators
for internal and output monitoring are provided in Table 7.2.

8.7      Capacity Building and Training Needs

The implementation of this ARAP implementation shall require that
personnel and stakeholders possess the appropriate capacity. This capacity
building plan has taken this into consideration in table 7.2 as follows:

Training Needs

Based on the public consultation, the capacity assessment of the
Resettlement Committee, Community Conflict/Grievance Redress
Committee and Beneficiary Technical Representative Team as well as the
community representatives and PAPs were carried out. The effective
functioning of the above mentioned is compromised by limited knowledge
on the ARAP process. Thus, knowledge barriers include:

       Limited knowledge on the principles of Resettlement Action Plan,
        Monitoring & Evaluation of ARAP Implementation, Conflict
        Management and Resolution in ARAP implementation as well as
        ARAPs implementation and monitoring.

Some of the other training needs for the responsible institutions are as
follows:

       Information gaps on the Beneficiary Technical Team and the
        Grievance Redress Mechanism will require launching of an effective
        awareness campaign to give publicity to the BF and GRM and
        knowledge of its functions. The target groups shall include affected
        communities, government agencies, and civil society organizations.

       Skill gaps of the mediators of the Oyo State Mediation Center shall
        require strengthening of capacity by training and retraining of
        mediators in logging and Information management systems through
        ICT


Budget on these training needs are identified in Table 8.2.




                                                                                     57

9.0     World Bank Grievance Redress Services & Inspection Panel
9.1     Grievance Redress Services

Communities and individuals who believe that they are adversely affected
by a WBG supported program, may submit complaints to existing program-
level grievance redress mechanisms or the WBG‘s Grievance Redress
Service (GRS). The GRS ensures that complaints received are promptly
reviewed in order to address program-related concerns.

The Grievance Redress Service (GRS) ensures that complaints are being
promptly reviewed and addressed by the responsible units in the World
Bank. The objective is to make the Bank more accessible for project
affected communities and to help ensure faster and better resolution of
project-related complaints.


9.1.1. Eligibility

Eligibility criteria for acceptance of grievances through the GRS include
complaints that are:

• Related to an active World Bank-supported project (IBRD or IDA)

• Filed by a person or community who believes they have been or may be
       adversely affected by a World Bank-Financed project.

• Filed by a bidder or potential bidder about the procurement process on a
       World Bank-financed contract. These complaints will be processed in
       line with Bank Procedure (BP) 11.00 (Annex D) and will not follow the
       GRS procedures. The identity of the complainant will be kept
       confidential if requested, but anonymous complaints will not be
       accepted.

9.1.2 Reporting Mechanism

• Complaints must be in writing and addressed to the World Bank
 Grievance Redress Service (GRS).

• Complaints will be accepted by email, fax, letter, and by hand delivery to
 the GRS at the World Bank Headquarters in Washington or World Bank
 CountryOffices.

9.2     World Bank Inspection Panel

Program affected communities and individuals may also submit their
complaint to the WBG‘s independent Inspection Panel, which determines
whether harm occurred, or could occur, as a result of WBG non-compliance
with its policies and procedures. Complaints may be submitted at any time
after concerns have been brought directly to the WBG‘s attention, and
WBG Management has been given an opportunity to respond.

The Inspection Panel is the World Bank’s independent complaints
mechanism. Its mandate is to ensure that the voices of people who may be
adversely affected by Bank-financed projects are heard, and to
promote accountability at the Bank. The Inspection Panel is a non-judicial
body that acts independently, impartially and objectively in evaluating the
process followed by the Bank. The Panel does not investigate unless it
receives a formal, written Request for Inspection.

The Panel has the power to review Bank-funded projects, and determine
whether Bank Management is following the World Bank' s operational
policies and procedures which were put in place in order to provide social
and economic benefits, and avoid harm to people or to the environment.

      project is located and who believe that, as a result of the Bank’s
      violation of its policies and procedures, their rights or interests have
      been, or are likely to be, adversely affected in a direct and material
      way. They may be an organization, association, society or other
      group of individuals;

                      PLANS (ARAPs) FOR TEN (10) PRIORITY SITES OF IUFMP
1.0  Background

The World Bank is supporting the Oyo State Government to implement the Ibadan Urban Flood Management
project (IUFMP) that aims at developing a long-term flood risk management framework by initiating risk
assessment, community awareness, and providing enough flexibility in the project design to make changes
based on learning. The project also supports capacity building for flood risk management in the city of
Ibadan. It reinforces Oyo State government’s early warning and response capabilities and leverages existing
World Bank projects in Oyo State in support of the IUFMP.

Specifically, the Bank’s support will finance some priority investments related to improving the infrastructure
of Ibadan City, especially those destroyed by August 26, 2011 floods. The Bank's support will help Ibadan
reduce flood risks, improve waste collection and treatment, while developing and improving the quality of
existing infrastructural assets.

The project would be designed to keep a good balance between urgent post disaster needs (dredging,
reconstruction of bridges, roads, etc.) and medium-to-long term needs (institutional support, upgrading
existing and building new infrastructure to upgrade services and mitigate future risks). Selected sub - projects
should comply with regional and local government plans, address critical issues described above to integrate
planning and operational aspects that maximize the benefits of infrastructure investments to the beneficiary
communities in the long run.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to “improve the capacity of Oyo State to manage flo od risk and
to respond effectively and promptly to flooding in the city of Ibadan”.

In Oyo State, IUFMP activities involve medium-sized civil works such as construction of infrastructure and/or
stabilization or rehabilitation in and around the Ibadan city. These could result in environmental and social
impacts thus triggering the World Bank’s Safeguard Policies including Environmental Assessment OP 4.01;
Involuntary Resettlement OP4.12; Natural Habitats OP 4.04; Physical Cultural Resources OP 4.11, and Safety of
Dams OP 4.37 and Public Disclosure OP 17.60.

The environmental and social safeguards concerns are being addressed through the national instrument
already prepared under the project: an Environmental and Social Management Framework (ESMF). This
framework instrument need to be translated into specific cost, measurable, and monitorable actions for
specific intervention sites through the preparation of site-specific management and action plans.

ESMF: In general, the ESMF specifies the procedures to be used for preparing, approving and implementing:

(i) Environmental and Social Assessments (ESIA) and or
(ii) Environmental and Social Management Plans (ESMPs) for individual civil works packages developed for
each project. ESMPs are essential elements for Category B projects.

RPF. The RPF applies when land acquisition leads to the temporary or permanent physical displacement of
persons, and/or loss of shelter, and /or loss of livelihoods and/or loss, denial or restriction of access to
economic resources due to project activities. It sets out the resettlement and compensation principles,
organizational arrangements and design criteria to be applied to meet the needs of project-affected people,
and specifies the contents of a Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for each package of
investments. A Resettlement Policy Framework (RPF), which serves as a practical tool during the programme
formulation, design, implementation and monitoring, was prepared for IUFMP which serves as a guide for
the present terms of reference.

2.0      SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES:
The specific objective is for the Consultant to assist Oyo State to undertake the necessary studies and
prepare an Environmental and Social Management Plan (ESMP) Reports; Environmental and Social Impact
Assessment (ESIA) Reports and Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans (ARAP) of the proposed sub-project
in compliance with the World Bank environmental, social safeguards policies and procedures as well as the

Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP

Oyo State Ministry of Environment and Habitat and the Federal Ministry of Environment guidelines and
procedures.

This Terms of Reference (TOR) is to request a consultancy firm with extensive experience and skill in the
preparation of the following Safeguard Instruments for the respective sites mentioned below:

2.1       Environmental and Social Management Plan Study Reports for:
     I.   Omiri Culvert,Omiri;
    II.   Olorungunwa Culvert Poat Area;
   III.   Maje River culvert Iid- Mango Road;
   IV.    Foworogi Culvert, Egbeda Tuba;
    V.    Elere River Culvert, Egbada Tuba;
   VI.    Ebenezery Culvert, Alakia Isebo and
  VII.    Alaro Culv ert, 7-Up Road.

2.2       Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) for:
    I.    Ogbere Moradeyo;
   II.    Believers Stream Odo Ona Elewe and
  III.    Alaro Poly Road – Sango – Eleyele Road

2.3       Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plans for:
    I.    Alaro Poly Road – Sango – Eleyele Road;
   II.    Omiri Culvert,Omiri and
  III.    Believers Stream Odo Ona Elewe.

The Terms of Reference (TOR) define the scope of work and core tasks to be assigned to the Consultant. The
Consultant is expected to make reference to the feasibility study and designs of the proposed bridge/culverts
to be constructed from the Project Implementation Unit (PIU).

3.0       GOAL OF THE WORK
The proposed rehabilitation and stabilization of the hydraulic structures in these priority sites mentioned
above will reverse the current trend as much as possible and preserve the by-pass that is being degraded by
the flooding pattern in those areas such that the proposed structure can cope with recurrent flood events for
several years.
The reconstruction of the bridge, culvert and road approaches is classified as category “A” or category “B”
projects according to the World Bank categorization and a category I or II projects according to the FMEnv
categorization. Thus, it will require an Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) or Environmental
and Social Management Plan (ESMP) respectively.

From the foregoing, the significant impacts that are likely to occur from the Category A projects are
sensitive, diverse and unprecedented and might be felt beyond immediate project environment; while
impacts likely to occur for the category B projects are less significant which can be reduced or minimized
through compliance with appropriate mitigation measure. Thus, the nature of the category B project is
such that it will not represent a large-scale intervention in the site and will not fundamentally change
the environment if adequately mitigated.

4.0       PRIORITY SITES WITH ENVIRONMENTAL AND SOCIAL MANAGEMENT PLANS (ESMPs)
The ESMP should consist of a well-documented set of mitigation, monitoring, and institutional actions to be
taken before and during implementation to eliminate adverse environmental and social impacts, offset them,
or reduce them to acceptable levels. It should also include the measures needed to implement these actions,
addressing the adequacy of the monitoring and institutional arrangements at upstream and downstream in
the intervention site.

4.1.0      OMIRI CULVERT–OMIRI (OMI RIVER)
The sub-project activities in components 2 (sub component 2.1) will involve critical infrastructure
improvements which includes the construction of a replacement of the existing culvert with a larger capacity
single cell box relief culvert and road way approaches etc.

4.1.2      RATIONALE OF THE OMIRI CULVERT STUDY
Omiri River flowing through Adekola community is channeled by a dilapidated culvert with no protective
barriers on both sides of the culvert. This is a hazard to users due to the height of the road. Drainages are
blocked with waste preventing free flow of water. The topography of the project area of influence is a gentle
slope and characterized by igneous rock formations with sandy soils. The area receives surface water
(upstream) from Omi Riverand discharges at Christ Power - Olode. Vegetation in the area is composed mainly
of few trees, high shrubs and grasses. However, the original vegetation has been undergoing modifications
due to urban expansions and human activities.Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting
in series of environmental and social concerns such as existing drains are blocked with solid waste.




Collapsed culvert with debris                             Collapsed culvert

The proposed civil works include;

          preference given to providing a single opening to minimize the potential for debris blockage.,
   ii.    construction of appropriate bed scour (upstream and downstream) and side protection to prevent
          outflanking and
  iii.    construction of formal roadway approaches and associated drainage (for the full width of the
          floodplain) and the minimum land area required for the proposed intervention is estimated at about
          25m2
Specifically, the design includes:
       a. Excavation and stabilization;
       b. Construction of bed and concrete screeding;
       c. Construction of 9” thick reinforced concrete retaining wall (Abutments);
       d. Construction of deck concrete; and

The Olorungunwa Culvert – Poat Area (Omi River) priority site is located in Egbeda Local Government Area.
The site falls within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y coordinates N7.36993 and E3.99749 and
at an altitude of 190msl.

4.2.1    RATIONALE OF THE OLORUNGUNWA CULVERT STUDY
The existing inadequate Olorungunwa culvert constructed on an earth road has a flow of water from
Olorunguwa stream to Omi River. The existing road has been damaged by erosion. There is excessive growth
of weeds which obstructs the flow of water. Drainage exists on only one side of the road.
The topography of the project area of influence is a gentle slope and characterized by igneous rock
formations with sandy soils. The area receives surface water (upstream) from Olorungunwa
stream/springand discharges at Omi River. Vegetation in the area is composed mainly of few trees, high
shrubs and grasses. However, the original vegetation has been undergoing modifications due to urban
expansions and human activities.
Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting in series of environmental and social concerns
such as sheet erosion, presence of undercutting in roads/ erosion, No drainages on existing earth roads;
Aquatic weeds restricting flow of water and high sediment load in stream.




         Collapsed culvert                                Collapsed culvert and road approaches without
drainages


The proposed civil works include constructing appropriate road drainage to carry the significant flows that
can be generated during intense storms and routing these flows through a new single cell box culvert under
the road and into the natural channels beyond and the minimum land area required for the proposed
intervention is estimated at about 25m2

Specifically, the design includes:

4.3.0      MAJE – IDI MANGO ROAD (OGUNPA RIVER) STUDY AREA:
The Maje River – Maje - Idi Mango Road (Ogunpa River) priority site is located in Oluyole Local Government
Area. The site falls within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y coordinates N7.31603 and E3.89197
at an altitude of 150msl.

4.3.1     RATIONALE OF MAJE – IDI MANGO ROAD (OGUNPA RIVER) STUDY
Maje River flows through Maje/Idi-oro community in Oluyole LGA with culvert sited on Idi Mango road. The
road crossing here is frequently overtopped, causing significant local disruption to social activities. In 2014
there have been several disruptions which have caused damage to properties. The culvert is damaged and
water flow through drains is hampered by water weeds.
The topography of the project area of influence is a gentle slope and characterized by lateritic soils. The area
receives surface water (upstream) from Ogbere River and flows to Ogunpa River. Vegetation in the area is
composed mainly of high shrubs, grasses and water weeds. However, the original vegetation has been
undergoing modifications due to urban expansions and human activities.
Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting in series of environmental and social concerns
such aquatic weeds restricting flow of water; high sediment/solid waste load in stream.

Government area of Oyo State. The site falls within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y
coordinates N7.33088 and E3.94549 at an altitude of 189msl.

4.4.1     RATIONALE OF THE FOWOROGI BRIDGE – EGBEDA TUBA ROAD STUDY
The stream in Foworogi channels water from River Ariyo to Fatusi. Existing Culvert is constructed on an earth
road used by vehicles (heavy and light) and pedestrians. Culvert is not adequate for the area. Waterway is
obstructed by water weeds. The low crossing has suffered severe structural damage and is now actively
eroding.
The topography of the project area of influence is a gentle slope and characterized by basement formation
and sandy soils. Vegetation in the area is composed mainly of some trees, high shrubs, and grasses. However,
the original vegetation has been undergoing modifications due to urban expansions and human activities.
Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting in series of environmental and social concerns
such aquatic weeds restricting flow of water, high sediment load in stream and lack of drainages on existing
earth roads.

coordinates N7.32389 and E3.95092 at an altitude of 200msl.

4.5.1     RATIONALE OF THE ELERE RIVER CULVERT-EGBEDA TUBA ROAD (OGEBRE RIVER) STUDY
Elere River flows through the Idi Ogun community into River Fatusi. The culvert which controls the flow of
water is constructed on an untarred earth roadway used by heavy and light vehicles, and pedestrians. This
culvert has been inadequately designed as it does not serve its purpose. It is a part of series of connecting
bridges that serve multiple communities, and a large area of ongoing and rapid urban growth. The unmade
roadway soon becomes impassable during the rains. The existing small temporary bridge can only cope with
small vehicles which mean that larger Lorries and vans go through the river resulting in significant deepening
of the stream and undermining of the current structure.
The topography is a gentle slope and characterized by basement geology formations and sandy soils in some
parts. Vegetation in the area is composed basically of wetland/marshy tree species, high shrubs and grasses

4.6.0     ALARO CULVERT-7UP ROAD (ALARO RIVER) STUDY AREA:
Alaro culvert is sited in a residential/industrial area on 7Up road in Ibadan South West Local Government Area.
The site falls within the Ibadan Metropolis and lies between x and y coordinates N7.3541 and E3.84603 at an
altitude of 162msl.

4.6.1     RATIONALE OF THE ALARO CULVERT-7UP ROAD (ALARO RIVER) STUDY:
The existing culverts are undersized and capacity is further limited by frequent and severe debris. The
complex nature of the upstream entrance to the culvert makes it easy for debris to collect and blind the
entrance. Outflanking of the short training walls is also in evidence. There are no protective barriers on both
sides of the culvert. Culvert is inadequate and needs to be replaced. Drainage also requires reconstruction.
Blockage by natural and anthropogenic debris is a significant issue that further reduces the culvert capacity
during times of flood.
The topography is a flat and characterized by basement geology formations and sandy soils. Vegetation in
the area is composed mainly of high shrubs and grasses. However, the original vegetation has been
undergoing modifications due to urban expansions and human activities.
Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting in series of environmental and social concerns
such as Air pollution from Zartech poultry farm; Sheet erosion, debris blockage– including woody debris and
anthropogenic waste.

5.1.1      RATIONALE OF THE OGBERE MORADEYO BRIDGE STUDY
Ogbere is a residential locality with various communities. The Ogbere bridge which links these communities is
in a terrible state of disrepair. The existing crossing was badly damaged following the flood event of 2011. It is
now highly dangerous, but continues to be used by pedestrians and motorcycles. The existing crossing
section is in poor condition leading to local flooding issue, including the flooding of property. The roadway
that once connected two parts of the city suburbs is now impassable. Alternative routes do exist but these
are much longer.

The topography is predominantly flat with a basement geology formation. The soil is sandy and prone to
erosion mostly by water. The area receives surface water (upstream) from Onipepeye stream and drains into
Ogbere River Vegetation in the area is rain forest, however, the original vegetation has been undergoing

5.3.1      RATIONALE OF THE ALARO POLY ROAD - SANGO-ELEYELE ROAD - POLY IJOKODO (ALARO
STREAM)BRIDGE STUDY:
The Alaro Poly is a major archery carrying significant traffic volume – including buses and heavy lorries. Scour
of the bed and flanks is an issue. Following serve scour at the outlet of the culvert that passes under the road,
and a general lowering of the downstream river bed, the large box section forming the culvert was left
unsupported and collapsed. The road verge subsequently eroded and continues to erode, exposing and
severing buried power and communication lines as well as placing road users at risk. Alaro stream controls
the flow of water that discharges to Ona River. The culvert sits on the expanse of Sango/Ijokodo major road
with high vehicular traffic. Also roads, culverts and drainages are badly damaged by erosion; public utilities
pipelines (water and telecommunications) were observed.The topography is predominantly flat with a
basement geology formation. The soil is clayey-loam and prone to erosion mostly by storm water. The area
receives surface water (upstream) from Ogbere River and discharges into Ona River. Vegetation in the area is
composed basically of sparse trees and high shrubs.However, the original vegetation has been undergoing
modifications due to urban expansions and human activities.

Human activities have impacted on the environment resulting in series of environmental concerns such as
Presence of undercutting in roads/ erosion; damaged drainages along asphalt paved road; exposed drinking

        Identifying institutional responsibilities and needs for capacity building if necessary to implement
         the recommendations of the environmental and social assessment;
        Carrying out consultations with primary and secondary stakeholders in order to obtain their views
         on and preoccupations about the project. These consultations shall occur during the preparation of
         the Reports to identify key environmental and social issues and impacts, and after completion of
         the draft Reports to obtain comments from stakeholders on the proposed mitigation/enhancement
         measures; and
        Preparing the ESMP and ESIA Reports according to the generic contents presented in Part A and B
         hereafter respectively.


6.1.1       The following socio-economic issues shall be addressed in the Reports (ESIA & ESMP):
           Establish social baseline for pre project intervention
           Determine the project’s social impacts on health and social well -being ; quality of the living
            environment; economic material well-being ;Family and community ; and gender relations

           A summary of the impacted communities for the project: location, access, population (number,
            demographic and social characteristics); economy (employment rate, income distribution); services
            (types, capacity, and adequacy) and housing. Concern is the ability to provide work force, service
            new development and absorb and adjust to growth (worker/family). . The report should identify
            and assess the social impacts identified during the public consultation process and those that,
            based on consultant’s experience, are also likely to occur. In some instances the affected
            communities may not be aware of or be in a position to identify all the social impacts that may
            occur. However, this does not mean that they will not occur. In such cases the consultant should

                                                                                                              93

            use his/her experience to identify additional social impacts that have not been raised by the public.
            A summary of the views of the population including vulnerable groups, determined through
            thoroughly documented discussions with local communities. These meetings and discussions must
            be documented and should show how issues and problems raised are or will be resolved
           Pay particular attention to the impacts of the project on vulnerable and marginalized individuals
            and groups ( including but not limited to mobility impaired individuals and groups and People Living
            with Disability)
           Detail measures that will need to be taken to mitigate the negative social impacts identified and
            the procedures for their implementation;

           Identifying key uncertainties and risks: Identify and communicate any key uncertainties and risks
            associated with the accuracy of the findings of the social assessment, as well as of the proposed
            project. Some sources of uncertainty and risk commonly associated with projects are linked to: (a)
            Lack of adequate information at the community level; (b) Creation of employment and business
            opportunities for members from the local, historically disadvantaged communities; (c) The influx of
            job seekers and construction workers to the area and the impact on services; etc.

           Assess the impact of the construction on individuals and groups whose livelihoods are tied to the
            route/road (motor cycle taxi and tricycle operators etc.). As part of consultations, the ESMP should
            identify the potential negative impact on the livelihoods of these individuals and groups and
            propose appropriate mitigation measures

           Assess potential impact of the project on property access and suggest measures to minimize the
            effects on property access

           Information will be gathered from field surveys and secondary data sources (interviews, structured
            questionnaires, in-depth interviews and focus group discussions).

   Maintenance works and associated costs.
   Consultation approaches and participation mechanisms.

6.3.5     Description of the Project Environment
This chapter shall first determine the limits of the study area that shall be defined in order to encompass all
project direct and indirect impacts. The description and analysis of the physical, biological and human
conditions shall address relevant environmental and social issues within this area, including any changes
anticipated before project implementation.

Within the human environment, key issues that shall be considered include population characteristics and
trends, revenue disparities, gender differences, health problems, natural resource access and ownership,
land use patterns and civil society organisation level.

It shall also address the interrelations between the environmental and social components and the
importance (value) that the society and local populations attach to these components, in order to identify
the environmental and social components of high value or presenting a particular interest. A particular
attention shall be given to the rare, threatened, sensitive or valorised environmental and social components.

The information presented shall be relevant to decisions about project location, design, operations as well as
environmental and social management. Maps, figures and tables shall be included in this chapter to better
illustrate the various environmental and social components.

6.3.6      Project Alternatives
This part of the ESIA Report consists in analysing the various feasible alternatives of the project, including the
"without project" option. It normally comprises two sections. The first section identifies and describes the
potential feasible alternatives that would allow reaching the project objectives. The second section presents
a comparison of the potential alternatives on the basis of technical, economic, environmental and social
criteria, as well as of public views and concerns.

The alternative comparison shall address the proposed project site, technology, design, and operation, in
terms of their potential environmental and social impacts and the feasibility of mitigating these impacts. For
each of the alternatives, the environmental and social impacts shall be quantified as possible, including their
economic values where feasible. The selected alternative shall be the most environmentally and socially
sustainable, taking into account the technical and economical feasibility.

6.3.7    Potential Environmental and Social Impacts and Mitigation/Enhancement Measures
This chapter presents a detailed analysis of beneficial and adverse impacts of various components of the
selected project alternative on the physical, biological and human (social, cultural and economic)

                                                                                                              96

environments. The methodology of assessment, based on a rigorous scientific method, shall be first
presented. Then all environmental and social, direct and indirect, short and long-term, temporary and
permanent impacts shall be described and assessed, indicating their importance level and their probability of
occurrence. The importance level may be assessed on the basis of the nature, extent, intensity and duration
of the impact, as well as on the sensitivity of the concerned environmental and social components and
perceptions of the public. Irreversible or unavoidable impacts shall be clearly identified. Cumulative effects
shall also be addressed taking into account other projects or actions planned in the study area.

Appropriate mitigation measures shall be identified to prevent, minimise, mitigate or compensate for adverse
environmental and/or social impacts. Moreover, enhancement measures shall be developed in order to
improve project environmental and social performance. Roles and responsibilities to implement measures
shall be clearly defined. The cost of the measures shall be estimated, including the cost for environmental and
social capacity building and gender mainstreaming, if necessary. Residual impacts shall be presented.

6.3.8     Environmental Hazard Management
Whenever relevant, this chapter shall describe the security measures and propose a preliminary contingency
plan for the construction and operation phases of the project (possible contingency situations, major actions
to properly react to accidents, responsibilities and means of communications).

For projects that may cause major technological accidents whose consequences may exceed the project site,
the ESIA shall include an analysis of the technological accident risk: identification of hazard and potential
consequences, estimation of the consequences’ magnitude and frequency, and risk estimation and
evaluation.

6.3.9      Environmental and Social Monitoring Program
The first section of this chapter shall describe the surveillance measures aiming at ensuring that the proposed
mitigation and enhancement measures are effectively implemented during the implementation phase. The
second section concerns the environmental and social monitoring activities designed to measure and
evaluate the project impacts on some key environmental and social components of concern and to
implement remedial measures, if necessary. Indicators, roles and responsibilities shall be clearly defined. The
cost of the program shall be estimated, including the cost for environmental and social capacity building if
necessary.

6.3.10   Public Consultations
This chapter shall summarise the actions undertaken to consult the groups affected by the project, as well as
other concerned key stakeholders including Civil Society Organisations. The detailed record of the
consultation meetings shall be presented in annex to the ESIA Report.

Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP

For projects that involve the displacement of 200 people or more, a full Resettlement Action Plan (RAP) is
required. For projects that involve fewer than 200 people, an Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP)
is required.
The aim of the ARAP is to identify and assess the human impact of the proposed works at the priority siteas
described above, and to prepare an Action Plan to be implemented in coordination with the civil works in line
with World Bank Policy and Nigeria policies and laws. Experience has shown that involuntary resettlement
can cause loss of income, assets, and community ties that, especially among the poor, can be essential for
survival and well being. In extreme cases, involuntary resettlement can lead to the dissolution of families,
impoverishments and health problems. The Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan will identify the project
affected persons (PAPs), engage them in participatory discussions regarding the plan and formulating a plan
of action to adequately compensate people for their losses.

The Policy of the World Bank is to ensure that persons involuntarily resettled caused by the taking of land in
the context of a project supported by the Bank, have an opportunity to restore or improve their level of living
to at least the pre-project level. Project affected people should participate in the benefits of the project and
they should be given options regarding how they restore or improve their previous level of living. In the
IUFMP it is not sufficient for communities to passively accept project works and the impacts of these works.
Rather they must be mobilized to contribute actively to project design and implementation and to maintain
the works following implementation. This feature underscores the need for accurate analysis of local social
organization.

7.1.0     Responsibility for the ARAP
In preparing the ARAP, the consultant will:

          a)   Review relevant Nigerian/Oyo State law and procedures regarding land taking and compensation as
               well as resettlement;
          b)   Review Resettlement Plans prepared for other World Bank urban projects in Ibadan and Nigeria;
          c)   Undertake a reconnaissance field survey in the sites/local government areas where sub-projects are
               proposed.
          d)   Consult with appropriate ministries: Works, Environment, Women Affairs, Lands, etc.
          e)   Consult with persons to be potentially affected by sub-projects works (consultation should look at
               gender division of labor, etc).

7.1.1          Steps to be taking by the consultant in Preparing an ARAP:
     i.        Community engagement: This must begin from an early date and a relationship of trust must be
               formed between the executing agency and the affected community in which both sides have an
               opportunity to air their views. In general, small neighbourhood meetings are preferable to large
               public audiences where there is a greater tendency for matters to be politicized and people tend to
               “grandstand” and posture rather than exchange information in an atmosphere of cooperation.
    ii.         It is necessary that member of the PIU and the engineering firm that will design the works be
               present at these meetings.
   iii.        Hopes and demands expressed by community members should be taken seriously and, if possible,
               incorporated into plans.
   iv.         Identification of the perimeter within which people and land will be affected by displacement or
               land acquisition. For this purpose, maps, engineering drawings, satellite imagery are necessary.
    v.         Complete census survey of all the families, businesses, public buildings, farms and other
               infrastructure located within the perimeter should be done. GIS technology is highly recommended
               for this purpose with all man-made features being geo-referenced. The use of hand held GPS device
               will facilitate establishing the coordinates of each property identified. The census includes data on
               age, gender, occupation, income, sources of livelihood of all persons who live on or derive a living
               from the area of land as well as information on houses, businesses and other structures in use in the
               affected area.
   vi.         Each land parcel and structure should be numbered, geo-referenced, photographed, and described
               in detail.
  vii.          Construction materials, roofing, and measurements should be noted in accordance with the
               standards in use in the particular state or federal standards.
  viii.        All information should be kept in a single folder (physical or virtual) for easy retrieval and cross
               tabulation.
   ix.         The use of a simple database manager is recommended such as Access or Foxpro.
    x.         In Nigeria and Ibadan in particular, it is important to include such feature as family compounds,
               places of worship, schools, health posts, sports fields, burial grounds and places held sacred by local
               populations where applicable. Each structure included in the census should be valuated according
               to its replacement value in the local market (see below).


                                                                                                                 100
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP

  xi.    Because of the linear nature of streams, bridges, culverts and roads, it is important to identify
         existing features or aspects of the engineering design that could impact on communities. If land is
         taken for the purpose of flood control or drainage, there is likely to be an impact on communication
         within and among communities. Barriers to access caused by project works should be considered in
         the ARAP and, where necessary, mitigation plans should be included.

7.1.2     Socioeconomic Study:
Based on the census, community meetings and other data collected in the field, a socioeconomic profile of
the affected community should be prepared as part of the ARAP. Some of the topics that shall be included
are:
         Demographic structure of the community;
         Leadership patterns and political process;
         Family structure;
         Services available in or near the community: schools, health facilities, credit facilities, religious
          organizations, government agencies;
         Existing organizations (e.g. age grades, religious groups) and capacity for community action;
         Conflicts and divisions (ethnic, religious, etc.) within the community or between communities;
         Important local customs and festivals;
         Educational Levels;
         Permanence of the community;
         Primary forms of livelihood;
         Community attitudes towards flood control measures;
         Relevant aspects of gender relations; women’s vs. men’s roles.

The entire range of social characteristics shall be woven together by a sociologist or other social scientist to
paint a coherent picture of how the community is likely to respond to change and how best to make
community members active participants in the changes that must take place.

7.1.3      Development of the Resettlement Plan:
Based on the census and socioeconomic study, a resettlement plan is designed. The primary issue is to
ascertain the impact that the project will have on livelihoods. This applies not only to land owners but also
land users, such as tenant farmers, renters, businesses, kiosks and the like. The impact may range from nil to
virtually destroying the livelihood of persons who depend heavily on the land for income. The design for the
project and the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) shall take account of social organization
and propose entry points, communication techniques, incentives and other necessary features of project
design that will ensure active community participation before, during and after implementation.

Where people actually occupy the land, the impact of the project may fall on housing, businesses, public
infrastructure and other structures.

7.1.4     Mitigation Measures:
Resettlement is about finding adequate ways of compensating people for loss of place of business or
farmland. However the task does not end with relocation. Perhaps the single most important feature of
post-resettlement rehabilitation is the restoration of livelihoods. In some cases, livelihoods are not affected
and people are able to continue in their chosen economic activities as before with no loss of income. In other
cases, however, loss of farmland, residence or business clientele can create a spiral leading to
impoverishment. In such cases, the Resettlement Plan can include specific measures to restore or improve
livelihoods.

Mitigation of resettlement can take various forms. When affected people depend primarily on land for their
livelihood, Bank Policy strongly recommends offering land in compensation for lost land so that the land-
based economy can be maintained. In some cases, cash compensation for lost assets is allowed, but only
where there is a free and active market for land, housing or other lost assets. The Bank does not approve of
compensation packages that lead people to squat illegally on public land or that sets them back deeper into
poverty. Where poor people are involved, it is often necessary to provide special assistance to assure that
people manage their compensation adequately. Other forms of compensation involve retraining people for
other professions for which there is a demand. Special care should be taken with vulnerable people who lack
social support necessary to allow them to restore their prior life style. Cash compensation may be used, but
only under certain conditions. Cash compensation is acceptable only when there is an active market in land
or other assets that people can acquire in order to restore their livelihoods. Works may not begin until
resettled people have been adequately compensated according to the ARAP. Temporary resettlement is
generally not acceptable, except in cases where the works require people to move away from their homes
and lands and then allows them to return to the same places.

                                                                                                           101

Design of mitigation plans involves three tools: (a) asset valuation; (b) the definition of entitlements; and (c)
an eligibility matrix. Entitlements are goods, services and sometimes cash made available to affected people
to offset their losses caused by the taking of land. Note that business losses not caused by the taking of land
are not covered by this policy.

7.1.5    Valuation of Assets:
Assets that will be lost such as land, homes, fencing, un-harvested crops, permanent crops such as fruit trees,
shops etc. should be valued at replacement cost that is the current cost of replacing the asset with a similar
asset on the open market. Depreciation is not to be considered in valuing assets. Many states maintain a
standard table of values for homes, land, crops, etc for expropriation purposes, but these tables are often
out of date and do not reflect actual prices practiced on the market. It may be necessary to conduct a new
survey using up-to-date information. Tax records in which the landowner declares the value of his/her land
are notoriously inaccurate because landowners frequently understate the value of their homes or land in
order to reduce their tax bills. The purpose of valuation is to make it possible for the affected party to
acquire new assets that will be equivalent to or better than the assets lost. Depreciation is not to be
considered in this survey. Various methods can be used to estimate the value of property such as data on
land transactions made within the past year or two, construction costs, estimates by real-estate
professionals, and others. The goal is to determine the replacement value of each affected structure for the
purpose of compensation.

7.1.6    Definition of entitlements:

Entitlements are goods and services provided to offset losses caused by expropriation of land, houses, farm
buildings, shops, etc. Entitlements are intended to offset the losses incurred by people when land is
expropriated for project purposes so they should be roughly equal in value. There are some exceptions,
however. Entitlements are sometime set at a minimum level to allow people to be resettled without a
significant loss of living style. This is often the case with squatters who have lived in place for a long time but
who lack legal title to the land they occupy. Entitlements may consist of land, land with improvements (e.g.
irrigation), new housing, building materials to build houses, cash payments, training for a new profession,
especially where it is not possible to continue in a previous activity because of the resettlement.

7.1.7    Eligibility Matrix:

The eligibility matrix matches categories of affected people with specific entitlements or a selection of
entitlements. For example, farmers who lose up to one-half of their land may be eligible to receive plot of
land equivalent to the land lost or cash compensation for the portion lost. On the other hand, farmers who
lose a large portion of their land may be entitled to a new lot equivalent to the entire plot they farmed
previously or to cash compensation. The reason is that when a large portion of a farm is taken, it may lose its
economic viability and the farmer may opt to be compensated for the entire farm. The eligibility matrix must
be crafted carefully to satisfy the needs of the displaced families and the available financial envelope. There
is no one-size-fits-all eligibility matrix. Rather the matrix must be worked out in consultation with the
community and in accordance with availability of resources. In some cases, for example, land may be so
scarce that it will be impossible to provide land-for-land.

7.1.8    Cut – off Date:

A cut-off date shall be set and announced to the affected community. Usually the cut-off date corresponds
to the date of completion of the census. After this date, no compensation will be made to families or persons
who install themselves within the affected area or for improvements made to homes or other structures.
The purpose of the cut-off date is to avoid speculative investments inside the affected area by persons
seeking entitlements. If two years or more pass after the declaration of a cut-off date, the census must be
repeated and new valuations computed for assets.

7.1.9     Businesses:
Businesses and service establishments may be displaced by flood control projects. In such cases, business
owners may be compensated with cash, with a new place of business or other benefits. Service providers,
such as auto repair shops should be provided with a building site in a location where they will be able to
attract customers or keep existing ones. Business owners are entitled to compensation for lost profits
during the time they are unable to operate due to displacement or while they rebuild their clientele. Small,
informal businesses present a problem because they normally do not keep records nor do they pay taxes. In
such cases, an estimate of profits may be based on daily turnover, on inventory or other methods of
estimation.


                                                                                                             102
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP


7.1.10    Vulnerable People:
The census shall be used to identify vulnerable people among the affected population. Vulnerable people
shall be defined as elderly people who lack a social support network to assist them in moving to a new
location; persons suffering from a mental or physical disability, single mothers of small children and very poor
persons living below the poverty line. The entitlement table shall include this category as having special
entitlements including personal assistance with moving, reestablishment of household, reestablishment of a
social network and appropriate assistance from informal or formal sources. This role is normally played by
social workers.

7.1.11      Conflicts and Clouded Titles:
Sometimes it is not possible to compensate landowners and homeowners because of conflicting claims or
unsettled estates. In cases, of inheritance, for example, where the heirs to a property cannot all be found, it
may be necessary to deposit funds into an escrow account held by a reliable financial or government entity
until all claims are settled. The proponent agency has an obligation to proactively assist the affected parties
and claimants to settle their differences in a timely manner. In no case, is it acceptable for people to be
evicted from their homes or farms without having made provisions for them to be re-housed and
rehabilitated.

7.1.12    Public Facilities:
Public facilities such as schools, houses of worship, sports facilities that are displaced or become inaccessible
because of the taking of land should be rebuilt at project expense at a location and in a manner acceptable to
the users of that facility.

7.1.13   Disclosure:
After the resettlement plan has been developed, it must be disclosed in a manner that is accessible to the
community and other interested parties in the language used by members of the community. Printed copies
may be deposited at local agencies and posted on line. Prior to implementation, additional community
meetings should be held to discuss the plan and how it will be implemented.

7.1.14     Implementation:
Resettlement must be closely coordinated with construction.              A timetable shall be included in the
resettlement plan and compliance with this timetable shall be monitored. Deviations from the timetable shall
be justified in monitoring reports. It is not acceptable for construction to begin with the demolition of homes
or schools before appropriate measures have been taken to replace housing and other structures. If cash
compensation is used, it must be paid before people are obliged to move.

7.1.15    Responsibilities and Accountabilities:
The plan shall contain a matrix listing all entities (public and private) responsible for designing and
implementing the resettlement plan. It shall include columns indicating the role of each agency, the
resources allocated to it and the source of these resources and the legal instrument to be used to assure
performance (e.g. contract, MOU, operating agreement). It is essential that the development of the plan
include contact with the management of each agency and their agreement to perform their particular role in
a timely fashion. For example, if land is allocated to displaced farmers, the local land registrar must agree to
register each land parcel and issue the appropriate certificates of occupancy and land titles in a timely
fashion. Such arrangements must not be left until after implementation has begun.

7.1.16     Financing:
The Resettlement Plan shall include a detailed budget, a budget justification and a financing plan that shows
the source of funding for the overall resettlement plan. Bank financing may be used to pay for studies,
prepare resettlement plans, and to pay salaries to social workers and other staff needed to work with the
population. Where entitlements include the construction of new housing or infrastructure, loan funds can be
used for site preparation, design, and construction. The same procurement rules that apply to other project
activities apply to resettlement activities. Solutions that involve environmental impacts such as clearing
forested land for new farmland and other activities with significant should be subjected to environmental
impact assessments. Loan funds may not be used for land acquisition or for cash compensation. These costs
shall be paid out of local counterpart funds. The costs of resettlement shall be included in the overall project
costs.

7.1.17   Grievance Procedure:
Each Resettlement plan shall include clear procedures for filing and resolving grievances from the affected
population. Grievance procedures fall into the following steps.



                                                                                                            103
Abbreviated Resettlement Action Plan (ARAP) for Omiri Bridge Priority Site - IUFMP

a.       Reception and registration: Affected people shall have the right to file complaints or grievances
         with regard to any aspect of the resettlement project. They may do so verbally, in writing or through
         a representative. Grievances shall be recorded by the implementing agency with the name of the
         griever, address and location information, the nature of the grievance and the resolution desired.
         Receipt of grievances shall be acknowledged within 48 hours of receipt by an official authorized to
         receive grievances

b.       Resolution: All grievances shall be referred to the appropriate party for resolution and shall be
         resolved within 15 days after receipt. If additional information is needed, project management can
         authorize and additional 15 days for resolution. Results of grievances shall be disclosed to the griever
         in writing with an explanation of the basis of the decision.

c.       Appeals: Grievers dissatisfied with the response to their grievance may file an appeal. In such cases,
         the responsible authority shall assemble a committee to hear cases including at least one
         disinterested party from outside the company or agency responsible for the resettlement project.
         There will be no further redress available outside the resettlement project. In such cases, grievances
         would need to be pursued through the legal system.
d.       Monitoring: During project implementation and for at least 3 months following the conclusion of the
         project, monthly reports will be prepared by the responsible agency regarding the number and
         nature of grievances filed and made available to project management and included in the trimester
         reports by the PIU.

7.1.18   Monitoring and Evaluation:
The Resettlement Plan must include a timetable and performance indicators. Among the indicators shall be:

     o    Meetings held with community (date, attendees, topics discussed);
     o    Date of conclusion of census and Announcement of Cutoff Date;
     o    Presentation of Plan to World Bank through PIU;
     o    Date of Presentation of Plan to Community and Posting;
     o    Date of first compensation (e.g. moving families to new housing);
     o    Date of midpoint in project implementation; and
     o    Date at which last family or business leaves the affected area

Monthly monitoring reports shall be filed by the agency or company carrying out the resettlement plan
referring to these dates.

After project implementation at the time by which all families and businesses shall have been resettled and
compensated and rehabilitation measures carried out, an evaluation shall be carried out using evaluation
reports and interviews with the resettled families, farmers and businesses. While satisfaction of the resettled
families is an important factor, it can be expected that many people will be dissatisfied with having had to
move at all. The most important feature of resettlement is the extent to which resettled people have had the
opportunity to rebuild their livelihoods at a level similar to or better than the pre-project level. Surveys that
examine the satisfaction of people with the resettlement they underwent are not usually helpful.
