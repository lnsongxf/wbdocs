The Project Development Objective of the Floods Emergency Recovery Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH) is to meet
critical needs and restore the functionality of infrastructure essential for public services and economic recovery in the areas
affected by the massive flooding in May 2014. There are three components to the project. The first component will allow the
entity-level governments and Brcko District to purchase or refinance emergency recovery goods, including food, fuel, hygienic
items, agriculture goods, construction materials, and other emergency needs. The second component will finance the
rehabilitation of key regional and local public infrastructure. This component will finance the rehabilitation or reconstruction of
high-priority, public service delivery infrastructure in the worst-affected areas, including the rehabilitation of regional roads and
railways and flood protection, as well as local infrastructure such as rural roads, water and sanitation, schools, hospitals, etc.
Finally, the third component will finance the project management costs and provide technical assistance and capacity building
to help ensure future improved disaster resilience.

Expected results: The project will provide assistance to the population in affected areas to restore their lives to the pre-flood
level by providing emergency goods, including agriculture goods to help restore agriculture and income-generating activities and
construction materials to help rehabilitate the housing stock in the worst affected areas. The project will also recover priority
public service infrastructure facilities to pre-flood conditions.

Progress thus far: Implementation is under way in both entities and in the Brcko District. During the initial months of
implementation, the focus was on refinancing eligible emergency goods (primarily agriculture goods and construction materials)
and preparing the design and project documentation for regional and local infrastructure rehabilitation subprojects that will be
initiated in the 2015 construction season.


Key Partners: The Bank team is working closely with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of BiH, Ministry of Finance in the
Federation BiH (FBiH), the Ministry of Finance in the Republika Srpska (RS), and the Brcko District Government.

The agriculture sector is a relatively small but important part of the BiH economy. Agriculture’s share in BiH’s economy has fallen by
nearly half from 15.1 percent in 1999 to 8.4 percent in 2012, while the services sector has grown to 66.8 percent and industry represents
24.8 percent of the economy. Institutional constraints across the various governmental levels and bodies mandated to provide services
prevent BiH’s agro-food sector from reaching its full potential. BiH has some comparative advantages in agriculture, especially for niche
products due to its close proximity to the European Union (EU), moderate continental climate, and fairly rich and cultivable soils, as well
as clean and abundant natural water resources, natural upland pastures, and the ready availability of labor. In spite of the important role
the vertically integrated agrokombinats used to play in primary production, there is a long tradition of small-scale farming and organic
production in the country. Despite access to the EU market through preferential trade agreements, BiH is not reaping the full benefits of
this favorable treatment due to the absence of EU-compliant food safety institutions and an EU-compliant regulatory framework.

The Project Development Objective is to assist BiH in strengthening the capacity of its state- and entity-level institutions to deliver
more efficient and effective agricultural services and support programs and to make a substan tial contribution to an acceleration of BiH’s
eligibility to access support under the EU Instrument for Pre-Accession Assistance for Rural Development (IPARD). A project
restructuring was conducted in response to: (i) changes in country priorities in the pre-EU accession context; (ii) implementation issues
identified as part of the Bank’s implementation support activities; and (iii) damage rehabilitation needs pertaining to rural infrastructure
and assets following the severe floods that hit the country during the 2010–11 winter season.


Results achieved: To date, substantial efforts have gone toward strengthening the state-level agencies for veterinary services, plant health
and phytosanitary services, and food safety. In parallel, inspection services have been strengthened and information systems are under
development for the deployment of an eventual Agricultural Information System. Substantial progress has been made in the
implementation of a farm and client register and a livestock identification and registration system, as well as the identification and
rehabilitation of reference laboratories for the handling of plant material and food safety. The country has now conducted four consecutive
years of potato pest monitoring, including modifications to the survey in line with the EU’s Food and Veterinary Office (FVO)
recommendations that will allow for exports of potatoes to the EU. Similarly, a residue-testing strategy is under implementation in
consultation with the FVO, where Bank financing is supporting laboratory equipment and accreditation for a laboratory network for the
select testing domestically of some residues. Finally, the distribution of flood rehabilitation grants and the rehabilitation of rural
infrastructure is under way to assist farmers and rural populations in the areas that were most affected during the 2010/2011 floods.

Key Partners: The Bank team is working closely with the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, Ministry of Agriculture,
Water Management and Forestry in FBiH, Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water Resources in RS, Food Safety of BiH, Plant Health
Administration, State Veterinary Office of BiH, and Inspection Services in both entities.

BiH and Croatia have identified the need for improved water resources management and biodiversity conservation as key environmental
issues in their National Environmental Action Plans. The water resources of the Neretva and Trebisnjica river basins (NTRB), and the
ecosystems dependent on them, play an important part in the economies of both countries and the livelihoods of over 430,000 people
living in the area. Taken together, these two rivers comprise most of the Adriatic watershed of BiH and Croatia, and both are crucial to
energy production, recreation, fisheries, drinking water, and irrigation. They carry the (generally untreated) wastewater of the municipalities
and many industries into the basins. The approach to improving the water resources management and biodiversity of the NTRB called
for a joint effort of the two countries, resulting in the regional transboundary project, the “Neretva and Trebisnjica Manage ment Project
(NTMP),” supported by the Global Environment Facility (GEF) through a US$8 million grant, out of which US$6 million has been
granted to BiH and US$2 million to Croatia. In addition, the EC provided a US$2 million IPA grant for the rehabilitation and construction
of sewerage in Ljubuski, BiH. The Croatia GEF grant closed on December 31, 2014, and the BiH grant will close on June 30, 2015.
The project aims to provide a mechanism for promoting efficient and equitable water allocation among the users of the NTRB at the
transboundary level and for enhancing the basin ecosystem and biodiversity through improved water resources management, including:
(i) improved transboundary water resource management; (ii) enhanced management and use of wetland ecosystems and biodiversity; (iii)
high-priority investments for water pollution and two industrial sector investments; and iv) public participation and management of
project implementation.
Key Results Achieved/Expected: BiH and Croatia have been cooperating effectively and regularly holding joint bilateral
meetings. Rehabilitation of the wastewater treatment plant in Trebinje and Ljubuski was completed, as was the EC-financed
sewerage system in Ljubuski. The new advanced treatment plant in Bileca could become a best practice showcase for municipal
wastewater treatment. The newly constructed wastewater treatment plant in Konjic will start its trial work as soon as the EIB-
financed sewerage system is connected to it. The wastewater treatment plant of the visitors’ center of Nature Park Hutovo Blato in
BiH and the construction works for the reception center and 6-kilometer long hike and bike trail at the Bacina Lakes in Croatia
have also been completed. The preparation of the River Basin Management Plan for Croatia, FBiH, and RS and the Framework
for Neretva and Trebisnjica River Basin Management have been completed and adopted. The Minimal Environmental Flow study
and the Optimization of Hydropower Plants Work study have also been completed. The construction of the water-efficient
irrigation pilot in Glog in the Croatian Delta has unfortunately been dropped due to the inability to obtain a construction permit in
time. As a replacement, the water monitoring system has been strengthened by online monitoring of water quantity and quality
data, including ground waters (salinity, flows, etc.). By the end of the project, the following results will be achieved: reduction of
nutrients and other pollution from municipal sources in the selected municipalities in the basin; improved maintenance of
environmental flows; and improved ecosystem health and biodiversity in the basin.
Key Partners: The Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry in FBiH, and the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Water
Management in RS, under the coordination of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations of BiH; the five participating municipalities
in BiH; and in Croatia, the Ministry of Agriculture through Croatian Waters (HV). Key donors: The EC and the Governments of Spain and the
Netherlands.

Service delivery problems in BiH are prevalent due to the lingering after-effects of the conflict that left vast portions of the basic
infrastructure destroyed or severely damaged. A case that vividly illustrates the problem is wastewater collection and treatment in
the city of Sarajevo. A Wastewater Treatment Plant (WWTP) was built close to the confluence of the Miljacka and Bosna Rivers
in the early 1980s on the occasion of the 1984 Winter Olympics. Construction of the plant was supported by the World Bank –
financed Sarajevo Water Supply and Sewerage Project (Loan 1263-YU), which closed in December 1982. However, the plant was
extensively damaged in the spring of 1992 at the outset of the conflict, during which time the sewer network was also destroyed in
various places. Since the end of the conflict in 1995, the WWTP has been largely out of commission, with only minimal conservation
works carried out to prevent further deterioration. As a result, virtually all of the city’s wastewater is discharged into the Miljacka
and Bosna Rivers without any treatment, causing severe pollution of the rivers and impacting the communities downstream.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the living conditions of populations in the areas covered by the Sarajevo
Water and Wastewater Company and in downstream riverside communities by: (i) reducing the population’s exposure to and
reliance on highly polluted water from the Miljacka and Bosna Rivers; and (ii) improving the efficiency of the wastewater collection
network in the Sarajevo Canton. As of August 2011, the first civil works contracts had been signed for the rehabilitation of priority
sewage networks in the city. The Design Supply and Install of WWTP contract was signed in January 2014. Preparing the designs
and obtaining the necessary construction permit were completed and rehabilitation works started.

Results achieved: The rehabilitation work of a total of 17.24 kilometers of the city’s sewage network has been completed, which
exceeded the project target of 16 kilometers. The work also included separating storm water drainage connections from the sewage
network, thereby reducing the grit and sediment that undermine the treatment plant. 32,000 sewer connections are benefiting from
the rehabilitation works. Delivery of high-powered sewage network cleaning and maintenance vehicles took place in November
2011. Since commissioning the new vehicles, the number of sewer blockages in the network has been reduced by 20 percent on an
annual basis. Rehabilitation works on the WWTP are progressing.


Key Partners: The Bank team is working closely with the BiH Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, Sarajevo
Cantonal and Municipal Institutions, as well as with “VIK,” the Sarajevo Water Utility.

Key Development Partners: Close coordination has been established with the EC (which is providing project cofinancing in the
amount of €13.0 million).

The development and growth of small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are critical for the development of BiH. Following the
global financial crisis that began in 2008, access to finance for SMEs became even more difficult as banks limited their risk exposure.
Under this worrying backdrop, the World Bank in 2009 provided funds (US$70 million) via the Enhancing Access to Finance for Small
and Medium Enterprises Project to ensure continued access to finance for SMEs. This support proved critical for many SMEs
throughout the country, as many of them had found themselves totally cut off from credit markets. The situation began to improve in
2011, but the persistent difficulties in the Eurozone continued to negatively impact access to finance for SMEs. The deterioration in
economic activity in one of BiH’s key trading partners further depressed local prospects and tightened the credit enviro nment for local
firms. Realizing the situation, the World Bank quickly mobilized an additional US$120 million in 2012 to enable the banks to continue
extending credit to SMEs in an environment of constrained funding and growth (estimated at close to 1 percent for 2013). Following
the devastating floods of May 2014, the World Bank supported FBiH in developing a targeted and time-bound emergency support loan
program for SMEs in flood-affected areas using the revolving funds under the project. Additionally, the World Bank enhanced the
flexibility for reprogramming the loans under this project in line with the entity banking authorities’ decisions and included agribusinesses
as eligible SMEs under the project.

The Project Development Objective is to enhance access to finance for SMEs in BiH in the context of the global financial crisis and
the generally constrained conditions for SMEs. The primary beneficiaries of the project are SMEs with growth and export potential that
would benefit from improved access to finance. The project will also help the banking sector in BiH to withstand the global economic
downturn that has triggered financing difficulties for the enterprise sector.
Results achieved:
      By the end of 2014, a total of 142 SMEs had received loans under the Additional Financing project, while as many as 112
         companies (as of July 2012) had been supported via the original SME project to help ease the impact of the economic
         downturn and contribute to the recovery.
      The loans continue to be geographically well distributed, covering all 10 cantons in FBiH and over 20 municipalities in RS,
         and support a wide range of sectors, including food production and processing, wood processing and furniture manufacture,
         metal fabrication, and livestock food production.
      It is estimated that 4,000 jobs were saved and 1,120 new jobs created between August 2010 and March 2013, during the
         implementation of the original project when the figures were last reviewed.

Key Partners: The project was designed in close cooperation with the BiH, FBiH, and RS Ministries of Finance and the BiH Central
Bank. The Central Bank provided statistical data and analysis on demand throughout the project preparation period. The BiH Em ployers’
Association and the Foreign Trade Chamber were consulted in the project.
Key Development Partners: The Bank is coordinating its work on this project with other donors in BiH such as the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), Swedish SIDA, EU Delegation, and USAID.

Since the end of the war, BiH has made tremendous progress in improving its solid waste management (SWM) system. Only a few years ago, there
were no functioning regional sanitary landfills and almost all waste was discarded in unofficial sites such as wild dumps, roadsides, small village
dumps, rivers, and mines, which posed a direct risk to public health. During implementation of the first Solid Waste Management Project (SWMP-
1), which closed in 2010, several municipalities had set up and jointly operated regional sanitary landfills, and an increasing amount of waste was
being managed in compliance with high EU standards. Nevertheless, numerous illegal dump sites can still be found in many municipalities, and
their cleanup and closure remain a high priority that will require setting up functioning sanitary landfills to provide a viable alternative for disposal.
At the same time, advanced regional landfills will start moving to the next level of integrated SWM by introducing advanced separation and recycling
facilities and improving the financial viability of their services. The Second Solid Waste Management Project (SWMP-2) will support both: new
regions that will establish an additional six sanitary landfills by the end of 2014 and the rehabilitation of existing landfills.
The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) improve public health and quality of life by reducing exposure to pollutants and disease vectors
from solid waste; (ii) improve municipal institutional capacity by establishing up-to-date technical and financial solutions for SWM; (iii) enhance
environmental policy by improving the scope and depth of SWM strategies and facilitating recycling and waste-reduction programs nationwide;
and (iv) improve local governance by enhancing cooperation between municipalities.
Results achieved and to be achieved under project:
 Six regional sanitary landfills are operational in Sarajevo, Mostar, Zenica, Tuzla, Bijeljina, and Banja Luka; end-target is eight
   regional sanitary landfills to be operational.
 13 inter-municipal councils have been established.
 Regular monitoring is performed at six operational sanitary landfills (in Sarajevo, Zenica, Tuzla, Banja Luka, Bijeljina, and
   Prijedor); target is nine.
 40 percent out of a targeted 60 percent of regional solid waste utilities are complying with national environmental standards,
   while four utilities (Sarajevo, Tuzla, Zenica, and Mostar) have recycling and/or gas capturing facilities; target is six.
 Six utilities have implemented cost-recovery plans out of a targeted seven.
 Implementation of leachate treatment is in progress in all completed landfills.
 1.05 million people have been provided with access to regular solid waste collection under the project.
 300 wild dumps closed (25 percent of estimated exiting dumps).
 Share of collected solid waste disposed in regional sanitary landfills has increased;
 Regular environmental monitoring has improved, as 50 percent of solid waste utilities monitor compliance with national
   standards.

While BiH experiences some communicable disease challenges (such as the need to increase vaccination rates for measles and diphtheria/pertussis/tetanus [DPT]),
the BiH epidemiological profile is largely dominated by noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer, with some indicators (i.e.,
ischemic heart disease) estimated to be the highest in the South East Europe region. Road accidents, injuries, and suicides are also at high levels. With a rapidly
aging population, the burden of NCDs will continue to increase. The historic organization and financing of the health system in BiH, which was based on a
fragmented primary health care (PHC) system and an increasing bias toward curative services, is not oriented to meet the challenge of the ongoing and increasing
NCD epidemic.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to (i) expand and enhance the family medicine (FM) model of PHC; (ii) build management capacity in the sector;
and (iii) strengthen the policy-making process through the development and implementation of a system for monitoring and evaluating sector performance.
Results achieved: The project successfully achieved the three PDOs. Regarding the restructuring and strengthening of PHC, the FM model has been the single
largest reform implemented by the Government in the health sector. Coverage by FM teams increased from 5 to 80 percent (national average). In FBiH, more than
75 percent of service users expressed their satisfaction with the approach of FM teams in a recent survey. Medical doctors and nurses are being regularly trained for
FM specialization. RS has also been upgrading the clinical skills of its FM teams. The retraining program of its existing FM doctors was completed, FM specializations
are now regularly provided, and training is focusing on enhancing the role played by nurses as a vital component of the PHC delivery system. An IT system and
software application to support business process of FM team and health record are being used across the country. In FBiH, the project financed LAN and IT
equipment for all the PHC facilities (440) and financed software application for eight cantons.
 Similar progress was achieved in the areas of building management capacity, enhancing the policy-making process, and monitoring and evaluating health sector
performance. Health Management Centers (HMC) are fully functional in both entities. From a total of 45 staff having managerial skill in 2004, the HMC succeeded
in training 608 staff by project closing. Since 2010, managerial skills are mandatory for managers at all levels. In the area of policy making, several rulebooks were
developed to standardize the management of facilities; indicators for health services and health outcomes; training for FM teams, and specialization in FM. In
addition, in FBiH, the project supported a process to reach agreement across cantons on a standardized set of indicators and on a methodology for the monitoring
and evaluation of the sector. The methodology was adopted across the 10 cantons and data are being shared at the entity level. Lastly, the project supported the
implementation of health surveys at the national level using a similar methodology for both entities.
Progress toward achieving the PDOs is reflected in the achievement of the project outcomes. 4 out of 5 PDO indicators were achieved (PDO 1 was surpassed,
PDOs 3, 4, and 5 were fully met), and one PDO indicator (PDO 2) was partially achieved.
PDO 1. Coverage of the population through FM teams reached a national average of 70 percent. From about 5 percent of the population in 2004 (FBiH: 130,659,
          RS: 86,270), the coverage reached about 58 percent at the time of the end of the original credit (2010), with FBiH: 1,586,000 (69.0 percent), RS: 1,193,230
          (95.5 percent) (80.2 percent national level), surpassing the goal by the end of the project (September 2014).
PDO2. 260 FM teams and Health Centers in the RS meeting rigorous accreditation standards. From not having in place any accreditation process in 2004, the
          project reached 60 FM teams accredited by 2010. During the accredited process, some teams changed working roles and by the end of the project, 200
          active teams were accredited. This is 23 percent below the goal, and thus this PDO is considered partially achieved.
PDO3. Systemic implementation of selected preventive services in at least two major FBiH cantons. FBiH: implemented results-based payments (based on
          performance of preventive services) in four cantons. Pilots completed. New report system and software adopted.
PDO 4. HMCs operational with an annual budget and regular work plan. FBiH: The HMC was developed as a unit within the Federation PH institute; RS: The
          HMC is fully operational.
PDO 5. The RS Primary Health Care Strategy and the FBiH Primary Health Care Strategy operational plan are updated. FBiH: Operation Plan for 2014 has been
          updated and adopted. RS: The RS Primary Health Care Strategy was updated and is being implemented though it has not been formally approved by
          Parliament.
Key Partners: Ministries of Health in FBiH and RS are leading efforts, supported by various donors and agencies, notably the EU, World Health Organization
(WHO), and the World Bank. The project is cofinanced by the Council of Europe Development Bank (CEB), which contributes a significant percentage of total
project costs (32 percent) toward the financing of civil works and equipment. In addition, the EU is financing a number of complementary activities designed in
close collaboration with the Bank in the areas of: (i) public health; (ii) accreditation and quality assurance; (iii) pharmaceuticals; (iv) hospital provider payment
mechanisms; (v) hospital modernization; and (vi) the functional review of health institutions. Agencies such as the Canadian International Development Agency
(CIDA) and the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation (SDC) have provided considerable support and recently approved a trust fund to finance a project
to reduce Health Risk Factors for Noncommunicable Diseases.

The Water Quality Protection Project focuses on the Neretva and Bosna Rivers. The Neretva River originates in BiH and flows
through Croatia before entering into the Adriatic Sea, and has a strong impact on the water quality of the Bay of Mali Ston. It is
an important source of hydropower, drinking water, and irrigation, but also a source of pollutants for the Adriatic and
Mediterranean. The Neretva Delta is a Mediterranean wetland of international importance and is designated as a Ramsar
Wetlands site. The Bosna River Basin covers the largest and most developed area of BiH. The Bosna River also originates in
BiH and is about 260 kilometers long—BiH’s most developed and industrialized regions are found along this river. Wastewater
from communities and industrial facilities—the concentrated polluters—discharges directly into the river, most of it without
any treatment, and is the major source of pollutants in the Danube.

The Project Development Objective is to further strengthen the capacity of local utilities and to reduce pollution from
municipal sources into the Neretva and Bosna Rivers. The global objective is to reduce municipal pollution and nutrients in the
Adriatic Sea and the Danube Basin.

Results achieved:
 Water Information System (WIS) installed in the water agencies in both entities.
 Rehabilitation of the Trnovo, Odzak, and Zivinice Wastewater Treatment Plants (WWTPs) has been completed and plants
  are fully operational. Construction of the Mostar WWTP is under way.
 8 percent of municipal wastewater is now treated and discharged according to new BiH water environment standards.
 Three key studies have been completed: (i) a Wastewater Improvement Plan for Reducing River Pollution, (ii) Biological
  Monitoring of Rivers, Lakes, and Reservoirs, and (iii) a feasibility study on the low-cost, natural treatment of wastewater.
 Improved cooperation of BiH with institutions in Croatia, Montenegro, and Serbia, leading to an agreement on most aspects
  of the Wastewater Improvement Plan requiring cross-border cooperation.

The Social Safety Net and Employment Support Project (SSNESP) aims to improve the efficiency of social spending, quality
of social services, and efficiency of active labor market programs. It supports ongoing reform in the social protection sector in the
country through technical assistance on improving the targeting methodology in social assistance and strengthening the institutional
capacity to implement the targeting of social benefits.

The Project Development Objectives are to: (i) support noncontributory cash transfers in reaching the eligible poor and disabled;
(ii) improve the efficiency and transparency of benefits administration; and (iii) support job brokerage services for those active job
seekers who become ineligible to receive cash transfers or who are vulnerable (e.g., poor, disabled but able to work, hard-to-serve,
demobilized soldiers, etc.).
Results achieved: The project has provided technical assistance on improving targeting methodologies for noncontributory cash
benefits. Different targeting options were considered and analized in both entities. Proxy Means Testing is the proposed model for
the new social protection legislation that has been drafted in FBiH and for the amendments to the social protection legislation that
is planned for 2015–16 in RS. A total of 40 social welfare centers were rehabilitated (35 in FBiH and five in RS). The upgrading of
the SOTAC management information system used by the social welfare centers was finalized in FBiH and is currently under way in
RS. The upgrade of management information systems used for veteran benefits is under way in both entities. Strong progress was
made in delivering job-brokerage services to the most vulnerable active job seekers. About 10,833 unemployed persons have received
job brokerage support under the project (7,146 in FBiH and 3,687 in RS). Outcomes in terms of employment status after service
provision are positive. In FBiH, 64 percent of beneficiaries were employed six months after the employment services contract had
expired, while 55 percent were employed 12 and even 18 months after the contract had expired. 44 percent of beneficiaries in FBiH
are women. In RS, 54 percent remained employed both six and 12 months after the end of the contract for training, self-employment,
and employment with employers. 52 percent of beneficiaries in RS are women.

Key Partners: The World Bank team is working closely with the FBH Ministry of Labor and Social Policy; the RS Ministry of Health
and Social Welfare; the RS Ministry of Labor and Veteran-Disability Protection; and the Public Employment Funds in the two
entities.
Key Development Partners: Close coordination has been established with the EC and the United Nations Children’s Fund
(UNICEF).

The agriculture sector is and will remain economically important for BiH and is an integral part of the rural economy, providing important
sources of employment for rural inhabitants and having significant backward and forward linkages to the rest of the economy. According
to official statistics, the primary agriculture sector still accounts for approximately 9 percent of GDP and employs more than one-fifth of
the total labor force. Crop yields and potential options for growing high-value crops and double cropping are restricted without irrigation,
primarily due to prolonged dry spells during the summer season. Typical yield losses are estimated to be in the order of 30 –40 percent in
the southwest, while in the northern areas along the Sava river plain, typical yield losses amount to 20–30 percent, with less in the central
and mountain areas. In addition, in many of the plains and valleys, productivity also regularly suffers from waterlogging and inundation.
Thus, drainage is as important as irrigation.

The Irrigation Development Project aims to improve the performance of the irrigation systems and the irrigation institutions to support
agricultural producers in the project areas.

The Project Development Objective would be achieved through: (i) rehabilitating irrigation and drainage infrastructure, including
construction, reconstruction, upgrading, and modernization, on existing agricultural land; (ii) introducing new technologies in irrigated
agriculture; and (iii) promoting institutional development, strengthening water resources management institutions, and introducing a
participatory approach to water management. The project would support better water resources planning and management for the
sustainable use of the water resources in irrigation and drainage, mitigation of the impact of droughts and floods, and in general preparation
of more suitable adaptation strategies that can also cope with climate change.
Expected results: The project will support better water resource planning and management for the sustainable use of water resources in
irrigation and drainage and the mitigation of the impact of droughts and floods, and in general help prepare more suitable adaptation
strategies to also cope with climate change.

Progress thus far: Progress toward reaching the Project Development Objective has been satisfactory. Works have been completed in
three subproject sites (two sites in RS and one in FBiH), worth around US$8 million, or 20 percent of total project costs. In parallel, for
these sites, agreements are under way with municipalities and Water User Associations (WUAs) to modernize the water-monitoring systems
and to train farmers on improved irrigation practices. In parallel, works are ongoing on the remaining subprojects from the first batch (in
Siroki Brijeg and Gorazde). The second batch of irrigation schemes has been selected in RS and the design and supporting studies are
under way. In FBiH, the preselected subprojects for the second batch were affected by the May 2014 floods, and therefore their
participation in the project activities is still pending, awaiting the final decision of municipal authorities.

The project aims to support the development of a sustainable real estate registration system with harmonized land register and
cadastre records in the urban areas of BiH. The Real Estate Registration Project (RERP) and its predecessor, the Land
Registration Project (2007–12), are part of a programmatic approach toward supporting a well-functioning land administration
system in BiH by 2016. The RERP will support this goal with a focus on the scaling-up of cadastre activities and on the
sustainability of land registration and cadastre institutions.

The beneficiaries of the project will be (i) the public, which can own, lease, and use real estate under the protection of the legal
registration of rights, (ii) the business community, which can invest more, relying on the secure access to real estate and improved
access to credit, (iii) the government institutions and municipalities that can make use of the online access to accurate spatial
information to increase their revenues and inform their decision making, and (iv) real estate registration institutions that will gain
from more sustainable operations and staff policies.
Society overall will benefit from improved land governance supported by the up-to-date and accessible spatial information on
real estate and on their transactions, which will increase accountability and informed decision and policy making concerning land,
real estate, and natural resources.

Results achieved:
Project implementation is progressing well, with many activities under way. In RS, the Real Estate Cadastre establishment is
ongoing in 62 Cadastre Municipalities (CMs), while work has been completed in six CMs. The Vulnerability Mapping (VM) has
been conducted in 112 CMs. Geodetic and computer equipment has been purchased for harmonization teams, 160 commissions
have been contracted, and technical specifications for vectorization and cadastral database creation have been finalized. Tender
for the development of a new coordinate system is under way. In FBiH, harmonization is ongoing and vulnerability mapping
has been conducted in seven CMs, and the reports produced. FBiH Geodetic Administration has started public awareness
activities. The RS Geodetic Administration has finalized tender documentation for the development of the new coordinate
system and also finalized the purchase of two offices, while the purchase of the remaining offices is under way. FBiH has initiated
office renovation activities.

Relative to the size of the country, the forest resources of BiH are among the richest in Europe in terms of their extent and variety.
BiH has a total forest area of 3.2 million hectares, covering some 62 percent of the total land area, making it the most forested
country in Europe. The rural population (estimated to be 2 million) considers the forests to be an important source of employment,
energy (wood fuel for heating, largely from forest residues), and recreation. As BiH is a mountainous country, forests also have
important watershed protection values, especially for the middle and lower Danube.

Some 17 percent of the forest areas are classified as low, degraded forests, while an additional 6 percent of the forest estate is
classified as underutilized pasture land or bare landscapes. Improved forest management would allow BiH to take advantage of
timber production values, providing income for local people while also protecting environmental values associated with watershed
protection. Potential climate change hazards such as fires and pests threaten vulnerable forest lands and the economic
opportunities they otherwise might provide; sustainable management reduces their vulnerability.

The Project Development Objective is to build the capacity of forest sector stakeholders and demonstrate approaches for
sustainable forest and land management through the integrated management of vulnerable forest, scrub, and pasture landscapes.

The Project addresses key issues through support to: i) enhanced planning and monitoring for sustainable management; and,
ii) the demonstration and replication of sustainable management techniques in vulnerable areas.


Expected results: Procurement planning and tendering procedures are well advanced, with a view to addressing high-priority
issues that were seasonally constrained in 2014. These include investments in equipment for firefighting for the summer fire
season, as well as the commencement of forest seedling nursery operations in anticipation of an autumn afforestation program on
degraded and vulnerable lands on the national forest estate. Ongoing efforts in both ministries will support forest monitoring and
certification efforts that improve access to continental export markets. A total of 3,000 hectares of land are being directly addressed
over the project lifetime, of which 600 will be in the first calendar year. Cooperation with the Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) prior to effectiveness has involved training in information systems suitable for carbon monitoring on the forest estate.


Key Partners: The Bank is working closely with: the Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management, and Forestry in FBiH; and the

The Project Development Objective of the Energy Efficiency Project for Bosnia and Herzegovina is to demonstrate the
benefits of energy-efficiency improvements in public sector buildings and support the development of scalable energy-
efficiency financing models.

The project has three components. The first component, energy-efficiency investments in public facilities, will support energy-
efficiency investments (subprojects) in schools, hospitals, and clinic centers. This component will finance energy-efficiency
upgrades as well as related technical consultancy services (for example, energy audits, technical and social monitoring and
evaluation, technical designs, supervision, and subproject commissioning). The second component, support for the
development of scalable financing mechanisms and capacity building, will support the development of sustainable energy-
efficiency financing mechanisms in the public sector, strengthen implementation capacity, and help to increase public
awareness on energy efficiency. The third component, project management, will ensure effective project management by the
project implementing units (PIUs) through financing additional experts, training PIU staff, and covering incremental operating
costs.

Key Partners: Ministry of Physical Planning of FBiH and Ministry of Physical Planning, Civil Engineering and Environment
of RS.

Key Development Partners: The World Bank is cooperating with the USAID, which is preparing detailed energy audits for
several buildings likely to be included in the BEEP; the FBH PIU is also cooperating with the Swedish and Swiss Embassies
for additional support for subproject preparation activities.

The objective of the Drina Flood Protection Project for BiH is to provide increased protection from flood events to agricultural and
commercial interests and communities in the project areas.
There are two components to the project. The first component is flood protection works and support for the Bijeljina area. This component
will fund civil engineering works and related investments in flood protection in the Bijeljina area, in the downstream flat plains near the
confluence with the Sava River. This includes resources for the Agriculture Project Coordination Unit (APCU) at the RS Ministry of
Agriculture, Forestry and Water Management (MoAFW), including staff for procurement and financial management (FM), as well as
technical assistance as may be required for the supervision of works and contract management and the provision of administrative and
coordination support to the RS Waters Institution in Bijeljina, which will support the project at the technical level.
The second component is flood protection works and support for the Gorazde area. This component will fund civil engineering works
and related investments in flood protection in four clusters of works in the Bosnia Podrinje Canton (around Gorazde), in the Middle Drina.
This includes resources for the Project Implementation Unit (PIU) at the FBiH Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry
(MoAWF), including staff for procurement and FM, as well as technical assistance as may be required for the supervision of works and
contract management and the provision of administrative and coordination support to the Sava River Watershed Agency in Sarajevo, by
which the project is technically supported.
Expected results:
    i.   avoided damages of agriculture production on land likely to suffer frequent floods;
   ii.   avoided damages of assets (private houses, apartment houses, industrial facilities, roads, electricity, schools, kindergartens, health
         facilities, and other public buildings);
  iii.   avoided losses of business due to uninterrupted production, provision of services, interrupted communications, traffic disruption,
         etc.;
  iv.    avoided human health costs due to reduction of the pollution in the water supply systems, reduced water borne diseases, and
         reduced risks of human life losses;
  v.     increased recreation benefits, including tourism development;
 vi.     indirect economic development effects.

Key Partners: The Bank team is working closely with the Ministry of Finance and Treasury of BiH, RS Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry
and Water Management, and FBiH Ministry of Agriculture, Water Management and Forestry.

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the World Bank Group, is lending to MF Banka to support the bank’s
lending to micro and small enterprises in Bosnia and Herzegovina.

The investment in MF Banka, a new IFC client, would help scale up the bank’s lending capacity to underserved micro and small
enterprises (“MSEs”) in BiH. Located in Republika Srpska, MF Banka is an ideal partner for IFC’s microfinance strategy in Central
and Eastern Europe, which seeks to create and support commercially viable financial institutions able to attract enough capital to
diversify and expand their MSE products. MF Banka is the only dedicated MSE market player in BiH with a banking license and
therefore seeks long-term funding to sustain dynamic growth and offer new products to targeted customers. With a successful
MSE lending track record, the bank has a well-defined development strategy and strong capacity to use IFC’s funds to shore up
finance for underserved segments of the economy.

IFC’s expected role and additionality:

       Longer-term resources for MSE lending: This project would provide long-term funding, now limited from other
        commercial sources, thus opening up financing channels with additional longer-term resources to underserved MSEs in
        the BiH economy.
       Building a long-term relationship with Mikrofin group: Through this project, IFC would build a long-term
        partnership with a major MSE bank in BiH, reinforcing the bank’s focus to serve more customers, expand its outreach
        in rural and low-income areas, and promote sustainable best practices in the MSE sector.
The development impact of the project is expected to include:
       Increased access to funding for underserved MSEs in a fragile and conflict-affected state (FCS);
       Demonstration effect by reengaging in the BiH microfinance sector and building confidence in the financial
        sector; and
       Job creation, contributing to economic growth and poverty reduction.

The IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is lending to a Bekto Precisa to support the local manufacturing sector, create
jobs, and generate exports.

An IFC loan of €8 million will enable Bekto Precisa, a local supplier of plastic and metal products for the automotive and electrical
industries, to expand and become more competitive. The investment will allow the company to handle larger orders and facilitate
the partial refinancing and restructuring of its existing debt.

Bekto Precisa’s operations are based in Gorazde, 100 kilometers east of Sarajevo, where it employs more than 350 people. The
export-oriented company offers production solutions covering design, engineering, precision tool-making, and molding.

IFC’s expected role and additionality:
    Long-term Financing: The proposed long-term IFC financing will help Bekto Precisa to grow/modernize by
       (i) funding its capital expenditure program to improve its competitiveness by broadening its products’ dimensions; and
       (ii) restructuring its debt through extending the maturity that is not readily available in the market at favorable rates to
       enhance the company’s financial flexibility.
    Corporate Governance Advice: IFC is expected to accelerate the company’s transformation from a family-owned
       business to a more institutionalized firm.
    Global Sector Expertise and Knowledge: IFC will share its global sector expertise and knowledge to help improve
       the company’s lean manufacturing programs and fine-tune its long-term strategic vision to grow beyond its traditional
       customer base.
    Standard Setting: IFC will help the company improve its environmental and social practices to exceed local regulatory
       requirement and be a pioneer in the country.
The development impact of the Project is expected to include:
    On top of the company’s existing labor force, Bekto Precisa is expected to create additional direct skilled jobs in a
       country where the official unemployment rate is around 45 percent.
    Moreover, the multiplier effect is estimated at three times for indirect jobs in small and medium-sized enterprises
       (SMEs) focused on factory and machine maintenance and small mechanical workshops located mainly in Gorazde, a
       small remote mountain town, supporting local micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs).
    The increased sales and production capacity of the company as well as export-oriented production and sales will boost
       the hard currency flow to BiH, with a certain positive impact on the country’s current account deficit and tax revenues.
    Finally, given that Bekto Precisa mainly sources its main processing material and services domestically, which
       corresponds to more than 50 percent of total annual expenses of the company, the project will have a direct positive
       local supply chain impact.

IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, with the support of the Government of Canada, is helping Turkey’s Sisecam Group
enhance competitiveness and cleaner production in its BiH subsidiary, Sisecam Soda Lukavac (SSL), a soda ash producer.

IFC will provide €24 million in financing to Sisecam Soda Lukavac, including €7.5 million from the IFC-Canada Climate Change
Program (CCCP). The loan will help the company improve resource and energy efficiency.

In 2007, IFC provided a €24 million loan to Sisecam to help finance the acquisition of Soda Lukavac, then a loss-making state-
owned enterprise. In 2010, IFC provided another €15 million loan to Sisecam’s subsidiary in BiH. Sisecam has been an IFC client
for over 35 years with multiple investments, first in Turkey and then abroad, as IFC helped finance the group’s expansion into
Bulgaria, Russia, the Balkans, and other countries in Europe and Central Asia.

Canada’s contribution was instrumental, helping to make the financing package viable.

IFC’s expected role and additionality:
    Longer tenor: IFC will provide long-term financing not readily available in the current environment in BiH. IFC funds
       will be in the form of a senior loan.
    Environmental and social support: IFC has worked with the client during previous projects and is continuing its
       efforts to improve its (i) waste management, and (ii) clean production
    Blended finance: CCCP funding to partially finance investment in energy-efficiency equipment
The development impact of the project is expected to include:
    Local enhanced supply chain: An increase in the production capacity will result in an increased demand for raw
       materials from local brine and limestone mines (which sell more than half of their output to SSL) and local
       subcontractors (transportation and catering services), thereby supporting significant employment in the local supply
       chain.
    Employment preservation: Had it not been privatized, the plant would have been shut down, adding to unemployment
       in BiH. SSL is one of the largest employers in the Tuzla area (around 550 people) in a country where the official
       unemployment rate is 45 percent.
    Demonstration effect: IFC’s investment in SSL continues to have a strong demonstration effect, as SSL has become an
       example of a successful privatization and foreign direct investment (FDI) in BiH, an IDA country. This is a South-
       South investment that will also (i) strengthen economic ties between Turkey and BiH; and (ii) send an encouraging
       signal to other foreign investors in the region. The continued success of SSL will increase investor appetite for state
       assets in BiH.

The project in BiH aims to facilitate at least US$120 million of investment into small hydropower plant (SHPP) construction (out
of which US$15 million would be provided by IFC) to support construction of 40 SHPPs, with a total installed capacity of 80
megawatts (MW) that could directly avoid 500,000 tons/year of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions (the estimation is based on a
reduction in coal-fired electricity production).

The Project Development Objectives:
The overall goal of the project in BiH is to create a comprehensive framework to support the development and implementation of
SHPP projects. This goal will be achieved through the systematic implementation of three individual objectives:
    Improve the existing regulatory framework to enable SHPP sponsors to develop and construct feasible SHPPs
    Work with SHPP sponsors to improve their SHPP designs and business plans
    Work with selected financial institutions (FIs) in BiH to improve their internal capacities and knowledge on SHPPs and
       project financing

 Results Achieved:
  Regulatory improvements in both entities led to the adoption of the Renewable Energy Law in RS and the Renewable Energy
     Law in FBiH.
  The Law on Concessions, with a few essential articles drafted by the IFC team, has been adopted by the National Assembly
     of RS.
  The Renewable Energy Action Plan (REAP), the decree on incentives for electricity generation from renewable energy
     sources, and the methodology for determining levies for incentives have been adopted by the Government of FBiH.
     Development of both documents was supported by the IFC team.
  The following reviews of technical design documents were finalized:
      Three SHPPs owned by the Marvel Company
      Three SHPPs developed by Most International
  Renewable energy training to two FIs, UniCredit Bank Mostar and UniCredit Bank Banjaluka, has been delivered.
  IFC’s direct and indirect work in BiH’s renewable energy sector has led to the commissioning of a total of 53 renewable
     energy plants since the program began, generating annually an additional 98,283 megawatt hours (MWh) of clean energy.

IFC will provide transaction advisory support to the Government of FBiH through the Public Company of Motorways
Federation of BiH to assist with the implementation of a road project under a public-private partnership (PPP) scheme. This
will include the upgrading, operation, and maintenance of a section of the Corridor Vc motorway between Karuse and
Poprikuse in FBiH. The project is a critical enabler of the Government’s objective of improving the road network in the
country. IFC will conduct its mandate in two phases. In phase one, IFC will carry out technical, commercial, legal, and
regulatory due diligence for the project and will present the proposed transaction structure to the FBiH Government. As part
of phase two and following the approval of the proposed transaction structure by the Government, IFC will assist the latter
with implementing an open and transparent competitive bid to select a private developer for the project.

The Project Development Objectives:

The objective of this project is to assist the Government of FBiH with structuring and implementing a successful tender
process for the selection of a private concessionaire that will upgrade, operate, and maintain the motorway section between
Karuse and Poprikuse. Successful implementation of the project will improve access to road infrastructure for Bosnian and
foreign drivers and facilitate trade and tourism in the region. The program is supported by three donor partners: Austria,
Norway, and Switzerland.


Results Achieved:
  Signed mandate with Motorways of FBiH for a 40-kilometer section on the Corridor Vc.
  Legal, technical, and financial due diligence has been completed. Recent client deliverables include: recommended
     transaction structure and summary term sheet and risk allocation matrix
  Awaiting feedback from the Government before committing to the next tender phase.

The project works to address the microfinance crisis that originated with sector over-liquidity in 2008. Principally, the project aims
to strengthen the delivery of responsible and quality microfinance services in BiH. The focus of the project is to help create policies
for a better environment ensuring more efficient and effective microfinance operations; cooperation with the SMART Campaign,
which measures the level of adherence to the internationally recognized principles of consumer protection; and addressing the issue
of over-indebtedness of microfinance clients. To this end, the project works at mainstreaming the debt counselling, developed
during Phase I of the project, to local municipalities and free legal aid offices. This work establishes a solid exit strategy and
strengthens the capacity of local institutions in providing services to the population on this issue. During this time, the Debt Advice
Centre “UPlusu,” also established during Phase I of the project, serves as a resource center for debt counseling.

The Project Development Objectives:

The overall objective of the project is to further the development of the microfinance sector in BiH by improving the conditions
for microfinance institutions (MFIs) to conduct their business on a sustainable basis under post-crisis conditions. Specifically, the
project aims to maintain a microfinance portfolio in the country at a sustainable level of US$350 million while driving down the
level of nonperforming microfinance loans from 8.2 to 4.0 percent. These development impact indicators are expected to be
achieved by 2016.
Results Achieved:
     Altogether, 19 municipalities have already received training in debt counseling, launching free debt advice services in the
      local communities, and nine more have signed up for training in the first quarter of 2015, resulting in 81 debt restructuring
      cases resolved in the period July–December 2014 alone, out of 163 clients counseled.
     Three BiH microcredit organizations (MCOs) have received the SMART Campaign’s certification for treating clients
      responsibly, among the first six such MFIs in the world to receive this rigorous certification in 2014. The same three MCOs
      applied for recertification in 2015, demonstrating continued understanding of the benefits that SMART certification brings
      in terms of responsible financing, and the process is gaining credibility with clients and MCOs. No legislative changes have
      been made in the sector, but there has been a notable decrease in multiple borrowing by microfinance clients, as evidenced
      by IFC’s annual over-indebtedness study.
     In terms of policy reforms, together with EBRD, KfW, and the European Fund for South Eastern Europe (EFSE), a joint
      policy-level approach related to the necessary microfinance sector reforms has been agreed. The first microfinance
      transformation, one of the project goals, has been accomplished in FBiH.

Key Partners: U Plusu, a nonprofit debt counseling service provider, Central Bank BiH, FBiH Banking Agency, RS Banking

The project proposes programmatic assistance on the national, entity, cantonal, and municipal levels of government. The proposed
project will provide critical regulatory, agribusiness, and investment policy tools to help BiH in its EU accession process, reduce
the administrative burden to businesses, assist governments in attracting FDI and increasing exports, and assist in enabling a single
economic space.

The Project Development Objectives:
The project goal is to increase the competitiveness of BiH by assisting selected governments at all four levels in the country to
achieve investment climate reforms. The proposed project will provide critical regulatory and investment policy tools to help BiH
in its EU accession process, reduce the administrative burden to businesses, and attract FDI. In this respect, agribusiness will be
a key sectoral focus of the project. The project is well on track with implementation, with project targets being met or exceeded
six months before project close.
Results Achieved:

Regulatory simplification work on the local, cantonal, entity, and national levels has led to direct and verified private sector savings
for businesses in the amount of US$6.49 million, and US$106 million in savings in indirect costs (waiting and processing time for
companies). This is a result of streamlining the process for licenses, permits, approvals, etc., reducing the processing time and
fees, and eliminating information requirements and unnecessary documents in many cases. The project has also resulted in over
US$30 million in new investments/reinvestments in BiH facilitated by project partners.

Furthermore, a regulatory impact assessment has been introduced as a mandatory regulatory quality control mechanism in FBiH.
This is the first time this kind of regulatory governance system was introduced in FBiH, aiming to improve the quality of
regulations. In addition, several significant legal acts have recently been adopted: Law on Registration of Business and Law on
Offenses in FBiH, Law on Spatial Planning and Construction in RS, Law on Construction in Zenica-Doboj Canton, Law on
Construction in Tuzla Canton, and secondary legislation on provisions related to food information for consumers at the national
level. In cooperation with the RS and FBiH Ministries of Agriculture, the Governments of RS and FBiH adopted strategies for
increasing competitiveness and FDIs in three value chains (fruits, vegetables, and diary).

Finally, transparency has been improved by creating online electronic registers at the national, entity, cantonal, and local levels (a
total of 14 registers created), with online information about requirements for licenses, permits, costs, documents, and forms. Such
information did not exist before in online format for each of the government levels.

IFC will provide demand-driven corporate governance advisory services based on its established delivery methodology. Specifically,
the project will: 1. Build on the capacity of certain partner institutions in selected countries in Europe and Central Asia (ECA) to
deliver corporate governance services in their markets. The project will provide training/capacity building to partner institutions,
based on IFC’s corporate governance methodology and according to their needs and capacity. Such training is expected to include
the training of trainers and lead to the development of sustainable training institutions. 2. Provide corporate governance advisory
services to targeted companies with the aim of helping them improve their business performance and reach new investment and/or
financing. 3. Provide advice to local regulators and other relevant stakeholders on the corporate governance framework.

The Project Development Objectives:
    The project’s overall goal is to improve the current state of corporate governance and the delivery of corporate governance
       services, building on corporate governance project activities previously undertaken by IFC in ECA. Through the project,
       IFC aims to leave a sustainable legacy for the delivery of corporate governance training and services by local institutions
       in selected countries. IFC also expects such partner institutions to raise sales revenue from the delivery of corporate
       governance services. IFC also aims, through its firm-level work in the ECA region, to improve the performance of
       companies, as well as their ability to raise financing, through recommended improvements to their corporate governance
       practices.

Results Achieved:

Two local consultancies have been receiving intensive training in corporate governance and have started providing advisory services
to companies (eight in-company engagements to date) based on acquired knowledge. The BiH Institute of Directors has been
established with project support and is continuously receiving capacity-building support. Three comprehensive corporate
governance assessments were conducted in BiH, including one for IFC investment client, Bekto Precisa. Comments on the FBiH
Company Law have been provided as part of the Regulatory Impact Assessment process. One regional research and conference

The project/program will work to simplify tax administration procedures to reduce tax compliance costs, particularly for SMEs,
and improve the legal framework and efficiency of international taxation procedures, with a focus on Transfer Pricing (TP) and
Double Taxation Treaties (DTT). Specifically, the project will start by focusing on Albania, where it will provide advisory services
to the Ministry of Finance.

The Project Development Objectives:
    The project goal is to improve transparency and legal/regulatory certainty in tax procedures for international and
       domestic investors through the alignment of standards (TP and DTT) and simplified processes. The secondary goal is
       to improve overall compliance and contribute to an improved investment environment. The program will contribute
       and benefit from ongoing Tax Transparency and TP product development to quantify the link between international tax
       process alignment and investor decision making. The project has two objectives that will be achieved by the end of the
       project.


Results Achieved:

The respective ministries of finance (national and entities) and tax administration have been receiving intensive training on key
aspects of the legal framework for TP and DTT, covering topics such as permanent establishment, beneficial ownership,
residencies, taxation of interests and dividends, and intra-group services. Both the FBiH Corporate Income Tax Law and the RS
Law on Amendments and Changes to the Corporate Income Tax Law drafts are currently in their respective parliamentary
approval processes.

REGIONAL PROJECT - TRADE LOGISTICS WESTERN BALKANS BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA
Key dates:
Start Date: September 01, 2011
Effective: August 30, 2013
End date: June 30, 2014
Total Budget: US$2,152,061
Donor: European Union




The Western Balkans Trade Logistics Project aims to reduce the regulatory and administrative bottlenecks to cross-border trade
in the region through more streamlined export, import, and transit procedures; closer and more harmonized inter-agency
cooperation in-country and between countries; and wider use of electronic systems for data exchange, risk-based controls, and
trade logistics–related payments. The objective of the project is to improve the competitiveness of the private sector in the
region through more efficient access to regional and global markets. The activities implemented by the project are to result in
US$10 million in private sector savings. The project is implemented by IFC in partnership with the EU and is being delivered
in close cooperation with the Central European Free Trade Agreement (CEFTA).
Project Development Objectives: (i) Reduction in the number of documents and days needed for goods to be exported and
imported; and (ii) Streamlined procedures for the flow of cargo by road, air, and river.
Results Achieved:
    The project has succeeded in increasing the working hours of the federal inspectors at the three most frequented border
        crossing points (BCPs) with Croatia (BC Izačić, BC Orašje, and BC Šamac-Domaljevac) in order to align them with the
        working hours of customs. About 70 percent of the entire trade volume for FBiH is conducted through these three border
        points. This alignment shortens the total lead time for the clearance of goods, resulting in savings for the private sector.
        According to data obtained from the agencies for 2013, this reform has shortened the lead time throughout the year for
        clearing goods by the phytosanitary agencies by a monthly average of 10.56 percent since January 2013.
       The project assessed the procedures of cargo flow at two ports on the river Sava. It also identified the absence of a customs
        post at the Brcko port, which was provided for in the legislative framework. The implementation of this post will be
        followed up on. The Council of Ministers adopted a decree on July 17, 2013, requiring the Indirect Tax Administration
        (ITA) to deliver a report about the establishment of a Customs Unit within the Port of Brcko within 30 days. However, the
        ITA turned down the establishment of a Customs Unit within the Port of Brcko.
       The project performed a review of the fees currently imposed by entity inspectorates and has made recommendations for
        reductions in both the number and amount. The project participated in the organization of a joint meeting of two entity
        inspectorates, which resulted in the signing of a Protocol about the harmonization of fees and procedures between these
        two inspectorates. The outcome of these initiatives was to lower the fees for the Quality Certificate at the border that is
        submitted by the Federal Directorate for Inspection Affairs FBiH by an average of 39.83 percent in direct costs.
      The project hosted the first Risk Management Methodologies workshop, which was designed as an introductory workshop
       in sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) agencies in charge of regulating the import and export in/out of BiH. The goal was to
       discuss the perspectives of facilitating processes/procedures involved in trade and the need for practical opportunities to
       particularly improve risk-based SPS border controls. As an outcome of this event, the team has received open interest from
       the Veterinary Office of BiH for the implementation of work assistance. The practical work with the Veterinary Office of
       BiH has been completed, providing the SOP, Concept Note, and Annual Sampling Plan papers based on Risk Management
       (RM) Methodology. Completed the final practical training for the veterinary border inspectors. Implementation of the RM
       was in place at the start of 2015.

BiH covers three globally significant ecosystems and several smaller-scale globally important sites. It is estimated that BiH has
the highest proportion of threatened plant species of any European country, and yet by the mid-2000s, it had only 0.55 percent
of land set aside as protected areas—the lowest level in Europe. Protected areas were generally underfunded, relying heavily
on resource extraction for revenues. Additionally, staff working in protected areas had little or no experience in applied
management approaches for ecosystems-based management and new management fields, such as sustainable tourism and
participatory conservation. Broad consensus on expanding the protected area network existed in both entities, to protect key
biodiversity and cultural assets and to provide new income opportunities for local residents.

The Project Development Objective was to strengthen the institutional and technical capacity for sustainable protected
area management and expand the BiH network of forest and mountain protected areas.

The Project addressed key issues through support to: i) protected area development, including planning, monitoring, and
building facilities; ii) enhanced capacity and support for biodiversity conservation; and iii) local initiatives in biodiversity
conservation.


Results achieved: In FBiH, protected area management plans have been completed and adopted for the Una National Park
and Blidinje Nature Park. In RS, all management plans and related protected area baseline ecological assessments for the
national parks and forest reserves have been finalized. Numerous small works and rehabilitation efforts have been realized in
all the protected areas, including tourist viewing centers, bicycle paths, and research and office accommodations. A capacity
to address critical firefighting threats has been built. Overall, protected areas now make up about 2.6 percent of the land area,
compared with only 0.55 percent at the time of Board approval.


Key Partners: The Bank team worked closely with: the BiH Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations, the Ministry
of Tourism and Environment in FBiH; and the Ministry of Spatial Planning, Civil Engineering and Ecology in RS. They are
also collaborating with the Ministries of Agriculture, Water Management, and Forestry in both entities along with cantonal
and municipal institutions.

The countries of Southeast Europe, including BiH, the EC, bilaterals such as USAID and CIDA, and international financial
institutions (IFIs) cooperated to develop a regional energy market—the Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE,
now called the “Energy Community”)—and integrate it into the internal energy market of the EU.
Project Objective: This project facilitated BiH’s participation in the regional energy market through investments to improve
dam safety; reduce adverse environmental impacts at thermal power stations; replace aging existing facilities and equipment
at hydropower and thermal power stations; and rehabilitate distribution systems.
The Project maintained electricity generation in BiH at or above base levels. Environmental compliance improved at Kakanj,
Tuzla, Ugljevik, and Gacko thermal power plants. Dam safety measures were recommended at Grabovica, Salakovac,
Jablanica, Rama, Trebinje II, Visegrad, and Bocac hydropower plants. A previous project (Power III) started a pilot activity
for the implementation of a Financial Management Information System, which has since been scaled up throughout the
enterprise by EPHZHB; the other two power utilities (EPBH and EPRS) are also scaling it up. This system would help
improve management control, governance, transparency in power trade and accounting, and the commercial integration of
the BiH power system with the regional energy market.
Results achieved:
     Environmental compliance improved at Kakanj, Tuzla, Ugljevik, and Gacko thermal power plants.
     Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP) at Kakanj is functioning better than the contracted performance levels and has helped
      improve air quality in the vicinity as registered by the project-supported environmental monitoring system, which is
      fully operational.
     Wastewater treatment, water cooling system rehabilitation, and ash handling at Ugljevik and Gacko have also helped
      improve environmental performance, through decreasing the overall environmental impact (emissions) into the
      environment and through the improved and more rational use of natural resources (primarily water).
     Better coal handling in Tuzla indirectly helps improve environmental performance through improved combustion of
      a more homogeneous coal mix.

Although road traffic in and around the major urban areas in BiH was growing 5 percent per year, the quality of the road
network was inadequate, despite a decade of substantial expenditures. Large expenditure needs that reflected a legacy of
conflict and neglect were not fully met. Road safety remains a serious social and public health issue in BiH. The state of the
road network, driver behavior and limited driver education, poor or nonexistent traffic law enforcement, and significant
growth in vehicle ownership and use have increased traffic accidents—there were 436 fatalities and 8,470 injuries in 2004. The
2008 rates declined slightly to 5.3 fatalities per 10,000 vehicles, but the rate is still nearly three times higher than the EU27
average. Hence, road safety was a significant and growing concern that required a comprehensive response.

The Project Development Objectives were to reduce user costs on the priority sections of the trunk and regional roads,
improve road safety, and modernize road maintenance practices.

The Project addressed a range of interconnected sector issues by (i) the financing of main and regional road and bridge
rehabilitation; (ii) the financing of technical assistance to implement the recommendations of the 2007 Road Safety
Management Capacity Review; and (iii) technical assistance on the introduction of output and performance-based road
maintenance contracts on a pilot basis in each entity.
Results achieved:
 Out of 241 kilometers of roads to be rehabilitated by the project and financed from IDA credit, 121 kilometers were
     rehabilitated in FBiH and 172 in RS, which has reduced project road-user costs by 11 percent in RS over 2007–12 and
     by 18 percent in FBiH between 2004 and 2012.
 There was significant progress on the development of the institutional framework for road safety, with the approval of
     entity-level road safety strategies and the establishment of a road safety agency in RS.
 Modernization of road maintenance was progressing more slowly, with a pilot-output and performance-based
     maintenance contract signed in March 2010 in FBiH and in June 2012 in RS. It is still too early to ascertain with
     accuracy the efficacy of the new maintenance method in FBiH.
Key Partners: The (i) Federation Road Directorate and the Republika Srpska Road Directorate; (ii) RS Ministry of Transport
and Communications; and (iii) state and entity Ministries of Transport and Communications.
Key Development Partners included EBRD and EIB, which provided parallel financing as part of a program of US$210
million of magisterial and regional roads rehabilitation, with the former providing US$75 million and the latter €80 million
(US$105 million). The EBRD contributed to the introduction of output- and performance-based maintenance contracts, while
the EIB financed preparation and design for rehabilitation work. Government of Norway.

Property registration systems in BiH have been in disarray since World War II, when many of the records and documents
relating to property were destroyed. The situation was made worse during the 1992–95 war, when more records were lost and
people were displaced, sometimes permanently, and legal records often no longer matched up. The informal development of
large areas occurred because of the difficulty in getting permission to build or occupy property. The breakdown in institutional
capacity and the deterioration of land and property records make it very difficult to complete basic real estate transactions,
develop property, or borrow money based on property as collateral. Property development in urban areas is also restricted
because of inadequate urban planning documentation and the uncertainty caused by a real property restitution initiative.
The Project Development Objective was to facilitate the orderly development of transparent land markets through the
registration of real estate rights and complimentary policies that enable transactions to be made with security and efficiency.
The Project has addressed the issue of building effective registration and cadastre systems by (i) improving the transparency,
speed, and accuracy of registering property transactions; (ii) improving the efficiency and speed of providing data on property
units for clients wishing to register their property rights; and (iii) developing the strategies and draft legislation required for
removing the impediments to business development and economic growth that exist in the land administration sector.
Results achieved:
 New service standards developed and adopted. Registration took many months prior to commencement of the project in
     2007, but now there are backlogs in only two courts: Banja Luka and Mostar. In FBiH, booklets explaining the service
     standards have been distributed to all courts for the public to review or take copies. A customer survey conducted in
     February 2010 across the country identified an increased quality of services and timeliness, the improved professionalism
     of staff, and better access to information.
 97 percent of property folios digitized in RS and 96 percent in FBiH. 1.9 million hectares of cadastre maps have been
     digitized, exceeding the project target of 1.4 million hectares.
 Over 18,000 cases from the backlog have been resolved since 2007, at a time when new registration requests have
     increased by almost 100 percent. Improvements were made in service delivery and to the physical infrastructure of 37
     offices, and opportunities for corruption have been largely eliminated. Requests can be processed in a matter of minutes.
 New legislation covering land registration, spatial planning, cadastre, property taxation, and regularization of informal
     developments have been drafted and some enacted during the period of the project.
Key Partners: At the state level (BiH), the project worked with (i) the Advisory Board, with the participation of each entity
and the state government; (ii) the Ministry of Justice at the entity level; (iii) the Geodetic Administration (GA) in RS and
municipal and cantonal governments in FBiH; (iv) Ministry of Finance at the state, entity, and cantonal levels; and (v) Ministry
of Spatial Planning (at various levels).
Key Development Partners: SIDA, Austrian Development Agency (ADA), German Society for International Cooperation
(GTZ), USAID, and the EU.

On August 4, 2011, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$43.1 million for reinsurance of the SID Bank, Inc.;
Ljubljana coverage to the Mercator retail group (Mercator) in Bosnia and Herzegovina (BiH). MIGA is
reinsuring the investment for a period of up to six years against the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation,
and war and civil disturbance.

MIGA’s support to SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana is in accordance with MIGA’s mandate to cooperate with national
entities of its member countries, as stated in MIGA’s Convention. By providing facultative reinsurance, MIGA
is allowing SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana to reduce its net exposure to Mercator and to free up capacity for other
investment insurance projects.

Mercator is helping to stimulate exports between Balkan countries by carrying goods from the other countries
in each of its retail locations. As a result, Mercator is expanding the venue for suppliers to sell not only in their
respective countries, but also in neighboring countries where Mercator has an established presence. In addition,
Mercator’s further expansion in the Balkans, supported by SID Bank, Inc.; Ljubljana and MIGA, will provide
employment and retail training opportunities in these countries.

MIGA is also helping to establish best practices with respect to corporate governance as well as environmental
and social policies in the host countries.

On December 22, 2010, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$12.5 million to ProCredit Holding (PCH), covering
its investment in its subsidiary in BiH. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of
expropriation of funds for mandatory reserves held by the subsidiary in the central bank of its jurisdiction.

This project is part of a master contract that MIGA has issued. PCH is headquartered in Germany and is the
parent company of 21 banks (ProCredit group). The ProCredit group is a provider of finance to some 750,000
micro, small, and medium-sized enterprises (MSMEs) in Latin America, Eastern and Central Europe, and
Africa. Throughout the world, banks are required to maintain mandatory reserves with the central banks of
their respective jurisdictions. The ProCredit group’s capital adequacy ratio (CAR) is calculated according to the
German Banking Act. Under this act, at a consolidated level, reserves deposited at the various central banks
can attract a risk weighting of 100 or even 150 percent, depending on the country. This risk weighting
determines the amount of equity required to maintain a specified CAR in accordance with the German Banking
Act.

The guarantee issued by MIGA will help PCH obtain capital relief from the CAR requirements. By obtaining
MIGA’s insurance against the risk of expropriation of funds, the risk weighting for mandatory reserves held at
the central bank can be reduced. A lower risk weighting will allow PCH to free up equity currently tied up for
CAR maintenance purposes, thereby allowing these funds to be injected into its subsidiary banks. This in turn
will allow PCH’s emerging market subsidiary banks across its network to increase their lending activities.

MIGA’s support will help PCH optimize its capital management across its 21 banks, allowing PCH to direct
equity to subsidiaries with the greatest need. These banks will be able to offer additional financial services to
MSMEs at a time of macroeconomic challenges. Supporting productive small businesses will help stimulate
growth, generate employment, and reduce poverty. MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World
Bank Group’s microfinance strategy, which includes improving the supply of microfinance in large but
underserved markets; enhancing deposit capacity by assisting microfinance institutions in savings mobilization;
promoting capacity building; creating and shaping markets; and fostering innovation.

MIGA has issued guarantees of €33.25 to Raiffeisen Zentralbank Österreich AG (RZB) in Austria covering
their €35 million shareholder loans to their subsidiary Raiffeisen Leasing d.o.o. Sarajevo (RLBH) in BiH. The
loans will fund the RLBH’s leasing portfolio. MIGA’s coverage is for a period of up to six years against the
risks of transfer restriction and expropriation of funds.

RLBH leases vehicles (including cars, trucks, and trailers), various types of equipment (including processing,
packaging, and construction equipment), and industrial and office buildings. Loan proceeds are expected to be
used to finance vehicle leases to micro and small-sized enterprises and car leases to individuals.

This project is expected to contribute to the development of the financial sector in BiH by improving access
to finance, particularly to segments of the economy that are currently underserved.

The shareholder loans support RLBH’s ongoing leasing business, thereby contributing toward the continued
development and strengthening of the country’s leasing sector. The leasing sector in BiH is still relatively small
compared to West European countries. Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are especially expected to
benefit from the development of leasing in the country, as they often do not qualify for bank financing and
lack the capital to purchase fixed assets to grow their businesses. SMEs and corporates account for more than
90 percent of RLBH’s leasing volume.

MIGA’s support for this investment is aligned with the World Bank Group’s country assistance strategy in BiH
for 2008–11 and the country’s development objectives, particularly with regard to improving the environment
for private sector–led growth and convergence with Europe.
