REFERENCE GUIDE
This reference guide explains how the Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs) calculate and jointly
report private investment mobilization.

The purpose of the methodology is to recognize and measure the private capital mobilized in
MDB project activities. “From Billions to Trillions: Transforming Development Finance” outlines the
MDBs’ joint commitment to mobilizing increased investment from the private sector and
institutional investors.

    The methodology is focused on assessing the private financing mobilized by an MDB, which must be assessed on a project-by-project basis, since the financing
                             structure for each or activity is unique. These definitions define the sources of financing in a transaction.

                                              Infrastructure
    The MDBs use a common definition to qualify transactions as infrastructure projects.
    Infrastructure is defined as underlying physical foundation or civil works (including integral
    and/or dedicated equipment) that support economic and social development. The following
    sectors are automatically classified as infrastructure:
         • Energy (electricity generation, transmission, distribution)
         • Water and waste management (water and sanitation, solid waste, irrigation, flood
           control)
         • Transport (roads, ports, airports, urban transport, railway, fluvial and maritime transport)
         • Telecommunications
         • IT within infrastructure sectors
         • Social infrastructure (schools, hospitals, etc.)
      
     Captive infrastructure, reserved for the sole use of a firm, is excluded

        Long-term financial instruments have a tenor that is at least one year. Short-term (< 12 month tenor) instruments are tracked and reported separately.

   commitment date is not available.

   MDB’s commitments in each year to the total amount approved by the
