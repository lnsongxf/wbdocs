October 15, 2015   EFFICIENT USE OF TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT

                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
                   Experience shows that there is often ample room for more effective and efficient
                   use of investment tax incentives in low-income countries. Tax incentives generally
                   rank low in investment climate surveys in low-income countries, and there are many
                   examples in which they are reported to be redundant—that is, investment would have
                   been undertaken even without them. And their fiscal cost can be high, reducing
                   opportunities for much-needed public spending on infrastructure, public services or
                   social support, or requiring higher taxes on other activities.

                   Effective and efficient use of tax incentives requires that they be carefully
                   designed. Many low-income countries use costly tax holidays and income tax
                   exemptions to attract investment, while investment tax credits and accelerated
                   depreciation yield more investment per dollar spent. Tax incentives targeted at sectors
                   producing for domestic markets or extractive industries generally have little impact,
                   while those geared toward export-oriented sectors and mobile capital appear to be
                   relatively effective—but the former need to be tempered by considerations of WTO
                   consistency and both can be instances of mutually damaging tax competition. Enabling
                   conditions—good infrastructure, macroeconomic stability, rule of law, etc.—are
                   important for effectiveness.

                   Good governance of incentives is critical for their effectiveness and efficiency.
                   Transparency is necessary to facilitate accountability and reduce opportunities for rent
                   seeking and corruption. Tax incentives should therefore be subject to legislative
                   process, consolidated under the tax law, and their fiscal costs reviewed annually as part
                   of a tax-expenditure review. The approval process of tax incentives may involve several
                   stakeholders, but is ultimately best consolidated under the authority of the Minister of
                   Finance and enforced and monitored by the tax administration. To the extent possible,
                   the granting of tax incentives should be based on rules rather than discretion. Despite
                   political obstacles, several countries have successfully reformed their tax incentive
                   regimes.

                   The proliferation of incentives is largely a manifestation of international tax
                   competition—which regional coordination can help mitigate, although this requires
                   political commitment and an effective supranational enforcement mechanism—which is
                   often lacking. Common reporting standards and data collection can be an important
                   first step toward coordination and enhanced transparency.

                   More systematic evaluations are needed to facilitate informed decision making. In
                   most low-income countries, the effectiveness and efficiency of tax incentives cannot be
                   assessed due to lack of data and the absence of analytical tools and skills. The
                   background document to this report offers guidance on how to develop the data and
                   tools required for systematic analysis. Progress requires concerted action by several
                   stakeholders to ensure evidence-based, transparent decision making.

INTRODUCTION
This paper responds to a request of the G20 Development Working Group for an exploration
of options for low-income countries’ effective and efficient use of tax incentives for
investment.1 To that end, it develops principles for the design and governance of tax incentives and
provides guidance on good practices in these areas. Since much of the pressure to offer incentives
stems from an awareness of those offered by other countries, the paper also discusses options for
international coordination to address the risk of mutually damaging spillovers from such tax
competition. Finally, a separate background document develops practical tools and models that can
help assess the costs and benefits of tax incentives, which is essential for informed decision making.
The aim is thus to assist low-income countries (LICs)2 in reviewing and reforming their tax incentives,
so as to better align them with their developmental objectives.

Investment tax incentives should be viewed as part of broader (tax) policy design. A good
revenue system adopts taxes that are simple, fair and efficient. Tax incentives risk compromising
these principles to the extent that they complicate the tax system, create horizontal inequities, and
distort production efficiency; and they may forgo revenue that could have been spent more
productively or needs to be replaced in other and more damaging ways. At the same time, tax policy
may be able to play a purposive role in improving on market outcomes that are inefficient or unfair.
The economic rationale for tax incentives must thus be evaluated in terms of their ability to achieve
clear goals in ways that are both effective and efficient, relative to alternative policies, both tax and
non-tax, that could achieve the same objectives.

Tax incentives have been a focus of work by international organizations (IOs) for many years.3
This report draws on the ample experiences and insights that IOs have gained from interactions with
countries. IOs and many other observers4 have often found tax incentives to be ineffective,
inefficient and associated with abuse and corruption. As a result, they have frequently advised
countries to remove them or to improve their design, transparency and administration. Yet, this
advice has often had limited effect. The common reluctance to scale back incentives—perhaps even,
as will be seen, a tendency for them to proliferate—may reflect vested interests, political inertia, and
tax competition with other countries. It might also be that observers have underestimated the

  Other countries of course also make extensive use of tax incentives, and much of the analysis below is also relevant
to them.

 Definitions of LICs differ, but usually refer to countries below a certain per capita GNP. The group may consist of
between 30 and 60 countries, depending on the threshold. The analysis in this paper is relevant for a large group of
developing countries and a broad definition may thus apply.
3
  Studies by IOs include Lent (1967), UNCTAD (1996, 2000), Clark (2000), OECD (2001, 2006), Tanzi and Zee (2000),
Zee, Stotsky and Ley (2002), Easson and Zolt (2004), Keen and Mansour (2010), Klemm (2010), James (2013; 2014)
and Zolt (2014). Tax incentives are also frequently discussed and evaluated in technical assistance provided by IOs.

  Some examples are Mintz (1990), Boadway and Shah (1992), Shah (1995), Bird (2000), Eason (2001; 2004), Bolnick

benefits that incentives have generated. Drawing on recent insights from interactions with countries
and an extensive range of academic and other studies, this paper aims to take a fresh look at
incentive policies in LICs in order to develop practical advice for improvement, supported by simple
tools for making progress.5

The analysis in this paper is necessarily selective. In particular, the focus is on:

      Tax incentives, as defined in the next section—thus ignoring non-tax incentives, such as grants,
       in-kind benefits or loan guarantees: such other measures can in principle mimic the effects of tax
       incentives, but are usually designed differently and subject to different governance procedures.

      …for investment—excluding tax incentives aimed at other objectives, such as supporting
       charitable giving or owner occupation or reducing pollution.6 The focus, moreover, is on
       incentives in the tax treatment of business income; governments may also seek to attract
       investment by special treatment in relation to Value Added Tax (VAT) or tariffs, for instance, but
       these are touched on only briefly—both for reasons of space and because income taxation and
       the associated policy concerns have been more prominent in the debate on tax incentives.

      …that are implemented at the national level—those implemented at the sub-national level
       raise other, broader fiscal federalism issues, which go beyond the scope of this paper.7

This paper relates to other global initiatives aimed at strengthening domestic revenue
mobilization in LICs. For instance, there are several initiatives to strengthen tax design and improve
capacity in tax administration in LICs to enhance their ability to mobilize domestic resources,
including through extensive and long-standing technical assistance by the IMF, World Bank and
others. Moreover, the G20/OECD work on base erosion and profit shifting (BEPS) aims to support
the implementation of BEPS outcomes to LICs, as suited to their circumstances, by providing
toolkits. During consultations with developing countries on BEPS, a common concern expressed by
LICs was the extent to which tax incentives erode their tax bases. This concern reflects an important
tension, which was also emphasized by the IOs in their joint report for the DWG in 2011: “Striking
the right balance between an attractive tax regime for domestic and foreign investment, by using tax
incentives for example, and securing the necessary revenues for public spending, is a key policy
dilemma.” (IMF, OECD, UN and World Bank, 2011). The underlying report explores this dilemma in
greater detail.

  All case studies used in the paper aim to illustrate key problems, practices and achievements and are not intended
to provide country-specific recommendations. The choice of our case material is inevitably selective and there could
have been equally valid cases in other countries or periods. In selecting our examples, we used the following criteria:
cases should i) be described in publicly available and easily accessible documentation; ii) obtain a broad regional
coverage; iii) offer insight into either/both good and bad practices; (iv) preferably relate to experiences in LICs,
although experience from other countries is used where this provides concrete and useful examples for LICs.

    While tax incentives can be targeted to ‘green’ investment, this paper does not address this dimension specifically.

 Note that interactions between national and sub-national tax incentives covering the same activities or assets risk
producing unintended and potentially perverse results, such as negative tax burdens for certain industries.

EFFECTIVENESS AND EFFICIENCY
A. Prevalence
In this paper, by a ‘tax incentive’ is meant any special tax provisions granted to qualified
investment projects or firms that provides favorable deviation from the general tax code.
They can take several forms, such as tax holidays (complete exemption from tax for a limited
duration), preferential tax rates in certain regions, sectors or for certain asset types, or targeted
allowances (tax deductions or tax credits) for certain investment expenditures.

Tax incentives have been used to pursue a variety of objectives. The primary motivation is
usually to stimulate investment and—especially in LICs—attract foreign direct investment (FDI). FDI
inflows, for instance, are believed to not only bring capital and (high-wage) jobs to a country, but
can also spur competition and increase the efficiency of domestic markets more widely, thus
contributing to a country’s overall economic development. Empirical growth regressions indeed
generally find positive correlations between inward FDI and economic growth, although conclusions
about causality remain contentious (see e.g. Adams, 2009, for a review of evidence on Africa). Tax
incentive policies also often aim to promote specific economic sectors or types of activities as part
of an industrial development strategy or to address regional development needs.

They are commonplace around the world (Figure 1). The use of tax incentives is widespread, and
extends well beyond LICs. Countries differ with respect to the type of incentives used, with high-
income countries relying more on investment tax credits and favorable tax treatment of research
and development (R&D), low-income countries relatively more often offering tax holidays and
reduced tax rates, and middle-income countries most often having preferential tax zones (in which
income can be tax exempt and other favorable treatments may apply).

Over the last decades, tax incentives have become more widespread in LICs. For instance, in
1980, less than 40 percent of the LICs in sub-Saharan Africa offered tax holidays while free zones
were non-existent. By 2005, more than 80 percent offered tax holidays and 50 percent had adopted
free zones (Keen and Mansour, 2010). The number of countries in sub-Saharan Africa granting tax
holidays and establishing free zones has grown further since (James, 2014). There is also evidence,
however, that the average length of tax holidays has declined somewhat in various regions of the
world (Abbas and Klemm, 2013). With the global declining trend in corporate income tax (CIT) rates,
including in LICs, it might indeed be that the benefit for investors of receiving tax incentives has
somewhat diminished.

Broadly, a tax incentive serves a useful social purpose if the social benefits it generates
exceed the associated social costs. The background document to this report offers a simple
conceptual framework that lends practical substance to this general principle by identifying the key

components that affect the social benefits and costs of tax incentives: these are set out in Box 1.8
The next subsections look in turn at the benefit side of the calculation—the ‘effectiveness’ of
incentives in achieving their aims—and then the cost side—their ‘efficiency’.9

 Sometimes the term ‘wasteful tax incentives’ is used. This concept is not always well-defined, however. This paper
adopts the framework of cost-benefit analysis to identify whether tax incentives are desirable or not.
9
 In principle, this should be assessed taking into account also other ways of achieving the aims of policy: the benefits
associated with a regional tax incentive might be achieved at even lower social cost, for instance, by a regional
spending program. The point is of considerable practical importance, but since the alternative instruments are highly
context-specific, cannot be pursued in detail here.

                                                                                                                            9

                  Box 1. Elements of a Cost-Benefit Assessment of Tax Incentives

 Investment tax incentives ultimately aim to contribute to a country’s development and improved
 living conditions for its citizens. As elaborated on in the background document, the following
 elements are critical for the social benefits:

    Size of the net investment effect—the rise in investment should be corrected for redundancy
     effects (investments that would have occurred without the incentive) and displacement effects
     (the reduction in any other investments) to infer the net incremental increase in capital due to
     the incentive.

    Net impact of higher investment on jobs and wages. New jobs can yield significant social gains if
     they reduce unemployment. However, if new jobs displace existing jobs, the social benefits
     depend on the productivity (and wage) differential between the new and old jobs.

    Productivity spillovers. To the extent that new investment boosts productivity elsewhere in the
     domestic economy, such as in supplying or competing firms (often seen as a particular benefit
     from inward FDI), this magnifies social benefits by raising income levels more widely.

 The social costs of tax incentives depend on the following factors:

    Net public revenue losses—public revenue falls if tax incentives are redundant or create leakage
     and abuse. But additional net investment and jobs can recover some of the revenue loss.

    Administrative and compliance costs, which can rise due to tax incentives, especially if they are
     complex or create opportunities for rent seeking and corruption.

    Scarcity of public funds. Often overlooked is that $1 of tax revenue has a higher social value than
     $1 of private income, because it is the greater value of the public expenditure it finances that
     justifies transferring resources from public to private sectors through distortionary taxes. To
     compare changes in private income and tax revenue, the latter thus need to be weighted by the
     ‘marginal cost of public funds’, which will be greater than unity (as discussed further below).

    Distorted resource allocation. Discrimination in favor of some and against other investment
     implies that taxes, rather than productivity differences, determine resource allocation. This
     distortion reduces average productivity and lowers income per capita.

B.    ‘Effective use’
Effective use is taken here to mean that tax incentives realize their stated objective. This can be
assessed irrespective of associated costs, which will be explored later. Raising investment or FDI is
usually a necessary but not a sufficient condition for ‘effectiveness’, as the higher investment should
be of the kind envisaged to yield the desired social benefits in broader welfare terms.

Empirical evidence finds that taxes matter for investment, although most likely less so in
developing countries. Empirical studies on the relationship between effective tax burdens and FDI
generally conclude that host country taxation significantly affects investment (De Mooij and
Ederveen, 2008).10 Most of this evidence, however, refers to advanced economies. Recent studies
report similar results for developing countries, although the effects tend to be somewhat smaller on
average (James and Van Parys, 2009; Abbas and Klemm, 2013). One reason might be that many
developing countries do not offer attractive general investment conditions for most multinational
companies, due to for instance poor infrastructure, macroeconomic instability, unclear property
rights, and weak governance or judicial systems. In these circumstances, tax incentives do not
effectively counterbalance such poor conditions and are largely ineffective (Kinda, 2014). At the
same time, however, tax incentives might be one of the few (albeit second-best) instruments for LICs
to offset disadvantaged circumstances, address regional disparities and mitigate market failures,
such as lack of financial access.

         Investment surveys confirm that tax incentives usually do not top the list of investment factors
         in developing countries. In 2010, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization
         conducted a business survey of 7,000 companies in 19 sub-Saharan African countries active in
         agriculture, mining, manufacturing, utilities, construction, and services sectors. Investors were
         asked to rank the importance of twelve location factors and to assess how they might have
         changed, improved and worsened, in the last three years (Figure 2). The results suggest that
         tax incentives packages ranked 11th out of 12 in importance; and this importance fell over
         time. For comparison: transparency of the legal framework ranked 5th in investors’ concerns
         and grew in importance. Investors thus seem to care much more about deficient legislation
         and onerous regulations than about the availability of tax incentives (UNIDO, 2011).

Tax incentives are often found to be redundant in attracting investment in developing
countries; that is, the same investments would have been undertaken even if no incentives had
been provided. Table 1 shows redundancy ratios, based on investor surveys in various countries,
measured by the percentage of investors who claim that they would have invested even without tax
incentives. Redundancy levels thus obtained—subject to well-known caveats, such as a discrepancy
between answers and actual behaviors under a counterfactual scenario—are high in most countries.
For example, redundancy rates exceed 70 percent in 10 out of the 14 surveys listed in Table 1. In



10
  FDI comprises different components, such as new plants and equipment, plant expansions, and mergers and
acquisitions (M&A). The evidence is that new plant location choices are more responsive to tax than are incremental
investment increases; and M&A tends to respond to taxation differently from greenfield investment.

                                                                                                                11

     Guinea, Rwanda, Tanzania and Uganda, more than 90 percent of the investments would, it seems,
     have been made even without the incentives.

Effectiveness varies between countries and sectors. In some countries, tax incentives seem to
have played an important role in attracting new investment and spurring economic growth. Famous
examples include Korea and Singapore, where tax incentives—offered as part of a broader strategy
to attract investment—seem to have encouraged rapid industrialization (Tanzi and Shome, 1992).
However, in many instances tax incentives have resulted in little or no new investment, as indicated
by the redundancy ratios in Table 1. Studies offer some insight into the factors determining
effectiveness. For instance, FDI that is resource-seeking (to exploit the presence of natural
resources), market-seeking (to penetrate a local market), or strategic asset-seeking (to exploit local
know-how or technology) is generally found to be less responsive to tax than FDI that is efficiency-
seeking (to exploit cost advantages in production for the world market).11 Indeed, tax incentives
tend to have the greatest salience where investment is oriented toward exporting firms (Grubert and
Mutti, 2004).

       China is often quoted as an example of effective (tax) incentive policies. During its transition period
       between the mid-1980s and mid-2000s, it experimented with a wide range of industrial policy
       instruments, including tax incentives for special economic zones, reduced tax rates for FDI, and tax
       holidays for strategic industries. FDI inflows accelerated during this period and the country became
       a top destination for many multinationals. In a panel of 29 regions between 1985 to 1995, Chen
       and Kwan (2000) find, for instance, that special economic zones systematically boosted FDI inflows.

       Examples of less effective tax incentives can be found in Africa. Figure 3 shows how FDI was
       influenced by changes in investment codes between 1994 and 2006 in countries of the CFA franc
       zone and the Economic Community of Central African States. The vertical lines in the figure denote
       the introduction of new investment codes, such as tax incentives and legal protections. Providing
       more generous tax incentives did not have any demonstrable effect on FDI (Van Parys and James,
       2010).

The effectiveness of incentives in attracting investment also depends on the international tax
rules in place. Multinationals taxed on a “territorial” basis in their home country are able to retain
the benefits of host country tax incentives, since there is no offsetting home country tax on the
foreign source income. Multinationals might be subject to home country tax on foreign source
income due to controlled foreign corporation (CFC) rules12 or tax upon repatriation under a ‘world-
wide’ system—as used in e.g. the US, China and India. The tax incentive can then become ineffective,
since the benefit will be taken away by increased tax payments in the multinational’s home
country—although tax deferral until repatriation of income often effectively mitigates such an
effect.13


11
     This classification of types of FDI is due to Dunning (1993).
12
  CFC rules vary, but are in essence provisions that bring immediately into tax passive income—the complement of
active business income—arising abroad that has not paid at least some minimum amount of tax. For worldwide
countries, CFC rules in principle provide some protection against tax avoidance through deferral; for territorial
countries, they simply ensure that only active income is exempt in the residence country.
13
  Moreover, some tax treaties provide for ‘tax sparing’, whereby the residence country of a corporation determines
the foreign tax credit based on the taxes that would have been paid if the incentive had not existed.

The ability of multinationals to avoid host-country taxes may blunt the impact of tax
incentives—so measures to restrict that ability may make tax incentives more effective. A
multinational that can readily avoid host-country taxes (by, for instance, using interest deductions to
shift profits to a low tax jurisdiction) may see little additional benefit from tax incentives. By the
same token, actions that make such avoidance more difficult, from the G20/OECD BEPS project for
example, would make tax incentives more attractive for them.

Where tax incentives increase FDI, domestic investment may be displaced. Displacement
reduces effectiveness in terms of the net impact of the incentive on the domestic capital stock. This
happens, for instance, if FDI reflects a mere transfer of ownership, through mergers and acquisitions,
or if domestic investment is ‘round tripped’ through a foreign entity to take advantage of the tax
incentive. Displacement can also occur in labor markets, where jobs in new firms come at the
expense of employment in other sectors of the economy.

        Evidence for 40 Latin American, Caribbean and African countries between 1985 and 2004
        suggests that changes in the length of tax holidays systematically increased FDI inflows. These
        FDI inflows did not, however, increase total investment, nor did they increase economic growth.
        This suggests full displacement of domestic by foreign capital (Klemm and Van Parys, 2012).

FDI inflows can yield various other social benefits, such as economic diversification gains,
knowledge and technology spillovers, new management practices, reduced unemployment, and
improved conditions in less-developed areas (Blomstrom and Kokko, 1998; OECD, 2002). FDI
spillovers may impact other firms in the same sector (‘horizontal’ spillovers) and/or

supplying/purchasing firms (‘vertical’). The available evidence—mainly for emerging economies,
rather than LICs—indicates strong empirical support of vertical spillovers, but weaker support for
horizontal spillovers (Box 2).



                           Box 2. Evidence on Productivity Spillovers from FDI

 Empirical studies of horizontal spillovers look at the systematic variation of productivity growth in an
 industry and its intensity of FDI. Early studies for Morocco, Russia and Venezuela find no support for
 such productivity spillovers in manufacturing industries; instead, and counterintuitively, they all report
 negative correlations (Haddad and Harrison, 1993; Aitken and Harrison, 1999; Yudaeva et al., 2003).
 Gorodnichenko et al. (2007) find that horizontal spillover effects are generally insignificant in an analysis
 for 17 countries in Eastern Europe and Central Asia. In a meta-analysis of 32 empirical studies on
 technology spillovers from FDI, Woodster and Diebel (2006) conclude that intra-sectoral FDI spillovers
 are non-existent in developing countries.

 Evidence for advanced economies is usually more supportive of horizontal spillovers. For instance,
 studies using data for the US and the UK typically report positive correlations between domestic plants’
 productivity and FDI intensity (Xu, 2000; Keller and Yeaple, 2003; Haskel et al., 2007). Here, spillovers also
 tend to be more prevalent in high-technology sectors and when own R&D is undertaken, reflecting a
 greater ability to understand and assimilate new technologies (Griffith et al., 2004). Lack of absorptive
 capacity may explain why horizontal spillovers are less prevalent in developing countries.

 Studies on vertical spillovers usually explore backward effects of FDI to domestic suppliers, again by
 measuring productivity gains in the manufacturing sector. A study for Zambia, for instance, finds
 significant knowledge transfers from foreign to local firms (Bwalya, 2006). Similar positive spillover
 effects are found for Indonesia and Lithuania (Javorcik, 2004; Girma et al., 2007). For the 17 countries in
 Eastern Europe and Central Asia, Gorodnichenko et al. (2007) consistently report positive backward
 productivity spillovers. For strategic industries in China, Du et al. (2011) find support for backward and
 forward vertical FDI spillovers.

C. ‘Efficient use’

Efficient use in this paper means that objectives are achieved at low social costs. Such costs
include revenue losses for government and other social costs, for example due to less efficient
resource allocation.

Redundancy matters for efficiency too, since it implies a loss of government revenue from
projects that would have been undertaken also without tax incentives. Redundancy implies that
the tax incentives are a mere cash transfer to the investor: a net social loss to the extent that the
marginal cost of public funds exceeds unity (and an even greater loss in national terms if the
investor is foreign). On the other hand, for projects that would not have been undertaken without
the incentive, there is no direct revenue loss—so long as taxation of the incentivized activity is not
entirely eliminated, there may in fact be a net revenue gain from those projects. To minimize the
revenue cost of tax incentives, the goal would thus be to offer tax incentives only to those marginal
investors who would not have invested otherwise.

Indirect revenue costs arise from taxpayers abusing the tax incentive regime.14 For example, if
tax incentives are only available to foreign investors, local firms may use foreign entities to route
their local investments in order to qualify. Similarly, if tax benefits are available to only new firms,
taxpayers may reincorporate or set up new corporations to be treated as a new taxpayer under the
tax incentive regime. Other leakages occur where taxpayers use tax incentives to reduce the tax
liability from non-qualified activities, for instance, by shifting taxable income to a related firm that
qualifies for a tax holiday or that resides in a tax-free economic zone (McLure, 1999; Eason, 2004).
Preventing such losses requires proper anti-abuse rules and strong administrative capacity to
enforce them.15

           In 2000, the government of India removed incentives for exporters, except those located in
           export processing zones or qualified as export-oriented units. Investment behavior hardly
           changed due to this reform. Indeed, firms that lost their incentives maintained the same level
           of investment as before, despite higher tax rates, similar to the control group that kept their
           incentives. However, reported profits did respond aggressively to the loss of incentives. In
           particular, reported pre-tax profits dropped by half on average in firms that lost their
           incentives, despite little change in sales. In contrast, pre-tax profits in firms that kept their
           incentives showed an increase. Hence, companies seem to have diverted profits from affiliates
           facing higher taxes to those exempt from tax due to the incentives (James, 2007).

           In 1987, Bolivia established a tax credit for exporters based on the growth of their export
           receipts over the previous year. This led to the emergence of what was called “tourist cows”:

14
     See also the top 10 of most frequent abuses listed in Zolt (2014).
15
   Anti-abuse rules can be either specific provisions in the tax law to prevent certain behaviors that are deemed
abusive, or general provisions under which behaviors can be classified as abusive based on a broad characterization
in the law. High-quality legal drafting and a robust administration are necessary to ensure effective anti-abuse
provisions.

16
                                                          TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


        farmers generated tax credits by moving their herds back and forth across the border in order
        to maintain or increase the growth of their “export” receipts. The scheme was eliminated in
        1991 (Rodrik, 1993).

Additional resource costs arise for the government in administering tax incentives and for
businesses in complying with the associated requirements. Of course, any tax comes along with
such costs. However, they generally increase with the complexity of the assessment processes of tax
incentives, and with the opportunities for rent seeking and corruption they might create (as
discussed further in the next section). The additional administrative costs are a particular concern in
LICs, where administrative capacity is often limited. Indeed, scarce resources might be diverted away
from core aspects of a country’s tax administration, undermining other efforts to mobilize revenues.

     In Papua New Guinea (PNG), the taxation review committee recently evaluated its tax incentive
     policies and concluded that one significant concern is the additional complexity they create,
     placing greater demands on already limited tax administration resources. In particular, PNG’s
     experience with the research and development incentive and the infrastructure tax credit have
     highlighted the challenges of implementing or effectively monitoring these incentives in the
     absence of sufficient administrative or technical capacity (PNG Tax Committee, 2014).

A first step to understanding the public revenue forgone as a consequence of tax incentives is
to calculate the implied ‘tax expenditure’ (see background document). Investment tax incentives
are only one form of tax expenditure, by which is meant a provision in the tax code that deviates
from some benchmark tax system in a direction favorable to the taxpayer. A tax expenditure review
quantifies the revenue forgone for each provision, including for investment tax incentives analyzed
in this paper.16 Conceptual complexities arise when performing a tax-expenditure review, including
in defining the relevant benchmark to which tax incentives are to be compared. Importantly, a tax
expenditure review does not take into account either any effect of the incentive on investment or
the leakage and abuse to which it can give rise to. The former may imply an overstatement of actual
revenue cost, since elimination of the incentive might lead to a reduction in the tax base and hence
to less additional revenue (if the rate would still be positive) than a ‘static’ calculation implies. The
latter implies an understatement. As methodologies differ, international comparisons of tax
expenditures are usually difficult.

     Tax expenditure analyses are increasingly being used by developing countries, with strong
     encouragement by and support from the IOs (see e.g. IMF, OECD, UN and World Bank, 2011),
     including through technical assistance. The International Budget Partnership’s Open Budget Survey
     indicates that tax expenditure reporting is undertaken by the following middle and low-income
     countries: Argentina, Chile, Columbia, Dominican Republic, Guatemala, India, Jamaica, Jordan,
     Kenya, Lebanon, Malaysia, Morocco, Nepal, Pakistan, Peru, Philippines, Russia, Serbia South Africa,

  For assessing the revenue forgone from investment tax incentives, corporate micro simulation models can play an
important role, as the background document explains further.

                                                                                                              17

     Sri Lanka, Tanzania, Trinidad and Tobago. Some other countries carry out such analyses, but their
     score is low, indicating weak methodological frameworks.

     In the Philippines, tax incentives are provided to a large number of firms producing for the
     domestic market. The cost of fiscal incentives granted by the Board of Investments (which is only
     one of the authorities that can do this) in 2004 was estimated to exceed 1 percent of GDP (Reside,
     2006). The background document discusses recent progress in the Philippines, with the Tax
     Incentives Management and Transparency Act.

For purposes of policy evaluation, each dollar of public revenue forgone should be inflated by
an indicator reflecting the scarcity of public funds: the ‘marginal cost of public funds’. Taxes
generally reduce labor supply, saving and investment, thereby imposing an additional cost to
society. The marginal cost of public funds (social cost of a dollar of tax revenue) in advanced
economies is generally estimated around $1.20 to $1.30 due to these distortions. Estimates for
developing countries are scarce, but constraints on the instruments for domestic revenue
mobilization available to them likely mean that in LICS too, the marginal cost of public funds
substantially exceeds unity. For instance, Auriol and Walters (2012) estimate it at an average of $1.20
for a group of 38 African countries. Intuitively, spending a marginal dollar on tax incentives by the
government to attract FDI competes directly with other uses of funds, such as tax rate cuts across
the board or increases in expenditure on infrastructure or education. High returns to such public
investments in LICs due to a scarcity of public funds raise the opportunity cost of tax incentives by
(on these estimates) an extra 20 cents per dollar revenue forgone, and thus call for a 20 percent
higher payoff to justify them.

Calculations of ‘dollar cost per job created’ are a popular metric for measuring the cost-
effectiveness of tax incentives. Number of jobs can be measured either for all investors enjoying
the incentive, or only for those that are ‘marginal’, in the sense that they would not have invested
without the incentive. Dollar costs can either be based on total revenue forgone from the tax-
expenditure review, or only those from the non-marginal investors. Clearly, calculations of this kind
are simplistic and suffer from several pitfalls, implying they should be interpreted with caution. Still,
however calculated, the dollar cost per job provides a quick ballpark figure that can inform
policymakers on the relative cost-effectiveness of a particular incentive—which can also be
compared with the costs of creating jobs by direct spending measures. Sometimes, the numbers
calculated are striking.

     A 2008 Investment climate advisory study found that the government of Yemen spent about
     $6,000 per worker each year for 8,000 jobs that investment incentives helped create—more than
     six times the country’s per capita income. In Thailand, a 1999 study by the Foreign Investment
     Advisory Service found that investment incentives each year cost the government about 16 times
     the average annual wage of an industrial worker. In Tunisia, it was found that the cost of tax
     incentives for each job created was three and a half times the per-capita income. The government
     of India granted over US$200,000 per job in incentives. Investments by General Motors in Hungary
     cost US$ 300,000 per job created. (James, 2014; Kenneth, 2011)

Inefficiencies also arise from distorted resource allocations. By definition, tax incentives place
non-incentivized investments at a competitive disadvantage. The risk is that, in seeking to pick
winners, there will be inefficiently high investment in incentivized activities and inefficiently low
investment in others. Incentivized firms may also be able to attract workers from non-incentivized
firms by offering higher wages, just because they enjoy an artificial competitive advantage. Diversion
of labor and capital to the incentivized firms in response to discriminatory tax treatment will distort
the allocation of resources and can hurt economic growth.

    The World Bank Group finds that a few politically connected firms have captured tax incentives in
    Egypt and Tunisia. This selective access caused a dual economy with large differences in
    profitability between insiders and outsiders, undermining a level playing field and reducing
    competition, significantly reducing job growth (Shiffbauer et al., 2015).

In principle, efficiency may require taxing activities that are more mobile across countries less
heavily than those less mobile…. This is in line with the standard principle of efficient tax design
that items with less tax-sensitive bases should be taxed more heavily—because the tax then has a
lesser impact on real decisions. Such an outcome would effectively be one in which incentives are
offered to the most mobile activities—which in practice has clearly been a major concern for many
LICs and others. Differential tax rates across sectors may also serve as a pragmatic device for
imposing higher burdens where rents (that is, profits in excess of the minimum required by
investors) are more substantial.

…but this can bring its own difficulties, and be inferior to more cooperative outcomes.
Applying different rates to different sectors, for instance, creates opportunities for profit shifting
between the two (as elaborated on above). And since tax bases are less mobile from a collective
perspective (that of a trading bloc, for instance) than between individual countries, low tax rates set
in pursuit of national objectives may forego opportunities for efficient taxation from a collective
perspective. Where there is reason to suppose substantial rents are being earned, targeted taxes
may be the better way to approach them rather than by differential rates—hence the distinct
resource rent taxes often found in, and recommended for, resource-rich countries.


GUIDANCE IN THE USE OF TAX INCENTIVES
As the analysis above makes clear, how tax incentives are designed and governed is critical to their
effectiveness and efficiency. This section discusses principles and good practices in these areas, and
elaborates on issues of reform of tax incentives.

A. Design
Tax incentive policies involve three core design issues:

   Choice of tax instrument to incentivize investment;

   Eligibility criteria used in the selection of qualified investments;


                                                                                                     19
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


    Reporting and monitoring requirements during different stages of the tax incentive’s life cycle,
     as well as sunset and recapture provisions.

Instrument choice

Incentives can cover a wide range of taxes, including corporate income tax (CIT), VAT, tariffs,
property taxes, personal income taxes and social contributions. Incentives in each of these areas
require distinct economic analysis. For instance, a reduction in tariffs for capital goods is usually on
solid economic ground in that it eliminates production distortions that create large welfare costs. On
the other hand, VAT exemptions on investment may be entirely redundant, since full operation of
the tax means that VAT charged on inputs does not ‘stick’ with the purchaser, but is fully recovered
as a credit against VAT charged on sales;17 but VAT exemptions can become beneficial for firms if
VAT implementation is problematic, for instance, due to imperfect VAT refund procedures.
Corporate income tax incentives are probably the most contentious and widely criticized by
observers. Much of the focus below will consequently be on them.

Tax incentives that lower the cost of investment are often to be preferred over profit-based
tax incentives:

    Cost-based tax incentives involve specific allowances linked to investment expenses, such as
     accelerated depreciation schemes and special tax deductions and credits. They are targeted at
     lowering the cost of capital and so make a greater number of investment projects more
     profitable at the margin—that is, may generate investments that would not otherwise have been
     made.

    Profit-based tax incentives generally reduce the tax rate applicable to taxable income;
     examples include tax holidays, preferential tax rates or income exemptions. One effect is thus to
     forego government revenue in order to make even more profitable investment projects that
     would be profitable, and hence undertaken, even without the incentive.

The difference between the two types of instruments is critical. For instance, profit-based incentives
will be less effective in encouraging investment compared to incentives that reduce the capital cost
if profitability is low. When profits are earned due to the presence of location-specific factors, such
as natural resources, agglomerations, or local markets, profit-based incentives tend to be associated
with high redundancy rates and are again ineffective in raising investment. But international
considerations are important here. Profitable investments that are highly mobile across national
borders—because, for instance, rents are associated with intangible assets, such as patents or
trademarks, that are easy to move between jurisdictions—may be sensitive to both cost-based and
profit-based tax incentives.

Tax holidays tend to favor readily mobile (‘footloose’) activities rather than long-term
investment. By offering temporary tax relief for profitable firms, tax holidays benefit industries that

17
  Indeed VAT exemption on investments (and intermediate purchases more generally) can be worse than redundant,
because of its cascading effect through the production chain: see for instance Ebril et al. (2001).

20
                                                             TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


start making profits soon in the holiday period. This introduces a bias towards short-term projects
with low upfront investment costs, which may be those least likely to generate spillover effects on
the wider economy (of the kinds described above). Such investment projects are known to “pack
and go”, fleeing the host country as soon as the preferential treatment is removed. For industries
with significant long-term capital needs, and for which spillover benefits may be greater, tax
holidays could actually discourage investment: little otherwise taxable profit might be expected
during the holiday period, and, to utilize depreciation allowances, a firm might be encouraged to
postpone investment until after the holiday period in order to claim full deductions for its costs (see
background document).

Eligibility criteria

Tax incentives need to be well-targeted and based on clear eligibility criteria. Targeting serves
two related purposes: (i) identifying the types of investment that a government seeks to attract; and
(ii) reducing the fiscal cost of incentives. The following criteria are commonly used—often in
combination:

    Special size. Tax incentives are sometimes restricted to new investments (or investors) that
     exceed some stipulated value of assets or those that create at least some stipulated number of
     new jobs. This of course has significant appeal, for instance where investments can be
     transformational for a country or region or where financing and technical constraints hold up
     investment. Limiting incentives to large investments can also reduce administrative costs for
     government. However, discrimination in favor of large foreign investments can also lead to
     manipulation, abuse and distortion. For instance, size conditions are relatively easy to meet on
     paper, but extremely difficult to monitor and verify ex-post. If an investor increases the size of
     their planned investment or the number of new jobs simply to obtain a tax privilege, this implies
     an inefficient use of resources, so that marginal productivity increases can be very low or even
     negative. Discrimination can also distort competition and restrict the growth of smaller domestic
     enterprises that do not enjoy incentives, even when they are more productive.18

    Special sectors. Many countries grant preferential tax treatment to certain sectors of the
     economy, which policy makers consider as most desirable and which are most likely to be
     influenced by tax. Among the activities commonly preferred are tourism, “offshore” financial
     centers, film production and manufacturing activities, with the idea that they bring more socially
     valuable spillover effects. Incentives are also sometimes restricted to so-called “pioneer”
     industries, which can be defined in various ways, but are always viewed as of strategic value for




18
   Many countries also offer special tax incentives for small and medium-sized (usually domestic) enterprises
(perhaps to address their difficulties in raising external finance), for example through lower tax rates or special
allowances. There is no clear evidence, however, that targeted tax relief for small firms is more cost-effective than
general tax relief for businesses (IMF, 2012). On the contrary, special relief may hurt economic growth by creating a
small-business trap, preventing small firms from growing larger to maintain their preferential tax treatment.


                                                                                                                   21
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


     the national economy.19 There is always a question, however, whether serving special interests
     aligns with serving the general public interest. For instance, investments in other economic
     sectors are placed at a competitive disadvantage and may under develop, even though they are
     more productive.

    Special regions/zones. Tax incentives are sometimes targeted to special regions in the form of
     ‘zones’, for example to address geospatial inequality. Economic zones (EZs)—which exist under
     various names and definitions20—have rapidly gained popularity over the last couple of decades.
     For instance, the International Labour Organization (ILO) estimated in 2007 that 3,500 EZs were
     operational in 130 countries, compared to only 176 in 46 countries 20 years earlier. Successful
     economic developments in Hong Kong SAR, Singapore, and Korea have often been attributed to
     EZs. In China, SEZs were used as test beds for the gradual liberalization of the economy and
     export-oriented industrialization. There is evidence that these Chinese SEZs, on average, boosted
     the growth rate of FDI by almost 7 percent per year (Wang, 2013) and regional economic growth
     by 12 percent per year (Alder et al., 2013). These successes in East Asia have inspired many other
     developing countries to adopt EZs of various kinds, including in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia.
     Experience on their effectiveness, however, is mixed at best. Zeng (2015) recently concluded, for
     example, that the experiences have been disappointing in most African countries, which he
     explains by poor institutions, weak governance and inadequate infrastructure (among others). In
     India too, there is evidence that the number of EZs per region has had no discernible impact on
     regional economic growth (Leong, 2013). In such circumstances there is evident risk of
     significant revenue loss through redundancy, and many observers also stress sizable risks from
     tax planning between the free-zone and affiliates outside the zone (similar to those shown in the
     India example above).

     “Performance data are elusive because the effects of zones are hard to disentangle from other
     economic forces. But anecdotal evidence suggests that they fall into three broad categories: a few
     runaway successes, a larger number that come out marginally positive in cost-benefit assessments,
     and a long tail of failed zones that either never got going, were poorly run, or where investors
     gladly took tax breaks without producing substantial employment or export earnings” (The
     Economist, April 4th 2015).




19
  Investment incentives are also frequently targeted at export-oriented production. However, such incentives may be
contrary to WTO rules—although there is a LIC exemption provided under the WTO Subsidies and Countervailing
Measures Agreement, under which 33 LIC WTO members (as well as 12 accession LICs) are granted special relief.
20
   Export processing zones (EPZs), for example, are enclaves where foreign companies engaged in the manufacturing
of products for exports enjoy preferential (tax) treatment compared to the rest of the economy. Special economic
zones (SEZs) offer locational flexibility and have a wider application than EPZs by granting such treatments also to
domestic sectors. Several other zone types exist, each with particular features. Incentives in those EZs generally
involve non-tax benefits, such as good infrastructure and cheap utilities, as well as reductions in customs duties,
income taxes and other (local) taxes and fees.

22
                                                           TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


    A recent IDB study uses micro data to evaluate Export Free Zones in Costa Rica, El Salvador and
    Dominican Republic, including the specific role of tax holidays. It finds that (i) the Zones generally
    favor high profitability projects that would likely have gone ahead also without the incentives;
    (ii) projects are readjusted to keep incentives over time; and (iii) global tax avoidance is facilitated
    through the use of transfer prices vis-à-vis subsidiaries in the Zones (Artana, 2015).

Life-cycle stages

After approval, the tax administration should continue monitoring firms. This is an often
neglected stage in many countries. Even when granted a tax holiday, taxpayers should still be
required to file a tax return so that the authorities can assess the revenue cost of the incentive (as a
central element of its tax expenditure review). Tax authorities should also periodically carry out
audits to ensure that tax incentives are not abused. Conditions attached to incentives often require
ongoing monitoring—for example, requirements that a given number of jobs be maintained, or that
a certain percentage of production be exported (which may call for specialized tax forms for firms
enjoying such incentives). Where non-compliance or abuse is detected, a penalty should be imposed
and, ultimately, tax privileges denied.

Making tax incentives temporary rather than permanent can have some attraction. One major
attraction of a temporary tax incentive is that its expiry provides for a natural point of evaluation,
feeding into a periodic reconsideration of whether the incentive should be continued, reformed or
repealed. Temporariness of a tax incentive can also be used as a counter-cyclical policy. Indeed,
when foreseen to be phased out in the near future, the investment effects of an incentive tend to be
bigger than of permanent incentives (US Department of Treasury, 2010). Sunset provisions should
be built into the law. In the absence of such a provision, firms may seek to roll-over a tax holiday,
either by negotiating a new holiday period or by incorporating a new firm that may qualify for it. Tax
holidays then become de facto permanent tax exemptions—a practice that should be avoided.

B. Governance

Good governance requires that the government’s decision-making process, its policies and
the administration be transparent and subject to scrutiny and evaluation, to ensure that
authorities can be held accountable for their actions and remedial action taken when necessary. This
limits the scope for corruption, strengthens the trust of investors in government, and enhances
confidence of the public that the tax system is fair in design and implementation. Transparency is a
necessary but not a sufficient condition for good governance (see Box 3). IOs have developed a
variety of practical tools to assess the transparency and wider governance performance of countries
with respect to tax incentives.21 The background document presents templates that can be used as
assessment tools. In general, the key requirements for good governance are that:



21
   See for instance the IMF Fiscal Transparency Code (2014), including pillar IV on resource revenue management;
IMF Manual on Fiscal Transparency (2007); OECD Best Practices for Budget Transparency (2002). The background
document presents recent templates developed by the OECD and the World Bank.

                                                                                                                   23
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


    The award and monitoring of incentives be guided by the rule of law, with clarity about eligibility
     criteria;

    Authority to grant national-level tax incentives (related to national taxes) rest solely with the
     Ministry of Finance; decisions drawing, as need be, on the views of stakeholders across
     government;

    There be effective and transparent administration and evaluation.


                                          Box 3. Transparency

Transparency is fundamental to empowering all stakeholders—the legislature, businesses, civil
society and the public at large—with information about tax incentive policies, so that they can
hold government accountable for its decisions. Transparency also generates information required
for evaluation. Transparency should be created along three dimensions:

    Legal: tax incentives should have a statutory basis in relevant tax laws.

    Economic: the rationale for tax incentives should be clearly spelled out to enable a public
     debate on the country’s policy priorities. The costs and benefits of an incentive scheme should
     be assessed ex-ante and ex-post, based on clearly stated assumptions and methodologies,
     and the assessments published.

    Administrative: qualifying criteria should be clear, simple, specific and objective, so as to
     reduce the discretion afforded to officials that grant the incentives. The decision-making
     process should be open and a list of incentives granted should be published.

Because the revenue costs of tax incentives are usually not obvious, governments tend to face
limited scrutiny when granting them, in contrast to the case of direct expenditures. Budgeting the
amount of revenue forgone from tax incentives by the Ministry of Finance and revealing it to the
public supports good governance, enables informed budget making and improves accountability.

Transparency in the benefits they receive should also be required from multinational corporations.
This can strengthen corporate social responsibility as employees, customers and local communities
can hold corporations accountable for their decisions, including their tax treatment.

Rule of law

Tax incentives should be clearly prescribed in the law… This ensures that the legal basis
governing the tax incentive has been approved by the legislature and has passed appropriate
parliamentary and public scrutiny. If, on the other hand, tax incentives are negotiable and provided
through decrees, agreements, regulations and the like, they escape oversight and can become prone
to undue influence.

Tax incentives in Nigeria can be introduced through laws, budget speeches, government
notices/directives, executed agreements, as well as Memoranda of Understanding between the
government and businesses (Nlerum, 2011).

…and preferably consolidated in the tax law. The transparency and accessibility of tax incentives
are compromised when embedded in multiple pieces of legislation applying, for instance, to
different sectors. Tax incentives are for this reason best consolidated into the main body of the tax
law. This reduces the likelihood of conflicting or overlapping provisions, which could create
unintended distortions and uncertainty, as well as revenue losses. In practice, however, more than
half of all LICs provide tax incentives outside the tax law (Figure 4).

     In December 2012, special tax measures in as many as 17 laws and legislative acts were
     either abolished or consolidated into the General Tax Code in Senegal, significantly
     improving transparency of the tax system. The comprehensive tax reform, along with tighter
     administrative measures, streamlined the tax system and represented a significant rollback of
     tax incentives and exemptions. (Journal Officiel de la République du Sénégal, 2012)


Eligibility criteria for granting tax incentives should be clearly defined and readily verifiable
to allow for a rules-based approach. The law (and its accompanying regulations) should specify
the conditions that the taxpayer needs to satisfy in order to qualify for a tax incentive, with as little
room as possible for subjective interpretation or negotiation. Granting incentives can then be largely
automatic by verification of stipulated criteria. Yet, not all tax incentives can be granted
automatically, for instance because the law cannot always prescribe eligibility under all possible
circumstances. This often introduces some elements of discretion. The extent of discretion, however,
should be kept to a minimum as it introduces the risk of rent-seeking behavior on the part of the
investors and corrupt behavior on the part of the public officials—a major concern in many
countries.22 Excessive discretion can also serve as a signal of poor governance and thus alarm new
investors. Figure 4 shows that, troublingly, close to 70 percent of LICs allow for granting processes
that are largely discretionary in nature.

         There are several examples of considerable discretionary interpretation. For instance, the
         recently promulgated Foreign Investment Law of Myanmar loosely defines eligibility for tax
         exemptions over a “suitable period” for businesses that are “beneficial for the State.”(Myanmar
         Foreign Investment Law, 2012). The Gambia’s investment promotion authority confers a
         special status on investors, which are then awarded special investment certificates entitling
         them to benefit from incentive packages; the investment promotion authority states that,
         “Apart from these specific incentive packages, others can be negotiated with the Agency
         depending on the strategic nature of the investment.” (James, 2014). Tanzania’s ‘Strategic
         Investor Status’ allows companies investing over US$ 20 million to negotiate individual tax
         breaks. These “special concessions to individual companies … have never formally been made
         public” (Tax Justice Network, 2012). Haiti’s Investment Code covers virtually any economic
         activity and provides no selection criteria to be applied by the inter-ministerial committee in
         charge of granting discretionary incentives, which include both a 15-year CIT holiday and
         accelerated depreciation (Investment law of Haiti, 1989).

         There is reason for optimism too, as increased public awareness and civil society activism have
         urged governments to bring some previously secret deals into daylight. In 2012, the
         government of Sierra Leone established an online database for mining contracts, to make
         information on natural resource extraction contracts publicly accessible. Similarly, dozens of



22
   The World Bank defines corruption as the abuse of public office for private gain; rent seeking reflects the use of
companies’ resources to obtain economic benefit without wealth creation. Both can hamper development, see e.g.
Abed and Gupta (2002).

        previously secret extractive industry contracts were placed online by the government of Guinea
        (Africa Progress Panel, 2013).


Authority to grant

It is critical that ministries and agencies involved in the granting of tax incentives coordinate
their activities. Several government agencies are often involved in the foreign investment process,
such as the Investment Promotion Agency, the Ministry of Economy and Ministries responsible for
specific sectors, such as Agriculture, Tourism or Mining. These different players often bring specific
expertise, which can be useful in the design of tax incentives or required in the evaluation of
eligibility criteria. But they usually also have different objectives. For instance, investment promotion
agencies often support tax incentives in order to attract investors, having little direct concern for the
revenue consequences. The Ministry of Finance, in contrast, will emphasize that revenue needs to be
raised to provide public goods, including key pillars of a business-enabling environment such as
infrastructure. Where various Ministries do not properly coordinate and responsibilities are not
centralized, incentives may overlap, be inconsistent, or even work at cross-purposes. Effective
coordination is a daunting but critically important task.

The ultimate and sole authority to enact tax incentives at the national level should be with the
Minister of Finance. Countries that have been successful in attracting investment have generally
adopted a holistic approach that places tax policy in the context of a broader national development
strategy. It is common practice to have an interdepartmental adjudication committee with combined
expertise that makes recommendations to the Minister of Finance about tax incentives. The latter
should take the final decision to enact tax incentives and be responsible for their implementation
through, or working closely with, the tax administration. Indeed, the Minister of Finance is best able
to weigh different priorities while also keeping an eye on the cost of incentives. Where authority is
outside the Ministry of Finance, special interests can easily dominate the general public interest.

      As many as 10 organizations/agencies have the authority to grant tax incentives and

      Board, Ghana Free Zones Board, Ghana Investment Promotion Council, and Ghana National

      The Solomon Islands recently implemented a comprehensive statutory regime, prescribing
      the process of granting tax exemptions for import duties, excise, Goods and Services Tax
      (GST), income tax, sales tax and stamp duties. If a request is received for a tax exemption, a
      formal “Exemption Committee” provides advice to the Minister for Treasury and Finance.
      The Committee consists of representatives of the revenue administration, the Ministry of
      Development and Planning and the Ministry of Commerce. The law also prescribes clear and
      public criteria for the award of tax incentives and demands publication of both the
      application and the decision regarding the incentive. (Revenue and Customs Exemption
      Committee Solomon Islands, 2013).

Administration

The revenue administration should be in charge of the implementation and enforcement of
tax incentive schemes, as it has the unique authority, expertise and experience necessary for the
execution of the tax law of which incentives should be part. Where tax incentives are simple and
unambiguous, they might be self-assessed by the taxpayer and subject to ordinary control and
auditing procedures. Many incentive provisions, however, require some form of approval by the tax
administration. When verifying facts, information or certification may be needed from other
specialized government agencies or ministries. For the tax administration, documentation and
publication of the decisions is a prerequisite to ensure transparency. This enables it to be held
accountable by government and taxpayers. It also enables government (preferably the Ministry of
Finance) and other organizations to evaluate the costs and benefits of tax incentives.


C. Reform
IOs have frequently advised countries to remove, or radically adjust, their tax incentives, as
they have often been found to be ineffective or inefficient, or governance structures were ill-
performing. Yet, reform of tax incentive regimes has proven difficult. This is because tax incentives
are usually not only driven only or even mainly by well-articulated economic concerns—aimed at
improving the wellbeing of citizens—but also by political motivations. For instance, politicians may
find it attractive to introduce new tax incentives to reveal their proactive stance in addressing weak
economic performance, or to favor particular regions. The fiscal costs of granting those incentives,
moreover, are usually not transparent and only arise as forgone revenue in the future. Tax incentives
also create vested interests among businesses and within government, making them difficult to
repeal, even if they are ineffective. Indeed, economic elites are sometimes able to influence the
governance and design of tax incentives and shape public opinion where it suits their objectives.
When successful, they become powerful lobbyists who can capture the political process to resist
change (Moe, 2005). Yet, successful reforms have been achieved:

       In 2013, Jamaica undertook a major tax reform, eliminating many of its generous and
       discretionary tax incentives. The Minister of Justice said: “The Jamaican economy has not been
       well served by the existing regime of sector based incentives. The consensus is that such
       incentives may have been partly responsible for Jamaica’s lackluster record of growth by
       encouraging the misallocation of limited economic resources in our country.” (James, 2013)

       In 2009, India’s Ministry of Finance released a draft Direct Taxes Code and a discussion paper
       on the bill, which recommended that India should move away from profit-based tax incentives
       in favor of expenditure-based tax incentives. A final bill was sent to Parliament in 2010, and
       passed to a Standing Committee on Finance (SCF), which released its report in March 2012.
       The SCF report concurred with the Ministry of Finance that profit-based incentives facilitate
       artificial tax planning, and that this form of incentive should no longer be granted (while
       existing tax holidays previously granted for firms in special economic zones would continue to
       be respected) (Standing Committee on Finance 2011-12).

        Egypt passed a new income tax law in mid-2005 that provided for the phasing out of tax
        holidays while grandfathering current beneficiaries. Between 2005 and 2006, FDI into Egypt
        doubled. (Keen and Mansour, 2010)

        In 2006, Mauritius normalized the taxation of its export processing zone companies with that
        in other sectors and removed all provisions relating to tax credits and tax holidays (except for a
        four-year income tax holiday for small business). At the same time, the corporate tax rate was
        gradually reduced from 25 to 15 percent in 2008. (Keen and Mansour, 2010)

        In his latest budget speech, the Finance Minister of India proposed to reduce the corporate tax
        rate from 30 to 25 percent over the next 4 years, accompanied by rationalization and removal
        of various tax incentives and exemptions, which, he argues, have led to pressure groups,
        litigation and loss of revenue. The Minister expects base broadening and rate reduction to lead
        to higher levels of investment and growth and more jobs (Government of India, Ministry of
        Finance, February 28, 2015).

When reforming tax incentives, governments should seek a balance between tax stability for
incumbents and equal treatment of entrants to the market. Sunset provisions are often provided
when incentives are scaled back due to policy reform. For instance, in the case of repeal of a tax
holiday, the expectation can be that existing privileges will continue for incumbent firms. Investment
laws sometimes even contain stability clauses for investors against adverse legislative changes, as a
sign of government’s commitment. Such stability provisions, however, create an uneven playing field
between old and new investors and can lead to significant distortions. Such situations should not
last for too long. Government might therefore need to renegotiate existing incentive provisions or
provide reasonable, time-bound incentives to new investors.



INTERNATIONAL COORDINATION
Tax incentives are often instances of tax competition, with the risk that ultimately all
countries will lose from their use.23 By attracting investment that would otherwise have gone
elsewhere, tax incentives can have adverse cross-border spillover effects on the welfare of other
countries. To the extent that the allocation of investment is driven by tax rather than commercial
considerations, the result is an inefficient global allocation of capital, and a consequent collective
loss of output. Moreover, tax incentives in one country might evoke strategic reactions that lead
them to offer similar policies (IMF, 2014). This process of tax competition can cause a race to the
bottom, with all countries ultimately ending up with lower tax revenue and with no discernible
impact on the allocation of investment. ,




23
  Tax competition might not be bad per se. For instance, some see tax competition as welcome in counteracting a
political bias towards excessive public expenditure. Such arguments are less pervasive in LICs, however, which
generally face an urgent need for higher domestic revenues to finance projects for development.

                                                                                                              29
TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


       Examining data for 40 countries in Latin America, the Caribbean and Africa, it appears that the
       length of a country’s tax holidays responds positively to that of its neighbors (Klemm and Van
       Parys, 2012).

       A race to the bottom is evident among special regimes in Africa, where effective tax rates have
       fallen to almost zero in industries where special regimes are in place (Abbas and Klemm, 2013).

       Grenada announced in 2012 that, in order to encourage the resort group Sandals to invest
       in his country, the government agreed to waive the company’s payment of corporate taxes
       for 25 years, place a cap on Sandals’ property taxes for 25 years and waive all import duties
       for 25 years. The minister announced that the benefits to the economy were an injection of
       US$100 million and the creation of 425 jobs. This reflects the aggressive nature of tax
       competition in the hotel industry in the Caribbean (James, 2013).

Tax coordination offers opportunities to address spillovers—but also involves the risk of
inducing other harmful responses. In principle, a coordinated response can prevent mutually
harmful outcomes induced by uncoordinated tax design, for instance by agreeing to a ban on the
use of certain tax incentives. Most forms of international coordination, however, are only of limited
scope and scale. This raises two fundamental issues that require careful consideration when
assessing the impact of tax coordination:

    Coordination with respect to some tax incentives can intensify tax competition in other
     provisions. Suppose for instance that countries agreed not to offer special treatment to mobile
     activities (which, as discussed above, they might wish to do) but could otherwise compete on
     the general rate of tax they apply. The outcome could then be worse for all than if differential
     treatment were allowed, since they will then compete more aggressively on the rules covering all
     industries, including those with immobile capital (see e.g. Keen, 2002). Against this, of course,
     must be weighed the disadvantages of differential treatment across sectors discussed above.

    Coordination among a subset of countries can intensify tax competition with outsiders—
     with the latter the major beneficiaries. Coordination is best achieved among the countries
     that most directly compete for mobile capital. If too limited in regional scope, the tax base of the
     participating countries can become more vulnerable to pressures from outside jurisdictions with
     lower taxes: they are in effect setting themselves up for increased competition from non-
     participants, who may consequently be the major beneficiaries. The scope of coordination
     agreements should thus be sufficiently broad in terms of country coverage,24 the difficulty being
     that of overcoming the incentive to benefit by staying outside the agreement.

International tax coordination can take different forms. For instance, countries can agree on a
non-binding code of conduct not to use certain tax incentives, such as tax holidays—as for instance
has been done with the Code of Conduct for business taxation in the European Union. Something

24
  Or other relevant characteristics. Similar arguments apply, for instance, to cooperation between producers of some
natural resource, whatever their geographical location.

more binding would be a common legislative framework, akin to the state-aid rules in the European
Union. Yet, tax coordination has proven difficult in practice in many regional groupings. Negotiating
and implementing an agreement is a substantial effort, and will require an effective supranational
monitoring framework and powerful institutions to enforce it—something that is lacking in many
regions. More realistic in these circumstances might be to start with a more modest form of
cooperation. For instance, countries could agree on a common framework for reporting tax
incentives and information exchange to encourage mutual learning. This could also enhance
transparency and governance practices, and enable ex-post assessment of tax incentives.

   The Southern African Development Community (SADC) aims to reduce and ultimately to eliminate
   tax competition that damages the region’s revenue mobilization efforts. The SADC Protocol on
   Finance and Investment provides for co-operation and coordination on tax incentives in the region.
   The “Guidelines for the application and treatment of tax incentives in the SADC region” seeks
   endeavors by the Member States to avoid harmful tax competition or introducing tax legislation
   that prejudices another Member State’s economic policies or activities (SADC, 2012).

   The members of the East African Community (EAC) have recently made progress towards
   coordination of their tax incentive regime through the use of a ‘Code of Conduct’, though this is yet
   to be adopted. This aims to formalize an existing arrangement under which each year the EAC
   finance ministers meet before their budget speeches are made and discuss their budget proposals.
   This provides the opportunity for Finance Ministers to dissuade other members if they propose any
   new tax incentive that puts other countries at a disadvantage (Tax Justice Network, 2012).

   In the West African Economic and Monetary Union (WEAMU), considerable efforts have been made
   to set-up a structure to tackle the problem of tax competition by issuing directives that limit the
   applicable tax rates that countries can use. The coordination framework has led to some
   convergence of countries’ tax systems, and in turn to positive revenue effects in WAEMU member
   states. However, there are large gaps between de jure and de facto coordination, as WAEMU has
   failed to provide its regional institutions with the necessary resources to undertake effective
   surveillance, which has led to ineffective enforcement and undermined the credibility of
   coordination. In fact, the framework allows for unfettered tax competition as long as this is done
   outside the countries’ main tax laws. This has made their tax systems opaque, increased complexity
   and contributed to a culture of tax negotiation (Mansour and Rota-Graziosi, 2013).

   In Central America, coordination of tax incentives has some history. Between 1962 and 1984, four
   countries (Costa Rica, El Salvador, Guatemala and Nicaragua) were parties to a convention on tax
   incentives, which mandated uniform tax incentives and prohibited the introduction of new ones. In
   2012, the Committee of Ministers of Finance of Central America, Panama, and the Dominican
   Republic (COSEFIN) discussed the adoption of a “Declaration of Good Practices” for investment tax
   incentives, which was preceded by a wide-ranging exercise to quantify the cost of existing tax
   incentives to make a stronger case for their removal. Discussions on a mandatory code of good
   practices remain ongoing (Cebotari et al., 2013).

TAX INCENTIVES FOR INVESTMENT—OPTIONS FOR LICS


International tax rules adopted by advanced and emerging economies may affect the
intensity of tax competition among LICs. The benefits of tax incentives to investors are larger, for
instance, if parent companies reside in countries with territorial taxation and/or weak CFC regimes,
since (as discussed above), because the exemption of qualified foreign-earned income in the
residence country preserves the benefit of tax advantages in the host country. Advanced and
emerging countries with worldwide taxation, however, sometimes offer tax sparing clauses, as
discussed in footnote 14. This too increases the potential effectiveness of tax incentives. This in itself,
however, is likely to intensify tax competition among LICs to attract FDI. Ultimately, territoriality and
tax sparing may therefore not make LICs collectively better off.

Tax incentives as part of bilateral or multi-party investment agreements vary widely in form
and there is no standard template for them. There are often exceptions providing that tax
matters are not covered by such agreements. This might refer to tax matters generally, those
confined to double tax treaties (not extending to indirect taxes such as VAT), or those related to
specific investment treaty obligations, such as the "most favored nation" provision. Where a tax
incentive is provided, it is important to consider whether the relevant investment treaties might
unintentionally be automatically accorded to other taxpayers, not originally intended to benefit from
the tax incentive (such as under a most favored nation clause). Moreover, protections under the
investment treaty (such as stabilization clauses) may make it hard to withdraw the tax incentive
when it no longer serves the original purpose, or may require compensation not otherwise payable.
Also important is which dispute settlement procedure would apply if tax issues fall under the
investment treaty (usually there is a binding arbitration clause), and what should be done to prepare
for such a possibility. These issues are best considered in collaboration with those responsible for
negotiating the investment treaties.

CONCLUSIONS
This paper finds that many LICs have considerable scope to improve the effectiveness and
efficiency of their investment tax incentives. The paper has set out options for improvement in
design and governance, at both national and international levels. At the national level, there is
generally scope to improve the design of tax incentives (for example by placing greater emphasis on
cost-based incentives rather than profit-based ones; and by targeting tax incentives better),
strengthen their governance (for instance through more transparency, better tax laws and a stronger
role of the Minister of Finance) and by undertaking more systematic evaluations. At the international
level, countries may gain by coordinating their tax incentive policies regionally, so as to mitigate the
negative spillovers from tax competition.

Making progress requires concerted action from many stakeholders. National reform and
international coordination of investment tax incentives have often proven difficult to achieve for a
variety of reasons. Making better progress requires that political decisions about tax incentives be
based on proper analysis of their effectiveness and efficiency, which requires transparency along
with systematic information gathering and evaluation. Stakeholders need to accept their various
responsibilities if progress is to be made:

      Governments in LICs bear the prime responsibility for the design and governance of tax
       incentives. It is critical that they can be held accountable by parliament, businesses, donors,
       relevant regional and international bodies, and the public at large. This requires transparency, as
       well as a properly functioning legal system. Also important is that governments be equipped
       with the necessary skills, tools and data to undertake evaluations, to enable informed decision
       making. Publishing an annual tax expenditure review as part of the budgetary process is an
       important step in this direction.

      Society at large, including civil society organizations (CSOs) and media, play a vital role in
       scrutinizing government decisions, detecting malfunctioning practices, and mobilizing voice.
       They can, for instance, draw attention to and publicize the revenue foregone from tax incentives
       that is reducing the resources available for development.

      Corporations, including foreign-owned multinationals that enjoy tax incentives bear
       corporate social responsibility, including towards (local) communities, governments, employees,
       consumers and other stakeholders. This means, for instance, that they should comply not only
       with the letter but also the spirit of the tax law. Going further, the business sector might develop
       and subscribe to a code of conduct under which incentive packages that fail to meet certain
       minimum transparency standards are not accepted or sought.

      Supranational regional bodies have delegated responsibility from national governments to
       enforce commitments agreed upon in the cooperation. Their powers will be as strong as the
       members want them to be. Supranational bodies can support transparency by developing
       common standards for reporting, data collection and evaluation of tax incentives.

      Governments in donor countries, including those in the G20, have a responsibility in: (i) the
       design of their own corporate tax policies, to avoid harmful spillovers onto LICs (for example,
       through treaty abuse; (ii) the provision of donor aid, which itself in many cases enjoys the
       benefits of tax incentives offered by LICs (a practice for which the rationale is increasingly
       unclear, and which is being revisited by several donors);25 (iii) imposing conditionality regarding
       tax incentives when providing donor aid, such as meeting minimum transparency standards.

      International organizations, such as those co-authoring this document, need to build on their
       established experience to support their LIC members in building more efficient and effective tax
       system. This includes support in developing their capacity to employ tools to better analyze tax
       incentives (such as micro simulation models and effective tax rate models), and evaluations that
       help inform the debate (such as tax expenditure reviews, governance assessment and more
       comprehensive cost-benefit assessments)—as discussed in detail in the background document.

Realizing improvements in effectiveness and efficiency in the use of tax incentives is important for
LICs to achieve better development outcomes. Higher investment can then be reconciled with more
abundant domestic revenue mobilization, much-needed for public spending programs and

                              Appendix I. Consultations
This paper draws on the extensive technical assistance provided by the IMF and World Bank on tax
incentive issues in developing LICs over many years, and their continuing dialogue with them on tax
matters. In preparing this paper, the IOs also held several discussions during public consultation
meetings with representatives from developing countries, civil society organizations, businesses and
academics. Events were organized during March and April 2015 in Paris, Washington DC and New
York. In response to an online invitation for comments on a draft version of the paper during July
and August 2015, several submissions were received. A short review of key issues raised is listed
below.

Developing country officials showed great interest in deepening their analysis of tax incentives
with the tools described in the paper, including for the analysis of tax holidays and economic zones.
Most officials noted that their countries have not carried out any in-depth analysis of the costs and
benefits of tax incentives, yet are frequently confronted with pressures from businesses to grant
them. For the fear of losing investments, generous tax incentives are then offered with ample tax
receipts foregone. In some regions in Africa, countries are coordinating efforts to assess the revenue
costs of tax incentives—sometimes showing very large numbers. However, methodologies are not
harmonized, which hampers comparison between studies.

Civil society expressed the view that tax incentives are often ineffective and inefficient. They also
emphasized the importance of ‘spillover effects’ of tax policies in one country on other countries
and therefore the need for international cooperation. They argue that developing countries are
particularly vulnerable to tax incentives, reducing the domestic resources for their own development.
Organizations also noted the inherent difficulties of performing a proper cost-benefit assessment,
yet urged the IOs to support such exercises in LICs so as to improve information in the decision-
making process. Finally, the importance of transparency—from both governments and businesses—
was emphasized. It was argued that G20 countries need to work together with LICs to develop a
global coordinated approach, with developing counties having an equal say at the negotiation table.

Business argued that tax incentives can be effective instruments to stimulate investment, but only
when used as part of a well-conceived and well-implemented strategy. Thus, tax incentives require
clear pre-established objectives, should be based in the law and efficiently managed. They
emphasized that it is essential for investment that the tax regime be predictable, efficient and stable.
Business also argued that tax incentives cannot compensate for an otherwise poor tax structure or
for an unfavorable investment climate, such as significant administrative barriers, limitations to
competition, no independent legal system, or failing property rights protection. Finally, they find
that countries should be able to set their own tax policies and allocate their own tax incentives, since
there is no one-size-fits all. Regional coordination is not considered to be helpful.

Independent contributors offered important information and ideas. One contribution offered
insight into tax incentives in ten ASEAN countries. It shows that, while 10 countries grant tax
holidays, 6 of them also allow for their renewal upon expiration. Contributors also warned against

                                                                                                     35

the outcomes from investor surveys, which may give a biased view regarding the actual behavior of
investors. An important point raised was the lack of relevant data and the need for more systematic
data gathering by tax administrations. This will require them to monitor firms, even if they have
been granted tax exemptions. Also emphasized was the need to explore the effectiveness of tax
incentives under the unique circumstances of every country. Others noted that tax incentives are not
only prevalent in LICs, but are widespread in advanced countries. Several contributors emphasized
the importance of tax expenditure budgeting for enhancing transparency.
