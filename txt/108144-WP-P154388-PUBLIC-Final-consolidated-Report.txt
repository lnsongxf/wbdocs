1. Executive summary
Strengthening the financial management systems of Local Government Units (LGUs) in West Bank and Gaza
assumes critical importance from the Palestinian Authority (PA) as well as other stakeholders (such as
donors). For the last few years, several efforts were made to computerize the LGUs operations, particularly
with respect to public financial management (PFM). Most common among these have been efforts to
introduce a unified financial management information system (FMIS) that computerize and automate key
aspects of budget execution and accounting operations across the LGUs.

FMIS can enable prompt and efficient access to reliable financial data and help strengthen financial controls,
improving the provision of public services, raising the budget and reporting processes to higher levels of
transparency and accountability, and expediting LGUs’ operations. Also, it can enable the Ministry of Local
Government (MoLG) to obtain timely and sufficient data and information on the performance of all LGUs.

In this context, the World Bank contracted PricewaterhouseCoopers Palestine (PwC) to perform an
assessment of the current FMIS maintained in sample municipalities and to understand whether these
systems are achieving the LGUs’ objectives and needs, and how the systems are integrated with other
information systems covering the LGUs’ operations.

The assessment was carried out by PwC team, and was based on inquiry and meetings with staff from the
sample LGUs, MoLG, and Municipal Development and Lending Fund (MDLF).

Summary of Work Results

The assessment noted a wide disparity among the systems used by the sample municipalities, and most of the
municipalities are considering that the current FMISs are not addressing most of the LGUs’ needs for different
reasons that are detailed in the report. Further, the FMIS have minimal integration with other information
systems maintained by an LGU for recording other operational data.

While various reasons contributed to that, according to the LGUs, a primary reason was that different donors
funded the municipalities with different systems under their funding projects with minimal coordination with
other stakeholders. Another important reason is the lack of centralised leadership to supervise all efforts (of
LGUs, donors and other stakeholders) to develop the LGUs’ systems.

Accordingly, we obtained an understanding of the MoLG and LGUs needs of any future FMIS, as well as the
major difficulties faced by the LGUs while using the current or previous FMIS. We analysed the information
we obtained and we reported herein matters for consideration by the MoLG and LGUs while adopting any
new FMIS in the future.

Our recommendations were broken down under the following four areas:

      1- Basic considerations for standardization

MoLG and LGUs should first establish one standard and unified basis of accounting for all LGUs to follow in
order for any FMIS to follow similar treatment for the accounting transactions. A unified basis of accounting
will facilitate the consolidation of financial information from the LGUs, and will allow benchmarking of LGUs’
financial information with each other.

Also, the system should have a unified chart of accounts that is easily correlated with the unified budget that
the LGUs currently use and expect to use in the future. The chart of accounts is integral to the success of any
FMIS. Without an intelligently designed chart of accounts, information cannot be stored or accessed properly

      2- Recommendations related to the FMIS type

As MoLG, MDLF and World Bank initiative for providing the LGUs with a unified system to be used by all
LGUs, a major consideration should be given to the advantages of having a web-based system that is installed

PwC                                                                                               Page 4
in one central place and linked to all LGUs from that central point, and to have one central administrator unit.
This approach will help in saving costs and efforts, and will standardize the procedures followed by the LGUs
to record transactions and produce reports.

Also, the system should have the ability to be integrated and compatible with other information systems to
ensure that all LGUs are able to operate efficiently by having one integrated view of information. By having
integrated data, users can access the system and extract the specific information they require to carry out
different functions and tasks, and make certain decisions. Users can use this information for a variety of
purposes: to plan and formulate budgets; examine results against budgets and plans; manage cash balances;
track the status of debts and receivables; monitor the use of fixed assets; monitor the performance of specific
departments or units; and make revisions and adjustments as necessary, to name a few.

The LGUs currently use different information systems to manage their operations, such as human resources
related systems; systems for geographical data; building permits management systems, and others. LGUs
expect that the FMIS to be integrated with other information systems. This integration is vital to facilitate the
LGUs work, especially for major business processes reporting. Therefore, the FMIS design and structure need
to be flexible enough to adapt to those needs. Consideration should be made to obtain the program source-
code from the vendor so that the vendor does not limit the MoLG and LGUs ability from achieving the
integration option.

      3- Recommendations related to the system’s functions

As for the system’s financial management functions and features, the FMIS must be modular, provide
scalability, and utilize open-systems architecture.

Based on our discussions with the LGUs staff and our analysis, we identified five essential functions that
should be available in any FMIS as to ensure LGUs’ ability to record and report info rmation in a feasible and
efficient manner. The five functions are:
     a) Data reporting and exporting;
     b) Data Migration;
     c) Multi-currency;
     d) Year-end closing;
     e) Budgeting and planning support:
     f) System interface.

      4- Recommendations related to the system’s implementation

Whilst our report did not aim to cover the system implementation process or the contractual terms to be
signed with the vendor, we recommended certain matters that should be carefully considered in future
purchase and installation of a FMIS as to avoid prior issues and difficulties that were encountered by the LGUs
in previous cases. These matters are:
      1-   Recommended hardware;
      2-   Training on the system;
      3-   Technical support;
      4-   System coding;
      5-   System documentation;
      6-   System change management.

2. Scope and objective
      2.1    Background of assignment
The PA through the MoLG has a strategy for reforming the current institutional, fiscal and financial systems
of LGUs to enable them to achieve their mandate for providing local services in an efficient, transparent and
accountable manner. To assist in achieving these objectives, the World Bank has been supporting a number
of reforms and initiatives designed to improve the PFM processes and systems used in LGUs and enhance the
fiscal sustainability of LGU’s.

The World Bank has contracted PwC to perform a PFM assessment on LGUs in West Bank. The primary focus
of this assessment is on the following areas:

         Mapping the current systems and business processes for all components of financial management of
          LGUs including their institutional arrangements; funds flow; budgeting; accounting; internal
          controls; financial reporting; asset management; and audit and oversight of public finances;

         Assess the level of computerization of municipal financial management processes and, an assessment
          of the variations between the prescribed systems and the actual practices; and

         Provide recommendations for the reform and capacity building of financial management systems of
          LGUs that can be delivered through the ongoing and planned interventions by the World Bank; other
          development partners; and, the PA.


      2.2 Scope of work
The PFM assessment covered the following two key components:

          Component One - Assessment of Municipal FMIS:

The objective of this component was to assess whether there is compatibility between the systems used by
LGU’s and provide recommendations for the design of a revised system that will ensure that there is coherence
and compatibility between the new FMIS and the current FMIS applications. This assessment:

         Reviewed the different municipal FMIS systems currently used in the municipalities;
         Assessed the financial management and information requirements of LGUs to establish if the current
          and proposed FMIS effectively addresses these needs; and
         Assessed the extent to which core municipal processes including local revenue collection and asset
          management are computerized.

          Component Two - Assessment of PFM Systems and Processes of LGUs:

The assessment of the PFM processes was done through:

         Reviewing the current institutional arrangements of the LGU PFM systems and how effectively these
          are functioning; and
         Assessing the design and functioning of the core PFM processes: Budget preparation; Revenue
          Collection and Expenditure Management; Billing/Invoicing; Fund Flows; Accounting; Financial
          Reporting; Internal and other Management Controls; Asset Management; Audit; Legislative Scrutiny
          and Oversight; Human Resources and Training; and, Citizen Engagement in PFM.

This report covers only component one (Assessment of FMIS) mentioned above.

      2.3 Approach and methodology
A qualified and experienced team was assigned to carry-out this assessment. To complete this assessment, we
used the following four-stage strategy:

1- Planning:
   We developed specific questionnaires and work programs to guide the conduct of the assessment and to
   ensure that we collected all valid and relevant information.

2- Interviewing officials and gathering data:
   We obtained our information through interviewing key stakeholders of the LGUs. The interviews were
   done in person and were designed to allow us to understand and evaluate the information provided for
   this assessment.

      Our interviews focused on establishing the current systems being used and the difficulties the LGUs face
      in practically using these systems.

3- Reviewing documents:
   We reviewed information obtained through inquires, and relevant documents, to help in assessing the
   current processes, and to identify current areas of weakness that require remedial action or need
   improvement. Where possible, we validated stakeholder responses by reference to documentary
   evidence.

      All the above activities were designed to ensure the delivery of relevant and practical conclusions and
      recommendations that are designed to benefit users of this report.

4- Writing the report:
   The conclusion of this assignment was drafting the final assessment report. The first-stage was an initial
   draft being prepared by the core assessment team. This draft was then subjected to quality assurance
   reviews to ensure that the content of the assessment report was accurate and consistent.

      2.4 Sample municipalities for assessment
A sample of 12 municipalities was selected by the World Bank for the assessment purposes, and included
municipalities of different sizes in terms of population, operations, and number of systems used. The sample
included the following municipalities: Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, Jenin, Jericho, Bethlehem, Birzeit, Yata,
Turmosaya, Aqaba, AlKhader, and Bido.

      2.5     Key assumptions
Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control framework, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. Also, predictions of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control to
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal control framework may become inadequate because of
changes in the control environment; or, that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
regulating internal control may deteriorate.

Our services provided under this assignment do not constitute an audit or review performed in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing or International Standards on Review Engagements, and thus, we
do not express any assurance on the subject matter of this assessment.

Our work under this engagement was limited to obtaining an understanding of the current procedures and
systems maintained by the sample municipalities. Our work on Component One neither involved any work
on the design or implementation of any proposed FMIS system, nor aimed to describe or explain the process
for implementation and adoption of any future FMIS system. Finally, our work does not represent an
assessment or review of any specific information system in any of the municipalities.

3. Current municipal FMIS
    3.1     Background
In the territories administrated by the PA, a municipality is an independent administrative unit of local
government. Municipalities are divided into four classes A, B, C and D as categorised by MoLG in-line with
the decision of the Minister of Local Government on April 20, 1998, based on LGU’s establishment time and
size of population. The municipalities are considered as local governments with autonomy over decision-
making, budgets, personnel management, and with council members elected by the governorate population.
The village councils are administrative structures that depend on a supervisory ministry and whose purpose
is to represent the central power in distant outlying areas.

Moreover, the Local Authorities Law no. (1) of 1997 (the Law) governs the structure, establishment and work
of the LGU. The Law provides the legal basis for LGU’s operations and governance as it specifies the duties
and authorities of the LGU; the public services to be provided; financial management related guidance; the
roles and responsibilities of the LGU’s head of the council and the members; and the elections of those parties.
In addition to the Law, the operations of the LGUs are further regulated by the PA applicable local laws as
well as specific regulations issued by the MoLG to the LGUs. Specifically, the MoLG issued a separate
guidance/instructions on financial management that the LGUs must comply with. These instructions
specified the responsibilities of the LGU finance personnel, and the policies governing the preparation,
execution, and accounting for the LGU’s budget execution. Further, MDLF prepared and shared with the
LGUs a manual of policies and procedures to be used by the LGUs for accounting and record keeping.

MoLG staff confirmed that the Law, the guidance on financial management, and the manual did not discuss
or specify how should the LGUs maintain the accounting records (whether manual books or using a specific
accounting system).

Currently, the LGUs’ budget execution and accounting processes are computerized using diverse and
incompatible systems, and two of the sample LGUs do not have computerized processes for the budget
execution and accounting functions. This situation has a number of adverse effects on the efficiency and
effectiveness of the LGUs’ PFM.

The resultant absence of reliable and timely revenue and expenditure data covering all PA LGUs for budget
planning; monitoring; expenditure control; and, reporting has negatively impacted on the entire range of
budget management activities. This has led to un-controlled commitment of public resources, causing a large
build-up of arrears; continuous requirements for borrowing and donor support; misallocation of resources;
and, the inability to check the effectiveness and efficiency of service delivery. In addition, LGUs and MoLG
have found it difficult to provide an accurate, complete, and transparent account of their financial position to
the Palestinian Legislative Council (PLC) or to other interested parties, including donors and the general
public. This lack of information has had a serious impact on the transparency and accountability of LGUs
when reporting on the management of public finances.

To rectify the above unsatisfactory situation, various stakeholders are planning to strengthen the public
expenditure management through the development and implementation of a standard and unified FMIS for
all LGUs.

The MoLG and MDLF has started this reform few years ago through the purchase and implementation of the
Free Balance PFM system, under a plan to roll out the system to all LGUs in the West Bank within a number
of years. However, according to the MoLG and LGUs, the LGUs’ staff encountered difficulties in using the
Free Balance software which in-turn, led various partners (including the MoLG, MDLF, and World Bank) to
consider alternative solutions to this FMIS issue.

    3.2 Purpose of municipal FMIS
The MoLG and the LGUs need an FMIS to achieve the following objectives:



PwC                                                                                                      Page 8
    1- Automate and unify the processing of budget execution and accounting processes in an effective,
       timely and efficient manner,;
    2- Facilitate the reporting of financial information to comply with the LGU’s regulatory reporting
       requirements;
    3- Provide timely, accurate, and consistent data for management and budget decision-making;
    4- Facilitate financial statement preparation;
    5- Consolidate the LGUs’ public financial management data and reports; and,
    6- Integrate and transfer of data across all information technology (IT) based systems managing the
       LGUs business processes.

The extent of LGUs’ business processes varies according to the size and nature of the LGU. This in-turn affects
the reporting requirements of the LGU and MoLG.

For example, a large LGU may generate revenues from a range of fees, whereas a smaller LGUs will not collect
the same types or magnitude of revenues. Therefore, the FMIS should be able to accommodate the different
needs and profiles of all LGUs.

    3.3 Basis of accounting
The culmination of all financial business processes is the production of the annual financial statements by
LGUs that are constructed using a standard and internationally recognised reporting basis.

For the 12 LGUs in our sample, we found that 8 LGUs (66%) are using the cash basis of accounting; 3 LGUs
(25%) are using the modified accrual basis; and, 1 (9%) is using the full accrual basis. Table 1 in the report
reflects each of the 12 LGUs basis of accounting.

Whilst we cannot speculate whether or not this distribution of the basis for accounting accurately reflects the
situation for entire population of West Bank LGUs, it does provide a clear indication that the basis of
accounting and reporting is not standard across LGUs. This implies that the accounting treatment of similar
business transactions will be handled differently by the LGUs which will ultimately impact on the nature and
content of the financial reports produced by LGUs. Finally, this state of affairs will make it impossible for the
LGUs financial reporting information to be consolidated by the MoLG.

    3.4 Correlation between                             the business processes                            and
        information systems:                           levels of computerisation                          and
        integration of data
        3.4.1        LGUs budget execution and business processes

The LGUs budgets regulate the LGUs financial operations and business processes. The LGUs transactions
that have a financial impact are recorded on the FMIS, yet the LGU should also maintain records for non-
financial information. Based on our work in the 12-sample municipalities, we found that the LGUs are using
one or more information systems to record operations under the following business processes:
         Municipal Budgeting,
         Financial Accounting,
         Project Accounting,
         Treasury and Cash Management,
         Procurement Cycle: Supply Chain Management, Expenditure Management, Contract
             Management and Accounts Payable,
         Human Resource and Payroll Management
         Fixed Assets Life Cycle Management including Maintenance Management,
         Real Estate and Resources Management,
         Land Use and Building Control Management,
         Revenue Cycle: Meter Reading, Billing, Accounts Receivable, and Revenue Management,
         Customer Care and Debt Collection.




PwC                                                                                                       Page 9
The individual municipal budgeting process is currently documented on a unified system called “Bawabe”,
which is controlled centrally by the MoLG, and hence is not within the scope of this report. However, it is
worth noting that the budget categories/items are standard on this system and the municipalities use these
for budget preparation and submission to the MoLG for review and subsequent approval.

The Bawabe system was developed in 2014 by “Jaffa.Net” company, using the funding from the Belgian
Development Agency (BTC). The LGUs use the system to document its annual budget and to send it to MoLG
for approval. Once an LGU enters its budget on the system and is submitted to MoLG review and approval,
the budget cannot be edited unless the MoLG revert the budget to correct certain comments. When the budget
is approved, the budget is locked on the system and the LGU cannot edit it afterwards (full details of the
budget process is described in Component Two report).

Also, the LGUs use the system to enter the quarterly financial report (which is requested by MoLG). Once the
data of the financial report is entered, the Bawabe system can generate a report to show budget versus actual
comparison, based on the information entered by the LGUs.

For other non-financial processes, each municipality currently has unique information system(s) to manage
the relevant data and records. The next section will provide an overview of the main systems to be used at the
sample municipalities.

        3.4.2        Summary of current systems used

The computerization of municipal financial management processes has been supported through a number of
donor supported projects, as a result, there is a wide variance in the design and functionalities of information
systems currently being used by LGUs. Whilst some LGUs are using sophisticated systems, there are others
that do not have any computerized systems, and in between there are some that are using legacy systems of
various types. This situation creates severe compatibility problems between divergent systems being used by
LGUs.

Currently, the 12 LGUs maintain a numerous IT based systems to record and report their business
transactions (financial and non-financial). These systems include FMIS, as well as other systems that are used
for other business operations and needs, with minimal integration or compatibility between these systems.

The current municipal FMIS varies from simple off-the-self to sophisticated systems. The table below presents
a summary of the FMIS in the 12 municipalities:

From the above analysis it can be seen that the majority of the 12 municipalities’ are using FMIS that are off-
the-shelf and developed by local vendors. In some cases these were customized for the municipality’s specific
needs. Only one municipality uses the Free Balance PFM System, and two others use a manual recording
approach.

Some of those municipalities have been using those systems for years and have been updating these on a needs
basis. Others have, in 2015, purchased new accounting information systems or made significant updates to
their systems.

For other business processes, some LGUs maintain other systems to support their business processes and
transactions. Examples of these include:

    -   Revenue Management Information System (RMIS) this is a system developed by a local
        company (Experts) and used for billing and invoicing of fees.
    -   Geographic Information System (GIS) this is used to manage geographical information of the
        city. LGUs have different versions of GIS that were funded by numerous donors and implemented
        through multiple vendors. Except for Ramallah Municipality, other GIS are not integrated into the
        accounting systems.
    -   Building permits and management systems this is used to record permits granted by the
        municipality to the public; and, to manage the various services provided by the municipality for
        construction. These vary from municipality to municipality.
    -   Attendance management systems are used to record staff attendance. These systems vary from
        municipality to municipality.
    -   Human Resources and Payroll management systems are used to provide an automated
        system to manage employees’ records, calculate monthly payroll, and facilitate the pr eparation of
        human resource related reports. These vary from municipality to municipality.
    -   Workflow Management Systems are systems used to record internal memos and
        communications between the departments of LGUs, and they vary from municipality to municipality.

Annex 3 includes a table listing the major information systems used by each municipality under our
assessment, and describes the main challenges faced by the municipalities while using their current FMIS.

        3.4.3        Level of integration among the systems

Municipalities have different systems for their business processes. The number of these systems vary
depending on the municipality’s needs, nature of operations, size, staff capacity, and technology awareness.
Most of the sample 12 municipalities have at least two systems, and there is minimal integration of data
between these systems.

For those municipalities that have a degree of integration across their systems, we found that these have either
been developed by the same vendor or were developed in-house. For example, those LGUs that have Al-
Ghassan system, have contracted the vendor to develop systems for other business operations. In these
instances, it was possible to transfer data automatically from one system to the core accounting system.
Another example is Jenin Municipality, where Al-Shamel accounting system developed by Al-Israa Company,
interfaces with the human resource attendance management system and payroll systems developed by the
same company.

However, in other municipalities, currently they have multiple systems provided by different vendors, and
there is no compatibility or automatic integration of data.

For example, Jericho Municipality uses Al-Ghassan as the core accounting system. It also has a human
resource and payroll system; RMIS for billing; GIS; and, Workflow management system. All of these were
developed by different vendors, and are not integrated.

This absence of compatibility and the inability to integrate data is causing significant problems for
municipalities because of the time and effort spent to duplicate information into the different systems, as well
as cost of maintaining and supporting multiple systems.

    3.5     Challenges faced by municipalities for achieving objectives
            from FMIS
Based on our discussions with the municipalities’ staff, we noted that all 12 municipalities, except for the two
municipalities using the manual approach for recording (see Table 1 on page 10), consider their current FMISs
are achieving the first objective of an FMIS (as specified in section 3.2 above), which is to automate and unify
the processing of budget execution and accounting procedures within the municipality. Moreover, 4 of those
municipalities (Hebron, Nablus, Jericho, and Bethlehem) believe that the current FMIS are not achieving that
objective in an efficient, timely and effective manner.

Add to that, the municipalities’ staff explained that the current FMISs do not achieve any of the other
objectives discussed in section 3.2 above; specifically in relation to providing timely and accurate data for
decision-making, and integration with other information systems.

Due to those reasons, the municipalities are considering the purchase of a new system, or significantly
updating the existing one by the system developer. In fact, Bethlehem Municipality, for instance, has recently
contracted a vendor for the purchase and installation of a new system. Add to that, Birzeit Municipality has
actually changed their system in early 2015.

In addition, all 12 municipalities have indicated that they faced different challenges while implementing the
current or previous systems they have. Based on our inquiries, we noted certain common and recurring
challenges that the municipalities encountered while adopting or using an FMIS. Following are the key
challenges noted:

     Limited LGU staff capacity to use computerised systems.
     The training provided by the vendor on the system was not sufficient to provide a comprehensive
      overview of the functionalities of the system, or was not properly planned.
     Systems functions did not meet the municipality’s operational requirements.
     Chart of accounts is not aligned to budget classifications.
     The time needed by the system to process the recording and posting accounting transactions.
     Difficulties or errors in data processing and reporting. Also, problems in the fiscal year end closing;
      either the system does not give the user the possibility to close the accounting modules at the end of
      the year, or closing balances are not automatically transferred to the new-year.
     The system does not support multi-currency recording and/or reporting.
     Lack of adequate reporting features and tools where the user can have multiple options and types of
      reports, and can choose the level of details the report should reflect. Currently many municipalities
      rely on their IT staff to develop and generate specific reports,
     Bank reconciliations are inaccurate or easily produced.
     Lack of adequate technical support, this is either due to the vendor having an insufficient or
      unqualified technical team capable of resolving technical issues on a timely basis.
     High maintenance costs.
     As discussed previously, a lack of compatibility and integration.

Annex 3 includes a table listing the major information systems used by each municipality under our
assessment, and describes the main challenges faced by the municipalities while using their current FMIS.

    3.6 Weaknesses in Information Technology General Controls
        (ITGCs)
In addition to the above difficulties faced by municipalities, we also found many deficiencies in the ITGC in
the 12 sample LGUs. Whilst the main objective of our assessment was not designed, and did not aim, to do an
analysis and assessment of ITGCs, we would take this opportunity to report some significant and generic
internal control weaknesses that warrant attention. We categorised the deficiencies under four categories, as
follows:

    1. IT governance



PwC                                                                                                     Page 12
  -   Most LGUs lack policies and procedures covering IT applications, or have outdated procedures
      manuals,
  -   Most LGUs lack formal system(s) documentation,
  -   No independent IT external audit has been conducted.

  2. Access Control
  - Lack of adequate segregation of duties,
  - Lack of adequate control over password setting and change procedures; such as, strong password to
     be mandatory, locking the wrongly entered password after a certain number of attempts, password
     expiration date.
  - Remote access to the live system data by the vendor (for support purposes) is not controlled
     adequately as full access is allowed to the vendor, and no audit trail (log) is maintained for any
     changes done during the remote session. Most LGUs developers use unsecured free tools for remote
     support; such as the Teamviewer tool.

  3. Physical Security
  Municipalities do not have adequate control procedures in place to safeguard the servers. Municipalities
  do not have specific room/location for servers, access to server rooms is not restricted to authorised
  persons only. The server rooms typically do not have sprinkler systems, fire and smoke detectors, air
  conditioners and backup power supply, etc.

  4. Backup and Disaster recovery plans
  - No comprehensive disaster recovery plans,
  - No routine backup procedures in some LGUs. In others, backup is not regulated, documented or
     routine.
  - Backup tapes are stored inside the same facility, and in some cases in the server room,
  - There is no backup testing, documentation, or inventory of backup files.

4. Recommendations for future
   FMIS
In pursuit of any new FMIS, the MoLG and LGUs should consider various important factors to ensure positive
outcomes from the new FMIS. These factors are broken down as follows:

    4.1     Basic considerations for standardization

As discussed earlier, one of the main purposes of the MoLG is the consolidation of all LGUs financial reports
to provide an overall view on the PFM of the LGUs. To achieve this objective, it is imperative that a standard
basis for financial reporting to be used by all LGUs.

Currently, municipalities use different basis of accounting. This results in different accounting treatment for
similar types of transactions. This renders the production of meaningful consolidated LGU financial
statements quite difficult.

Therefore as a first-step, the MoLG must ensure that all LGU are using the same basis of accounting. This
will ensure the standardisation of accounting treatment for all financial transactions and the way these are
reported.

For the short-term future and until the basis of accounting is unified, MoLG and LGUs might need to keep
the current status of using different basis of accounting. For that purpose, MoLG and LGU might need to
consider with the new FMIS supplier how the system General Ledger and structure can support the financial
data recording and reporting under different basis of accounting using . Using this approach, the MoLG will
be able to consolidate data of LGUs using similar basis of accounting, but will not be able to have a
consolidated view of all LGUs financial situations.

Moreover, on the long-term, following the accrual basis of accounting by the LGUs will facilitate the planning,
financial management and decision making at the LGU level as well as the government level (at MoLG side).
It provides a robust and internationally acknowledged and accepted way of reporting of financial information.
On the other hand, cash accounting does not account for and report on some important financial information,
such as fixed assets, most (if not all) liabilities, accrued revenues, and other financial data. As such, the cash
accounting will not provide an accurate overview of the financial performance of the entity; on the contrary,
the accrual accounting would provide more comprehensive information, and can allow for better and more
accurate comparison between LGUs.

Second, the chart of accounts should be consistent and standardised for all LGUs. This should be supported
by a detailed procedures manual that will be approved by MoLG, issued to all LGU and updated as necessary
by the MoLG and LGUs. It is recommended that the manual include a narrative description/explanation of
the chart of accounts to serve as a future reference for all stakeholders, especially for LGUs staff to refer to
when they need to link specific transitions and accounts to the budget categories.

The chart of accounts represents the basic building block of any accounting system, FMIS included. The chart
of account should be clear and accounts should be easily searched by the users. The chart of accounts lists all
accounts tracked by the system. Each account in the chart is assigned a unique identifier, or an account
number, involving a series of information tags that denote certain things about the data being entered into
the system. The account number attaches to the data and serves accounting, management and all other
reporting purposes. It also forms part of the data validation process, indicating things such as whether or not
a vendor exists, whether or not there is an authorized budget, and whether or not funds have been committed.
These are just a few of the many validations that a good computerized system will carry out.

While the assessment of the currently available chart of accounts is not within the scope of this report, yet it
is worth to note that the MoLG have developed a unified chart of accounts, which was entered on the Bawabe
and requested all LGUs to use it. However, the LGUs’ systems have different chart of accounts already


PwC                                                                                                       Page 14
established, and the LGUs cannot easily match their chart of accounts with that of the MoLG. Further, the
LGUs indicated that the MoLG chart of accounts is missing few accounts (mainly related to types of fees
collected).

In order to facilitate the recording and reporting of data, the same chart of accounts should be used on the
FMIS and Bawabe. MoLG and LGUs need to agree on the chart of accounts in advance to ensure it is
comprehensive for all LGUs operations. Annex 3 includes the unified chart of accounts as developed by
MoLG.

    4.2     Recommendations related to the FMIS type

While considering and deciding on the FMIS architecture, the stakeholders should consider the advantageous
of having a web-based system where the servers would be installed in one centralised location as would be
agreed by the MoLG and the LGUs. Doing this will save cost to the municipalities through standard servers
and standard maintenance contracts from one reputable and reliable supplier. The implementation of this
recommendation will not only standardize the system’s tools and features across all LGUs, but also provide
standard reporting options and features available to all users. Also, any updates/changes on the system will
automatically be applied to all LGUs, and any fees for these updates will be incurred once only at the
centralized location.

The recommended approach to implementing a web-based system would be first to implement this centrally
and then roll-out on phases to the LGUs.

Based on our meeting with MoLG, MoLG staff indicated that MoLG does not have the legal basis nor the
capacity to act as the administrator on the FMIS. According to MoLG staff, the Law and MoLG’s relevant
instructions do not discuss the record keeping approach that the LGUs should follow and does not mandate
using specific information system. Whereas MoLF staff confirmed that MoLG’s primary goal is to collect the
required information and reports from the LGUs, without bearing the administrative burden of managing the
FMIS.

Finally, the FMIS system must be integrated and compatible with other information systems to
ensure that all LGUs are able to report in a standard, timely, comprehensive and transparent manner to all
stakeholders. Integration implies that the system has the following basic features:
         - Standard data classification for recording financial events;
         - Internal controls over data entry, transaction processing, and reporting; and
         - Common processes for similar transactions and a system design that eliminates unnecessary
             duplication of data entry.

Integration sometimes applies only to the core financial management functions that a FMIS supports, but
ideally, it would also cover other information systems with which the core systems communicate. At a
minimum, the FMIS should be designed to interface with these systems.

The LGUs expect the new FMIS to have a flexible structure that can accommodate integrating data with other
systems, both currently used or any future ones to be acquired by the LGUs; including but not limited to the
RMIS, GIS and Human Resources management systems. In addition, the MoLG and LGUs expect that the
FMIS to be integrated with the Bawabe as to facilitate the reporting of information on timely basis. To that
end, the FMIS will include a module to enter the LGU’s budget, and the FMIS chart of accounts needs to match
the MoLG unified chart of accounts (or accounts automatically linked to the relevant budget categories if not
an exact match).

    4.3     Recommendations related to the system’s functions

The FMIS must be modular, provide scalability, and utilize open-systems architecture, and all modules within
the proposed system should be integrated in real-time so that data is only entered once in the system. The
system should allow for a fast and effective interface with other information systems.




PwC                                                                                                  Page 15
The FMIS modules that are currently being used by LGUs are listed in Annex 2 to this report. MoLG and LGUs
should discuss and agree with the system vendor on the system’s modules that the system should support.

According to our understanding of the LGUs’ needs, t he following functions and features of an FMIS are
essential to the LGUs:
    a) Data consolidation, reporting and exporting:
The proposed system should address the MoLG needs of consolidating LGUs financial information, in real
time, which will assist the MoLG and LGUs in decision-making. Also, the system should enable the LGUs to
view data in different formats, including but not limited to, PDF, Excel, XML, TXT, etc. Vendors should
ensure the integration of the systems application with MS office and PDF applications without these being
installed as separate applications.
    b) Data Migration:
LGUs expect the vendor to facilitate the full migration of data from the current system to the new one, and
allow automatic migration at time of installation of the new system.
    c) Multi-currency:
The LGUs need the software application to support multi-currency formats in recording and reporting
transactions, and be able to automatically and accurately calculate foreign currency exchange translation
variances.
     d) Year-end closing:
The software application must be able to reconcile and close at the end of the financial-year, and to
automatically transfer year-end balances to opening balances in the next financial-year. The manual of the
system procedures should include a clear section covering procedure for doing this and should be explained
to the LGUs’ staff in order that they can do this independently of the vendor.
    e) Budgeting and planning support:
The system should allow the recording of the budget (preferably automatically by having an interface with the
budget system currently used), and controls over budget movement should be enforced on the system in
connection with the current regulations related to budget movements.
    f) System interface:
The system application interface needs to be user-friendly and should support both Arabic and English
languages interfaces, for both data entry and reporting. Users must be able to easily switch between both
languages when using the systems.
     g) Optional specifications:
The following features, though not essential, yet are recommended and can facilitate the work of the LGUs’
staff:
- System must provide alert messages and transaction rejection where validation identifies invalid, out of
     range data input. The message should be clear and concise and displayed in both English and Arabic
     depending on the user interface.
- Other systems integration capabilities (e-banking, SMS gateway, document management system,
     mapping tools, GPS tracking tools).Web support (web applications, mobile applications)
- Ability to provide interface to E-mail.
- Ability to support and manage digital signature.
- System has “Help Button Tool” to be referred to by users for guidance.


    4.4     Recommendations related to the system’s implementation

While this report did not aim to cover the process for FMIS implementation or the contract terms to be signed
with the vendor, however, the following matters are essential for the successful implementation of the system
and should be considered with the various stakeholders prior to implementation:
   1- Recommended hardware:
LGU expect the system vendor to advice on the design and specification of the recommended hardware that
supports the system.
    2- Training on the system:



PwC                                                                                                  Page 16
Training is an integral part for any successful system implementation. Failure to train end users will inevitably
lead to the breakdown of the operational functions of the software application no matter how strong this is.
Therefore, LGUs need training to ensure that they are competent to use the systems applications on a routine
basis. All training provided by the vendor must be timed to ensure that it is provided at dates that are
convenient for the LGUs and taking into account the geographic disparity of the West Bank cities.
    3- Technical support:
The technical post-implementation support on the system should be adequate enough to ensure that all LGUs
are assisted to resolve errors and issues as these arise.
    4- System coding:
The vendor will be expected to provide a program source-code that is meaningful and readable to any
programmer. The vendor should adhere to the program coding standards that are required for efficient
program maintenance and modifications. Program coding standards are essential to writing, reading and
understanding the codes simply, clearly and, without having to refer back to design specifications.
    5- System documentation:
For the MoLG and LGUs, the vendor should provide full documentation of the system to enable the MoLG
and LGU to continue to use the system application in the absence of the vendor. The vendor must provide
documentation that identifies all software, hardware, application design, database, software installation,
system operations and maintenance needed by the municipalities to install, operate, access, and maintain the
system.
    6- System change management:
Changes to the system always require independent testing to mitigate the risk of an inappropriate outcome
from the changes. Systems lifetime and stability are significant factors for assessing whether changes are ready
for a move to production. Modifications that are executed and tested in the production environment pose a
greater risk of unauthorized modifications, therefore, vendors should implement a separate environment for
the system testing purposes.
    4.5     Other considerations

The introduction of a new FMIS should not be seen only as a technology fix, but rather, an FMIS
implementation should also be seen as a public finance reform that affects how things are done across the
LGUs. The implementation of the FMIS will automatically trigger the need to put in place certain changes in
the procedures and related controls maintained by the LGUs. Therefore, business process re-engineering or
redesign is, therefore, an important aspect of any FMIS reform.

One important aspect of the business process re-engineering is the ITGCs, which contribute indirectly to the
achievement of many requirements for proper recording and archiving of data. ITGCs are also important
when manual controls depend on application-generated information. Failures in these controls would affect
the overall control environment for the employed computer applications and will have direct effect on the
integrity of the data used for financial reporting.

The following are some major controls that should be maintained in any future system:

1- Audit Logging:
   - Maintain full detailed audit trail for all transactions made on the system, including but not limited to:
      user ID, date, time, module, activity type (i.e. read, modify, delete), change made,
   - Ability to allow management to review the system administrator's activities without any modifications
      (to preserve the log integrity),
   - Ability to log meaningful errors and retain them for current debugging or for future review,
   - Logs customization — the proposed system should have the ability to customize common error
      messages and logs.

2- System Security:
   - System access should be supported on both HTTP/HTTPS,
   - Ability to access the system anywhere through secure channels,
   - Ability to allow citizens to access certain modules in a secure manner. This feature will allow citizens
       to access a desired municipal service through a normal web site,



PwC                                                                                                      Page 17
  -   Ability to allow the system administrator to configure the permissions in all modules at any time to
      any users,
  -   Ability to integrate with the Active Directory and also to allow Single-Sign-On (SSO) to the system
      with any third party software,
  -   Ability to restrict the system administrator user to only performing administrative transactions on
      the system (restrict the system administrator to perform financial transactions for example),
  -   Ability to allow the system administrator to assign permissions through roles (Role Based Access
      Control) or through assigning permissions to single users. This feature should be used to manage the
      permissions for any user/role on any module,
  -   Ability and flexibility to control user access to the following but not limited to:
            Application module
            Access to screens and reports
            Access to fields
            Read /Write/Execute operations
  -   The system should have the capability y to use anti-virus applications and to check the attachments
      that are entered in the systems,
  -   The ability to use encryption for all or some information in the database,
  -   Ability to encrypt data transmission between client and server,
  -   Ability to restrict the number of unsuccessful logon attempts,
  -   The system should have the capability to view active users, and active sessions,
  -   Ability for the system administrator to disable users (change user status to inactive),
  -   Ability to configure all users’ settings such as password complexity, expiration, changing password,
      etc.

1. Executive Summary
In the territories administrated by the Palestinian Authority (PA), a municipality is an independent
administrative unit of local government. The municipalities are considered as local governments with
autonomy over decision-making, budgets, personnel management, and with council members elected by the
governorate population.

Strengthening the public financial management (PFM) systems and procedures of the Local Government
Units (LGUs) in West Bank and Gaza is of critical importance to the PA as well as other stakeholders (such as
donors).

PFM directly affects the delivery of public services to the LGU’s citizens that will achieve the following
objectives: (1) fiscal discipline; (2) strategic allocation of resources; and (3) efficient service delivery. Thus, it
is imperative to ensure that PFM policies and procedures are being followed.

In this context, the World Bank contracted PricewaterhouseCoopers Palestine (PwC) to do an assessment of
the current PFM processes in a sample of 12 municipalities and to assess whether or not they are following
the LGUs’ PFM policies and procedures.

The assessment was carried out by a PwC team, and was carried out based on inquiries and meetings with
staff from the sample LGUs, Ministry of Local Government (MoLG), and Municipal Development and Lending
Fund (MDLF). The assessment covered the following processes: Budget, Procurement, Revenue, Expenditure,
Cash Management, Accounting and Financial Reporting, Asset Management, Human Resources and Payroll,
Legislative Scrutiny and Audit, and Public Access to Key Fiscal Information.

2. Scope and Objective
2.1 Background of assignment
The PA through the MoLG has a strategy for reforming the current institutional, fiscal and financial systems
of LGUs to enable them to achieve their mandate for providing local services in an efficient, transparent and
accountable manner. To assist in achieving these objectives, the World Bank has been supporting a number
of reforms and initiatives designed to improve the PFM processes and systems used in LGUs and enhance the
fiscal sustainability of LGU’s.
The World Bank has contracted PwC to perform a PFM assessment on LGUs in West Bank. The primary focus
of this assessment is on the following areas:

         Mapping the current systems and business processes for all components of financial management of
          LGUs including their institutional arrangements; funds flow; budgeting; accounting; internal
          controls; financial reporting; asset management; and audit and oversight of public finances;

         Assess the level of computerization of municipal financial management processes and, an assessment
          of the variations between the prescribed systems and the actual practices; and

         Provide recommendations for the reform and capacity building of financial management systems of
          LGUs that can be delivered through the ongoing and planned interventions by the World Bank; other
          development partners; and, the PA.

2.2 Scope of work
The PFM assessment covered the following two key components:
          Component One - Assessment of Municipal FMIS:
The objective of this component was to assess whether there is compatibility between the systems used by
LGU’s and provide recommendations for the design of a revised system that will ensure that there is coherence
and compatibility between the new FMIS and the current FMIS applications. This assessment:
         Reviewed the different municipal FMIS systems currently used in the municipalities;
         Assessed the financial management and information requirements of LGUs to establish if the current
          and proposed FMIS effectively addresses these needs; and
         Assessed the extent to which core municipal processes including local revenue collection and asset
          management are computerized.


          Component Two - Assessment of PFM Systems and Processes of LGUs:
The assessment of the PFM processes was done through:
         Reviewing the current institutional arrangements of the LGU PFM systems and how effectively these
          are functioning; and
         Assessing the design and functioning of the core PFM processes: Budget preparation; Revenue
          Collection and Expenditure Management; Billing/Invoicing; Fund Flows; Accounting; Financial
          Reporting; Internal and other Management Controls; Asset Management; Audit; Legislative Scrutiny
          and Oversight; Human Resources and Training; and, Citizen Engagement in PFM.

This report covers only component two (Assessment of PFM system and processes of the
LGUs) mentioned above.

2.3 Approach and methodology
A qualified and experienced team was assigned to carry-out this assessment. To complete this assessment, we
used the following four-stage strategy:

1- Planning:
   We developed specific questionnaires and work programs to guide the conduct of the assessment and to
   ensure that we collected all valid and relevant information.

2- Interviewing officials and gathering data:
   We obtained our information through interviewing key stakeholders of the LGUs. The interviews were
   done in person and were designed to allow us to understand and evaluate the information provided for
   this assessment.

      Our interviews focused on understanding the current procedures being followed by the LGUs under the
      business processes/cycles specified in the scope of work above.

3- Reviewing documents:
   We reviewed information obtained through inquires, and relevant documents, to help in assessing the
   current processes, and to identify current areas of weakness that require remedial action or need
   improvement. Where possible, we validated stakeholders’ responses by reference to documentary
   evidence.

      All the above activities were designed to ensure the delivery of relevant and practical conclusions and
      recommendations that are designed to benefit users of this report.

4- Writing the report:
   The conclusion of this assignment was drafting the final assessment report. The first-stage was an initial
   draft being prepared by the core assessment team. This draft was then subjected to quality assurance
   reviews to ensure that the content of the assessment report was accurate and consistent.

2.4 Sample municipalities for assessment
A sample of 12 municipalities was selected by the World Bank for the assessment purposes, and included
municipalities of different sizes in terms of population and nature of operations. The sample comprised the
following municipalities: Hebron, Nablus, Ramallah, Jenin, Jericho, Bethlehem, Birzeit, Yatta, Turmosaya,
Aqaba, Alkhader, and Bido.

2.5 Key assumptions
Because of the inherent limitations in any internal control framework, misstatements due to error or fraud
may occur and not be detected. Also, predictions of any evaluation of the effectiveness of internal control to
future periods are subject to the risk that the internal control framework may become inadequate because of
changes in the control environment; or, that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures
regulating internal control may deteriorate.

Our services provided under this assignment do not constitute an audit or review performed in accordance
with International Standards on Auditing or International Standards on Review Engagements, and thus, we
do not express any assurance on the subject matter of this assessment.

Our work under this engagement was limited to obtaining an understanding of the current business processes
and the related policies and procedures followed by the sample municipalities, and identifying control
deficiencies based on our understanding of the actual processes, policies and procedures. Our scope of work,
though, did not aim to identify all weaknesses of internal controls in the LGUs due to the diversity of their
operations and procedures, as well as the differences in their available resources and human resource
capacity. Finally, our work did not constitute an assessment of staff qualifications or capabilities to perform
their duties.

3. Municipalities in Palestine
3.1 Legal framework
The structure, establishment and work of an LGU is governed by the Local Authorities Law no. (1) of 1997 (the
Law). The Law provides the legal basis for LGU’s operations and governance as it specifie s the duties and
authorities of the LGU; the public services to be provided; financial management related guidance; the roles
and responsibilities of the LGU’s council members; head of the council, and other personnel; and the elections
of those parties. In respect of elections, the Law makes reference to the related law governing the LGUs
elections. From information obtained from stakeholders we understand that elections are regulated by the
Local Government Units Elections Law no. (10) of 2005.

The Law designated the MoLG to oversee the operations of all municipalities and village councils in the West
Bank and Gaza. Included in its responsibilities, the MoLG monitors and supervises the operations of local
authorities and ensures that these authorities comply with relevant laws and policies. The MoLG also approves
the annual budget for all local authorities.

In addition to the above, the operations of the LGUs are further regulated by the PA applicable local laws as
well as specific regulations issued by the MoLG to the LGUs. Specifically, the MoLG issued instructions on
PFM that must be complied with by the LGUs. These instructions are available and accessible on the MoLG
website and other sources. These instructions are published on the MoLG website, however, they are undated
and are not signed by the Minister of Local Government, and accordingly may not be valid in legal terms.

The municipalities and village councils are considered as local governments with financial autonomy and are
managed by council members who are elected by the governorate population. The Law specified 27 functions
of the council that constitute the council duties and responsibilities to the public; namely: town planning;
building licensing and construction control; water supply; electricity supply; sewage management; public
markets management; licensing of trades and businesses; public health monitoring; collection and disposal
of solid waste; public storage control; public parks; cultural and sport activities; public transport (land and
sea); control of peddlers and open markets; weights and measures control; advertisement control; building
demolition; disposal of remnants of roads; social services for the poor; cemeteries; precautions against floods,
fires and natural disasters; hotel operation control; regulation of pack animals; canine control; budget
approval and management; and, management of the local government's assets and funds.

3.2 Institutional framework
MoLG categorised LGUs into the following four classes in-line with the decision of the Minister of Local
Government of April 20, 1998, as follows:

Class A: Is a primary municipality or district capital of the governorate,
Class B: Is municipalities with over 15,000 inhabitants,
Class C: Is for municipalities having populations between 5,000 and 15,000,
Class D: Is for municipalities with populations of less 5,000.

The Law stipulated that the LGU will be governed by the council whose members will be elected in accordance
with the above mentioned elections law. The Council of Ministers Decision no. (211) of 2004 determined the
number of the council members to be elected at the LGUs; as follows:

 LGU criteria                                                                      Council members
                                                                                       number
 A primary municipality                                                                      15
 Municipalities having a population of over 15,000 inhabitants                               13
 LGU established after 1994 and have more than 5,000 inhabitants                             11
 LGU’s inhabitants are between 1,000 to 5,000                                                9
 LGU’s inhabitants are less than 1,000                                                        7


PwC                                                                                               Page 10
The council has the responsibility to set policies and procedures governing the operations of the LGUs, after
taking into account the regulations and instructions issued by the MoLG. Article (16) of the Law specifies the
roles and responsibilities of the head of the council which includes, but not limited to, the following:
  - Setting and managing the council meetings,
  - The representative of the council and the authorized person to sign, on behalf of the council, for grants,
       loans, rent contracts, purchases contracts, and other legal commitments,
  - Supervising the LGU operations and personnel,
  - Managing and supervising the LGU’s revenues and expenditures.

3.3 General information on the selected municipalities
As reported above, a sample of 12 municipalities was selected by the World Bank for the assessment. The table
below shows the sample councils by MoLG class:

4. Key Functions and Processes
4.1       Budget
Budget Formulation and Monitoring
The municipalities follow the MoLG instructions when preparing budgets. This process starts once the
municipality receives a notice from MoLG to start the planning process for the annual budget. This notice
mainly includes the guidance on establishing the budget committee; the procedures to be followed; the
template forms to be completed; and, the deadlines for submission. The budget notice is received and handled
by the budget department; for small and medium size municipalities where a budget department does not
exist, the finance department leads the budget preparation.

The budget or finance department requests all departments to develop their own budgets, based on prior year
figures; their needs for the next year based on the set strategy and plans; and, taking into consideration the
actual figures reported in the prior year.

Following the preparation of each department’s budget, the budget committee meets to discuss these
preliminary budgets. Typically, the budget committee includes the head of the council (or Mayor in
municipalities); and the heads of all departments, including budget and finance or designate of the heads of
these departments.

Following this meeting, departments adjust the preliminary budget and send a final draft budget to the budget
committee for review for any final adjustments. The budget committee then sends the draft budget
(consolidated for the whole LGU) to the LGU council for review and approval.

Once the council’s approval is obtained, the budget is submitted, by the budget or finance department, online
to MoLG using the online budget program Bawabeh. This was developed by MoLG and introduced in 2014
for use in the 2015 budget preparation. After submission of the budget to the MoLG, the LGU has no ability
to edit the budget. MoLG’s instructions require that the LGU budget is submitted to the MoLG one month
before the beginning of the fiscal year. All LGU budget submissions must be supported by documents showing
the basis of the calculations made by the municipality in their budget submission.

The budget is initially reviewed by the MoLG district office and discussed with the municipality. Any
comments by the MoLG district office are recorded in Bawabeh. If the municipality agrees to these
adjustments, they will then amend the budget accordingly, after the MoLG district office gives the
municipality access to edit the budget and re-submit. When all MoLG’s district office comments are adjusted,
the budget submits to the MoLG’s central budget department.
A central budget department in MoLG reviews the budget, and can send back comments either to MoLG
district office or directly to the municipality. These comments are also made on Bawabeh. Once approved by
the MoLG, the budget is endorsed and is made official.

The budget is broken down by type of service or activity. The municipality is allowed to make any transfers
within the budget items within the same sources of funds, and these are approved by the Mayor and finance
manager. Any transfers between budget items from different sources of funds requires MoLG’s approval.
These approvals are sought by letters from the LGU to the MoLG, and these are not recorded on the Bawabeh.
If these transfer requests from the LGU are approved, the MoLG edits the municipality’s budget on the
Bawabeh. However, based on our discussions with the municipalities, they confirmed that the approval letters
are usually sent to MoLG after making the transfer, and not prior to that.

For the 12 municipalities in the sample, 6 have approved 2015 budgets whilst the other 6 do not (Jenin,
Hebron, Jericho, Bethlehem, Birzeit, and Turmosaya). Hebron, Jericho, Bethlehem and Birzeit Municipalities
have submitted the draft budgets to MoLG and the budgets are under discussion with MoLG. The
municipalities indicated that there was a delay in budget submission this year (2015). According to the
municipalities, the main reasons for the delay in preparing and approving the 2015 budgets are:
      -   The inconsistency/incompatibility between the Bawabeh budget items and the municipality’s
          financial system chart of accounts, which required more time from the municipalities in preparing
PwC                                                                                             Page 12
          the budget. Since the Bawabeh was introduced in 2015, certain municipalities are not able to match
          their chart of accounts to the Bawabeh budget items considering the nature of their systems and chart
          of accounts;
      -   MoLG has not yet approved the list of employees (‫)جدول تشكيالت الوظائف‬, and accordingly the respective
          personnel costs included in the budget, due to non-compliance with the structure and requirements
          specified by the Council of Ministers Law no. (1) of 2009 that regulates different LGUs’ personnel
          issues.

As for donor funding of development projects, the municipality incorporates their estimates of donor funding
into the budget only in the case where the funding is known and there is an initial agreement with the donor
to fund the project. In that case, the donor funding is allocated to those projects that will be implemented,
based on the municipality’s plans. If a specific funded project was not included in the annual approved budget
as the municipality did not envisage that project when preparing the budget, then, the municipality requests
the MoLG to create a new budget category on the Bawabeh for that project.

Level of Computerization
The draft or approved budgets are not entered into the municipalities FMIS; Ramallah Municipality is the
exception to this. The FMIS of Ramallah Municipality has a specific module to enter the annual budget, and
does not allow any overspending on a specific budget item unless approval for budget transfer was obtained
from the municipality’s council. For the other municipalities, as the FMIS does not have the option to enter
the budget, the municipality’s main control over budget overspending is the review of the budget department
on each expenditure to check whether the transaction is budgeted for.

The municipality should prepare quarterly reports showing budget versus actual comparisons as required by
the MoLG. These comparisons are prepared manually, and starting in 2015, they are entered into the Bawabeh
reporting module to be submitted to the MoLG. Except for Jenin and Turmosaya, the municipalities are
preparing those quarterly comparison reports and are submitting to MoLG (either by email or through
Bawabeh).

Budget Comprehensiveness and Transparency
The budgets of LGUs covers all expenditures and revenues. Expenditures include capital improvement and
construction expenditures; development expenditures; and, recurrent expenditures. Some transactions are
kept off-budget. These include the receipt of the contractors’ guarantees as these are not an asset of the
municipalities and will be returned to the contractors. In the case of a contractor’s breach of terms and
conditions, and where the guarantee has been liquidated by the municipality, the amount of the guarantee is
allocated and used to the same project activities.

The municipality’s budget (draft or approved) is not shared with the public. Municipalities stated that there
is no policy from MoLG or other parties requiring that municipalities must publicly disclose their budgets.

4.2       Procurement
Procurement Policies and Procedures
Municipalities are required to follow the MoLG’s regulations on procurement and contracts that were issued
in April 1999, as well as the manual of policies and procedures (the Manual) that was developed by MDLF and
approved by MoLG. This manual covers the financial and administrative aspects of the LGU’s operations.

The procurement cycle starts at the requesting department level. Once a department specifies a need for
works/services or supplies, the department contacts the procurement department (or the finance department
at certain municipalities). In the case of supplies, the procurement department first checks with the
warehouse department to check if the item is in stock. For services, as well as for supplies not in stock, the
finance department checks the municipality’s budget to ensure there is budget allocated for the requested
purchase. If the item is not budgeted for and the purchase is approved by the Mayor, a budget transfer should
be approved by the Mayor and finance manager thus allocating funds for the purchase (this transfer of funds
is done in accordance with the procedures on budget transfer discussed in the previous section).

Once budget availability is confirmed, and the purchase is approved by the Mayor (or his/her designee for
purchases lower than ILS 3,000), the finance department request the procurement department to start the
purchasing process. If the item costs less than ILS 1,000, a direct purchase can be done. Above that threshold,
the procurement department should request tenders as follows:
         If the item cost is less than ILS 10,000, the department should collect a minimum of three written
          offers, and
         If the item cost is above ILS 10,000, the department should use the open bid process (advertisement
          in newspaper).

For the open bid process, an advertisement is published in newspapers to request interested bidders to submit
their offers within a specified time. All bids received are kept in a safe until bid opening date, where the bidders
would be invited to attend the opening of the bids. A procurement committee is established to open and
evaluate the bids and then select the winning supplier. This committee should have a minimum of four
members, and typically includes the finance manager (or officer); purchasing manager (or officer); the
requesting department representative; and, a member of the municipality’s council.

The municipalities indicated that these procedures are usually followed, nonetheless, certain cases might
require an exception from the procedures. However, municipalities do not have a clear policy how and when
such exceptions are allowed.

Evaluation and Award of Contract
Evaluations of bids are done by the procurement committee. The committee could include a member with
technical expertise relevant to the item being procured.

Evaluations are carried out thoroughly and on the basis of the criteria specified in the bid invitation
documents. The committee prepares an evaluation report describing the details of their evaluation of the bids,
the ranking of the bidders, and the criteria used to select the winner.

Depending on the nature and type of services or supplies requested, the evaluation committee considers
different criteria when evaluating the bids. The following criteria are normally considered by the evaluation
committee:
 The scope and/or functions of the work or service required;
 The quality expected;
 Where appropriate, the estimated maintenance requirements;
 Cost estimates;
 Time plan/schedule;
 Adherence to the schedule of deliverables requested; and,
 In case of construction contracts bidding, a site visit is made to the contractors’ premises to check the
     contractors’ equipment and capability to do the work.



PwC                                                                                                   Page 14
Municipalities keep a record of the evaluation committee meetings and the evaluation results. There is a
protocol in place to ensure safeguarding of bid information during the evaluation process where all bids are
kept in a safe until the evaluation committee meeting, and all documents are archived after the bids.

Once a supplier is selected, the evaluation report is sent to the Mayor to review, along with the contract to be
signed by the supplier and the Mayor on behalf of the municipality.

For goods purchased, a committee is formed to receive the items delivered. The committee usually includes
the warehouse officer, procurement officer, and the technical/requesting department. The committee
matches between the purchase order, supplier’s invoice, and items actually received, and notes any
discrepancies. The committee then prepares and signs a report of goods receipt and sends to the finance
department. The finance department enters the purchase invoice into the system. However, at Jericho
Municipality, the warehouse officer has access to the accounting system and records the purchase invoice on
the system upon recording the stock receipt in the inventory module.

Level of Computerization
Except for Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities, the other municipalities maintain procurement related
documents on paper file, such as the purchase request, purchase order, receipt form. These paper documents
are signed by the preparer and reviewer. Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities have systems to record the
initiation of the purchase request, its review and approval, which is done electronically. These procurement
systems allow the procurement department to check the availability of an item in stock automatically as the
inventory system provide up-to-date information on stock status.

Upon checking the budget (before starting the bidding process), the finance department is expected to commit
the costs on the FMIS. This is done to provide management with an up-to-date commitments status for
management’s review and monitoring of budget spending and cash flow forecasting/planning. However, only
Ramallah Municipality’s system records such budget commitment electronically on the system before the
purchase. All other municipalities perform the checking manually, and only record the actual amount of the
purchase on the FMIS.

4.3     Revenue Cycle
Categories/Types of Revenue
As discussed earlier, the Law defines 27 functions and responsibilities of the LGU’s council to the public. These
include providing or managing public services that generate revenues to the municipality. The number of
services expected to be provided varies from one municipality to another depending on the municipality class,
size of the population served, and other considerations including the growth and maturity of the municipality
or government regulations on the provision of certain services.

The main municipal revenue sources are: fees, taxes, user charges (that is, utilities revenues), transfers from
the PA, and municipal fines. These are described below:

Fees: These are fees collected from the public for the general services provided to the public by the
municipalities. These fees include: (1) crafts, industries, and professions fees, (2) transportation fees and
fines, (3) construction permits fees, (4) public market related fees, and (5) signboard fees.

User Charges: these are mainly charges for water supply, and solid waste collection services.

Taxes: This includes property tax, housing tax, and education tax:
   - Property tax: this is based on the annual rental value of the property, and is collected by the Ministry
       of Finance (MoF). The current tax rate in the West Bank is 17%. After collection, the MoF retains 10%
       as management fees, and transfers the remaining 90% to municipalities;
   - Education tax: this is also based on the annual rental value of the property, and is collected by the
       municipalities. Education tax collected is supposed to be used for construction and maintenance of
       educational facilities. The current tax rate in West Bank is 7%.

Municipalities’ staff confirmed that not all municipalities are levying the taxes reported above, and even those
municipalities that levy those taxes, there is no clear information whether these taxes are being applied and
collected consistently and uniformly to the public. In addition, the staff confirmed that the municipalities
record revenues from the property tax for the percentage collected by the municipalities (i.e. 90%) and not
the entire amount.

Historically, five municipalities (Hebron, Yatta, Nablus, Jenin, and Aqaba) were providing electricity services
to the public. The Israeli Electricity Corporation (IEC) was directly supplying those municipalities with the
electricity power. As municipalities debts to the IEC increased with time, the Israeli Ministry of Finance
started to make deductions on the clearance revenues collected on behalf of the PA to cover portion of the
unpaid electricity bills outstanding on the municipalities to the IEC. Accordingly, the municipalities’ became
liable to the MoF for the balances deducted from the clearance revenues.

Under PA plans and energy sector strategy to enhance the electricity services to the public, district electricity
companies were established to handle the provision of electricity services in place of the municipalities. In
2000, the Hebron Electricity Power Company (HEPCO) was established to cover the cities of Hebron and
Halhul. In 2004, the Southern Electricity Company (SELCO) was established to cover the cities of Yatta, Dura,
Daheria, and in 2010, the North Electricity District Company (NEDCO) was established to cover the cities of
Nablus and Jenin.

At time of establishment the district company, each of the five municipalities made an agreement with the
MoF on the balances due on the municipalities and manner of payment. These balances and settlement
payments are reflected on the municipality records. As for the accounts receivable due on the customers, these
balances were kept on the municipalities records and left to the municipalities the responsibility of collecting
those balances. The municipality agreed with the district company on a mechanism where the district
company can assist in collecting those accounts receivable for a percentage of the fees collected. As for the
assets, the municipalities agreed to transfer all assets related to the electricity service provision to the district
company for ownership percentage of that district company. According to the municipalities staff, the assets
transfers to NEDCO was made according to the assets book value on the municipalities’ records, however, as
for SELCO, the value of the assets was based on the assessment of the assets fair value at the time of transfer.



PwC                                                                                                    Page 16
Billing, Collecting and Recording
The revenue recognition method varies among the 12 municipalities dependent on the basis of accounting
used. Municipalities following the cash basis and modified accrual basis of accounting record the revenue at
the time of collection. Whereas municipalities following the accrual basis (Ramallah Municipality only) record
the revenue when incurred (at the time of billing).

The 12 municipalities have electronic billing systems to calculate the revenue, issue the invoices, record
collections, and manage customers’ balances. However, the transfer of data (collection mainly) between the
billing system to the accounting system is usually done manually; except in Ramallah and Hebron
Municipalities where data is integrated.

The revenue collection process differs based on the type of the revenue. For taxes and fees collectible by the
municipality, the collection is made by one of the following methods:

Cash collection through the municipality’s collectors: when revenues are due for payment, a report
from the billing system is generated electronically. This report is distributed to the collectors, based on the
areas distribution. For amounts collected, the collector provides the payee with a manual receipt voucher. At
the end of each day, the collector prepares a daily cash report and attaches a copy of the manual receipt
vouchers to the report, and submits it along with the cash or checks received to the treasurer for approval and
reconciliation of the report. The treasurer then submits the report to the finance department who record the
cash collected on the system, and provides the cash to another finance officer to deposit in the bank

However, at Jenin Municipality, the collector does not necessarily report cash collected and reconcile it with
the treasurer on daily basis. Further, at Jenin, Aqaba, and Jericho Municipalities, there is lack of segregation
of duties as the treasurer has access to record and post transactions on the accounting system.

Cash collected at the municipalities’ premises: Citizens pay the due amount of services directly at the
municipalities’ customer service department. The department officer enters the amount of cash paid directly
into the billing system and provide the payee with a receipt voucher from the system and maintain a copy for
his records. During the day, the officer print a report of cash payments made and send to the treasurer, along
with the copies of receipt vouchers, with the cash collected. The same process is then followed by the treasurer
for reporting and depositing of cash as done with collectors.

Bank transfer: This method is limited to government’s transfers for the revenues collected by the
government on behalf of the municipality; such as property tax. Under this method, a copy of the bank notice
should be received from the bank by the finance department for review and to check the classification of the
revenue (that is, which type of revenue the receipt is for). The receipt voucher is then entered and recorded
on the system.


Reporting
The municipalities follow up on unpaid bills through sending notices to the debtors. Tracking of debt is done
through the billing systems. However, municipalities’ reported poor follow-up on outstanding bills, and that
further efforts should be made by the municipalities to collect the debts.

In terms of reporting and analysis of data, there is no clear framework or policy for municipalities to prepare
reports on revenues and collections for review and analysis by management. Municipalities rely on their
billing systems to see the balances of the customers and issues ad hoc reports when requested by management.

Level of Computerization
As discussed previously, the municipalities have separate billing systems that they use to calculate the
revenue, issue the invoices, record collections, and manage customers’ balances. Cash collection by the
collectors is done on manual receipt vouchers. Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities have recently purchased
automatic payment recording (pocket) machines that are automatically connected to the relevant billing
system. The payment receipt voucher issued from this pocket machine is given to the customer.

In addition, as indicated above, except in Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities, data is not integrated between
the FMIS and the billing systems.
PwC                                                                                               Page 17
4.4 Expenditure Cycle
Categories/Type of Expenditures
The expenditures types/categories that are being incurred at the municipality varies from one to another
depending on the size and nature of operations, however, the following are the main categories of
expenditures:

Payroll: the salaries of the staff.
Recurrent expenditures: the general and administrative expenses incurred by the municipality.
Works and supplies: incurred for the purchase of goods or services, including construction costs.

This section covers the recording and payment of expenses (other than payroll and related costs that are
covered under the Human Resources and Payroll Cycle; section 4.8) after being procured and received (the
procurement and delivery of goods and services is covered under the Procurement cycle; section 4.2).

Expenditure Approval and Recording
The approval of expenditure depends on the amount and nature of the transactions. The main differences
between recurrent and works expenditures are the types of supporting documents that should be maintained
to approve the expenditure, and the persons in charge of reviewing such supporting documents.

For all expenditures, the municipality should collect official supporting documents, such as contracts and
invoices. In addition to those, for supplies and equipment purchases, the supporting documents should
include a purchase order and confirmation of receipt of the supplies or equipment. For works type of expenses,
the payment request and progress report should be reviewed and signed by the project manager.

Upon receipt of a supplier payment request, this payment request should be sent to the accountant along with
the relevant supporting documents. The accountant should make sure that the supporting documents are
original, adequate and appropriate according to the municipalities’ policies and procedure s, and accordingly
prepares a payment voucher. For most municipalities, any payment voucher above ILS 5001 is signed by the
accountant, and is approved by the finance manager, the Mayor, and a council member (from the council
committee that supervises the financial affairs). For small municipalities, all transactions, regardless of the
amount, are approved in this manner. For expenditures below ILS 500, only the financial manager signs the
voucher. In Bethlehem, Yatta, and Jericho municipalities, the payment voucher is also signed by the internal
auditor. Upon the voucher approval, the treasurer prepares the check or bank transfer and submits for
signature by the authorized signatories along with the payment vouchers and supporting documents.

Expenditure Payments
Expenditure recording processes vary from one municipality to another due to the differences in the
accounting basis used. For municipalities using the cash basis, once the payment voucher is approved, the
treasurer makes the payment either in cash or by check on the date the check is signed (not post-dated). Once
cash or check is received by the supplier, the treasurer sends the voucher along with the supporting documents
to the finance department to be recorded on the system. Once recorded, a serially numbered payment voucher
is generated from the system, dated per the date of handing over the payment to the recipient, and is filed at
the finance department records along with relevant supporting documents.

For municipalities following the accrual and modified accrual basis, the expenses are recorded once accrued.
For purchases of supplies and equipment, upon receipt of those items by the municipality, the accountant
reviews the supporting documents that evidence the receipt of the items and accordingly record the expenses
and prepares the payment voucher and the check. The payment voucher along with the check and supporting
are sent for approval and signature of the finance manager, and the Mayor (above certain limits, discussed in
the next section, the check requires signature of a council member). The payment voucher is dated on the day
the finance manager reviews the vouchers and posts the transaction on the accounting system.

At year end, the municipalities finance staff look for expenses that are incurred and for which invoices are still
not received from the suppliers in order to record these expenses on the records. For supplies received, the
municipality recognises the expense amount based on the supplier’s delivery note, or in case there is not one,

1This threshold might differ slightly from one municipality to another.
PwC                                                                                                 Page 18
based on the quantity received and the values specified in the procurement. For recurrent expenses, the
municipality estimates the amount of the expense (normally the municipality’s staff record the amount as per
the invoices received after year-end to match the amount, however, the date of the expenses would be as of
year-end).

Level of Computerization
For Ramallah and Hebron municipalities, payment vouchers are prepared, reviewed, and approved by the
different personnel electronically on the FMIS. As for the other municipalities, they use manual payment
vouchers that are signed manually by the relevant authorised parties. Checks are filled manually at all
municipalities.




PwC                                                                                            Page 19
4.5 Cash Management and Treasury
Treasury and Banking Operations
The Manual (developed by MDLF) provides guidance for the municipalities to manage and safeguard its
treasury assets. It covers the procedures related to the use of bank accounts, managing and reconciling the
bank accounts, and use of petty cash.

The 12 municipalities’ treasury related procedures contain the following:

Cash at bank
The municipalities’ policies require that o pening or closing of a bank account should be approved by the
municipality’s council based on the recommendation of the financial manager. The policies also recommend
that minimal bank accounts are opened to avoid excessive bank charges and to maintain strong controls over
the bank accounts.
In general, the bank accounts maintained by the 12 municipalities are either current accounts or deposit
accounts. These are denominated in ILS or other currencies (mainly US Dollars and Jordanian Dinars). The
bank accounts are divided into three main types:
Specific fund bank account: this account is used for specific fund activities that have separate budget
categories. This account should be used for the revenues and expenditures made for that specific fund only.
General bank account: this account is used for collecting revenues that do not have a specific bank account,
and payment of general and administrative expenses.
Payroll bank account: this account is used for payment of monthly salaries of municipalities’ employees,
as well as other related personnel costs.

The authorized signatories for bank accounts in municipalities are divided into two levels; A and B, as follows:

                          Level A                                Level B
               Mayor (Head of Municipality)           Financial manager or financial
                                                      manager assistant
               Council member 1                       Manager of Municipality
               Council member 2                       -

The threshold for the authorized signatories are:
    - For any amount up to ILS 1,500, check should be signed by two signatories of level B,
    - If the amount is between ILS 501 and 10,000, check should be signed by the two signatories of level
        B, and one signatory of level A, and
    - If the amount is above than ILS 10,000, check should be signed by the two signatories of level B, and
        two signatories of level A.
Bank reconciliations are prepared electronically or manually dependent on the system being used by the
municipality. Monthly bank reconciliations should be prepared for all bank accounts. The accountant
prepares the bank reconciliation (by using an internal form if it is done manually) and submits the
reconciliation to the finance manager for review. At Aqaba, Birzeit, Turmosaya and Bido Municipalities, the
accountant prepares the bank reconciliations and no one reviews the reconciliation. Also at Aqaba and
Alkhader Municipalities, the reconciliations are not done on monthly basis. At Jenin Municipality, the
treasurer (who has access to cash as well as recording access to the system) prepares the bank reconciliations,
which is not reviewed by any other person.

Petty Cash
In general, petty cash is used by municipalities for payment of small and frequent administrative
expenditures. At small municipalities, there is no petty cash box but instead cash advance (‫ )سلف نقدية‬is paid for
the custodian to disburse on the expenditures.

The petty cash box in the municipalities is under the responsibility of the custodian, and the person who has
access to cash is covered by fidelity insurance; moreover, cash is insured against fire and theft.


PwC                                                                                                 Page 20
When the petty cash is reimbursed, the custodian prepares a report for all paid expenses attached with
supporting documents (invoice, payment voucher, internal memo and other) and sends this to the accountant
for review. The accountant then prepares a payment request for reimbursement which is approved by the
finance manager and Mayor. A check is then issued under the name of the custodian and is stamped as “paid
for first beneficiary only”.

There are no clear policies followed by municipalities regulating the types of expenses to be paid from petty
cash; the thresholds for the amounts to be disbursed from petty cash; and, the ceiling of petty cash that should
be kept by the custodian.

Municipalities maintain a safe or box for retaining cash and checks received from citizens. This safe/box has
two keys, one is kept by the treasurer and the other by the Mayor or his/her assistant. The treasurer is
responsible for depositing checks and cash at the banks on daily basis, and the bank deposit receipt should be
sent to the accountant at the finance department for filing. At some municipalities, the bank receipt/slip is
filed by the treasurer.

Cash Flow Management
Out of the 12 municipalities, those small and medium sized municipalities that have few revenue
sources/types usually have a limited number of bank accounts to manage their cash operations.

Such small and medium sized municipalities rely heavily on their few revenue sources to fund their
operations, and they do not usually borrow or take loans from commercial banks or other institutions. The
finance departments in these municipalities rarely conduct any cash forecasting or planning for their
expectations of future cash inflow and outflow, or develop plans for investment of any large fund balances.

In the large municipalities, while they also rely on their revenues sources, they have numerous activities that
generate income for the municipality. As such, some municipalities, like Nablus, has a large number of bank
accounts to manage these revenue sources. Having many bank accounts could make cash management
difficult, complex, and inefficient.

Level of Computerization
Out of the 12 municipalities, only Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities perform the bank reconciliations
electronically. As for the others, reconciliations are done manually. Municipalities following the cash basis of
accounting record any payments received in checks (post-dated) on the accounting system using an
intermediary account until the date of check withdrawal whereby then the payment is recorded on the revenue
account. However, Jericho Municipality does not record post-dated checks on the accounting system until
payment, and they maintain a separate record of these checks to monitor their dates.

4.6 Accounting and Financial Reporting
Accounting and Financial Reporting Policies and Procedures
The Law requires the LGUs to maintain proper records for its financial transactions. Further, the Manual
provides guidance on the financial policies and procedures to be followed by the municipalities depending on
the basis of accounting used. The Manual is based on the accrual and the modified accrual basis of accounting.
MDLF also issued an additional guide covering the accounting procedures followed on the cash basis of
accounting (for use of the municipalities following the cash basis).

The Manual provides guidance on, but not limited to, the types of basis of accounting and the benefits of each;
types and purposes of financial reports along with the intended users of these reports; the accounting
procedures to be followed for recording the financial transactions; and procedures to be followed when closing
the financial year.

The Manual also stipulates the requirement to select an external auditor to perform the annual statutory audit
of the LGU’s financial statements. Clause 10 (b) under Section (V) of the Manual requires that the audit of the
financial statements must be done in accordance with the International Auditing Standards or other
recognized auditing standards (without specifying what these other auditing standards are). For the 12
municipalities in our sample, we noted that most municipalities have recent audited financial statements
where the auditors’ reports were issued in accordance with the International Standards on Auditing. Two
municipalities: Jenin Municipality does not have audited financial statements for the last three years (2012,
2013 and 2014); and, Turmosaya Municipality does not have any audited financial statements.

Table 1 on the next page of the report summarizes the basis of accounting followed by each municipality along
with the latest available audited financial statements.

Section (IV) of the Manual listed the types of financial reports that must be prepared by the LGUs, including
reports for internal use. The reports that should be submitted to the MoLG are:
      1- Quarterly trial balance, along with detailed trial balance for each budget fund;
      2- Annual financial statements;
      3- The annual budget (as previously discussed in Budget Cycle).

We found that the 12 municipalities do not submit the quarterly trial balance. The 12 municipalities, as
requested by MoLG budget preparation notice, prepare and submit quarterly reports to the MoLG that show
the actual versus budget per each line item at the end of each quarter. Further, those municipalities that have
audited financial statements send a copy of these to the MoLG.

Accounting and Financial Reporting Standards
The annual financial statements of the LGUs are being prepared using a standard and internationally
recognised reporting basis. For the 12 LGUs in our sample, we found that 8 LGUs (66%) use the cash basis of
accounting; 3 LGUs (25%) use the modified accrual basis; and, 1 (9%) use the full accrual basis. Table 1 below
shows each of the 12 LGUs basis of accounting:

Table 1 – Basis of accounting and audited financial statements

Whilst we cannot speculate whether or not this distribution of the basis for accounting accurately reflects the
situation for entire population of West Bank LGUs, it does provide a clear indication that the basis of
accounting and reporting is not standard across LGUs. This implies that the accounting treatment of similar
business transactions will be handled differently by the LGUs which will ultimately impact on the nature and
content of the financial reports produced by LGUs. Finally, this state of affairs will make it quite difficult for
the LGUs financial reporting information to be consolidated by the MoLG.
Accounting System
The sample municipalities use different accounting systems to record their financial transactions, with two
(Turmosaya and Yatta) not using any accounting system (they use a basic manual based approach). Also, the
municipalities are using different information systems to manage their operations and there is minimal
integration between these information systems. Our Component One Report discusses, in detail, the
information systems used by the municipalities. However, one important matter to note is that the chart of
accounts for the municipalities accounting systems is not usually aligned with the budget classifications,
which caused the municipalities difficulties for matching the actual expenditure and revenues with the budget.

4.7     Asset Management
Accounting for and Management of Assets
Municipal assets are property owned, controlled or used by the municipality. These assets can be managed
directly or indirectly for the benefit of the citizens in the pursuit of local service delivery goals. Municipal asset
management is the process of inventory, valuation, use, disposal, strategic portfolio reviews, reporting and
auditing of municipal assets.

MDLF has issued a specific manual of policies and procedures to account for and manage fixed assets. This
manual describes, but is not limited to, the categories and types of assets, accounting for fixed assets,
valuation, safeguarding of assets, additions and disposal procedures, and the tagging system.

For the 12 sample municipalities, the latest updated records of fixed assets (in terms of valuation and count)
is a fixed assets register that was prepared by a consultant for over than four years ago, under a consultancy
contract with MDLF. This register was prepared using an MS excel sheet that has formulas to calculate
depreciation of assets based on percentages recommended by the consultant. The municipalities are only
updating the register by recording new items purchased, and then the MS excel sheet processes the calculation
of the depreciation at year-end.

All fixed assets registers do not have coding/tagging for the assets. In addition, all, except for Hebron and
Ramallah, have not done a fixed assets count since the consultant completed his assignment.

Ramallah, Hebron, and Nablus Municipalities have a department in charge of the assets register and
management of the municipalities’ assets. At all other municipalities, this responsibility is given to the finance
department.

Except for Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities, the municipalities confirmed that there is limited
compliance with the requirements of the above-mentioned manual, and no adequate procedures are being
applied to ensure proper use, valuation, disposal, reporting and auditing of assets.

The accounting for assets depends on the basis of accounting used. For accrual and modified accrual basis of
accounting, fixed assets are capitalised and depreciated by applying percentages recommended by the
consultant. For those using the cash basis of accounting, fixed assets are expensed upon purchase.

As for infrastructure assets, these are accounted for depending on the basis of accounting (similar to the
treatment of assets described in the previous paragraph). Projects in progress are recorded on the
municipalities’ assets as work in progress (for those following the accrual and modified accrual basis)
depending on the percentage of completion. For those municipalities following the cash basis, they do not
record such assets on their records of course, however, some municipalities includes such assets on an assets
register.

Level of Computerization
Ramallah and Hebron Municipalities have information systems where they record their fixed assets and
inventory. These systems have full records of assets held with details on their value, status, location, etc. Data
from these systems is integrated with the FMIS. All other municipalities are using an MS excel sheet for their
assets registry, and these records are not connected/integrated with the FMIS. These excel sheets are
vulnerable to change and editing with no controls to detect or prevent risks of misuse or loss of assets.

4.8 Human Resources and Payroll
Human Resources Policies and Procedures
For human resources (HR), the municipalities follow the regulations stipulated by the PA relevant laws and
guidance issued by MoLG. Primarily, the Council of Ministers Decision no. (1) of 2009 (“the Decision”)
regulates the recruitment, contracting, evaluation, and allocation of staff costs. It also provides a salary scale
for LGUs staff with a detailed breakdown based on category and grade. In addition, the Manual details the
procedures that should be followed by LGUs when preparing the payroll.

In accordance with the Decision, the employees of the LGUs are classified under 6 categories, which are: high,
first, second, third, fourth, and fifth. Article 3 of the Decision provided a broad explanation of the types of
duties of each category and indicated the grades that can be used to allocate employees on that category.
According to municipalities’ staff, the scale does not provide a clear and comprehensive distribution of the
positions/grades of staff categorised under those 6 categories and requires judgement of municipality
management while assigning staff on the salary scale.

LGUs’ employees contracts are classified under two types:
    Permanent contract type: This type is use for employees that are hired permanently under a specific
       category and grade;
    Contract-based (temporary) type: This type is used for employees contracted on a temporary basis,
       and is usually used for project based or short-term employment. The Decision included two types of
       contracts that can be signed with temporary staff; however, it did not provide clear distinction or basis
       that the LGUs should follow to select the applicable type of contract.

In accordance with the Decision, the municipality should submit a list of employees ( ‫ )جدول تشكيالت الوظائف‬to
MoLG to review and approve during the annual budget approval process. Any permanent employees should
be included in the list and be approved by the MoLG. For temporary employees, only the approval of the
Mayor is required.

Moreover, the employees’ contracts do not have job descriptions, as confirmed by the 12 municipalities’ staff.
The municipalities’ staff also confirmed that they do not have a code of conduct.

Competitive Hiring Practices
As discussed earlier, for permanent employees, the hiring process starts with the approval of the new position
by MoLG as part of the approval of the annual budget and the list of employees (that include budgets for new
employees to be hired). Once the position is approved and the municipality determines the timing for
recruitment, an advertisement is made in the newspaper for applicants to apply for the position. Upon receipt
of the resumes, a committee is formed consisting of the Mayor (or authorized designee), a council’s member,
the municipality manager (where applicable), an HR officer, and the head of the department where the
vacancy exists.

Based on the job requirements determined by the HR department, a short list of applicants is invited for
interviews with the committee. Written exams may be conducted depending on the nature of the position.
Based on the interviews, resumes, and exams, where applicable, the committee ranks the applicants, and
selects the top ranked applicant for the position.

Based on the committee evaluation and recommendation, the Mayor and the council review and approve the
recruitment decision. Once approved, the HR department prepares the contract, and determines the salary
based on the approved salary scale. Once the contract is signed, the HR department opens a file for the
employee and archives a copy of the contract and related employee’s documents. The HR enters the new
employee information into an HR system that contains the data related to the employees, and this is used for
calculation of salaries. Normally, the employee is given a 3-month probation period, at the end of which, the
employee's position is either confirmed and becomes permanent, or the decision is made to terminate the
contract.




PwC                                                                                                 Page 25
Time Recording
Municipalities’ employees are required to use daily attendance records where they sign in/out. With the
exception of two municipalities (Aqaba and Turmousya who use manual attendance sheets), all municipalities
use automated systems for the employees to electronically sign their attendance using fingerprint recognition.

At the end of each day, the HR officer updates the employees’ files for vacation and other leave to update their
respective balances. At the end of each month, a report from the attendance system is generated which
includes a summary of attendance information for each employee. This report is sent to the head of each
department for review and signature. This report is then sent to payroll officer in order to make the payroll
calculation.

The municipalities require the employees who request leave during the working hours to sign a specific leave
form that should be approved by the direct supervisor. This form should be submitted at the front desk at the
municipality upon leave, after signing out of the attendance system. Some municipalities confirmed that this
form is not always requested from staff and employees need only to sign out at leave time.

Payroll
The HR department is responsible for preparing the payroll for all employees. At the end of each month, the
HR system calculates the leaves taken during the month along with any overtime and deductions (or due
balances thereof) for all employees. Then, the HR officer generates a standard payroll report from the HR
system that shows the employees’ gross salaries, allowances, deductions, and the system-calculated net
salaries. The officer then reviews the report and sign as prepared.

If the municipality does not have an HR system, such as in the case of Turmosaya Municipality, the payroll
calculation process is done manually using excel sheets.

The payroll sheet, along with the relevant supporting documents, is then reviewed and signed by the finance
manager, and where applicable, the internal auditor, and is then reviewed and approved by the Mayor. The
payroll sheet is then sent to the treasurer in order to prepare the bank transfer letter and send for signature
by the authorized signatories.

In municipalities, such as Nablus, Yatta, Jenin and Aqaba, the finance department would be responsible for
preparing the payroll. In such a case, the finance manager/officer obtains the data related to employees’
deductions, overtime, and other relevant data from the HR department, either manually or electronically, to
update the HR system and generate the payroll sheet. Once the payroll sheet is generated and prepared by the
finance manager/officer, the same process of review and approval by the Mayor is followed.

The recording of the salaries costs depends on the basis of accounting used. If the municipality uses the accrual
or modified accrual basis of accounting, the payroll transaction is recorded as follows:

      -   At time the payroll sheet is approved by the relevant personnel, the payroll accountant first records
          an accounting entry to record the salary expenses against each employee account as payable. Once
          paid, another accounting entry is made to settle the amount payable against cash.

For municipalities that use the cash basis, they also record the same two accounting entries stated above but
these are done simultaneously, at the date of payment.

Annual Evaluation and Training
On an annual basis, and based on a written notice from the council, the HR department starts the staff
evaluation process. The HR department distributes the evaluation form used by the municipality to each
supervisor in order to undertake the evaluation of his/her department staff. The supervisors prepare the
individual evaluation forms and sends these for the review by the heads of departments. The head of
departments reviews the evaluations forms and discuss them with the Mayor (or their designate). Once
reviewed by the Mayor, the supervisor discusses the evaluation with the employee. Afterwards, the evaluation
forms will be sent to the council for final endorsement and acceptance (usually no changes would be made on
the form unless specifically approved by the Mayor). Upon this acceptance, a copy of the evaluation form is
sent to the employee.

PwC                                                                                                Page 26
The evaluation form allocates an evaluation rating to each employee. This depends on the scoring allocated
by the evaluator as recorded on the evaluation. The evaluation rankings are: excellent, very good, good,
acceptable (normal), weak. The salary raise is usually constant at 1.25% for each category regardless of the
ranking, unless the evaluation form specifically excluded this based on employee performance.

Hebron, Bethlehem, and Ramallah are doing regular (annual) performance reviews, however the other
municipalities are not following the process regularly.

No municipalities have training plans for employees. This is despite the fact that all municipalities allocate a
budget for training. We found that municipalities rarely use this training budget. The main training that
employees would receive is training funded by donors. This training is usually based on the donor’s project
needs, and is not necessarily based on the municipalities’ staff needs.

Level of Computerization
Except for Turmosaya Municipality, the municipalities have separate HR systems that have the employment
information of staff, along with relevant HR information (such as leaves balances, evaluations, promotions,
etc.) In addition, the municipalities use automated systems for the employees to electronically sign their
attendance using fingerprint recognition (except for Aqaba and Turmosaya Municipalities).

All municipalities that have the HR system prepare and calculate the payroll using that system and generate
the payroll sheet to be reviewed by the relevant supervisors. The payroll report generated from the HR system
shows the employees’ gross salaries, allowances, deductions, and the system -calculated net salaries.

4.9 Legislative Scrutiny and audit
Legislative Scrutiny
As discussed earlier, the Law mandates the MoLG to oversee the work of the municipalities and village
councils in the West Bank and Gaza. The Law also requires that the LGUs’ financial and administrative
operations and documents to be subject to MoLG oversight and audit by any representatives on behalf of the
MoLG.

The LGUs should submit their annual budgets to MoLG for approval. Additionally, the LGUs should submit
quarterly financial reports to MoLG showing a comparison between budget and actual revenues and
expenditures. LGUs must also provide MoLG with annual financial statements. As reported earlier not all 12
municipalities have, as yet, approved 2015 budgets.

MoLG has a manual for monitoring the work of the LGUs that the MoLG uses to do reviews and field visits on
the LGUs. The MoLG has a department that does these reviews (the General Directorate for Control and
Oversight.) The scope of these reviews includes three aspects: financial, operational and compliance with
applicable laws and regulations. The MoLG does two types of reviews; periodic and non-periodic. The MoLG’s
policy is to visit each LGU twice; at mid-year and at end of the year. The non-periodic reviews are done if a
complaint is made against an LGU. In this instance, a committee from MoLG would be convened to investigate
the complaint and decide if an audit of the complaint is warranted. When the review is finished, the MoLG
sends the report to the appropriate LGU.

To our understanding from the 12 municipalities, not all municipalities are being audited by MoLG and some
of them are unaware of the MoLG audit policies and procedures.

As LGUs are public organizations, they are subject to audit by the State Audit & Administrative Control Bureau
(SAACB) which is the supreme audit institution in Palestine.

The SAACB has a specific department for the audit of LGUs. The SAACB issues reports on all audits done and
these are summarised in the quarterly and annual SAACB reports. Such reports would reveal instances of
financial, internal control, administrative, and non-compliance, as well as any possible fraud instances (which
should be then reported separately to the Palestinian Anti-Corruption Committee.) SAACB submits its reports
to the municipality and provides a copy to MoLG. In general, municipalities’ staff indicated that there is
limited follow-up by the municipalities’ management on the implementation of the recommendations
reported by SAACB.

Audit (External and Internal)
As discussed earlier in our report, municipalities appoint an external auditor to do the statutory audits of the
annual financial statements in accordance with International Standards on Auditing. For our sample of 12
municipalities, 10 have recent audited financial statements and audit reports issued by an independent
external auditor. Jenin Municipality does not have audited financial statements for the last three years, and
Turmosaya Municipality does not have any audited financial statements.
Ramallah, Hebron, Nablus, and Jenin have established an internal audit department as an integral part of
their organization structure. These internal audit department’s main responsibility are to do and compliance
audits on the procedures being applied by the municipality. The internal audit team prepares an annual
internal audit plan at the beginning of the year. The team does the audits according to the plan, and issues
reports indicating any weaknesses noted and recommendations. These reports are provided to the
municipality management and process owners to discuss the weaknesses and recommendations identified.
Similar to SAACB reports, there are no efficient follow-up to monitor the implementation, by management,
of the recommendations from internal audit.
At Bethlehem, Birzeit, Yatta, Alkhader and Jericho Municipalities, the internal audit function has, typically,
one employee. The work of this employee is not based on an audit plan, but focuses on reviewing financial
transactions and related documents. One of his main duties is to review and approve the payment vouchers
and supporting documents before payment. Internal auditors should not be involved in management

PwC                                                                                               Page 28
activities as that would impair the auditor’s independence, and therefore in these cases, the employee is
operating as a financial controller and not an internal auditor. Aqaba, Turmosaya and Bido municipalities do
not have an IA function.

The municipality council is in charge the internal audit function, thus the internal audit team recruitment is
handled by the council, and the reports prepared by the internal auditor is sent to the council directly.




PwC                                                                                             Page 29
4.10 Donor’s Practices

There are two types of donor support that can be given to central and local governments: budget support and
development funding. None of the 12 municipalities receive budget support. The municipalities’ budgets do
not include any estimate for donor funding.

For development project funding: over the past few years, no municipalities signed direct funding agreements
with donors. Instead the donors channel their funding either through the government or by direct
implementation with the contractors. Such projects are not accounted for in the municipality records.

Donors can and do provide various types of in-kind or capital improvement funding, either directly to the
municipalities (such as equipment, furniture, software etc.), or to facilities that the municipalities are in
charge of. With this kind of assistance, the municipalities do not receive any cash funding, and thus recording
of the in-kind donation in their records will depend on the basis of accounting used.

Despite the fact that municipalities are not parties to donor agreements, they usually have an oversight role
on the implementation of projects. Donors coordinate with the PA government, and depending on the nature
of the project and whether it is within the municipality’s jurisdiction, the relevant ministry coordinates with
the MoLG, who requests the municipality to cooperate with the donor and supervise the implementation of
the project to ensure that it conforms to the plans agreed with the MoLG. The municipality role in these
projects is based on MoLG instructions and requirements.

The municipalities’ staff confirmed that in previous years when the donor used to sign a funding agreement
with the municipality to implement a specific project, the municipality first checks whether that project was
budgeted for in the approved annual budget. If the annual budget does not have a budget for the project, the
municipality would request a budget amendment from MoLG to incorporate the new project. Then the
municipality opens a new cost centre for the project on the accounting system, and if requested by the donor,
opens a separate bank account. The Manual includes policies and procedures for the recording and accounting
for funded projects.

4.11 Public Access to Key Fiscal Information
The transparency of the PFM system was assessed by checking whether the LGUs provide timely public access
to the following financial documentation:

    1.   Annual budget: For the 12 sample municipalities, with the exceptions of Bethlehem, Yatta, Jericho,
         and Alkhader, none of the others make the budget publicly available. Municipalities reported that
         there is no policy from MoLG or other parties requiring municipalities to make their annual budgets
         available to the public.
    2. In-year budget execution reports: These are interim reports that should be made available to the
       public within an acceptable time of their completion of the report. None of the 12 municipalities make
       these reports available to the public,
    3. Year-end financial statements or external audit reports: None of the municipalities makes the year-
       end financial statements available to the public on timely and regular basis, except for Ramallah and
       Nablus municipalities that published their audited financial statements via their websites. However,
       other municipalities (Hebron, Yatta, Bethlehem and Alkhader) did not publish the recent (couple of
       years) financial statements. None of the other 6-municipalities have ever made their financial
       statements or external audit reports available to the public.
    4. Contract awards: None of the municipalities publishes any information on the award of contracts.
       The municipalities’ staff indicated that they have no guidance or instructions what information to
       provide in this regard.

The municipalities have no standard policies or procedures to require them to publish and report to the public
any of the above information. Article (32) of the Law only requires municipalities to provide annual financial
statements to the MoLG within two months after year-end. We could not find any legal or other requirement
on municipalities to publish financial statements and auditors’ reports. Where municipalities do make limited
disclosure to the public, mainly via the municipality website, this is purely at the discretion of the municipality
management.
