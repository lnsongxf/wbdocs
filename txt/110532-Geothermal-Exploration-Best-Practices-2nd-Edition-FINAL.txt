   AND STRUCTURE
   OF THE GUIDE
                                                                                           13




1.1. Geothermal Exploration Best Practices
Exploration best practices for any natural resource commodity should aim to reduce the
resource risk prior to commitment of any signiﬁcant capital investment. While presenting
the framework, information, and guidelines for best practices for geothermal exploration,
this Guide will assist geothermal developers, contractors, and investors to address early-
stage risks in a cost-sensitive manner and to raise project quality.

Though signiﬁcant growth in electricity generation from geothermal energy has occurred
worldwide in recent years (Bertani, 2010), the high-risk cost of drilling to conﬁrm the
existence of a viable geothermal resource remains one of the key challenges facing
the industry. However, following best practices in the exploration stage will reduce the
uncertainty of the resource’s location, size, and productivity characteristics, which in turn
will lower the risk during the drilling phase.

This Guide can be used by developers and contractors to identify the most appropriate
tools and techniques to deﬁne the resource, and by investors to ensure that projects have
made all reasonable effort to reduce risks.

A test of best practices for geothermal exploration is the degree to which each principal
resource risk element is addressed. Principal resource risks for geothermal energy are
temperature (or enthalpy) and transmissivity (or permeability-thickness), which together
determine the rate and sustainability of thermal power output from producing wells.
Reservoir volume, chemistry, and depth are also important criteria. Each component of
a geothermal exploration program should be clearly designed to address one or more of
these risk elements, and each risk element should also be addressed in some manner.
Through exploration, a developer should aim to provide potential ﬁnanciers with at least
a qualiﬁed (and ideally quantiﬁed) estimate of the uncertainty associated with forecasting
thermal energy production and a sensitivity analysis on potential levels of net power
production.


1.2. Standard Protocols for Estimating and
Reporting Geothermal Potential
At present, there is no internationally accepted standard protocol to estimate and report
the potential of geothermal energy. The major countries harnessing geothermal energy
for electric power generation each have their own methodologies and classiﬁcation
schemes to estimate and report potential. Only two countries (Australia and Canada) at
this time have adopted formal geothermal reporting codes (see Section 1.6). These codes
expound the principles of transparency, materiality, and accountability for presenting
geothermal exploration results and estimates of future geothermal power generation. The
current standard practice on developed geothermal ﬁelds is to calculate ﬁeld capacities
based on numerical simulation, once sufﬁcient data are available. At the time of print, the
global geothermal community, through the IGA, is working towards developing standard
international protocols for adoption in other parts of the world.

     1.3. Outline of the Guide
     This Guide provides developers with an outline of various methodologies and strategies
     employed in the exploration for geothermal resources for power generation. This is
     done within the context of the typical geothermal development process, recognizing that
     the most appropriate exploration tools strongly depend on the geological setting of the
     project.

     This ﬁrst chapter was prepared by Colin Harvey and Graeme Beardsmore. The chapter
     provides an introduction to the topic and the scope of the Guide.

     Chapter 2 was prepared by Inga Moeck. The chapter introduces the concept of
     geothermal play types and describes the range of geological settings in which potentially
     exploitable geothermal systems may be present. The geothermal play type is a corollary
     to play types used in the oil and gas sector and classiﬁes the geological setting of a
     geothermal resource, which impacts the most suitable approach to exploration.

     Chapter 3 was prepared by Colin Harvey. The chapter gives an overview of the
     typical sequence of phases in any geothermal exploration and development program
     with reference to various geothermal play types. The Guide divides the geothermal
     development process into eight phases, in line with ESMAP’s Geothermal Handbook
     (Gehringer and Loksha, 2012). International developers or their consultants may divide
     the process into a different number of phases, but the core elements of the process are
     essentially the same in all cases. These are the eight phases:

     Phase 1: Preliminary Survey
     Phase 2: Exploration (includes temperature gradient drilling)
     Phase 3: Test Drilling (deep drilling)
     Phase 4: Project Review and Planning
     Phase 5: Field Development
     Phase 6: Power Plant Construction
     Phase 7: Commissioning
     Phase 8: Operation

     Chapter 4 was prepared by Horst Rüter, Colin Harvey, Graeme Beardsmore, Inga Moeck,
     and Stefan Bauer. The chapter includes a “tool box” for geothermal exploration and
     gives a detailed breakdown of the range of methodologies currently used and perhaps
     appropriate to reduce geothermal resource risk prior to raising funds for the Test Drilling
     Phase (Phase 3). The list of techniques is extensive, and new methodologies and
     techniques are continuing to be developed and applied. The developer or the exploration
     manager should select the most appropriate and cost effective set of methodologies to
     reduce overall risk.

     Only a subset of the tools presented in Chapter 4 would be appropriate for any
     given project. Understanding which tools are the most appropriate and under which
     circumstances is the key to carrying out an efﬁcient and effective exploration program.
     The exact choice is unique to each project, but certain sets of tools are commonly
     associated with speciﬁc play types.

The subsequent chapters present high-level discussions about the most appropriate and
commonly used tools for convection-dominated magmatic plays (Chapter 5, prepared by
Colin Harvey); convection-dominated extensional domain plays (Chapter 6, prepared by
Inga Moeck); and conduction-dominated plays (Chapter 7, prepared by Horst Rüter and
Graeme Beardsmore). The discussions focus on geoscientiﬁc tools. Non-technical and
environmental requirements common to all play types addressed in Chapters 3 and 4 are
not considered any further in subsequent chapters.

Chapter 8, prepared by Colin Harvey, lists the data sets that should be assembled
by a developer and how they should be combined, both to ensure a comprehensive
exploration study and to aid with presenting this to investors.

Appendix A1 provides a table of contents for a typical pre-feasibility report.


1.4. Exclusions
This Guide speciﬁcally addresses the ﬁrst two phases of the typical development pathway
to geothermal resources for power generation up to the conclusion of the Exploration
Phase. The Guide is intended to present a developer with an appropriate set of
exploration tools in order to minimize ﬁnancial risk in different geological settings prior to
raising funds for the Test Drilling Phase. However, the Guide does not discuss geothermal
drilling, except in the context of shallow wells for temperature gradient or heat ﬂow
measurements. Drilling to reservoir depth is assumed to be part of the Test Drilling Phase
and is beyond the scope of this Guide. Moreover, the Guide does not address the range
of power generation technologies which may be used.

The advice in this Guide may not be entirely appropriate for the exploration for low-
temperature geothermal resources for direct use, ultra-high temperature developments,
or other less conventional or unconventional geothermal developments.

The Guide does not address policy, regulatory and planning frameworks, or project
economics. As such, the Guide is of limited use to governments, development banks or
other international funding agencies for designing programs to promote investments in
geothermal energy. The recently released ESMAP Geothermal Handbook (Gehringer and
Loksha, 2012), considered a companion document to this Guide, addresses these topics.

                        1.5. Risk
                        1.5.1. Introduction
                        In ﬁnancial term risk can be deﬁned as “the potential for ﬁnancial loss.” Financial risk
                        increases proportional to the size of an investment and the uncertainty of making a return
                        on that investment. Geothermal projects are high-risk investments during the early stages
                        of exploration and development (Phillips et al., 2013) because they require signiﬁcant
                        ﬁnancial commitments at a stage when uncertainty about the viability of the resource
                        remains high.

                        At the early stages, the principal component of risk of a geothermal project is the
                        uncertainty associated with a natural resource that cannot be readily observed or
                        characterized without relatively large expenditures for drilling. The long lead times
                        required to develop geothermal projects exacerbate this risk by prolonging the period until
                        ﬁnancial returns are realized. This high-risk proﬁle makes it difﬁcult to attract ﬁnancing for
                        early-stage project development.

                        Figure 1.1 illustrates typical uncertainty and expenditure proﬁles associated with a
                        geothermal project. The highest ﬁnancial risk of a geothermal project occurs in the lead-
                        up to the Test Drilling Phase when uncertainty is still high. Although test drilling provides
                        information substantially reducing the uncertainty of the viability of geothermal resource,
                        it does so at signiﬁcant up-front cost and risk. This high-risk barrier is frequently the
                        stumbling block or hurdle to a project’s further progress (Gehringer and Loksha, 2012).

The return on investment (ROI) for a project is linked to many factors including the
project’s capital cost, timeline for development, and price of generated power. At the early
stages, however, the potential ROI has to be weighted by the probability that no viable
geothermal resource will be discovered. The purpose of exploration is to efﬁciently and
effectively minimize resource uncertainty as much as possible, thereby reducing the cost
of capital. The Guide recommends appropriate tools to minimize resource uncertainty
prior to test drilling.

Every major grid-connected power project faces signiﬁcant risks, for example, those
related to power price, demand, subsidies, government policy, and environmental and
social issues. The exploration and drilling risks of geothermal projects come on top of
these other risks and impact the availability of project funding at the early stages.

Numerous aid agencies and governments throughout the world have recognized the risk
proﬁle of the Test Drilling Phase as a barrier to geothermal development. Risk mitigation
funds have been established in some jurisdictions to assist projects through this phase
(Sanyal & Koenig, 1995; Sanyal and Morrow, 2012; Sanyal et al., 2011). Risk mitigation
funds decrease ﬁnancial risk by either reducing the amount of capital invested by the
ﬁnancier (i.e., a grant scheme) or by increasing the ROI to investors over the project’s
life (e.g., through feed-in tariffs) or by decreasing the uncertainty that the capital will be
recovered (i.e., an insurance scheme; Kreuter and Schrage, 2010).

However a project is ﬁnanced, maximum ROI is only achieved if wells produce at or
above their predicted outputs. Maximizing the probability of achieving adequate well
productivity relies on high quality exploration methods and interpretation, as outlined in
this Guide.


1.5.2. Risk Reduction through Exploration
The quality of exploration work prior to Test Drilling Phase (Phase 3) is a critical factor for
reducing well productivity risk. Geothermal exploration essentially involves the application
of a number of geological, geochemical, and geophysical techniques. The aim is to apply
the most appropriate techniques to minimize uncertainties associated with estimates
of temperature, depth, productivity, and sustainability of the geothermal resource in the
speciﬁc circumstances of each project.

Selecting appropriate techniques at the correct phases of an exploration program is
important for optimal efﬁciency and maximum risk reduction prior to the Test Drilling
Phase (for examples,see Antics & Ungemach, 1995). Experienced interpretation of data
collected with these geoscientiﬁc techniques enables a geothermal geoscience team to
develop a “conceptual model” of the heat source and ﬂuid ﬂow in a geothermal system
(Cumming, 2009). No single exploration technique provides the key to a successful
conceptual model, and ultimately no conceptual model can be conﬁrmed except through
test drilling.

This Guide provides advice on which exploration techniques are most appropriate at
different stages and in different geological settings. The most effective risk reduction
is achieved by sequentially applying the exploration techniques appropriate for the
geological setting, followed by experienced interpretation.
18   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     1.5.3. Risk Reduction through Test Drilling
     The successful completion of the Test Drilling Phase dramatically reduces the overall
     uncertainty for the project (Figure 1.1), and investment capital is typically easier to secure
     at that time. Test drilling conﬁrms (or refutes) the existence of a geothermal reservoir
     that warrants continued appraisal, thus validating (or refuting) the conceptual model
     developed during the preceding project phases. Key parameters that test drilling aims to
     conﬁrm include temperature, transmissivity, ﬂow potential, and ﬂuid chemistry, as well as
     the location and areal extent and depth of the reservoir (for an example, see Sperber et
     al., 2010).

     The locations for the test wells are determined based on the data gathered during the
     Exploration Phase (Phase 2). Therefore, carrying out the exploration in line with best
     practices reduces the risks during the Test Drilling Phase.

     Test drilling aims to substantially reduce uncertainties associated with reservoir
     characteristics, but there are signiﬁcant risks and costs associated with drilling activities
     themselves. The risks are a function of the drilling conditions, ranging from logistical
     considerations such as drill pad location and timely availability of equipment and services,
     to technical considerations such as the stability of the rock that must be drilled through
     to reach the reservoir, borehole competency and pressure conditions during drilling, and
     the experience and expertise of both the developer and the drilling contractor. Costs are
     a function of the drilling location, mobilization costs, the intended drilling depth, well bore
     diameter, casing depth requirements, and the length of inclined or deviated wells.

     If target depths are shallow, then it may be possible to obtain sufﬁcient information to
     prove the existence of a viable resource, using a relatively small and inexpensive truck-
     mounted drill rig. If the target is deep, then a larger drilling rig will be needed, as will
     better roads and support services; therefore, the levels of expenditure will be higher.

     The test drilling program should be designed with an aim to reduce uncertainties,
     associated with the extent, characteristics, and sustainability of the geothermal resource,
     to a level where signiﬁcant expenditure can be justiﬁed for the Project Review Phase
     (Phase 4) and subsequent development. To achieve this goal, the optimal number of
     test wells will vary from project to project. A minimum of two or three wells is a typical
     compromise between resource appraisal and cost for convection-dominated geothermal
     plays. However, prudent planning is recommended for additional wells due to the
     possibility of engineering or logistical failures. A single test well might be optimal for
     conduction-dominated geothermal plays where drilling costs are greater but reservoir
     parameters are laterally less variable.

     Interesting to note is that a recent review of drilling data for over 2,600 geothermal wells
     around the world (IFC, 2013) found that the “success” rate for the ﬁrst well drilled to test
     a new reservoir was about 50 percent. The average success rate rose to 59 percent over
     the ﬁrst ﬁve wells, to 74 percent during ﬁeld development, and averaged 83 percent for
     wells drilled in operating ﬁelds.

     Sanyal and Morrow (2012) previously carried out a survey on the majority of the more
     than 4,000 geothermal wells that had been drilled worldwide. While widely different
     success rates were encountered during the Exploration Phase, they concluded that
     improved success rates and faster drilling were almost always achieved in geothermal
     ﬁelds where local knowledge was obtained through experience. All these numbers
     depend on how the word success is deﬁned with respect to an economic well production
     rate.
                                                                                         19




1.5.4. Resource Sustainability Risk
Geothermal power plants are built as long-term infrastructure, typically with a 30-year or
more design life. The size of a plant is limited to what can be sustainably developed from
the resource. The geothermal resource must consistently and reliably provide geothermal
ﬂuid to the plant during its full design lifetime. During this period, resource degradation
risks include these factors:

 • Faster-than-anticipated decline in pressure or production rate
 • Premature cooling (either from injection water breakthrough or from incursion of cool
   groundwater)
 • Adverse chemical effects such as increases in non-condensable gas levels or
   changes in reservoir conditions leading to scaling (for an example, see Lichti et
   al.,2005; and Salonga and Lichti, 2005)

The resource can degrade at various times during the exploitation history, but early
indications can often be detected from Test Drilling Phase through the ﬁrst few years of
production. Implementation of a robust reservoir-monitoring program, combined with a
reliably calibrated reservoir model, is essential for detecting and remedying resource
degradation at an early stage (Clearwater et al., 2011). The Exploration Phase is critical
in preparing the groundwork for this reservoir model. Baseline data, against which
production data can be compared, should be collected during the exploration and test
drilling.


1.6. Relevant Literature
A very large body of literature now exists relating to geothermal development. A
comprehensive database of papers presented at geothermal conferences can be
accessed through several websites, including those of the Geothermal Resources
Council, the IGA, and Stanford University. Here is a list of overview publications that may
provide useful background reading.

2.1. Introduction
The characteristics of natural geothermal reservoirs cover a wide spectrum in terms of
temperature, depth, geometry, geology, and ﬂuid chemistry. It is natural and useful to
try to divide this broad spectrum of reservoirs into groups with similar characteristics
and development strategies. Many such schemes have previously been published, with
groups deﬁned, mainly according to the temperature, thermodynamic properties, or
depth of the reservoir. Such schemes are useful to guide decisions on drilling, reservoir
engineering, and plant design based on previous experiences with similar reservoirs.
They do not, however, help with the design of exploration programs because the reservoir
characteristics cannot be known (by deﬁnition) until exploration is complete. Exploration
strategy is best guided by considering the geological setting of the geothermal system
under investigation. To that end, exploration advice in this Guide is based on a catalog of
geothermal play types.

The advice presented in this Guide is based on a catalog of geothermal play types
representing sets of geological circumstances that may host accumulations of potentially
recoverable heat (Moeck, 2014). The term geothermal play type is analogous to
the lowest level of the classiﬁcation scheme for petroleum systems deﬁned by the
Petroleum Resources Management System of the Society of Petroleum Engineers
(SPE-PRMS, 2007). Petroleum “play types” represent particular stratigraphic or structural
geological settings that include all the components necessary for a potentially economic
accumulation of petroleum: a source rock, reservoir rock and trap (Allen and Allen,
2005). Translated to geothermal systems, a geothermal play type might be deﬁned as a
geological setting that includes a heat source, heat migration pathway, heat/ﬂuid storage
capacity, and the potential for economic recovery of the heat.

Understanding and characterizing the geological controls on geothermal systems has
been the topic of many ongoing studies, which have focused on different scales, from
plate tectonics (e.g. Mufﬂer, 1976; Heiken, 1982), to local tectonics/structural geology
(Faulds et al., 2010), to well logs and cores (Leary et al., 2013). The characteristics of
individual geothermal systems are a function of site-speciﬁc variables such as the nature
and depth of the heat source; the dominant heat transfer mechanism; permeability and
porosity distribution; rock mechanical properties; ﬂuid/rock chemistry; and ﬂuid recharge
rates/sources. The catalog on which this Guide is based deﬁnes six broad geothermal
play types according to plate tectonic setting, the nature of the heat source (magmatic
or non-magmatic), and whether the dominant heat-transfer mechanism is convection
or conduction (Figure 2.1). The division of geothermal play types is independent of
the subsequent heat recovery strategy. The Guide applies to all geothermal systems,
including “engineered (or enhanced) geothermal systems” (EGS), thus recognizing that
ongoing technological development and economic subsidies are increasing the range of
potentially economic geothermal systems.

                        2.2. The Geothermal Play: Deﬁnition and
                        Concept
                        The term play type is commonly used during mineral and petroleum resource exploration
                        processes. A “geothermal play” may be thought of as a conceptual model in the mind of a
                        geologist of how a number of geological factors might generate a recoverable geothermal
                        resource at a speciﬁc structural position in a certain geologic setting. The identiﬁcation
                        of a play is the ﬁrst step in any project development. The aim of the geothermal play
                        concept is to group similar geological settings that might host exploitable geothermal
                        resources, and to develop site-speciﬁc exploration strategies that may lead to resource
                        discovery and estimates of reserves. A geothermal play is deﬁned only on the basis of
                        geological setting, and has no economic implication other than providing a basis for an
                        economic assessment.

                        The term geothermal play is used by the Australia Geothermal Reporting Code (2010) to
                        qualitatively describe heat accumulations in the earth’s crust and is clearly discriminated
                        from terms used to quantify energy potential. The play fairway concept for hydrothermal
                        systems has been deﬁned as a geographic area over which favorable combinations
                        of heat, permeability, and ﬂuid are thought to extend (Phillips et al., 2013). King and
                        Metcalfe (2013) applied the geothermal play concept in their description of rift zones,
                        deﬁning a play as “a repeating set of prospects with common characteristics”.

The general ingredients of a geothermal play are heat source and heat transport,
permeability structure (faults, stratigraphy) and the presence of ﬂuid volume and a
storage system (porosity, fracture network). The set of geothermal play types adopted
for this Guide (Moeck, 2014) synthesizes previous groupings of geothermal systems
identiﬁed by Rybach (1981) and Hochstein (1988) with play concepts used by the
petroleum industry and the above-mentioned recent deﬁnitions of geothermal plays.
The main division of geothermal play types follows that of Rybach (1981) based on the
dominant heat transfer mechanism, namely, convective- and conductive-dominated
geothermal plays. Convective geothermal plays can be either magmatic (“hydrothermal
systems,” ibid.) or fault controlled in extensional domains (“circulation systems,” ibid.).
Magmatic and extensional domain types are consistent with the opinion of Hochstein
(1988), who separated volcanic from non-volcanic systems. The age of a magmatic
system, volcanic ﬁeld, basin, or tectonic cycle is an important geological parameter in
deﬁning geothermal plays.


2.3. Geological Perspective on Geothermal
Play Types
The plate tectonic setting has a fundamental inﬂuence on the types of geothermal plays
that might exist in a region. The plate tectonic framework controls the thermal regime,
hydrogeological regime, ﬂuid dynamics, ﬂuid chemistry, faults and fractures, stress
regime, and lithological sequence (Rybach, 1981; Bogie et al., 2005). The thermal state
of the crust at active plate boundaries is typically far more dynamic than intraplate and
tectonically quiescent settings.

The broadest division of geothermal play types deﬁned in this Guide is determined by
the dominant mode with which heat is transferred from the heat source to the reservoir,
consistent with the previous division of Rybach (1981). Generally, naturally occurring
heat transfer within geothermal systems is dominated at the system scale by either
convection or conduction. In this Guide, we use the word convection to denote all modes
of shallow and deep natural groundwater ﬂow. These include thermally driven ﬂow and
hydraulic gradient driven ﬂow (“advection” or “heat sweep” as deﬁned by Hochstein et
al., 2013), as well as buoyancy driven ﬂow due to different concentrations of salinity.
Whether convection or conduction dominates with respect to heat transport depends
primarily on the characteristics of the heat source and the distribution of permeability
within the host rocks at the system scale (Bogie et al., 2005; Lawless et al., 1995).
Important to recognize is that in all instances, however, convection and conduction are
end-members of a heat transfer continuum. Conductive intervals always exist in localized
parts of a convective regime, while minor convective intervals can sometimes exist within
conductive systems, depending on the porosity and permeability structure of the site. For
example, gravity-driven convection might occur within a discrete permeable aquifer within
a conduction-dominated thermal regime in steep mountainous terrain where the recharge
zone is at a higher elevation than the discharge site.

In greenﬁeld exploration, whether heat transport is dominated by convection or
conduction might not be initially clear. To predict which mode is likely to dominate, it is
important to understand the geological controls on heat transport. For example, fractures
often control the transport of ﬂuids (and hence heat), so if the dominant heat transport
mode is poorly understood then it may be critical to investigate fracture networks and
their relationship to the present-day stress ﬁeld to determine their ability to channel
ﬂuids. This example illustrates the value of the exploration play concept: applying an
understanding of the geological controls on geothermal systems for exploration and
targeting.

                       Six geothermal play types are described in the following sections based on the primary
                       delineation of convection-dominated and conduction-dominated heat transport.
                       Convection-dominated plays are further divided into magmatic/plutonic types (i.e.,
                       igneous, thermally driven convection) and non-magmatic, fault- and fracture-controlled
                       extensional domain types, referring to the nature of the dominant heat source and
                       tectonic setting. Conduction-dominated plays are further divided according to their
                       dominant permeability control: lithofacies, fractures, or a combination of both.

                       While each play type lies within a geological continuum and speciﬁc geothermal systems
                       can possibly have geological characteristics of more than one play type, Table 2.1shows
                       that currently developed geothermal systems can largely be grouped into three main
                       play categories. It is obvious from these ﬁgures that most of the developed geothermal
                       systems in the world can be categorized as convection-dominated magmatic play types.
                       The development of conduction-dominated geothermal plays has predominantly been
                       restricted to Europe (speciﬁcally Germany), where the regulatory framework has nurtured
                       their development. Developed extensional domain plays are mainly located in the Basin-
                       and-Range Province in the United States and in Western Turkey.

2.4. Convection-Dominated Play Types
In convection-dominated geothermal plays, heat is transported efﬁciently from depth to
shallower reservoirs or the surface by the upward movement of ﬂuid along permeable
pathways. Laterally extensive, porous high-permeability formations act as the primary
reservoirs. Convection-dominated geothermal plays are grouped primarily according to
the nature of the heat source.

Convection-dominated geothermal play types (CV1-CV2 in Figure 2.1) include those
often referred to as viable or active geothermal systems (Gianelli and Grassi, 2001).
They include all known “high-temperature” (greater than 200°C) geothermal reservoirs
shallower than 3,000 meters. These invariably lie adjacent to plate tectonic margins or in
regions of high tectonic activity (Nukman and Moeck, 2013; Hickman et al., 2004), high
volcanic activity (Bogie et al., 2005), young plutonism (less than three million years old),
or regions with elevated heat ﬂow due to crustal thinning during the extension of the crust
(Faulds et al., 2009, 2010).

Favorable tectonic settings for convection-dominated geothermal play types include
magmatic arcs above subduction zones in convergent plate margins (e.g., Indonesian
Sunda Arc or Philippine-Japan Arc); divergent zones located within oceanic (e.g.,
Mid-Atlantic Ridge) or intracontinental settings (e.g., East African Rift or extensional
provinces); transform plate margins with strike-slip faults (e.g., San Andreas Fault in
California); and intraplate ocean islands formed by hot spot magmatism (e.g., Hawaii). It
is possible for different types of convection-dominated plays to lie geographically close to
each other where the structural setting varies over short distance scales.

The age of magmatism is an important indicator of the presence of a heat source and
heat accumulations. Active and recent magmatism often indicates an excellent underlying
heat source (McCoy-West et al., 2011), while inactive or extinct magmatism may be
associated with large-scale intrusions of igneous rock (plutons) at greater depth (>5 km
depth) with remnant heat and additional heating by radioactive decay in granitic rock. In
this, the deﬁnitions of McCoy-West et al. (2011) are drawn on the following:

 • Active magmatism: volcanism <500 years
 • Recent magmatism: volcanism 500-50,000 years
 • Inactive or extinct magmatism: volcanism >50,000 years

The composition of erupted volcanic material may be an indicator of the potential for
an underlying heat source. Many recently active basaltic volcanoes in the Paciﬁc and
elsewhere show no evidence of surface thermal features, indicating rapid cooling. It is
interesting to note that in basaltic settings where geothermal developments have been
successful, subsequent evidence has emerged of shallow magmatic bodies of felsic or
intermediate composition that have been created by differentiation, partial melting or
partial incorporation of crustal material (Harvey and Harvey, 2010).

                      2.4.1. CV1a: Magmatic Play Type, Active or Recent
                      Magmatic Intrusion
                      A relatively shallow magma chamber is the dominant feature in all magmatic geothermal
                      plays. The chamber’s parental melts, recharge of basalt, and crystallized melts control
                      ﬂuid chemistry, ﬂuid ﬂow, and the overall geothermal system. A magmatic geothermal
                      play with an active or recent magmatic intrusion (CV1a) is distinguished by a shallow,
                      intense heat source in the form of a young magma chamber (Figure 2.2). Such plays can
                      be identiﬁed in regions with active basaltic volcanism at divergent plate margins (e.g.,
                      Iceland), basaltic to andesitic volcanism along island arcs (e.g., Java, Indonesia), or
                      recent andesitic to dacitic volcanism (e.g., South American Andes or Japan).

                      Intrusions of recent (but not active) magmatic bodies underneath or in the vicinity of
                      volcanoes commonly represent prime heat sources for geothermal developments.
                      However, an active magma chamber does not always produce volcanism, especially if
                      magmatism is juvenile or if the magma is siliceous (thus highly viscous and unable to
                      reach the surface). Such magma chambers might also, however, represent heat sources
                      for geothermal developments (Figure 2.3).

Inﬂuenced by active faulting, deep rooted magmas can intrude beneath ﬂat terrain with
no volcanism. Basaltic intrusions are favorably associated with dilational step-over
regions of major transform faults or juvenile rifts as the Imperial Valley (Salton Sea
geothermal ﬁeld, California) along the San Andreas Fault, or its neighboring rift arm at
Cerro Prieto (Mexico). In some cases, such settings can lead to the upﬂow of liquid and
the formation of hot springs, fumaroles, boiling mud pools, and other geothermal surface
manifestations, as seen in the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand (Bogie et al., 2005).

Geothermal systems associated with the “CV1a” play type may include an upﬂow zone
and an outﬂow zone, provided the topography of the volcano supports this zonation
(Williams et al., 2011; Giggenbach, 1992; Hochstein, 1988). The outﬂow is generally
modiﬁed from the original ﬂuid, and has a lower temperature and higher pH than the
upﬂow due to lateral migration (with associated heat loss) and loss of gases (during
boiling) towards the ﬂank of the volcano (Hochstein, 1988). Vertically extensive, low-
permeability, clay-rich layers in steep terrain, such as andesitic stratovolcanoes, can cap
high temperature reservoirs.

A vapor-dominated zone may develop in regions of a high heat-generating, localized
magma body and moderate to high topographic relief. A single circulation system may
develop at depth, generating signiﬁcant liquid through ﬂow at shallower depth and a
vapor-dominated zone due to phase separation (Ingebritsen and Sorey, 1988). Steam
heated discharge at higher elevation and chloride spring discharge at lower elevation are
typical surface manifestations of these vapor-dominated plays. Examples of this play type
can be found at several systems in the Philippines including Tongonan (Ingebritsen and
Sorey, 1988 and references within).

Ultimately, the placement of the magma chamber relative to the surrounding terrain
controls the geometry of the geothermal systemand affects the hydraulic head of
steam and brine. Faults can act as seals or conduits, playing a role in forming reservoir
compartments or hydrothermal convection, while accommodation zones of faults can
sustain enhanced vertical permeability and channel hydrothermal plumes (Rowlands and
Sibson, 2004).


2.4.2. CV1b: Magmatic Play Type, Extinct Magmatic
Intrusion
A magmatic geothermal play with non-active or extinct magmatic intrusion (CV1b)
incorporates a heat source in the form of a pluton consisting of crystalline rock enriched
in heat generating elements (Figure 2.4) or a young, crystallized but still cooling, intrusive
igneous body (Figure 2.5). Such play types are located where surrounding mountain
ranges provide high recharge rates of circulating meteoric2 water, driving a hydrothermal
system with possible vapor partition above the hot rock. They are typically located along
continent-continent convergent or transform margins with recent magmatism, such as
the southern periphery of the European Alps (e.g., Italy). An example is the Larderello
(Italy) geothermal system, which is controlled by the interaction between igneous rocks
and faults. The system includes a vapor-dominated layer above a ﬂuid-dominated layer
(Bertani et al., 2006). The ﬂuid-dominated layer sits above a granite intrusion emplaced
during a Pliocene extensional event (1.3-3.8 million years ago). Melts emplaced during a
subsequent Pleistocene magmatic event (0.2-0.3 million years ago) provide the primary
heat source, while low-angle normal faults from the Pliocene event control the recharge of
meteoric water into the system.

                  A low permeability barrier may act as cap-rock preventing the escape of steam or hot
                  ﬂuids to the surface. The Geysers in California is an example, where a large felsite
                  pluton provides the heat source for a vapor-dominated ﬂuid in a porous metasedimentary
                  reservoir overlying the intrusion (Ingebritsen and Sorey, 1988). The reservoir rock is
                  covered by low permeability serpentinite, mélange and meta-greywacke. There is little
                  or no natural recharge into the reservoir, so treated sewage is injected as a means of
                  enhancing heat recovery (Majer and Peterson, 2007).

                  Larderello and The Geysers are thermally powered by large-scale plutons and support

                  GWe of installed capacity at The Geysers. Small scale installations at Fang (Thailand)
                  and Chena (Alaska, U.S.A.), however, are also examples of this play type.

                  This play type can coexist with active or recent magmatism (Figure 2.6)

                          2.4.3. CV2: Extensional Domain Play Type
                          In an extensional domain geothermal play (CV2), the mantle is elevated due to crustal
                          extension and thinning. The elevated mantle provides the principal source of heat for
                          geothermal systems associated with this play type. The resulting high thermal gradients
                          facilitate the heating of meteoric water circulating through deep faults or permeable
                          formations (Figure 2.6). Examples of regions hosting extensional domain geothermal
                          plays include the Great Basin (Western U.S.), Western Turkey, pull-apart basins along the
                          Sumatra Fault Zone, and the East African Rift. Even the Soultz-sous-Forêts engineered
                          geothermal system in France could be categorized as an extensional domain play type
                          because the distribution of heat in the system is controlled by the circulation of ﬂuids
                          along faults and tilted sedimentary beds on an active shoulder of the Upper Rhine Graben
                          (Genter et al., 2010; Kohl et al., 2000).

                          These non-magmatic play types are either “fault zone controlled” or “fault-leakage
                          controlled” at the system scale. Hydraulic heads and hydrological budgets control the
                          regional groundwater ﬂow systems. In purely fault-controlled play types, meteoric water
                          inﬁltrates down a shallow fault, circulates and heats through deep-seated faults, and rises
                          along other faults (Reed, 1983). In fault-leakage controlled play types, water circulates
                          through a combination of faults and permeable concealed formations, typically recharging
                          and discharging (if the systems reach the surface) along fault zones. By the judicious
                          interpretation of water chemistry in combination with isotopic analysis (particularly
                          oxygen-deuterium), it may be possible to develop mixing models and identify the end
                          member chemistries of the component ﬂuids (Flynn and Ghusn, 1983).

                          In general, segmented faults are more favorable for geothermal systems than large faults
                          with large offsets. The local stress regime and its orientation relative to fault geometry has
                          a controlling impact on permeability pathways, with faults oriented perpendicular to the
                          minimum compressive stress direction more likely to be permeable (Barton et al., 1997).
                          Belts of intermeshing, overlapping, or intersecting faults, such as step-over regions,
                          fault terminations and accommodation zones, often provide high permeability pathways
                          through closely spaced, breccia3-dominated fracture networks (Faulds et al., 2010). In the
                          Western United States, for example, most known geothermal ﬁelds are located at step-
                          over regions or relay ramps (Faulds et al., 2012), while geothermal systems are relatively
                          rare along displacement maxima or on the mid-segments of faults.

     2.5. Conduction-Dominated Play Types
     Conduction-dominated geothermal play types (CD1-CD3 in Figure 2.1) include all of what
     could be called passive geothermal systems due to an absence of fast convective ﬂow
     of ﬂuids or short-term variations in ﬂuid dynamics. These play types are dominant within
     passive tectonic plate settings where there has been no signiﬁcant recent tectonism or
     magmatism. In these settings, temperature increases steadily (although not necessarily
     linearly) with depth. Conductively heated geothermal reservoirs with temperatures that
     might be economically productive are located at greater depth than convectively heated
     geothermal reservoirs. Economic viability, therefore, is closely linked to the geothermal
     gradient. Gradients higher than the global average can be found in regions of high heat
     ﬂow (e.g., due to elevated concentrations of heat generating elements in the crust), or
     where overlying strata are thermally insulating (Beardsmore and Cull, 2001).

     Conduction-dominated geothermal play types can be subdivided according to the
     natural porosity–permeability ratio within the potential reservoir rock, and the absence or
     presence of producible natural reservoir ﬂuids. This Guide divides them into Intracratonic
     Basin Type, Orogenic Belt Type, and Basement Type. Favorable geological settings for
     conduction-dominated geothermal play types include extensional, divergent margins and
     grabens, or lithospheric subsidence basins such as the North German Basin (Germany)
     or the Otway Basin (Australia); foreland basins within orogenic belts, such as the
     Molasse Basin north of the Alps (Europe) or the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin
     east of the Rocky Mountains (Canada); and crystalline basement underlying thermally
     insulating sediments, such as the Big Lake Suite Granodiorite beneath the Cooper Basin
     (Australia).

     Faults do not naturally channel heat in conduction-dominated play types. However, faults
     can play an important role as a ﬂuid conduit or barrier during production from geothermal
     reservoirs associated with these play types, and may cause compartmentalization of the
     reservoir into separate fault blocks. Greatly inﬂuencing reservoir quality are (a) lithofacies,
     a rock unit formed in a certain depositional environment affecting grain size, pore
     geometry and mineralogy; (b) diagenesis, the physical and chemical changes occurring
     during the conversion of sediment to sedimentary rock; and (c) karstiﬁcation. Hence,
     evaluating fault and lithofacies characteristics should be primary goals of exploration of
     these play types.

     Conduction-dominated geothermal play types with naturally low permeability reservoirs
     such as tight sandstones, carbonates, or crystalline rock can only be developed using
     engineered geothermal systems (EGS) technology. Although EGS techniques might
     be applied to improve the productivity of any geothermal reservoir, the development of
     many conduction-dominated geothermal systems strongly depends on them. Through
     the application of EGS techniques, non-commercial reservoir conditions (e.g., rocks
     with naturally low permeability or porosity) might be improved, for example, in the
     Denver Basin (U.S.) in the future. The in situ stress ﬁeld is a critical parameter for EGS
     technology because the successful planning and management of large-scale injection
     and hydraulic stimulation requires knowledge of stress direction and magnitudes (e.g.,
     Moeck, 2012; Moeck and Backers, 2011).

                 2.5.1. CD1: Intracratonic Basin Type
                 An intracratonic basin geothermal play (CD1) incorporates a reservoir within a
                 sedimentary sequence laid down in an extensional graben or thermal sag basin (Figure
                 2.7). Intracratonic basins that originate from lithospheric thinning and subsidence are
                 commonly divided into several troughs or sub-basins (Salley, 2000). The long geological
                 history of intracratonic basins usually produces a sediment ﬁll several kilometers thick that
                 spans a wide range of depositional environments, which may include ﬂuvial siliciclastics,
                 marine carbonates, muds and evaporites (a natural salt or mineral deposit left after the
                 evaporation of a body of water). Lithology, faulting, and diagenesis control the pattern
                 of high and low porosity domains (Wolfgramm et al., 2009; Hartmann and Beaumont,
                 2000), and are themselves strongly inﬂuenced by basin evolution and subsidence rates.
                 Lithology, diagenesis, faults, and the stress ﬁeld control permeability and its anisotropy.

                 Potential geothermal reservoirs are located in different basin portions depending on the
                 internal present-day structure of the basin. Formations above salt diapirs might provide
                 suitable geothermal reservoirs for district heating because high thermal conductivity of
                 salt rock causes local positive thermal anomalies in the overburden (Norden and Förster,
                 2006). Formations in deeper parts of the basin might provide suitable reservoirs for power
                 and heat production, provided they can produce geothermal ﬂuids at a ﬂow rate of about
                 70 kg/s or more (Tester et al., 2007). In all potential sedimentary reservoirs, primary
                 porosity (affected by deposition through lithofacies or biofacies) and secondary porosity
                 (affected by diagenesis) have a major inﬂuence on the ﬂuid storage capacity. Potential
                 reservoir units are terrestrial sedimentary rocks, such as aeolian and ﬂuvial siliciclastic
                 sequences, and shallow to deep marine sediments from carbonate sequences to shale
                 and pelagic clays. Typical ﬂuids are high-chloride brines (referred to as basinal ﬂuids) or
                 hydrogen carbonate (HCO3) rich ﬂuids (referred to as inﬁltration water).

                 The geological environment of many sedimentary basins and graben systems is already
                 well known from hydrocarbon exploration. Substantial databases of reﬂection seismic
                 data and bore hole data such as corrected bottom hole temperature, drill-stem, and
                 petrophysical data, (Leary et al., 2013) can be re-evaluated for geothermal assessment
                 (e.g. Moeck et al., 2009; Anderson, 2013).

                          2.5.2. CD2: Orogenic Belt Type
                          An orogenic belt geothermal play (CD2) incorporates a sedimentary reservoir within a
                          foreland basin or orogenic mountain belt (Fig. 2.8). Sedimentary sequences in foreland
                          basins are inﬂuenced by signiﬁcant crustal subsidence (up to several kilometers) towards
                          the orogen due to the weight of the thickened crust of the orogenic belt and loading of
                          erosional products from the mountain belt on the non-thickened crust. The result of this
                          process is downward bending of the non-thickened lithosphere, forming areas of local
                          extension and normal faulting in an overall compressional plate tectonic setting (Moeck,
                          2014). The wedge shape of foreland basins results in a progressive deepening of
                          potential aquifer rocks towards the orogen, with an associated increase in temperature.
                          Faults and reef complexes provide prime reservoir targets in carbonate rocks of the
                          Bavarian Molasse Basin (Germany) (Lüschen et al., 2011), while highly permeable and
                          porous sandstone in the Alberta Basin (Canada) provides potential geothermal reservoir
                          targets (Majorowicz and Grasby, 2010).

                          Within the orogenic mountain belt itself, the conductive thermal regime can be locally
                          disturbed where groundwater inﬁltration cools the rock mass. Groundwater ﬂow and
                          thermal gradient are both strongly inﬂuenced by extreme relief and resulting hydraulic
                          head (Toth, 2009). The great depth and small width of mountain belt valleys result in
                          relatively shallow penetration of recharge water, discharging in valley ﬂoors or on shallow
                          valley slopes (Toth, 2009). Conductive thermal gradients can vary from about 15-20°C/km
                          beneath high mountains to about 30-50°C/km beneath deep valleys (Craw et al., 2005;
                          Grasby and Hutcheon, 2001). Figure 2.8illustrates a typical conduction-dominated, locally
                          convectively disturbed, thermal structure in an orogenic zone.

                 2.5.3. CD3: Basement Type
                 The key features of a basement geothermal play (CD3) are a faulted or fractured
                 crystalline (usually granitic) rock with very low natural porosity and permeability, but
                 storing vast amounts of thermal energy (Figure 2.9). These might also be referred to as
                 petro-thermal or hot dry rock systems. Such low porosity-low permeability rocks underlie
                 large areas of continents but require reservoir development by EGS techniques to
                 allow man-made induced circulation between injector and producer wells using the hot
                 rock mass as a heat exchanger (Cuenot et al., 2008). Fractured crystalline rocks attain
                 potentially economic temperatures through elevated heat ﬂow or thermal insulation in the
                 overburden. Heat ﬂow is likely to be elevated if underlying rocks have elevated radiogenic
                 heat production from heat- producing elements such as potassium, thorium, and uranium.

                 Since crystalline rocks are generally not natural aquifers, ﬂuids need to be injected both
                 to improve the permeability of the rocks and to “charge” the system with “geothermal
                 ﬂuid” as in the Cooper Basin, Australia (Wyborn, 2010). Mineralogy and crystal size
                 may have major effects on the success of stimulation and the self-propping of induced
                 fractures, critical to maintain fracture permeability after stimulation and shear-offset along
                 a rough fracture surface.

                 2.5.4. Geothermal Exploration
                 The division of geothermal play types described above seeks to catalog geothermal
                 systems based on geological differences related to plate tectonic settings. The
                 catalog provides a basis to identify likely geothermal play types at the earliest stage of
                 assessment of the geothermal potential of a region. By doing so, the most appropriate
                 exploration strategies and methods can be selected for the speciﬁc geological setting.
                 In a broad sense, exploration for convection-dominated geothermal play types relies
                 on mapping surface geothermal phenomena, geochemical and geophysical data
                 against background geology. Exploration for conduction-dominated plays places greater
                 importance on subsurface rock properties and mapping through 2D/3D geological
                 modeling of geophysical data. Optimal exploration for any geothermal play might require
                 additional techniques such as stress ﬁeld analysis; geomechanical studies; natural
                 seismicity with seismic risk analysis; or an emphasis on structural geology.
36   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     With regard to the relationship between geothermal play types and hydrocarbon plays,
     conduction-dominated geothermal plays in basin settings (CD1, CD2) may co-exist with
     hydrocarbon plays. Technology transfer in exploration (as well as ﬂuid recovery methods)
     may therefore be more straightforward for these play types.

3.1. Introduction
This chapter describes the typical process of exploration, assessment, and project
development for geothermal power projects. However, every geothermal project is
unique, deﬁned by its local geological and market conditions. No two geothermal projects
follow exactly the same development path. Therefore, the speciﬁc combination of
methodologies, techniques, and timelines for any geothermal project will be unique to that
one project.

Historically, many of the early geothermal projects were developed in a non-systematic
manner. There were no clear guidelines or extensive experience to draw upon for the
geothermal development process, while exploration was rudimentary at best. The ﬁrst
time geothermal power was harnessed for electricity production was in Italy in the early
part of the 20th century using shallow steam from an area where surface discharges
were clearly evident. In New Zealand in the 1950s, the large utility-scale Wairakei
developments were initially justiﬁed on the basis of very high surface heat ﬂows and the
presence of numerous surface features, e.g., geysers and altered hot ground.

Developing an understanding and deﬁning the stages or phases of how to develop
a project to extract a geothermal resource has taken time for the geothermal sector
to accomplish. Even today, different countries and different agenciesemploy different
methodologies and techniques. For example, this Guide introduces the concept of
categorizing geothermal systems on the basis of play types (Chapter 2).

The Guide divides the process of developing geothermal projects into eight phases, in
line with the ESMAP Geothermal Handbook (Gehringer and Loksha, 2012), as follows:

 1.Preliminary survey
 2.Exploration
 3.Test drilling
 4.Project review and planning
 5.Field development
 6.Power plant construction
 7.Commissioning
 8.Operation

Other consultants and developers may divide the process into a different number
of phases (e.g., three phases: exploration, development, and operation; or ﬁve:
reconnaissance exploration, pre-feasibility, feasibility, detailed design and construction,
and operation), but the underlying activities and philosophy are essentially the same.
Completion of each phase represents an increase in the developer’s understanding of the
geothermal system, a decrease in the overall uncertainty of the project’s ﬁnancial viability,
a project decision point, and (usually) a requirement for signiﬁcant ﬁnancial investment.

The following sections introduce the eight phases of a typical geothermal project, with
the primary focus of this Guide on Phases 1 and 2: preliminary survey and exploration
phases of project development.
40         BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




           3.2. Phase 1: Preliminary Survey
           The Preliminary Survey Phase involves a work program to assess the already
           availableevidence for geothermal potential within a speciﬁc area and to identify relevant
           geothermal play types to guide subsequent activities (see Chapter 2). The geographic
           scope of the preliminary survey may be regional or national, perhaps a country, a territory,
           or an island. At the highest level, the survey seeks to identify geological settings that
           might host economically viable geothermal systems. In practice, the survey essentially
           involves a “desk-top” review of geological, hydrological and/or hot spring/thermal data,
           drilling data, anecdotal information from local populations, and remote sensing data
           from satellites, if available.If the area has a history of petroleum, mineral, and/or water
           resource exploration, then records of these activities may provide very useful background
           and subsurface information.


 Example   Most countries have existing databases of geological and hydrological data. These have
           usually been gathered for other purposes but may very well be useful for guiding early
           geothermal surveying and exploration. The potential explorer/developer should make
           every effort to collect and analyze all relevant data prior to designing and planning a new
           exploration program. Remote sensing using data gathered from satellites and aircraft
           (see Section 4.2.4), in particular, is playing an increasingly signiﬁcant role in preliminary
           surveying for geothermal resources.

           Information on land access processes and potential issues should also be gathered
           during the Preliminary Survey Phase. Different countries have different requirements
           and priorities for the environment, land use, indigenous rights, and other land access
           issues. In other words, what are the national, regional, and/or local regulations that
           govern exploration activities? Restricted areas might include national parks, cultural sites,
           geological hazards, urban areas, areas of unique ﬂora or fauna, or others. Land use
           issues are also important. Could a geothermal development live harmoniously with other
           existing or possible land uses? Identifying and addressing potential conﬂicts is critical at
           an early stage of a geothermal project, prior to committing to an exploration program.

           Surveying and addressing public awareness issues is essential in the earliest phases
           of a project. The explorer must understand local perceptions regarding geothermal
           development. In some countries, indigenous populations consider geothermal features
           to have religious signiﬁcance. For example, planned developments in Hawaii, Greece,
           Peru, and Bali received hostile responses to development proposals on religious
           grounds. Identifying any such concerns is an essential component of early geothermal
           investigations. Local communities should be made aware of the impacts, positive and
           negative, of any geothermal development. Public meetings and surveys should be
           undertaken to determine preexisting public attitudes towards development and to provide
           information in response. Having good communications with local communities is essential
           from the outset of any program.


 Example   In Japan, the majority of identiﬁed high temperature geothermal systems are located
           within or adjacent to national parks, where access for exploration has, until recently,
           been forbidden (Meltzer, 2012).

           In Indonesia, over 50 percent of known high temperature geothermal systems are
           located within or adjacent to protected forests or national parks (Abimanyu and Warsito,
           2010).
                                                                                                       41




          In New Zealand, almost half of the identiﬁed geothermal systems are in protected areas
          where development is limited or forbidden (Luketina, 2000).

          In Turkey, few hard rules or regulations currently exist regarding geothermal exploitation.
          The Turkish government has, however, established a Protected Area Special Committee,
          which decides on a case-by-case basis the appropriateness of drilling a geothermal well
          in a protected area. Access for exploration in national parks is controlled and limited.

          The Preliminary Survey Phase should also include an assessment of key environmental
          issues or factors that might affect or be affected by a geothermal development. As with
          any major infrastructure development, geothermal power plants have their own unique
          social and environmental impacts and risks that require awareness and management.
          Developing relationships and communication channels with all stakeholders at the early
          stages of investigation is critical, if the developer is to identify potential sociological or
          environmental roadblocks that may need to be addressed during the project.


Example   Surface water and groundwater quality and water allocations are becoming major
          issues worldwide. Understanding the impacts geothermal developments locally have on
          groundwater availability and quality is critical.


          Necessary infrastructure such as roads, water, power supplies, and availability of
          equipment and contractors must also be considered at an early stage. If roads and
          bridges have to be constructed in what is frequently steep or mountainous terrain, then
          both the exploration and test drilling phases might be delayed.

          The explorer also needs to understand the processes for obtaining and retaining
          legal rights to the geothermal resource and other essential project requirements (e.g.,
          surface water and land tenure) throughout the life of the geothermal project. Regulatory
          frameworks (and potential risk they will change in the future), which are relevant
          to obtaining access along with land rights for early stages of work and subsequent
          development, power supply agreements, and so on, should all be understood.
          Geothermal resources may be either publicly or privately owned. Payments may be
          required to secure leases or to obtain options to extract the resource if the detailed
          exploration is successful. Some countries legislate geothermal rights under mining laws;
          others consider them water rights, while many countries still have no legal framework for
          geothermal development. The geothermal permit process may be fast or very slow. Fully
          understanding these issues is critical from the outset.

          All the factors mentioned here can signiﬁcantly impact the time and cost required to move
          through the subsequent phases of project development. The preliminary survey aims
          to show whether the area of interest (country, region, or island) has a geological setting
          or features that may indicate the presence of an economically exploitable geothermal
          system. Once this is established, the developer must then determine the feasibility of
          obtaining concessions over the most promising areas and, if they become productive,
          how would geothermal power ﬁt with the existing energy infrastructure?

          Although the Preliminary Survey Phase is primarily desk-based, one or more short ﬁeld
          visits might greatly assist in conﬁrming the geothermal play type(s), the regional geology,
          the surface thermal features, and in identifying key environmental and social issues.
42   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     Basic background information collected during the preliminary survey phase covers

      • the power market and possible power purchase agreements (PPA) or feed-in tariff;
      • other/additional demands and possibilities for geothermal energy use such as district
        or greenhouse heating;
      • infrastructure issues (roads, water, communication, transmission);
      • resource ownership issues (in some countries geothermal permits are under mining
        laws; elsewhere it may be considered a water right under speciﬁc geothermal
        legislation; or a relevant legal framework might not yet exist);
      • environmental and social issues;
      • institutional and regulatory frameworks;
      • issues relating to political and ﬁnancial stability;
      • collection and interpretation of available remote sensing or aerial survey data;
      • information from available literature on any known geothermal systems, including
        geological, hydrological, and/or hot spring/thermal data and historic exploration data;
        and
      • information from previous explorations or wells that may have been drilled in the area
        of interest.

     All these factors need to be considered in order to identify possible barriers to
     development or potential roadblocks that might derail or slowdown a development
     program. Based on the outcomes of the preliminary survey, the explorer or developer
     may decide to proceed to the Exploration Phase. Obtaining ﬁnance and/or partners to
     share the risks and expenses of this phase may also be necessary. There may be several
     potential sites to investigate, which could effectively spread the risk but require higher
     overall expenditures.

     Engaging experienced geothermal consultants during the Preliminary Survey Phase is
     one of the keys to identifying and thoroughly assessing relevant background information,
     identifying possible non-geological issues, and designing an effective forward exploration
     program.

     The time required for the preliminary survey depends on a range of factors. The time may
     be as short as several months. However, if there are many potential sites to investigate
     and if environmental approvals and the permit process are complex and ﬁnance is difﬁcult
     to secure, the survey may take a year or longer.


     3.3. Phase 2: Exploration
     The purpose of the Exploration Phase is to cost-effectively collect new geoscientiﬁc data
     to minimize uncertainty related to estimates of key reservoir parameters (temperature,
     depth, extent, permeability, etc.) prior to the Test Drilling Phase. Exploration may start at
     a regional level and progressively focus on smaller target areas as data reveal the most
     attractive locations. Exploration typically begins with gathering new samples and data
     from existing surface manifestations (and perhaps wells if they are available). Exploration
     then proceeds to surface and sub-surface surveying using geological, geochemical, and
     geophysical methods. Environmental studies during the Exploration Phase establish key
     background (or baseline) information. Some countries require detailed environmental
     impact statements as an early outcome of any exploration program.
                                                                                                                43




                     For most projects, the decision to mobilize and contract equipment for the Test Drilling
                     Phase is a signiﬁcant ﬁnancial commitment. For this reason, uncertainties about the
                     characteristics of the drilling target and conditions should be reduced as much as cost-
                     effectively practical during the Exploration Phase. In order to make an exploration
                     program cost effective while reducing uncertainty, this typically begins with relatively
                     low cost regional reconnaissance methods and then proceeds to more complex and
                     expensive surveys over smaller identiﬁed areas of interest. Table 3.1gives some
                     examples of surveying techniques often used in the Exploration Phase. Chapter 4
                     provides a more comprehensive list.

                     Of all these techniques, drilling for temperature gradient (or conductive heat ﬂow)
                     measurements is usually one of the most expensive activities. Such drilling may be well
                     justiﬁed, however, if surface geological, geochemical and geophysical surveys have
                     been completed and substantial uncertainty remains about the nature of the target
                     reservoir. Temperature gradient drilling might then provide a cost-effective approach to
                     risk mitigation by obtaining additional subsurface information about the temperature and
                     extent of the potential reservoir (Coolbaugh et al., 2007).

                   By the end of the Exploration Phase, sufﬁcient data should have been collected and
                   analyzed to prepare a pre-feasibility study and select sites and targets for the Test Drilling
                   Phase, in which the ﬁrst deep wells are drilled directly into the predicted reservoir.

                   Figure 3.1shows an example of a time line for the preliminary survey and exploration
                   phases of a project. However, timelines can vary signiﬁcantly between projects: if any
                   obstacles to a smooth execution of the program are encountered; if the geological setting
                   is complex; or if the interpretation of geoscience results remains ambiguous after the
                   initial planned exploration program (requiring additional exploration). The timeline can
                   stretch beyond two years.

3.3.1. Conceptual Model
A conceptual model (discussed further in Section 4.4) is a schematic representation of the
current best understanding of a geothermal system, consistent with all known data and
information. The ﬁrst iteration of a conceptual model for any new project might be little
more than a generic representation of the type of geothermal play under investigation.
While the initial conceptual model is expected to be crude or incomplete, it is important
to have an initial model that can be reﬁned and improved as the exploration, test drilling
and ﬁeld development phases proceed and more data become available. During the
Exploration Phase, the conceptual model of the geothermal system is continually updated
as new data are gathered. The model needs to contain sufﬁcient geological, hydrological,
and tectonic information to allow a ﬁrst pass estimate of reservoir depth, temperature, and
extent. This is used during the Test Drilling Phase to target production scale wells toward
lithological units and/or geological structures with the highest probability of delivering
commercial ﬂow rates of geothermal ﬂuids.


3.3.2. Non-Technical Data Compilation
At the completion of the exploration program, the developer will be at a decision point,
whether or not to proceed with the project. This is the time to update or conﬁrm current
information (Cassel et al., 1981) relating to these factors:

 •   Power market and possible PPAs
 •   Purchase agreements for district or greenhouse heating
 •   Infrastructure issues (roads, water, communication, transmission)
 •   Resource ownership issues
 •   Environmental and social issues
 •   Institutional and regulatory frameworks
 •   Issues relating to political and ﬁnancial stability


3.3.3. Pre-feasibility Study
The ﬁnal product of the Exploration Phase is a “pre-feasibility study” – an assessment of
all the technical and non-technical data within the framework of a risk-weighted ﬁnancial
model of the project prior to committing to the Test Drilling Phase. This is a very signiﬁcant
milestone since proceeding to test drilling involves major ﬁnancial commitments to the
project. This is at a time when uncertainty about the reservoir characteristics is still high
and the expenditure curve is steep. The pre-feasibility study should recommend either for
or against continuing the project after considering all relevant factors.
46   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     3.4. Phase 3: Test Drilling
     The ﬁrst wells are drilled into the target reservoir during this phase, with well design,
     location, and depth based on the outcomes of the preliminary survey and exploration
     phases. These wells are sometimes termed exploratory or appraisal wells since they are
     often the ﬁrst opportunity to obtain direct information about the reservoir and resource
     characteristics. The term delineation wells may also be used when subsequent wells are
     drilled to assist in deﬁning the margins of a productive geothermal ﬁeld. Drilling the ﬁrst
     wells into the predicted reservoir zone represents the period of highest ﬁnancial risk in
     any project (Figure 1.1), because geological uncertainty remains high.

     Test drilling should provide the potential developer with a good understanding of the
     remaining uncertainties around reservoir temperature and size, depth, permeability,
     productivity, and sustainability; these uncertainties should have been reduced to a level
     that justiﬁes the signiﬁcant cost of the drilling. A preliminary estimate of the magnitude
     of the resource (expressed in terms of potentially recoverable thermal energy or thermal
     power) should be possible at this time, fully acknowledging the uncertainty of the
     estimate. Revised conceptual and initial numerical models can be developed.

     Typically at least two, but more often three, wells are drilled at this time to test the
     existence of a geothermal reservoir capable of sustaining commercial rates of ﬂuid
     production and injection. In some circumstances, more than three test wells may be
     required, depending on the success of the ﬁrst wells, the size of the project to be
     developed, and the predicted extent of the reservoir. Drilling, logging, and subsequent
     well testing is a complex and expensive undertaking (Grant and Bixley, 2011). The design
     of the wells and the well testing program, and the interpretation of the resulting data by
     specialist geothermal engineers and scientists signiﬁcantly improve the understanding of
     the reservoir. This enables

      • reﬁnement of the conceptual model and estimate of the recoverable heat resource;
      • determination of the average well productivity (critical for deﬁning the scope of future
        drilling);
      • provision of geochemical data that can constrain estimates of resource temperature;
        highlight any potential for scaling of corrosion; delineate different aquifers; help
        develop mixing models of the geothermal ﬂuids with near surface waters or magmatic
        components; and add to subsurface understanding in other ways; and
      • selection of the optimal well sites, targets, well paths and designs for subsequent
        production and injection wells.

     Upon completing the Test Drilling Phase, the project moves into the Project Review and
     Feasibility Phase.
                                                                                          47




3.4.1. Updating the Conceptual Model
The conceptual model of the geothermal system should be progressively updated
as more data become available during the Test Drilling Phase (Cumming, 2009).
In particular, the results from the ﬁrst well might modify the explorer’s geological
understanding of the system and help better target the second and subsequent wells.


3.4.2. Numerical Modeling
A conceptual model consistent with all available data can form the framework of a
numerical model for forecasting the performance of the geothermal reservoir during future
production. Once there are some production data to be matched, numerical modeling is
used to test the validity of the conceptual model, to estimate the impact that geothermal
exploitation will have on the reservoir, and to predict possible degradation of the reservoir
temperature and/or pressure and resultant power output.


3.5. Phase 4: Project Review and Feasibility
Once test drilling has conﬁrmed the existence of a viable geothermal resource, the
geological uncertainty and ﬁnancial risk of the project are substantially reduced and a
robust “feasibility report” can be prepared. A minimum of one successful production well
must usually be drilled before preparing a feasibility report for a geothermal investment.
A successful production well is fundamental to understanding the possible behavior of
the geothermal reservoir during production and to developing a realistic numerical model.
The private sector assigns signiﬁcant importance to successful geothermal production
wells to justify investments.

Information on reservoir performance collected during the Test Drilling Phase permits the
developer to build a numerical reservoir model, estimate the likely output per production
well, size and cost the planned development, and hence build a reasonably robust
ﬁnancial model. Such a model, incorporating a risk analysis, is critical for the developer
to obtain ﬁnance to move the project ahead to the Field Development Phase and to
negotiate acceptable terms for a PPA.

Preliminary sites for production and reinjection wells are chosen at this time. Good well
targeting is critical to drilling successful wells. A sound appreciation of the geological
setting and the speciﬁc formations and/or structures likely to have adequate permeability
is critical to designing the wells, specifying their targets, and planning the drilling
program. This process requires input from the geoscience team, led by geologists and
drilling engineers, which draws on information gained during previous phases of project
development.
48   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     A feasibility report is compiled to provide both the developer and potential ﬁnanciers with
     conﬁdence in the commercial viability of the project. The feasibility report typically is in
     two parts: the technical report and the ﬁnancial report. The compiled feasibility report
     contains the following elements:

      • Recommended location and design of drilling pads and other civil works (roads,
        preparation of power plant site, etc.)
      • Speciﬁcation of drilling targets for all production and reinjection wells
      • Well design
      • Forecasts of reservoir performance from the numerical reservoir model
      • The power plant design
      • A transmission access plan
      • Construction budget, costs and timeline for all of the above
      • Clariﬁcation of market issues
      • Demand analysis (regional and national)
      • Take-off and transmission issues
      • The terms of the PPA
      • Project budget and revenue projections

     Based on the feasibility report, funding is sought and a decision is made to develop or not
     to develop the project. All sections of a feasibility report need to be updated as the project
     progresses and as more data about the market situation and reservoir characteristics
     become available.


     3.6. Phase 5: Field Development
     The project now proceeds to the Field Development Phase with the drilling of a sufﬁcient
     number of production and reinjection wells to support the proposed power production. In
     parallel with the drilling, work starts on the gathering system to convey the geothermal
     ﬂuid from the wells to the power plant.

     Once a large project proceeds to ﬁeld development, two or more drilling rigs operating
     simultaneously is optimal in order to shorten the development time and bring revenue
     from generation as soon as possible. Predicting with great conﬁdence the precise
     productivity of wells prior to drilling is rarely possible, as this remains subject to natural
     geological variance between locations. The success rate for geothermal wells to achieve
     their minimum anticipated productivity or injectivity varies around the world, but a recent
     analysis of global geothermal well success commissioned by the International Finance
     Corporation (IFC, 2013) suggests that success rates typically improve from 50 percent
     during test drilling to 70-80 percent during ﬁeld development. Achieving or exceeding
     these success rates depends strongly on the quality of prior exploration and the validity
     of the conceptual model. In areas where many similar geothermal systems have already
     been developed, the success rate is generally higher than the global average.
                                                                                                49




For a well of 2 km depth, a drilling time of 40 to 50 days (24-hour operation) is not
unusual for a production scale well. The developer therefore has to determine the number
of production wells that will be required and the time needed to complete such drilling
(including an allowance for some unsuccessful wells, which often exceed 20 percent of
wells drilled). In addition, re-injection wells are required to return the geothermal ﬂuid to
the reservoir to minimize pressure decline. The ratio of production to reinjection wells
ranges from as high as 4:1 for resources with a high steam fraction to as low as 1:1
for liquid resources. The actual number of reinjection wells required depends on the
enthalpy of the production ﬂuid, well productivity, the ﬂuid-to-steam ratio, and the power
plant technology. The location and depths of reinjection wells is a decision based on the
conceptual and numerical models, which are continuously updated as new data become
available.

Some excess production capacity should be included in the ﬁeld development plan and
allowed for in the ﬁnancial model. A realistic temperature and pressure decline rate for
production wells should also be allowed for in the initial numerical and ﬁnancial models,
and updated as real data become available.

The Field Development Phase requires closely managing a range of suppliers (rigs,
casing, drill rods, drilling chemicals, drilling mud, etc.). Well testing, and perhaps tracer
testing, should follow each well completion to build knowledge of both production limits
and subsurface conditions. This enables both continuous updating of the conceptual
model and testing of any previous predictions. The numerical model should also be
updated.

Once a certain percentage of the total required ﬂuid production rate is conﬁrmed, the
project’s ﬁnancial risks are signiﬁcantly reduced, and debt ﬁnancing might become
available on commercial terms. Such ﬁnancing is usually not available until after the
majority (or all) of the resource is conﬁrmed through drilling, a PPA is signed, and the
conceptual design of the power plant is available; the PPA, especially, provides security
for long-term debt.

Any delays during ﬁeld development can seriously impact the timelines for completing the
project. Timing may be critical for meeting deadlines in PPAs and for generating revenue
for investment returns.


3.7. Phase 6: Power Plant Construction
The completion of the steam gathering system is coordinated with any necessary civil
works and infrastructure to allow the power plant to be constructed along with further
testing of the wells. Power plants are often designed and constructed under a single
engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) contract awarded following a tender
process.
50   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     3.8. Phase 7: Commissioning
     The Commissioning Phase should be planned and costed as a separate exercise prior
     to operation. This includes the testing of all power plant components and associated
     equipment to ensure their operability meets the respective design conditions. This also
     includes ﬁne-tuning the power plant’s efﬁciency, pressures from the wells, and other
     parameters, which can take several months to complete and could require resolving
     technical and contractual issues with the supplier of the plant (Gehringer and Loksha,
     2012).


     3.9. Phase 8: Operation
     The power plant begins operations once the power plant construction and commissioning
     phases are complete. Since the fuel supply for the life of the plant has effectively been
     fully provided during the Field Development Phase, the main focus is to optimize the
     production and injection scheme to enable the most efﬁcient and sustainable energy
     recovery and utilization. This helps to minimize operational costs, maximize investment
     returns, and ensure the reliable delivery of geothermal power. New production and
     reinjection wells may be needed over the lifetime of the plant to make up for any decline
     in productivity or adjustment of the reinjection strategy as the reservoir responds to
     exploitation.

                 4.1. Introduction
                 This chapter provides in-depth information about a range of data collection and
                 exploration methods and contains details of how exploration data are typically acquired
                 in geothermal projects. The chapter also provides examples of “good outcomes” for
                 each method, although subjective and variable from one geothermal project to the next
                 depending on the geological setting and type of reservoir. Each geothermal project is
                 different, and the exact exploration methods most appropriate for a given project depend
                 on speciﬁc conditions. However, as outlined in Chapter 3, geothermal projects generally
                 go through the same eight-phase development process, with the ﬁrst three phases
                 summarized in Figure 4.1below.

                 The goal of this Guide is to help minimize uncertainty regarding reservoir characteristics
                 before commencing the Test Drilling Phase of a project. To that end, this chapter is
                 divided into two broad sections that focus on the ﬁrst two phases of a geothermal project:
                 preliminary survey and exploration. The chapter is also written from the viewpoint of
                 assisting the project explorer, but is equally relevant to potential ﬁnanciers to assess
                 whether a potential developer has applied best practices to the project.

     4.2. Phase 1: Preliminary Survey
     4.2.1. Non-Geoscientiﬁc Information
     This topic is discussed in detail in Chapter 3.

     All non-geological information should be compiled and presented in such a manner as to
     illustrate, if required, that the explorer is competent and understands local requirements
     and perceptions towards geothermal development. Documents and maps detailing
     easements or other rights of use should be collated, as well as documents and maps
     detailing any land-use restrictions in the area. A fundamental task is to unify all data to a
     common coordinate system (e.g., UTM with zone or latitude and longitude). Projection
     and datum information should be clearly indicated (e.g., World Geodetic System 84,
     European Datum 1950, etc.). Geo-referenced digital databases (e.g., locations and
     characteristics of geothermal manifestations, topography, roads, other infrastructure,
     geology, geochemistry, geophysics, etc.) should be created whenever possible for ease
     of analysis and presentation, with data compiled by means of summaries, databases,
     spreadsheets, maps, and ﬁgures, depending on the nature of the data. Short narratives
     (e.g., geologic setting, tectonic history, development history) sufﬁce where tabular
     compilation is inappropriate.

     The development company should also collate a dossier of relevant information about
     the company. Information may be requested about ownership, management, ﬁnancial
     structures, personnel experience with similar projects, or other commercial issues
     relevant to the project.

     Though maybe not required for several years, the explorer should also think about
     selecting a drilling company at the earliest phases of a project. When selecting a
     geothermal driller, considering the driller’s equipment and experience with similar projects
     would be wise.


     4.2.2. Environmental Impact and Resource Protection
     4.2.2.1. Local Requirements
     A thorough understanding of the local regulations for environmental protection is an
     essential early step for any geothermal development addressed in Chapter 3. Although
     geothermal development is frequently viewed as an environmentally friendly option for
     power generation, the fact that any development impacts the environment and land
     use must be appreciated. In some locations, geothermal systems might be protected
     from development because their public value in their natural state is considered greater
     than the public value of geothermal power. This public value might be due to culture,
     environment, history, or tourism. Geothermal systems in close proximity to urban areas
     may also be protected.

     Even when geothermal development is permitted, an environmental and social impact
     statement (ESIS) may be a prerequisite to embarking on a survey or exploration program.
     The environmental impact of each exploration method itself should be considered. Some
     exploration methods may be restricted in nature reserves or water protection zones.
     In urban areas, the permitted gross vehicle weight for roads may pose an issue for
     some exploration methods, while other methods may be prohibited near listed historic
     monuments.
                                                                                                       55




Example   In Germany, off-road driving in nature reserves is often prohibited, but access by foot is
          allowed. Bird sanctuaries are often off limits during breeding seasons. The total weight
          of vehicles (e.g., seismic vibrators) must be considered since heavy vehicle trafﬁc is
          restricted on certain public roads and bridges.

          In Turkey, potential developers aiming to build a geothermal power plant with capacity
          over 5 MWe must prepare an environmental impact statement. There is no need to
          prepare the statement for a project aiming to build a plant of less than 5 MWe capacity,
          but the explorer must apply for a certiﬁcate conﬁrming exemption from this requirement.


          4.2.2.2         Baseline Environmental Data
          Baseline environmental data deﬁne the starting conditions of any development and
          should be collected as early as possible. In many countries, license terms impose strict
          conditions relating to any potential environmental impact of a geothermal project. For
          example, a license may be granted only on the condition that the geothermal project
          has minimal or no impact on other existing land uses. This might cover such impacts as
          land subsidence, air quality, surface geothermal features, groundwater quality, visual
          amenity, and seismic activity. Collection of robust baseline data is critical to ensuring
          and demonstrating compliance with such conditions, but collecting this data may take
          signiﬁcant time. For example, it might require many months of monitoring to deﬁne
          baseline seismicity characteristics or variability of discharge from active geothermal
          features. It is important the explorer identify environmental parameters that might be
          sensitive and address these early in the project. Baseline data can be presented, if
          requested, by using maps, charts, graphs, tables, databases, or other appropriate
          formats.


          4.2.3. Literature Review
          An early step in evaluating a geothermal play is to ﬁnd and assess any existing data
          and previous research pertaining to the play area. In many cases, previous studies offer
          valuable insights into the geological setting through hydrology, geochemistry, geophysics,
          or other surveys. This step is critical to avoid duplication of effort and to enable the
          explorer to apply exploration funds prudently.

          A thorough literature review by experienced geothermal specialists can save the explorer
          signiﬁcant time and expense by avoiding duplication of effort during the Exploration
          Phase of the project. Such a review may, for example, uncover valuable baseline
          environmental data. Historical data might also provide a useful comparison to newly
          collected data, enabling the explorer to assess the quality and consistency of new data
          against previously collected information.

          The literature review should focus on uncovering articles, reports, maps, databases
          and ﬁgures concerning the geothermal play, geothermal system, and/or cultural and
          environmental information about the project area. Table 4.1lists the types of data typically
          gathered during this stage of the Preliminary Survey, but this should not be considered an
          exhaustive list.

                    •   Regional heat ﬂow


                   The literature review should include a thorough online search, but should also include
                   visits to local government agencies, universities, and other institutions where public
                   documents (and human recall) relevant to the project area might be held. Data provided
                   on a commercial basis by third-party suppliers should be checked for quality and
                   usefulness before purchase. These are possible sources of data:

                    • Academic publications and theses from local and foreign universities or research
                      programs
                    • Data, results and/or reports from previous leaseholders including mining tenements, or
                      previous exploration campaigns for minerals or oil and gas
                    • Reports and documents from agencies of the national, provincial, and municipal
                      governments
                    • Data and information found through internet searches
                    • Data purchasable from third-party suppliers
                    • Commercially produced maps



 Example           In Turkey, background geological, hydrogeological, geochemical, and geophysical
                   information about known geothermal ﬁelds can be searched and bought from the General
                   Directorate of Mineral Research and Exploration and from universities.
                                                                                         57




A good outcome after reviewing the literature and published data is a high level of
conﬁdence knowing all relevant existing data and maps are identiﬁed, collated, and
assessed for inclusion in what might be a very preliminary conceptual model of the
resource. At this stage, the best practice is to build a geographic information system (GIS)
database to hold and present all relevant geospatial information about the geothermal
play and license area.


4.2.4. Satellite Imagery, Aerial Photogrammetry,
and LIDAR
More and more data from satellite and airborne sensors are becoming readily available. A
range of these data can be applied to geothermal exploration. Examples include satellite
or aircraft-based infrared scans (Haselwimmer & Prakash, 2013); thermal data acquired
by Thematic Mapper (TM) and Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) sensors
onboard Landsat-5 and Landsat-7 satellites (Qin et al., 2011); digital elevation models
from airborne LIDAR instruments; and data from the Advanced Space-borne Thermal
Emission and Reﬂection Radiometer (ASTER), launched in 1999 as part of NASA’s Earth
Observing System. Data from all of these sensors are increasingly being applied around
the world to identify surface geothermal features.

Data from these sensors should be purchased and assessed during the preliminary
survey phase, if the explorer knows or expects that the license area contains relevant
surface features with a strong thermal or mineralogical signature. Remote sensing
data can be added to the GIS database for integration with data compiled from surface
surveys to produce detailed maps for each project area. The maps can be interpreted
to identify the locations and extent of possible current or historic surface geothermal
features. The technique may be especially useful in difﬁcult terrain where ground access
is difﬁcult. Note, however, that conﬁrmation of thermal or mineralogical anomalies always
requires on-ground veriﬁcation and assessment.


4.2.5. Conclusion of Preliminary Survey
At the conclusion of the Preliminary Survey Phase, the explorer should have a thorough
understanding of the legal, social, environmental, and geological parameters within which
the project has to operate. The explorer will have legal and social license to proceed to
the Exploration Phase of the project, with conﬁdence that development of a power plant
will be allowed should a viable geothermal resource be discovered. All previous data
relevant to the geothermal play will have been collated and assessed, revealing where
key data gaps and critical geological uncertainties remain. Efﬁciently and effectively
minimizing geological uncertainties by ﬁlling these data gaps is the goal of the Exploration
Phase of the project.

     4.3. Phase 2: Exploration Methods
     4.3.1. Overview
     The purpose of the Exploration Phase is to cost-effectively collect new geoscientiﬁc data
     to minimize uncertainty related to estimates of reservoir temperature, depth, productivity,
     and sustainability prior to the Test Drilling Phase.

     Beginning the Exploration Phase with broad, regional-scale methods is common in order
     to constrain the “big picture” conceptual model of the geothermal system, before focusing
     in more detail on areas showing the most promise for economic extraction of geothermal
     resources. Regional-scale exploration methods include geological mapping, outcrop
     sample collection and analysis, geochemical sample collection and analysis, airborne
     geophysical surveys, and broad-spaced surface geophysical surveys. Even where similar
     data already exist, resampling or resurveying partially or fully may be cost effective to
     verify the quality of the earlier data or to allow proper “stitching” of old and new data sets.

     At the end of the regional exploration stage, the data are evaluated to assess the
     likelihood of an economically viable geothermal system existing. To proceed to the next
     stage of exploration, there should be at least prima facie evidence of a geothermal
     system with heat source, heat migration pathway, and reservoir, and some indication
     of the likely geographic extent, all of which can be presented as a conceptual model
     consistent with all data.

     If the regional data are encouraging, the exploration program moves to more localized
     exploration methods, geographically focused on the most promising areas. Each method
     employed should aim in some way to improve the conﬁdence in the estimates of reservoir
     temperature, depth, productivity, and sustainability. The same type of data collected
     during regional exploration may be collected again during localized exploration. The
     difference between the two stages might be the spacing between data stations, level
     of detail of the data analysis, or both. Regional exploration is generally carried out at a
     broad-scale and station spacing, while localized exploration focuses on ﬁner details and
     employs closer station spacing.

     Table 4.2lists a broad range of geoscientiﬁc datasets and methods that might be
     employed during a geothermal exploration program, separated broadly into geological,
     geochemical, geophysical, and other methods. Any single exploration program will very
     likely employ all of the listed methods. An appropriate set of methods for a speciﬁc project
     should be chosen based on a cost-beneﬁt analysis of the different options, where the
     beneﬁt can be quantiﬁed to the degree the method will reduce the uncertainty in the
     explorer’s understanding of critical reservoir parameters. The following sections describe
     each method in more detail.
                                                                                                             59

     4.3.2. Geology
     A thorough understanding of the project area’s geology and how it ﬁts into the
     surrounding regional geological and tectonic setting are crucial to understanding a given
     geothermal system. A geological understanding assists in assessing ﬂuid ﬂow (especially
     through identifying faults and permeable rock units) and temperature anomalies (through
     mineral alterations). At an early stage of the literature review, a decision should be made
     as to which is the most likely geothermal play type to exist in the area (see Chapter 2).
     The following sections discuss the method of assessing the geology and the focus areas
     of analysis of gathered data.

     4.3.2.1. Mapping and Identiﬁcation of Play Type
     Once data have been gathered from available literature, geological studies (including
     ﬁeld work) can be carried out at both a regional and local level. Initial geological studies
     focus on understanding the overall geology of the project area and identifying the most
     promising areas for more detailed exploration. Efforts focus later on the most promising
     areas, generally with the speciﬁc goal of understanding the permeability pathways that
     bring thermal ﬂuids from their deep source to shallower parts of the system, where they
     can be economically exploited for geothermal power production.

     An assessment should be made of the accuracy and suitability of existing maps and
     cross sections by comparing them to ﬁeld observations. If the quality of existing mapping
     is sufﬁcient, but cross sections have not been constructed for the project area, this should
     be done. If the quality of existing mapping and/or cross sections is insufﬁcient, new
     geologic mapping should be undertaken. In either case, multiple cross sections should
     be constructed through the project area to present and evaluate the three-dimensional
     subsurface structure. Data from existing wells may also be useful to constrain subsurface
     data and structures.

     In many cases, explorers ﬁnd that the existing geologic mapping is of good quality,
     but there is a need for additional mapping focusing on areas and issues of particular
     relevance to geothermal exploration, including those discussed below. An example of
     a geological map from the geothermally active Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand is
     shown in Figure 4.2.

                       4.3.2.2. Heat Source
                       The possible heat source for the geothermal system should be identiﬁed or inferred. The
                       heat source may be associated with active magmatism or regional high heat ﬂow. Felsic
                       volcanism is often associated with shallow magma chambers that can be a heat source
                       for geothermal systems, whereas maﬁc volcanism tends to be sourced from deeper
                       magma chambers that are less likely to drive a shallow geothermal system (Elders et
                       al., 1984). The most interesting igneous rocks are of Pliocene or younger age (less
                       than ﬁve million years old); they are most likely to be associated with magma chambers
                       that still retain signiﬁcant heat. For example, there is some signiﬁcant young volcanism
                       in the central and eastern parts of Turkey. Despite this, the major focus of geothermal
                       development in Turkey is currently in Western Anatolia, where regional heat ﬂow is known
                       to be high. In conductive plays the heat source may not be known in detail.

                       4.3.2.3. Hydrothermal Alteration
                       Geothermal manifestations are direct indicators of hot water ﬂowing in the subsurface
                       and therefore warrant special attention when preparing maps. Areas that lack active
                       geothermal manifestations, but show evidence of their earlier presence, are also of
                       special interest. It is common, particularly in heavily populated or agricultural areas,
                       for water tables to have lowered over time. This can result in active geothermal
                       manifestations drying up, even though there is still an active system below at depth.
                       Indicators of areas of former hot spring activity include hot spring deposits (sinter,
                       travertine, etc.), bleached or hydrothermally altered areas, and silica cementing of
                       shallow deposits, all of which indicate that hot water has passed through the area
                       (Browne, 1989)
62   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     Certain types of mineralization are often associated with hydrothermal systems, including
     deposits of sulfur (S), mercury (Hg), gold (Au), silver (Ag), and antimony (Sb). The
     presence of such deposits can indicate the potential existence of a geothermal system,
     because circulating geothermal ﬂuids concentrate these minerals into economically
     attractive deposits. Any such occurrence should therefore be mapped. However, there
     are limitations to the use of mineral deposits as indicators of active geothermal systems.
     While concentrations of these minerals are sometimes associated with active geothermal
     systems, most such deposits on the surface are associated with long extinct geothermal
     systems that, while providing potentially attractive mining targets, are no longer
     associated with economic accumulations of heat (Lawless, 1988; Browne, 1989).

     In addition to concentrating certain economic minerals, geothermal ﬂuids break down the
     rocks though which they are passing, changing their mineral content. The most common
     result of this water-rock interaction is the formation of clays (Browne, 1978). Sometimes
     colorful, other times bleached white, these clay alteration zones are one of the most
     prominent indicators of a geothermal system. However, as with the mineral deposits
     described above, these alteration zones may be the result of ancient rather than current
     activity. In some geothermal areas, the careful mapping of alteration types and patterns
     provides insight into the history of thermal activity.

     4.3.2.4. Mineral Geothermometers
     Certain minerals that typically form from neutral pH waters in geothermal systems have
     well deﬁned and restricted temperature stability ranges (Browne, 1993). They include clay
     minerals, zeolites, and calc-silicates, and are widely used as mineral geothermometers.
     Much useful data may be gathered from surface samples and supplemented by data from
     core drilling where appropriate.

     Clays are hydrated aluminosilicate minerals, whose structures are sensitive to changes
     in both temperature and the geochemical environment. They are extremely ﬁne in
     particle size and therefore their compositions can change rapidly to remain in chemical
     equilibrium with their immediate environment. In the study of hydrothermal alteration, they
     are widely used as sensitive mineral geothermometers and as indicators of changes in
     chemical environment.

     For example, speciﬁc clay minerals that are stable under acid conditions (kaolinite,
     dickite, pyrophyllite, and diaspore) can be associated with acid alteration above
     upﬂow zones, along faults or within the reservoir. The neutral pH clays, which include
     smectites (sometimes called montmorillonites), chlorite, and illite, show a progressive
     transformation with temperature. Indeed, Harvey and Browne (1991) studied the
     transition from smectite through a mixed illite-smectite layer more extensively at Wairakei
     than elsewhere (Harvey and Browne, 2000). They found the following:

      • Smectites are stable to about 70°C, above which they begin a transformation through
        a series of mixed-layer clay structures towards illite or chlorite. In some geothermal
        systems smectite may survive at higher temperatures, perhaps due to the inability for
        water-rock interaction to reach equilibrium in low permeability settings that can result
        from swelling clays.
      • Interlayered illite-smectites or chlorite-smectites are stable in the range 70°C–210°C.
      • The crystallinity of clays increases with increasing T.
      • Discrete illite is stable above ~210°C.
      • In some geothermal systems in more basic (basaltic) settings, changes in chlorite
        composition have been found to be temperature dependent.
                                                                                                                    63




                        With respect to zeolites and calc-silicates, the following was found:

                            •   Mordenite is stable up to 120°C.
                            •   Laumontite is stable from 120°C to 210°C.
                            •   Wairakite is stable from 210°C to > 300°C.
                            •   Epidote is stable above 250°C.
                            •   Ca-garnet is stable above ~290°C.
                            •   Prehnite is stable above ~220°C.
                            •   Actinolite is stable above ~290°C.

                        Figure 4.3is a schematic illustration of a typical clay alteration zone above a high
                        temperature geothermal system. There is a clear advantage in geothermal exploration
                        to be able to distinguish between the smectite layer and the mixed smectite-illite layer.
                        Because of their very ﬁne particle size, not until the development of X-ray diffraction
                        analysis in the 1930s did the structure of clay minerals become well understood. Today
                        most analytical laboratories involved in geothermal exploration have X-ray diffraction
                        equipment. However, because X-ray diffraction laboratories are usually remote from
                        exploration sites, there is typically a delay in interpretation due to the time taken to
                        transport the samples from the ﬁeld to the laboratory. In the 1990s, Harvey et al. (2000)
                        developed a rig geologist tool that partly overcomes this problem by enabling the
                        presence of smectite clays to be identiﬁed, using a speciﬁc chemical dye (methylene
                        blue). Figure 4.4summarizes the methodology in which Gunderson et al. (2000)
                        successfully used the methylene blue technique in Indonesia to ground-truth resistivity
                        data (Figure 4.5and Figure 4.6).

                     4.3.2.5. Lithology and Stratigraphy
                     Understanding the stratigraphic sequence in the area allows a better understanding of
                     the distribution of various lithologies (Rosenberg et al., 2009). In areas with major normal
                     faulting, exposures in the hills and mountains may provide clues to what lies beneath the
                     subsurface in the adjacent valley. Drilling data from any deep wells in the region should
                     also be evaluated to conﬁrm the stratigraphic sequence, to the extent that such data
                     are available (Sepulveda et al., 2012). An example of constructed stratigraphic columns
                     based on drill hole data from the Wairakei Geothermal Field in New Zealand is illustrated
                     in Figure 4.7.

                     Permeability is almost always a limiting factor in geothermal projects. Therefore,
                     identifying units that are likely to have good permeability is of primary importance when
                     targeting wells. Certain lithologies have greater potential to be reservoir rocks. Such
                     lithologies may have high primary permeability and/or secondary permeability. Rocks with
                     high primary permeability include sandstone, limestone, quartzite, marble, gneiss, lava
                     ﬂows, breccia, and pyroclastic ﬂows. The presence of brittle rock units that can sustain
                     fractures when deformed may provide fracture-controlled (secondary) permeability, which
                     may provide major ﬂow paths for thermal ﬂuids.

                         Potential capping rocks (aquitards and aquicludes) are important to identify (Facca and
                         Tonani, 1967). These are units with low permeability such as clays, silt, shale, schist, and
                         other rock types. The distribution of low permeability and high permeability rocks may
                         therefore deﬁne ﬂuid ﬂow pathways, resulting in a geothermal reservoir of a particular
                         size or shape. In addition, argillic (of or pertaining to clay or clay minerals) alteration and/
                         or siliciﬁcation of existing lithologies associated with an active geothermal system may
                         create a low permeability cap above a geothermal reservoir or low permeability zones at
                         the margins of the system.

                         4.3.2.6. Geologic and Tectonic Structure
                         Analysis of regional geologic structure enables an understanding of the geological context
                         of the project area. Of particular interest are large-scale extensional features such as
                         grabens and metamorphic core complexes, or any other structural features that result in
                         or are the result of crustal thinning. In addition, the location, orientation, and distribution
                         of regional deep fault zones are important, as these faults can play many roles in a
                         geothermal system, from ﬂuid conduits to barriers to ﬂuid ﬂow as well as creating or
                         enhancing secondary permeability (Blewitt et al., 2003).

                         Local geologic structure is of paramount importance in any geothermal project.
                         Geothermal systems are often associated with structural highs and in many cases
                         dipping units may transmit geothermal ﬂuids from depth across signiﬁcant distances
                         (i.e., the source or reservoir may be laterally offset from the surface manifestations).
                         Understanding the depth, orientation, and thickness of potential reservoir units and lower-
                         permeability units is essential to developing a comprehensive conceptual model. It is
                         equally important to understand the locations, orientations, and sense of slip along both
                         regional structures (e.g., graben-bounding faults), and local structures (e.g., cross-cutting
                         faults).

                         4.3.2.7. Two-Dimensional (2D) Geologic Cross-Sections
                         As more and more subsurface data becomes available from the ongoing exploration
                         activities, it should be possible to develop two-dimensional (2D) cross sections to
                         illustrate the basic stratigraphic and structural framework of the geothermal play (Figure
                         4.8).

                       4.3.2.8. Three-Dimensional (3D) Geologic Models
                       When further drill hole information is available, all structural and stratigraphic information
                       can be integrated into a 3D model (Figure 4.9). The 3D models have proved to be
                       extremely useful for well targeting and structural and stratigraphic visualization (Milicich
                       et al., 2010). Such sophisticated models can only be developed after several wells
                       have been drilled, but the ﬁgure illustrates the direction in which conceptual models can
                       develop.

                       4.3.2.9. Geological Hazards
                       The geologist also should prepare a geological hazards map, identifying potential
                       geological hazards in and around the project area. These could include volcanic activity,
                       landslides, areas prone to ﬂooding, slope stability, or other site-speciﬁc factors.

                       A good outcome from the geological analysis is a clear picture of the regional and
                       local geology, stratigraphy, and tectonic structure of the area, as well as identiﬁcation
                       of uncertainties and data gaps needing to be addressed in subsequent stages of
                       exploration. This information should indicate which units or structures could host a
                       geothermal reservoir, and forms the basis for subsequent conceptual and numerical
                       models.

                       4.3.3.1. Overview
                       Geochemistry presents an extremely useful set of tools for the exploration of high
                       enthalpy geothermal resources. Even at the early stages of exploration, sampling of
                       ﬂuids and gases, followed by analyses and calculation and interpretation of chemical
                       geothermometry, is very useful to develop an understanding of the temperatures and
                       extent of the possible geothermal reservoir. This gives an early indication of whether
                       a sufﬁciently well-developed resource might exist that is hot enough to be utilized for
                       geothermal electricity generation.

                       Geochemical studies later in the Exploration Phase focus on understanding the
                       geothermal ﬂuid sources and ﬂow paths and assessing potential operational issues that
                       will come with development, such as wellbore scaling, corrosion, and concentrations
                       of non-condensable gases. Regional carbon dioxide (CO2) soil gas surveys, a recent
                       advancement in geochemical evaluations at the regional exploration stage, are becoming
                       increasingly popular to supplement geothermometry techniques, because variations in
                       CO2 concentrations at the surface may delineate permeable faults or the extent of an
                       active geothermal system.

                       4.3.3.2. Active Geothermal Features
                       Active geothermal features include any or all of the following:

                        • Hot/warm springs and seeps (hot = >50°C and warm = >25°C)
                        • Mineral springs (with conductivity exceeding one standard deviation or more above
                          the background)
                        • Fumaroles
                        • Solfataras
                        • Hot/warm wells (including geothermal or groundwater wells)
                        • Gas seeps
                        • Geysers
                        • Mud pots
                        • Steaming ground

                       Active geothermal features are proof of an existing geothermal system on some scale,
                       although not proof of a system suitable for power generation. The ﬁrst step in ﬁeld
                       exploration is to locate and characterize all existing geothermal features within the project
                       area and within a relevant distance of the area. A conservative rule of thumb is to record
                       “hot” (>50°C) features within 10 km and “warm” (>25°C) features within 5 km of the
                       project area. Active geothermal features should be plotted on a map (Figure 4.10).

                                                                                             69




Before entering a thermally active area, it is critical to assess safety issues in the project
area. Hydrothermally altered ground is frequently unstable; the margins of hot springs
may have overhangs that collapse; and gas discharges associated with the features can
prove fatal to animals, birds, and humans. All precautions should be taken as follows:

 •   Presence of suitably qualiﬁed support personnel
 •   Accident evacuation plan
 •   Gas masks and sensors
 •   Insulated ﬁeld equipment, boots, and gloves
 •   Designated sample equipment including extended poles for sampling pools

For each active geothermal feature, the following parameters should be carefully
measured and recorded:

 • Location in UTM with zone or latitude and longitude: In each case, projection and
   datum information should be clearly indicated (e.g., WGS 84, ED 1950, etc.) along
   with elevation.
 • Temperature in degrees Celsius (°C)
 • Electrical conductivity (EC): Also known as speciﬁc conductivity (SC), measured in μS/
   cm units
 • pH
 • Flow rate in liters per second (l/s) or kilograms per second (kg/s): Estimates are
   sufﬁcient; the measurement does not need to be exact, only accurate to within an
   order of magnitude; highest ﬂow rate, highest temperature springs are more likely to
   give the best geochemical estimates of reservoir temperatures since high ﬂow rates
   and high temperatures suggest rapid ascent to the surface from the reservoir.
 • Presence of gas bubbles
 • Presence of sulfur or other odors
 • Presence of precipitates in the ﬂuids
 • Presence and extent (mapped if possible) of deposits associated with the active
   geothermal manifestations such as sinter, travertine, bleaching/alteration, and/
   or siliciﬁcation of surrounding or underlying deposits: Quartz sinters around active
   springs indicate high temperature reservoirs; lower temperature geothermal ﬂuids or
   near surface mixing with cool groundwater, more often result in amorphous silica or
   chalcedony.
 • Samples of the spring discharges collected and preserved using standard techniques
   (Giggenbach and Goguel, 1989): Samples should be analyzed by experienced
   geochemical laboratories prior to interpretation and graphical presentation (See
   Section 4.4).

In addition to the above parameters, the overall number of manifestations should be
recorded (particularly for springs >50°C and wells >80°C), along with their areal extent
and the cumulative ﬂow rate of all the manifestations. If this information is available
from previously published studies, it should be re-conﬁrmed, as geothermal systems are
dynamic and can evolve over relatively short periods of time (years or less). Documenting
current conditions is important, although historical data are also useful.
70   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     In the case of hot/warm wells, this additional information should be recorded if possible:

      •   Intended purpose (objectives) of the well
      •   Well spud date (drilling start date)
      •   Completion date (date hole is completed)
      •   Total depth (bottom hole depth, both depth drilled and true vertical depth)
      •   Drilling history (daily drilling reports and/or summaries of drilling conditions)
      •   Drilling results (temperature and ﬂow rate upon hole completion)
      •   Bottom hole temperature (BHT)
      •   Temperature and outputs of long-term discharges under different wellhead pressures
      •   Well completion data
          - Casing diameter as well as the depth of the hanger and the depth of the casing shoe
            (may be multiple casing strings, if so, should record information for each one)
          - Liner diameter as well as depth of the hanger and depth of the bottom of the liner
            (may be multiple liners, if so, should record information for each one)
          - Nature of any open interval (open hole, gravel pack, etc.)
      •   Geological logs (mud logs, core logs)
      •   Geophysical logs (temperature pressure spinner logs, resistivity logs)
      •   Well test results
      •   Any other relevant tables

     This information can be very helpful in determining which lithological units and/or
     structures are associated with the production of hot water. The location and names of
     all the geothermal features, as well as the mapped extents of surrounding geothermal
     deposits, should be compiled on a single map for each project area. The remaining data,
     including temperature, electrical conductivity, pH, and ﬂow rate, should be compiled
     into tables that correspond directly to what is shown on the map. These two sets of
     documents should encompass as much of the above listed information as can be
     obtained. Ideally, all of these data would be geo-referenced, allowing for easy integration
     with other project data. Logs and testing results from hot/warm wells should be presented
     and discussed on a well-by-well basis, and down hole summary plots should be created
     summarizing all the available information for each well.

     4.3.3.3. Fluid and Gas Sampling Procedures
     Once geothermal manifestations have been identiﬁed, located, and characterized,
     geochemical samples should be taken of representative ﬂuids, steam, and/or gases
     (Giggenbach and Goguel, 1989). The sampled ﬂuids should be properly preserved
     and analyzed for silica, cations, anions, and isotopes in water and sulfate. When
     numerous geothermal manifestations exist in an area, those with the highest discharge
     temperatures and electrical conductivities should be given priority for sampling (if all
     cannot be sampled). If there are multiple features with comparable temperatures and
     electrical conductivity (EC) values, the features with the highest ﬂow rates are the
     most important for sampling. If ﬁeld measurements of temperature and conductivity
     (and chloride content, which is sometimes measured in the ﬁeld) suggest that the
     manifestations may be mixtures of hotter and colder water bodies, a range of samples
     should be selected to assist in understanding how the thermal ﬂuid is mixing with other
     water components (D’Amore and Panichi, 1985).
                                                                                          71




If no thermal manifestations are located in the area, then springs or wells with elevated
EC levels, gas bubbles, unusual odors, or tastes should be sampled. These attributes are
sometimes the result of an input of thermal ﬂuids, although not in all cases. For example,
EC can vary due to the host rock type. Therefore, an appropriate method is needed
to determine what constitutes “elevated” EC levels. One such method is to analyze
numerous non-thermal water sources in the area to establish an average “baseline” EC
for the area. Any spring water with the EC just one standard deviation or more above the
average would be considered to have an elevated EC level. Note that close proximity to
the coast can complicate measurement and interpretation of EC data.

A laboratory with experience in analyzing geothermal ﬂuids should carry out all analyses.
A typical suite of elements and species should include Na, K, Ca, Mg, Li, Cl, B, SO42-, NH3,
TDS, pH, alkalinity as HCO3 and CO3 and total alkalinity as HCO3, and SiO2 (measured in
diluted sample, corrected to native concentration). In addition, Sr, Rb, Mn, F-, 18O and D
stable isotopes in water and 18O in dissolved SO42- are extremely useful.

Checking the quality of all analyses is important. A cation-anion balance (CBE) is typically
used where

        CBE (%) = [( Σz x mc - Σz x ma ) / (Σz x mc + Σz x ma )] * 100

And where

 • mc is the molality (moles per kilogram) of cation;
 • ma is the molality (moles per kilogram) of anion; and
 • z is the ionic charge (Coulomb).

For good quality analyses, the CBE should be less than 5 percent.

The completed analyses should be compiled into a spreadsheet or entered into a
database prior to interpretation using chemical geothermometers, mixing models and
possible speciation calculations, which are described below.

4.3.3.4. Assumptions and Applications of Chemical
Geothermometers
Chemical geothermometers were ﬁrst proposed in the 1960s, arising from water-rock
interaction studies. Various approaches have been tried, including empirical experimental
results (Hemley, 1967), theoretical thermodynamic calculations (Helgeson, 1969), and
ﬁeld studies associated with the early exploration of New Zealand’s geothermal ﬁelds
(Browne and Ellis, 1970). A basic assumption for all ﬂuid and gas geothermometer
calculations is that equilibrium conditions exist within the geothermal reservoir
(Giggenbach, 1980. 1981). Other assumptions are as follows:

 • Water pH is controlled by salinity and aluminosilicate equilibriums involving hydrogen
   and alkali metal ions.
 • Calcium and bicarbonate ion concentrations are related to pH.
 • Carbon dioxide content is controlled by solubility product and ionization constant
   relationships.
 • Magnesium concentrations are controlled at low levels by silicate equilibriums
   (chlorites and smectites).
 • Cation concentrations in solution are controlled by temperature-dependent reactions
   between clays, feldspars, and other minerals.
72   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




     Silica Geothermometers

     Fournier (1992) reported on numerous experimental studies of silica solubility, which
     formed the basis of several silica geothermometer equations. These are listed below,
     where T is the calculated equilibrium reservoir temperature (in degrees Celcius), and S is
     the silica concentration in parts per million (ppm):

     Quartz (no steam loss)                           T = 1,309/(5.19-log10S) - 273.15
     Quartz (Maximum steam loss @100oC)               T= 1,522/(5.75-log10S) - 273.15
     Chalcedony                                       T= 1,032/(4.69-log10S) - 273.15
     α-Cristobalite                                   T= 1,000/(4.78-log10S) - 273.15
     Opal-CT                                          T= 781/ (4.51-log10S) - 273.15
     Amorphous silica                                 T= 731/(4.52-log10S) - 273.15

     Cation geothermometers

     The literature contains a large number of cation geothermometers published by many
     different researchers. D’Amore (1992) and Giggenbach (1992) reviewed many that were
     available at the time. All have been determined from empirical relationships between
     reservoir temperatures and chemical analyses of liquids and gases over a range of
     geothermal systems. The number of published equations for cation geothermometry is
     too large to list them all here. However, as an example, the equation for calculating the
     sodium potassium geothermometer (using cation concentrations in parts per million) of
     Fournier and Potter (1979) is:

     T = 1,217 / [1.699+log10(Na/K)] - 273.19

     Another commonly used cation geothermometer is the Na-K.Ca geothermometer of
     Fournier and Truesdell (1973) which is widely used and has frequently provided excellent
     agreement with measured reservoir temperatures.

     Isotope geothermometers

     Gerardo-Abaya et al. (2000) reviewed a number of published multicomponent isotope
     geothermometers. These generally require more elaborate testing equipment and
     procedures, and are not discussed any further here.

     4.3.3.5. Selection of Appropriate Geothermometers
     The response rates of ﬂuid and gas geothermometers to changes in temperature varies
     greatly. Geothermometers also respond differently to interactions between various rock
     types and different reservoir conditions (Giggenbach, 1992). Silica geothermometers
     respond relatively quickly but can be invalidated due to mixing and dilution with near
     surface non-geothermal waters (groundwater). Cation geothermometers respond
     more slowly and, since they are based on ratios, they are less affected by dilution.
     The cation geothermometers often provide more reliable estimates of deep reservoir
     temperatures. As a generalization, hot springs having the highest ﬂow rates and the
     highest temperatures tend to give the most useful and reliable data from chemical
     geothermometry. However, all discharging springs with ﬂow rates of great that 1 liter/sec
     should be sampled and analyzed.
                                                                                                             73




                       It is recommended that the geochemist calculate a broad range of geothermometers as a
                       set (Powell and Cumming, 2010). Silica, cation, and isotope geothermometers should be
                       calculated and compiled in a table in which the various results can be compared against
                       each other. Based on assessing the chemical geothermometers against geological and
                       mineralogical well information and other geoscientiﬁc data, the geochemist then selects
                       what he/she considers to be the most appropriate geothermometer temperatures.

                       4.3.3.6. Use of Triangular Diagrams and Chemical Ratios to
                       Develop Mixing Models
                       Chemical parameters (including isotopes) can be plotted against each other in a variety
                       of ways to assess the characteristics of the geothermal ﬂuids. Figure 4.11 through to
                       Figure 4.17illustrate a range of plots on which geochemical data can be displayed to
                       develop mixing models, identify end members such as groundwater and reservoir ﬂuid
                       compositions, and thereby build an understanding of the evolution of ﬂuid compositions
                       in a geothermal system. Such plots can answer questions like whether mixing, boiling
                       and/or dilution is taking place within a system. Publications by Harper and Arevelo
                       (1982) on the Baslay-Dauin prospect in the Philippines and by Lovelock et al. (1982) on
                       the Tongonan Geothermal Field also in the Philippines provide useful case studies that
                       include some integration of geochemical data with geological and geophysical data.

                      4.3.3.7. Geochemical Modeling Software
                      Although more extensively used during Phases 3 and 4 of a geothermal project, very
                      sophisticated geochemical modeling software is available, which is worth noting. Such
                      software can model the down hole concentrations of chemical components and speciation
                      in geothermal ﬂuids. For example, Arnorsson et al. (1982), building on the earlier work of
                      Truesdell and Singers (1971), developed the WATCH geochemical software. With inputs
                      of well chemistry data, WATCH and other programs can simulate a range of reservoir
                      processes including scaling, cooling, boiling, and mixing of reservoir ﬂuids.

                      Another commonly used geochemical exploration technique is to survey for CO2 soil
                      ﬂux and/or mercury (Hg) in soil. Geothermal systems contain non-condensable gases,
                      the principal component of which is CO2, and often have elevated mercury levels.
                      Therefore, soil sampling surveys (Figure 4.18) are designed to locate anomalously high
                      concentrations of CO2 and/or mercury that could indicate a potential geothermal system at
                      depth.

                      Increased CO2 ﬂux occurs near many active geothermal manifestations, and CO2 ﬂux can
                      suggest a geothermal system at depth. Surveys on CO2 soil ﬂux surveys are performed
                      with a portable meter that measures the active ﬂux of CO2 through the soil. While CO2 soil
                      ﬂux surveys can show the presence of active geothermal manifestations and structures,
                      such as faults that may be conducting geothermally derived gases toward the surface
                      (Harvey et al., 2011), these surveys rarely provide signiﬁcant geologic or geochemical
                      insight. However, they can often conﬁrm the results of other methods (notably geologic
                      mapping) and are reasonably cost-effective.

     Mercury surveys are performed by taking small soil samples and analyzing them in
     a portable mercury detector. While this method can resolve very small differences in
     mercury concentration, there are many sources of mercury aside from active geothermal
     systems, which tends to cloud the results. Extinct hydrothermal systems can still have
     mercury associated with them millions of years after activity has ceased. In addition, there
     are numerous anthropogenic sources, such as improper disposal of mercury-bearing
     items (thermometers, refrigerators, etc.), and industrial processes such as manufacturing
     or mining that lead to the disposal of ﬂuids with elevated mercury. To the extent that the
     history of a site is known, this may help in the interpretation of soil mercury survey data.

     Radon detection methods and studies of radon isotopes may also be useful in identifying
     active faults or surface activity (Kreuger, 1979).

     4.3.3.9. Summary of Geochemical Data
     Fluid and gas geochemical data are presented on maps, tables, drawings, and plots for
     the project area. Accompanying reports should explain the inferences and conclusions
     drawn from the data. Inferences and conclusions may include the following:

      • Estimated reservoir temperature at depth
      • Genesis (origin) of the geothermal ﬂuids
      • Locations of different aquifers or reservoirs in two or three dimensions
      • Mixing between aquifers
      • Sources of recharge to the geothermal system
      • Pathways of discharge from the geothermal system
      • Potential for corrosion and/or scaling by the geothermal ﬂuids
      The following should be provided as a minimum for each project area, if appropriate
        data are available:
      • Map of sample locations showing the local or assigned names of the geothermal
        features from which the samples were taken
      • Table summarizing the ﬂuid geochemistry of the sampled geothermal features keyed
        to the map and including ﬁeld parameters (location, temperature, EC, pH, ﬂow rate,
        gas bubbles, odors, precipitates)
      • Table summarizing the gas geochemistry of the sampled geothermal features keyed to
        the map and including
        - Field parameters, including location, temperature, ﬂow rate, odors
        - Geochemical analyses of the following at minimum: NH3, H2S, CO2, CH4, H2, N2, Ar,
          He, SO2, HCl, HF, O2. In addition, 3He/4He, 40Ar/36Ar, noble gas concentrations and
          ratios, and stable isotopes in steam condensate – all very valuable in assessing the
          system’s geochemistry; should include standard deviation of each sample and/or
          other evidence of quality control on analyses undertaken
        - Total ﬂux and makeup of non-condensable gases for any well in production
      • Table showing geothermometry calculation results; should include these
        geothermometers that can be calculated for a given sample: silica (quartz, chalcedony,
        and amorphous glass); cation (Na-K-Ca, Na-K-Ca-Mg, Na/K, K-Mg); and sulfate water
        isotope (18O).

                           - Potassium concentration versus sodium concentration: K(mg/L) vs. Na(mg/L)
                           - Delta deuterium versus Delta oxygen-18 (δD vs. δ18O)
                           - A ternary plot of the major anions (SO4-HCO3-Cl)
                           - A ternary plot of sodium, potassium and magnesium, including scales for the Na/K

                           - Giggenbach gas ratio grids (H2/Ar vs. CO2/Ar, H2/Ar vs. T, CH4/ CO2 vs. CO/ CO2,
                             CO/ CO2 vs. H2/Ar)
                         • Contour maps showing sample points and their values appropriate to depict soil
                           survey data, as well as tables including locations, values, and characteristics of the
                           sample points

                       A good outcome of the geochemistry studies would be an indication of temperature
                       distribution within the geothermal system, a maximum temperature range for the
                       reservoir, a ﬂuid-mixing model, and the identiﬁcation of uncertainties and data gaps that
                       need to be addressed in the subsequent stages of exploration.


                       4.3.4. Geophysics
                       The term geophysics refers to the measurement of a range of physical parameters that
                       vary in response to variations in the physical properties of the earth. Geophysical surveys
                       (Figure 4.19) are indispensable tools in geothermal exploration (Wright et al., 1985).
                       They allow us to infer relevant rock and ﬂuid properties and the existence and geometry
                       of reservoirs and permeability pathways, with reasonable conﬁdence prior to drilling.
                       Deciding which geophysical techniques are the most appropriate and cost-effective in
                       any speciﬁc exploration program requires input from experienced geothermal scientists.
                       As for the overall exploration strategy, the selection of adequate geophysical methods will
                       mainly depend on the type of geothermal play under investigation (Chapter 2).

               There are many types of geophysical surveys from which to choose. Each responds to a
               speciﬁc property of the earth or to similar properties at different time and space scales.
               They include gravity and magnetic surveys and electrical and electromagnetic resistivity
               surveys, particularly magnetotelluric (MT) or controlled source electromagnetic (CSEM),
               but there are also several others, along with active and passive seismic techniques. Table
               4.3lists these and others. Note that heat ﬂow surveys (also referred to as temperature
               gradient drilling) are also included as a geophysical exploration method, distinguishing
               the relatively shallow temperature gradient drilling activity from the later Test Drilling
               Phase that targets the predicted reservoir zones.

               Quality results from a geophysical survey depend on many factors:

                •   Quality and suitability of the equipment
                •   Appropriate survey parameters
                •   Proper operation of the equipment in ﬁeld
                •   Quality control (QC) of collected data
                •   Appropriate data processing and interpretation
                •   Understanding of noise sources

               For this reason, an experienced geophysicist should be involved in all stages of a
               geophysical survey. Important tasks for the geophysicist are as follows:

                •   Evaluation of preexisting data
                •   Reprocessing of purchased data
                •   Deﬁning objectives of the measurements
                •   Choosing appropriate method(s)
                •   Overseeing the tendering process for a contractor
                •   Verifying proposals
                •   Survey planningQC
                •   Fieldwork QC
                •   Data QC
                •   Data processing and interpretation QC

               4.3.4.1. Gravimetric Surveys
               Gravimetric (or gravity) surveys are relatively simple to implement and map small
               variations in the force of gravitational attraction of the earth. These small variations are
               due primarily to bulk density variations of the rock sequence beneath the survey site. The
               careful design and implementation of a gravity survey can make the difference between a
               highly successful interpretation tool and a waste of resources.
                                                                                                                   81




                        A gravity survey involves measuring the earth’s gravitational ﬁeld at speciﬁc locations
                        on the earth’s surface (or along a ﬂight path during airborne gravity surveys) to detect
                        the locations of subsurface rock density variations. Most of the instruments (Figure
                        4.20) for gravitational ﬁeld surveys (e.g. LaCoste and Romberg, Scintrex, Worden) are
                        spring based, with the local strength of the gravitational ﬁeld deduced by measuring
                        the amount by which a constant mass stretches a spring (Figure 4.21). High precision
                        superconducting gravimeters are an available alternative for ﬁeld use (Sugihara and
                        Nawa, 2012).

                   Gravitational attraction is sensitive to the precise distance from the center of the earth’s
                   mass, so the location and precise elevation (centimeter accuracy) are two of the most
                   important factors to record during a gravity survey. This is normally achieved using a
                   differential GPS (DGPS). Table 4.4lists other factors to record.

                   Survey parameters such as the number of stations and station spacing should be
                   decided according to the size, depth, and relative density of the bodies and structures
                   being sought. For quality control, measurements at one or more survey stations should
                   be repeated several times to conﬁrm results. After the ﬁeldwork is completed, several
                   corrections must be applied to the gravity data during processing to produce a ﬁnal
                   result called a Bougueranomaly map or simply a Bouguermap. The usual sequence of
                   corrections is as follows:

                    • International gravity formula corrects for the variation of gravity with latitude.
                    • Free air correction corrects for the elevation at which a measurement is made;it
                      adjusts readings of gravity to what would have been measured at sea level if the
                      intervening elevation were composed entirely of air.
                    • The Bouguer correction accounts for the attraction of the terrain; Bouguer reduction
                      is called simple or incomplete, if the terrain is approximated by an inﬁnite ﬂat plate
                      (called a Bouguer plate).
                    • Terrain reduction (complete Bouguer correction) accounts for the effects of terrain
                      more precisely.
                    • Bouguer anomaly map/Bouguer map is the result of gridding or contouring all data
                      points after the above corrections are applied.

                   Figure 4.22 shows an example of a Bouguer map plotted over a topographic map of a
                   caldera in New Zealand, characterized by a low gravity anomaly in the center of the map.
                   The interpretation of a Bouguer map on its own is limited by the inherent ambiguity
                   of gravitational ﬁelds. A small density anomaly at a shallow depth can produce the
                   same gravitational effect as a large density anomaly at greater depth. Either depth
                   or composition must be constrained by independent data (e.g., depth estimates from
                                                                                                                  83

                       the spatial resolution of geological interpretations from gravity and magnetics (see below)
                       is insufﬁcient to map permeable structures like smaller faults or structurally weak zones.

                       A gravity survey should only be considered as part of a new exploration program if
                       underground structures are expected to result in detectable lateral and vertical density
                       contrasts. To properly assess this possibility requires some preexisting knowledge of the
                       subsurface, including the expected lithologies, the depths at which they are expected
                       to lie, and the geometrical relationships between them. A general rule of thumb is that a
                       body must be almost as big as it is deep in order to be detectable with a gravity survey.
                       The distances between stations must also be small enough to resolve any surface
                       anomaly produced by the subsurface body.

                       A good outcome of a gravity survey is a reliable Bouguer map, revealing variations in
                       the gravitational ﬁeld strength that can be related to the geological structures relevant to
                       geothermal exploration, including geometry and depth of signiﬁcant rock units or faults.
                       Variations of gravity surveys such as “airborne gravity gradiometry” or “microgravity
                       surveys” provide similar data at different spatial scales.

                     4.3.4.2. Geomagnetic Surveys
                     Geomagnetic (or magnetic) surveys are also relatively inexpensive and simple to
                     implement. Spatial variations in the magnetic properties (such as remnant magnetization,
                     magnetic susceptibility, and magnetic permeability) of near surface rocks cause local
                     variations in the strength and/or direction of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld. Geomagnetic
                     surveys map these variations and highlight anomalies. The main magnetic components of
                     rocks are the minerals magnetite (Fe3O4) and maghemite (Fe2O3). Most of the variation
                     in the measured magnetic ﬁeld can be attributed to different concentrations of these
                     minerals in the near surface. For example, the impact of basaltic rocks on the earth’s
                     magnetic ﬁeld is signiﬁcantly higher than that of granitic rocks.

                     In many liquid-dominated geothermal ﬁelds, hydrothermal processes alter magnetic rocks
                     to mostly nonmagnetic minerals. Such processes cause volcanic rocks to become partly
                     or completely demagnetized, and a signiﬁcant magnetization contrast then exists between
                     the reservoir rocks and the unaltered volcanic rocks beyond the reservoir (Soengkono
                     and Hochstein, 1995). Another application of magnetic surveys to geothermal exploration
                     involves identifying the depth of the curie point or curie temperature (Bhattacharyya and
                     Leu, 1975). At the curie point, materials change from ferromagnetic to paramagnetic.
                     Estimating the depth to this point provides an estimate of average thermal gradient
                     (Salem et al., 2000).

                     Application of the magnetic method involves measuring the total ﬁeld strength (and
                     possibly inclination and declination) of the earth’s magnetic ﬁeld at speciﬁc locations or
                     along a line on the earth’s surface (Figure 4.23). As for gravity surveys, robust design of a
                     magnetic survey can prevent a waste of resources and yield optimum interpretable data.
                     Surveys can be performed on foot or using piloted aircraft or unmanned aircraft systems
                     (UAS) along a ﬂight path. The aim is to determine the location of subsurface magnetic
                     susceptibility and magnetization variations.

                     The magnetic ﬁeld strength at the earth’s surface generally drifts over the period of a
                     typical magnetic survey, due to atmospheric effects (or spherics). A static base station is
                     used to correct for this drift by collecting ﬁeld strength measurements at regular intervals
                     at the same location in order to quantify the drift over time. Raw data from the survey
                     are then corrected relative to the base station record. Airborne magnetic data must
                     additionally be corrected for heading and level (Green, 1983). In general, the distance
                     between individual data points must be small enough to resolve the target.

                     The magnetic susceptibility of key lithologies is an important input parameter to reliably
                     model the results of a magnetic survey, and therefore should be measured. Field Kappa
                     meters can be used to make susceptibility measurements onsite. Alternatively, rock
                     samples can be collected to measure susceptibility and determine the magnitude and
                     direction of remnant magnetism in the laboratory.

                        The measured value of magnetometers is the total ﬁeld intensity or tesla (T) in units of
                        nanotesla (nT). Before interpretation of geomagnetic data, all contributions to the total
                        ﬁeld not originating from geological sources have to be subtracted from the measured
                        values where

                        ΔT = Magnetic Anomaly = T - TV - TA -TR - T0
                        and where

                             •   T = measured value;
                             •   TV = diurnal variation;
                             •   TA = altitude correction;
                             •   TR = terrain correction; and
                             •   T0 = normal ﬁeld.

                        The results can then be gridded or contoured and plotted as a magnetic anomaly map
                        (Figure 4.24). Table 4.5lists parameters that should be recorded during a magnetic
                        survey.

                   A geomagnetic survey will only provide useful information for geothermal exploration if
                   there is an expected detectable contrast in magnetic susceptibility and/or magnetization
                   in the underground layers or structures. To distinguish between anomalous and
                   undisturbed magnetic areas, the size of the survey area has to exceed the size of the
                   expected anomaly.

                   A good outcome of a geomagnetic survey is a reliable magnetic anomaly map, revealing
                   variations in magnetic properties that can be related to the geological structures
                   relevant to geothermal exploration, including geometry and depth of intrusions, dikes,
                   etc. Geomagnetic surveys are most appropriate for constraining the “big picture” of the
                   underground.

                         4.3.4.3. Magnetotelluric Surveys
                         The magnetotelluric (MT) method responds to the earth’s electrical resistivity structure
                         (Simpson and Bahr, 2005). The method involves taking a time series recording of
                         natural, low frequency, orthogonal electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the earth’s surface, then
                         interpreting the data in the frequency domain. Natural ﬂuctuations in the earth’s magnetic
                         ﬁeld are generated by lightning, ionospheric resonances or variations in the solar wind.
                         These ﬂuctuations induce electric currents (or telluric currents) beneath the surface of the
                         earth. The ratio of the electric ﬁeld to the magnetic ﬁeld in the induced electromagnetic
                         (EM) wave is a function of the frequency of the signal and the bulk electrical resistivity
                         of the ground. Lower frequency magnetic ﬂuctuations induce currents through a greater
                         thickness of ground (Figure 4.25). Recording data over a wide frequency spectrum
                         effectively gives information about a great thickness of ground. Lower frequency records
                         (i.e., information about greater depths) require longer collection times.

                         The MT method is one of the very few geophysical techniques that can provide
                         information about rock units deeper than about 1,000 meters. This makes it useful for
                         geothermal exploration, where target depths are typically in the range of 1,000-3,000
                         meters for convection-dominated geothermal plays and even deeper for conduction-
                         dominated plays. The MT method is particularly useful for convection-dominated plays
                         because it can potentially image low resistivity and low permeability smectite clay units
                         that often cap high enthalpy geothermal reservoirs (Melosh et al., 2010). For this reason,
                         the MT method is often used to reduce uncertainties about reservoir depth, geometry, and
                         areal extent.

                         During an MT survey the horizontal electric and magnetic ﬁelds at the earth’s surface
                         are measured using electrodes and magnetometers buried in the ground (Figure 4.26,
                         left-hand side). The non-polarizing electrodes often contain solutions of copper sulfate or
                         cadmium chlorate. Metal electrodes can be used, but electric ﬁeld data quality can be low
                         since they generate electrical noise as they corrode. The magnetometers are induction
                         coils for frequencies above 0.01 Hz and ﬂuxgate magnetometers for lower frequencies.
                         Figure 4.26 shows examples of coil preparation, storage, and data acquisition in the ﬁeld.

                     Recorded MT data are processed and represented as a complex impedance tensor
                     relating the electric and magnetic ﬁeld values and expressed as the apparent resistivity
                     and impedance phase (Vozoff, 1986). Interpretation involves estimating the shallow
                     resistivity structure using the higher frequency information, then deriving progressively
                     deeper resistivity structure from the longer wavelength bulk resistivity information and
                     the shallow resistivity estimates. By its nature, MT interpretations become less precise at
                     greater depths.

                     MT surveys can be performed at a regional scale. In these cases, the station spacing
                     may be less than one per square kilometer. It is usually more cost effective to identify a
                     prospective area with other methods and then conduct an MT survey with relatively high
                     station spatial density in that area, with perhaps as many as 10 to 15 stations per square
                     kilometer.

                     Carrying out a time domain electromagnetic (TDEM) survey (see below) covering the
                     same MT station locations (Wameyo, 2005) is a good practice in order to apply a “static
                     shift correction” to the MT data for more robust interpretations (Irfan et al., 2010). The
                     TDEM survey effectively provides high frequency electromagnetic information that the
                     MT survey is unable to record. This allows greater resolution of the resistivity structure
                     at shallow depths (typically a few hundred meters), hence improving the structure’s
                     interpretation at greater depth from the MT data.

                     Unaltered volcanic rock generally has high electrical resistivity. Hydrothermal ﬂuids tend
                     to reduce the resistivity of volcanic rocks in three ways:

                      • By altering the rocks to clay
                      • By increasing the salinity of the ﬂuids in the rocks
                      • By increasing the temperature of the rocks

                     Hydrothermal alteration has a dominant effect on resistivity in high enthalpy reservoirs.
                     In volcanic areas, acid-sulfate water can interact with the surrounding volcanic rocks
                     to produce different alteration products depending on the temperature and hence on
                     the distance from the heat source. With basalt as the surrounding rock, low-resistivity
                     smectite becomes the dominant alteration product in the temperature range from 100°C
                     to 180°C. At higher temperatures mixed layer clays are produced (Figure 4.27).

                         Magnetotelluric data are normally interpreted through an “inversion” process, whereby a
                         semi-automated algorithm determines the simplest and most likely “apparent resistivity”
                         structure consistent with the collected data. Inversions can also be carried out in 1D, 2D
                         or 3D, referring both to the spatial distribution of recording stations and the dimensions
                         of the model simultaneously solved. A 1D inversion produces a vertical “sounding” from
                         a single station; a 2D inversion, a proﬁle from a line of stations; and a 3D inversion, a self-
                         consistent block model from an array of stations (Siripunvaraporn et al., 2005). Higher
                         dimension inversions require signiﬁcantly greater computing power and time to complete.

                         Inversions might be carried out by the MT contractor or by an independent third party.
                         Inversion algorithms typically need to be constrained in some way, usually through
                         limiting the allowable number of discrete layers and/or the depths between layers. For
                         this reason, inversion results are subjective because they depend on input from the data
                         processer. The results from 1D, 2D and 3D inversions can differ signiﬁcantly from each
                         other for the same set of data, because the models depend on the dimensionality and

                   A phenomenon called magnetotelluric polarization is of particular and growing interest
                   for geothermal exploration as it has the potential (when interpreted jointly with other data
                   sets) to reveal the dominant orientation of fractures (e.g., Onacha et al., 2010). Joints or
                   fractures lying in a preferred orientation and ﬁlled with conductive brine tend to conduct
                   electricity more efﬁciently (i.e., lower resistivity) parallel to their strike, compared to
                   perpendicular. If the electrical and magnetic ﬁelds are each recorded along perpendicular
                   axes, then deriving a resistivity tensor is possible in describing how the electrical
                   resistivity varies with direction. A preferred direction of higher apparent resistivity within
                   a particular depth interval might be interpreted as being perpendicular to a dominant
                   fracture orientation. The evidence becomes more compelling when combined with other
                   directionally sensitive techniques such as “seismic shear-wave splitting” (see below).

                   A good outcome from an MT survey is a 3D apparent resistivity block model derived
                   from stacked 1D or 2D inversions (incorporating static shift corrections from a TDEM
                   survey), or a full 3D inversion. The inversion model should suggest regions of contrasting
                   electrical resistivity consistent with the conceptual model of the geothermal system.

                            4.3.4.4. Controlled Source Electromagnetic Surveys
                            Controlled source electromagnetics (CSEM) is the general term for electromagnetic
                            sounding methods that use an active transmitter and antenna to generate their own
                            electromagnetic source ﬁelds with known properties. For frequency domain methods
                            (FDEM), the transmitter generates a sinusoidal electromagnetic wave at a ﬁxed
                            frequency that is selected for the desired depth of exploration (lower frequencies for
                            greater depths; higher frequencies for shallower depths). Some CSEM methods operate
                            in the time domain (TDEM methods) by recording the decay over time of a secondary
                            electromagnetic ﬁeld induced by a ﬁnite electromagnetic pulse. The main advantage of
                            CSEM methods over the MT method, which utilizes natural electromagnetic sources,
                            is that CSEM data acquisition is faster. However, the depth of imaging for CSEM is
                            generally shallower than that for MT.

                            A huge variety of CSEM methods have been developed, distinguished mainly by the
                            frequency (or frequencies) at which they transmit and detect electromagnetic waves
                            and in the geometry of their source and receiver antennae (Figure 4.31). The primary
                            electromagnetic ﬁelds are generated by electrical current waveforms passed through a
                            loop (Árnason, 1989) or grounded dipole (Figure 4.32). Those primary ﬁelds generate
                            eddy currents in the ground, which induce secondary electromagnetic ﬁelds that can be
                            measured at the surface using a receiver coil or receiver electrodes. The properties of the
                            induced ﬁeld depend on the electrical resistivity distribution of the subsurface rocks.

                          Data from FDEM surveys are normally processed to reveal the amplitude and phase
                          of the induced ﬁeld (relative to the primary ﬁeld) after compensating for the primary
                          ﬁeld. Data are further processed to derive apparent resistivity with depth. In most
                          TDEM instruments, the current is transmitted as a periodic square wave. The induced
                          electromagnetic ﬁeld is recorded at the receiver stations during the transmitter off time,
                          in absence of the primary ﬁeld. After processing, the data are represented as apparent
                          resistivity – depth curves, proﬁles (Figure 4.33) or maps. Modeling and inversion can be
                          carried out in 1D, 2D or 3D.

                          The penetration depth of an induced electromagnetic wave depends on the signal
                          strength (current or voltage), the distance between transmitter and receiver (meters to
                          kilometers), and the frequency of the transmitted wave (lower frequencies penetrate
                          deeper). The transmitter-receiver distance is approximately equivalent to the maximum
                          depth of exploration, which good survey design should reﬂect. The best practice is
                          to record multiple receiver measurements relative to the same transmitter station to
                          enhance signal-to-noise ratio at all depths.

                          Working in areas with steep changes in topography creates challenges in laying out
                          antennae wires, as well as in processing and interpreting the collected data.

                          The parameters that should be recorded during a CSEM survey are similar to those
                          collected during an MT survey, and are listed in Table 4.7.

                   4.3.4.5. Electrical Resistivity (Direct Current)
                   Direct current (DC) soundings also image the vertical apparent resistivity distribution of
                   the subsurface. The resistivity of soils and rocks is governed primarily by the amount of
                   pore water and its resistivity. DC soundings are based on the principle that the electrical
                   ﬁeld produced in the ground around a current-carrying electrode is a function of the
                   distribution of electrical resistivity of the surrounding soils and rocks. The usual practice is
                   to generate an electric current in the ground between two electrodes (current electrodes)
                   and to measure the resulting difference in electrical potential (voltage) between two
                   other electrodes (potential sondes) not connected to an active current. Surveys
                   can be designed to generate 1D soundings or 2D proﬁles. Many different electrode
                   conﬁgurations have been applied, including the dipole-dipole array, Schlumberger array,
                   Wenner array, pole-pole array, and others. In an example of a four-electrode DC dipole-
                   dipole array (Figure 4.34), there are two electrodes (C1 and C2) and two potential sondes
                   (P1 and P2). A series of electrode (current and potential) station locations (Numbers 1-9)
                   is separated by a ﬁxed distance (a). The separation between dipoles is always a multiple
                   (n) of the ﬁxed distance (a).

                   The exact array parameters need to be accurately known before a reliable inversion
                   (Figure 4.36) can be performed.

                   The parameters to be recorded and reported for a DC survey are mostly the same as for
                   a CSEM or MT survey.

                   4.3.4.6. Self-Potential Methods
                   There are two standard designs for a self-potential (SP) survey. In one design, electrodes
                   are separated by a constant distance (Figure 4.36, bottom), commonly 5 or 10 meters,
                   and both electrodes move to a new location for each measurement. Alternatively,
                   voltages can be measured across the survey area relative to a ﬁxed base, in which case
                   one electrode remains in a constant location while the second electrode is moved around
                   (Figure 4.37, top). Figure 4.37shows an example of SP mapping.

                   The SP survey is a relatively low-cost method (Ross et al., 1995), but the results can be
                   difﬁcult to interpret. The SP survey is often used for reconnaissance surveys, mapping
                   major boundaries or tracing faults. In Japan, the method has also been used to monitor
                   geothermal reservoirs, especially for liquid-dominated geothermal systems (Yasukawa et
                   al., 2005).

                     4.3.4.7. Seismic Surveys
                     Seismic surveys are sensitive to differences in the “acoustic impedance” (the product
                     of density and seismic velocity of rocks). Seismic waves propagate and interact
                     with subsurface structures, with part of the seismic signal typically reﬂecting and the
                     remainder of the signal refracting at each rock contact. The surveys can yield important
                     information on the location and orientation of subsurface structures, such as faults and
                     rock discontinuities, which may help to explain ﬂuid ﬂow.

                     Seismic surveys can be divided into two subcategories based on the source of the
                     seismic signal. Reﬂection surveys rely on using induced or man-made vibrations or single
                     sources (e.g., explosive source) at the surface. Passive surveys, however, rely on natural
                     tremors or earthquakes, volcanic eruptions, or other tectonic activity as sources.

                     Seismic Reﬂection Surveys

                     A seismic reﬂection survey is an “active” technique that images boundaries between rock
                     layers of different acoustic impedance and requires a controlled source of seismic energy,
                     such as seismic vibrators (commonly known as vibroseis), dynamite explosives, or air
                     guns for marine surveys. The general principle of seismic reﬂection is to send elastic
                     waves from the source into the underground, where each layer reﬂects a part of the
                     wave’s energy and allows the rest to refract through. The reﬂected wave ﬁeld is recorded
                     at the surface by a number of seismic receivers (geophones) that sense the motion of
                     the ground in which they are placed (Figure 4.38). Surveys can be designed to image the
                     underground along a proﬁle (2D survey) or within a volume (3D survey).

                     Reﬂection seismology is one of the more expensive geophysical methods and requires
                     considerable permitting efforts, extensive ﬁeld logistics, and complex data processing.
                     Surveys to collect 3D data can require crews of hundreds of workers depending on the
                     survey size.

                          A seismic survey begins by obtaining all necessary permitsmonths in advance of ﬁeld
                          activities. The permits might include compensation for expected damages to land, roads,
                          pipes, buildings, or other infrastructure caused by the heavy machinery of the survey
                          equipment. The next step before measurements begin is mobilizing the equipment
                          and the seismic crew and setting up the ﬁeld camp, ofﬁces, and workshops. During a
                          topographic survey, the coordinates of all seismic stations are recorded. The acquisition
                          of seismic data is the next step, which also includes real-time quality control and
                          possibly re-measuring the stations. Processing of data is completed offsite in specialized
                          processing centers during or after acquisition. Demobilization includes the removal of all
                          equipment, rehabilitation of the survey area, and the departure of the seismic crew. Post-
                          survey data processing can take months, as can the subsequent interpretation of the
                          processed data.

                          The design of a seismic reﬂection survey must consider such things as the distance
                          between the shot point and geophones, line distance, source/receiver parameters,
                          survey size, coverage, receiver patch, sampling rate, recording time and bin-size. All
                          these parameters should be evaluated before the survey, or even before tendering
                          for the contractor. The choice of survey parameters depends greatly on the depth and
                          characteristics of the geological target. Most of the parameters can be ‘ﬁne-tuned’ once
                          a survey starts. Some typical layout parameters for 2D and 3D seismic reﬂection surveys
                          are shown in Figure 4.39 and Figure 4.40.

                     Seismic data require more detailed processing (Figure 4.41) and interpretation than
                     most other geophysical methods. An important element of seismic processing is
                     the development of a seismic velocity model based on known or inferred geological
                     conditions. The velocity model allows the processed data to be converted from their “two-
                     way-travel-time” vertical scale to a more physically meaningful and useful “true depth”
                     scale. How well a velocity model is constrained depends primarily on the presence or
                     absence of deep wells to which the seismic data may be tied in the survey area.

                     A complementary seismic ﬁeld technique is called vertical seismic proﬁling (VSP),
                     referring to measurements made using geophones inside a well and a seismic source
                     (vibrator, explosives) at the surface. One advantage of VSP measurements is that depths
                     and times are known, so the seismic velocity of the rocks is much better constrained than
                     for surface seismics.

                     In general, the accuracy of true depth interpreted from a seismic image depends on the
                     presence of deep wells for reliable velocity information.

                     Processed seismic data are most commonly presented as cross sections or slices
                     (horizontal and vertical) from a seismic cube, with two-way-travel-time converted to true
                     depth using the seismic velocity model and seismic migration techniques. Interpreted
                     sections typically show the most important seismic reﬂectors (i.e., boundaries between
                     rock units with the greatest contrast in sonic impedance) and faults as solid colored lines
                     on top of the actual processed data (Figure 4.42 and Figure 4.43).

                       Seismic reﬂectors (often called horizons), faults, and other geological featuresare
                       handpicked or semi-automatically picked by a geologist during the data interpretation
                       stage. Geophysicists (data processing) and geologists (interpretation) should work hand

                   The applicability of 2D and 3D seismic reﬂection as an exploration tool for geothermal
                   energy depends on the local geology, local cost of deployment, and relative cost of
                   drilling. Seismic reﬂection is most appropriate in sedimentary basins where experienced
                   crews are readily available and the cost of drilling is very high (e.g., target depth is great).
                   Under such conditions, seismic reﬂection can deliver high-resolution images of the
                   subsurface stratigraphy and faults prior to deep drilling. Seismic reﬂection is generally
                   inappropriate in geological regions where seismic energy tends to be highly attenuated
                   (e.g., on thick basalt or thick coal layers), where logistics are too challenging (e.g., on
                   steep, forested terrain), or where the cost of a seismic survey is comparable with the cost
                   of drilling (e.g., where the target reservoir is expected to be relatively shallow).

                   A good outcome of a seismic reﬂection survey is a clear and detailed image of the
                   main geological structures, faults, and stratigraphy beneath the survey region. Seismic
                   reﬂection surveys provide a “detailed picture” of the underground to a depth of several
                   kilometers.
102                    BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




                       Passive Seismic Surveys

                       Passive seismic surveys use natural seismic signals from earthquakes either within the
                       geothermal ﬁeld or from outside. In passive seismics, recorders (seismometers) are
                       placed on the surface of the earth or in shallow boreholes and signals are continuously
                       recorded. The measured seismic components are commonly processed using
                       tomographic techniques in which source positions and velocity distribution are jointly
                       inverted. The result is a 3D picture of the velocity distribution in the subsurface.

                       Compared to reﬂection seismic data, which consists of numerous records collected
                       spatially very close together over a relatively short time, passive seismic surveys must be
                       run for signiﬁcantly longer time to be able to acquire the same amount of data. However,
                       it has some advantages over reﬂection seismology.

                       The method is comparatively inexpensive, even though it requires instrument deployment
                       over long enough periods to record a sufﬁcient number of events for useful analysis. The
                       recording period can be determined from the rate of natural seismic events times the
                       number of stations. Preferably more than 10,000 observations should be recorded, for
                       example, from 1,000 events recorded by more than 10 stations. With modern computer
                       analysis codes, a data set of this size can be analyzed and interpreted in about a month.

                       The seismometer stations record movements on all three axes. This means information
                       about the different seismic wave velocities. The size and depth of possible shallow
                       geothermal ﬂuid pathways can be mapped by analyzing seismic data for reﬂected arrivals
                       and converted waves, gaps, wave attenuation, and variations in wave velocity ratios. In
                       particular, mapping the hypocenters of seismic events in seismically active areas has
                       proved useful for identifying active faults (Simiyu, 2009).

                       Seismic Shear Wave Splitting

                       When seismic waves travel through a layered or fractured rock volume, the shear
                       component of the waves can split (or polarize) into two components traveling with
                       different velocities (Figure 4.44). Full waveform passive seismic data can record these
                       two distinct sets of shear waves. In the context of exploring for geothermal reservoirs,
                       “shear wave splitting” may provide additional value from passive seismic surveys. The
                       degree to which the effect can be observed and the observed arrival time offset, the
                       angular difference between the waves, together with models of the seismic ray paths,
                       might be interpreted to discriminate between zones more and less likely to have high
                       fracture density in a particular orientation, giving indications of potential routes of ﬂuid
                       ﬂow within a geothermal reservoir. High-quality, full waveform seismic data are required.

                       4.3.4.8. Ground Temperature Mapping
                       Ground temperatures at shallow depths can be used to measure the conductive heat
                       ﬂow. Higher levels of conductive heat ﬂow may indicate a shallow sub-surface anomaly.

                       Temperatures within the top 30 meters of the earth’s surface are typically affected by
                       daily and seasonal atmospheric temperature cycles. The magnitude of the effect is
                       directly proportional to the magnitude of the temperature cycle and decays exponentially
                       with depth. At a depth of 1 meter, temperature variations induced by the 24-hour solar
                       irradiation cycle are typically more than 99 perfect damped out (Beardsmore and Cull,
                       2001; pp. 78-79). Variations induced by the season cycle persist to greater depth, but
                       the drift in temperature is slow relative to the typical time taken for a ground temperature
                       survey. Mapping the relative temperature of the ground at a depth of 2 meters can
                       therefore delineate relatively hot areas related to subsurface geothermal features
                       (Coolbaugh et al., 2007) and reduce the number of temperature gradient wells required
                       to delineate thermally anomalous zones. Ground temperature can be measured with
                       portable systems (Figure 4.45) that deploy a temperature sensor at a 2-meter depth using
                       handheld hammer drills.

                       When used in this manner, ground temperature is a proxy measurement for conductive
                       heat ﬂow. High rates of conductive heat loss, resulting in high thermal gradient, can
                       be expected above shallow thermal anomalies, but subsurface anomalies can only be
                       detected if the magnitude of the effect is signiﬁcant with respect to other inﬂuences on
                       shallow ground temperature. These include the following:

                        • Variations in the albedo of the ground, resulting in different amounts of absorption of
                          solar radiation
                        • Variations in the thermal diffusivity of the ground resulting in different depths of
                          penetration of the daily and season temperature cycles
                        • Variations in slope resulting in different angles of incidence of solar radiation
                        • Short-term temperature disturbances from weather events

      Sladek et al. (2012) found that the above factors contribute to ground temperature
      variations on the order of 1°C at a 2-meter depth across a typical survey area, so the
      contribution from a buried thermal anomaly must be signiﬁcantly greater than 1°C in
      order to be clearly detected. Anomalies of that magnitude can only be sustained by
      heat sources shallower than about 100 meters. Ground temperature mapping might, for
      example, provide a useful and cheap method for delineating the subsurface extent of an
      outﬂow zone.

      4.3.4.9. Heat Flow (or Thermal Gradient) Drilling
      Often not appreciated, the temperature distribution within the earth represents a “potential
      ﬁeld” in the same way as do gravitational and magnetic ﬁelds. Delineating variations in
      the shallow temperature ﬁeld can reveal information about the deeper thermal structure
      in the same way that gravity and magnetic surveys reveal information about the deeper
      rocks. A key difference between temperature surveys and gravity/magnetic surveys,
      however, is that boreholes are required to measure the temperature ﬁeld.

      Heat ﬂow (or temperature gradient) drilling provides the most direct insight into the
      temperature distribution within a geothermal system. Heat ﬂow wells are typically
      less than 500 meters deep and have a relatively slim diameter (up to 6 inches or 15
      cm) compared to production wells. The primary objective of such drilling is to obtain
      temperature gradient and rock property information to improve the conﬁdence around
      temperature and depth predictions. Secondary objectives might be to ground-truth
      geophysical survey data or to obtain additional geochemical data.

      Heat ﬂow drilling is not always preferable or possible. Whether it makes sense in a given
      project depends on the expected characteristics of the reservoir, the availability of an
      appropriate drill rig and experienced drillers, and the rock composition in the subsurface.
      Very fractured or unconsolidated shallow rocks can be difﬁcult to drill and complete
      successfully, though this information will also be useful in planning the Test Drilling Phase.

      Such slim holes may be drilled with relatively small drill rigs, commonly truck mounted,
      as are typically used throughout the world for mineral exploration or groundwater drilling.
      Being able to mobilize small, locally available drill rigs may enable valuable subsurface
      data to be obtained at relatively low cost during the Exploration Phase. If such rigs are not
      available locally, then high mobilization costs and time may signiﬁcantly compromise the
      value of such activities.

      Such wells are typically completed in two or three weeks. In some cases, heat ﬂow wells
      are drilled using two rigs: a rotary rig to drill the “top hole” and a coring rig to drill the
      deeper section. This two-rig method can shorten the drilling program and save costs. In
      all cases, the collection of core from the drilled interval can provide valuable information
      (see below) to constrain the conceptual model, but could add signiﬁcant cost to the
      drilling program.
                                                                                          105




Heat ﬂow wells drilled with a rotary rig are typically completed with inner tubing that is
capped on the bottom, and the annular space between the tubing and the wellbore walls
is backﬁlled with gravel or cuttings. Heat ﬂow wells drilled with a coring rig might leave the
coring rods in the hole to form an effective casing. Both types of completion aim to keep
the hole open for logging while reducing the potential for ﬂuid ﬂow into or out of the well.
Restricting the movement of ﬂuid between the well bore and surrounding rock is critical
to ensuring that the temperature measured inside the well reﬂects the actual formation
temperatures of the penetrated rock, rather than being an artifact of internal ﬂow. To
the extent that internal ﬂow within or behind the casing might occur, this needs to be
considered when the borehole temperature data are interpreted.

Because the drilling process itself disturbs the natural temperature, a series of “heat-up”
temperature logs (perhaps 3 or 4 over the course of several weeks) is typically collected
to establish the ﬁnal stabilized temperature. The time-series data can reveal zones of ﬂuid
ﬂow into or out of the borehole, but the stabilized data are used for the main analyses.

Occasionally, a heat ﬂow well might encounter a shallow geothermal reservoir. In
this case, there are opportunities to collect additional information that are useful for
understanding the system. For example, it may be possible to collect ﬂuid samples by
brieﬂy ﬂowing or bailing the well. If the drilling permit does not allow such activities, it
may be possible to conduct a short injection test of the well. Injection test data, together
with the stabilized temperature proﬁle, can be used to estimate the productivity of a full-
diameter well drilled into the reservoir. All subsurface data gathered from the drilling helps
reﬁne the conceptual model of the geothermal system.

The time-series of temperature logs represent the main data set collected from a heat
ﬂow well. Temperature logs should be collected

 • using a specialist temperature logging tool (many commercial tools on the market);
 • during descent from top to bottom of the well (so measured borehole temperatures are
   relatively undisturbed by the passage of the tool itself);
 • at a relatively slow speed (so the tool remains close to thermal equilibrium with the
   well at all times); and
 • at a depth and temperature resolution and accuracy appropriate to delineate
   conductive gradients at the speciﬁc location.
 Best practice includes collecting core samples of the intersected rocks for thermal
   conductivity measurements. Such data allow the temperature logs to be translated into
   conductive heat ﬂow logs to
 • quantify the rate of conductive heat loss over the survey area, which, in conjunction
   with estimates of advective heat loss from surface features, serves as a measure of
   the magnitude of the underlying heat source;
 • delineate conductive zones from zones of convection in the well; and
 • allow extrapolation of temperature at greater depth based on thermodynamic
   principles of heat transfer (so long as the bottom of the well is in a conductive zone).

At a minimum, all temperature logs should be presented graphically with a legend listing
the dates each log was collected. Data are most usefully presented on a separate chart
for each well (Figure 4.46), but can be combined on a single chart to illustrate the regional
variations in temperature proﬁles (Figure 4.47). In all cases, the data should demonstrate
that ﬁnal, stabilized temperatures have been reached.

                        If temperature alone is recorded, then the temperature gradient in the deeper part of each
                        hole can be estimated and used to predict temperatures at depths beyond the maximum
                        well depth, although gradients typically change across lithological boundaries, limiting
                        its use in some play types. If thermal conductivity measurements are also made, then
                        an interpretation of the heat ﬂow proﬁle should also be presented. In a purely conductive
                        setting, conductive heat ﬂow should be relatively constant with depth and provide a ﬁrm
                        basis for temperature prediction beyond the maximum well depth.
                                                                                                                107




                     Temperature data from speciﬁc depths or elevations can be gridded and presented
                     as “temperature contour maps” to illustrate the distribution of isotherms (Figure 4.48).
                     Alternatively, isotherms can be presented on cross sections that include the shallow
                     geology. Another alternative, of particular use for conductive geothermal plays, is to
                     present gridded maps of surface conductive heat ﬂow.

                     Each heat ﬂow survey should be designed and interpreted by a person who understands
                     the fundamentals of heat transfer and is experienced in interpreting the nuances of
                     borehole temperature proﬁles. That person, or another member of the geoscience team,
                     should also have a deep insight into the tectonic setting and geology of the area and
                     how they might impact the thermal structure. The acquired and interpreted data should
                     be summarized in a document setting out the survey parameters, analytical methods,
                     results, and interpretations.

                     Heat ﬂow drilling is commonly one of the last activities of the Exploration Phase, focusing
                     ﬁnancial resources to improve the conﬁdence in estimates of reservoir depth and
                     temperature in areas deemed to be the most promising based on earlier exploration
                     and analysis. In this sense, heat ﬂow drilling is an excellent complement to geochemical
                     geothermometry, which estimates the temperature within the reservoir, but is unable to
                     constrain its depth.

                     Good outcomes from combined temperature and heat ﬂow surveys include, but are not
                     limited to, an indication of the temperature distribution both horizontally and vertically,
                     detection of the limits of convective zones, indications of ﬂuid migration pathways, and
                     quantiﬁcation of conductive heat loss from the survey area.

                      4.3.5. Laboratory Measurements on Shallow Cores,
                      Cutting, and Outcrop Samples
                      The interpretation of all geological, geochemical, and geophysical data is greatly
                      improved if actual samples of the relevant rock units can be obtained for laboratory
                      analyses. Information about the fundamental rock physical properties (density, magnetic
                      susceptibility, thermal conductivity, sonic velocity, electrical resistivity) enhances the
                      conﬁdence of interpretations and inversions of geophysical data. Mineralogical studies
                      aid predictions of water-rock interactions and the interpretation of geochemical data.
                      Observations of anisotropic rock fabric and measurements of rock strength assist with
                      predicting how a rock might respond to hydraulic stimulation. Assaying rock or ﬂuid
                      samples for precious mineral content might reveal commercial value to the wells beyond
                      the geothermal energy while tests for radioactivity can highlight potential hazards or
                      radiogenic heat sources (potentially radioactive samples require special handling).

                      Heat ﬂow drilling provides the opportunity to collect fresh core samples of the shallow
                      section of the stratigraphy in a region. It is often possible to ﬁnd existing core samples of
                      deeper sections of the stratigraphy from previously drilled bores (perhaps some distance
                      away from the actual area of interest but still representing relevant formations), or it might
                      be possible to ﬁnd outcrops of relevant formations in the region from which to collect
                      samples for laboratory analyses (Figure 4.49).

                      In general, rock analyses are a relatively inexpensive way to add signiﬁcant value to a
                      drilling program or geophysical survey. The range of possible laboratory analyses on rock
                      samples is wide. The speciﬁc analyses appropriate for any given rock unit and exploration
                      program strongly depends on the set of exploration tools being applied, but could include
                      any of the following:

No one laboratory will be able to carry out all of the above tests. Some tests are routine
while others are highly specialized and provided by only a handful of laboratories around
the world. In all cases, a reputable, experienced laboratory should be chosen.

It is rarely possible to obtain fresh samples of all the relevant stratigraphic units during
the Exploration Phase. This is to be expected and is unavoidable. However, reasonable
efforts should be made to obtain fresh samples of as many units as possible. The
properties of weathered samples will typically be signiﬁcantly altered from their fresh
state. For this reason, using laboratory measurements on weathered samples to
constrain geophysical or geochemical models is not recommended; the results could be
signiﬁcantly misleading.

A good outcome from a rock sampling and measurement program would be to obtain
real measurements of physical properties relevant to the geochemical and geophysical
techniques employed during the Exploration Phase of both the unaltered rocks and
altered rocks. These measurements should constrain and maximize the conﬁdence of
the derived geochemical and geophysical models and improve the conﬁdence in the
conceptual model.


4.3.6. Stress Field Estimates
The prevailing stress ﬁeld inﬂuences the distribution and preferred orientation of
permeability pathways in natural geothermal systems and controls the growth of
engineered reservoirs during hydraulic shearing. Following Anderson’s faulting theory
(Anderson, 1951), a stress ﬁeld is deﬁned by three orthogonal principal compressive
stress axes, S1>S2>S3. One of these axes is vertical, SV, and the other two axes are
horizontal; SH (maximum horizontal compressive stress) and Sh (minimum horizontal
compressive stress). The relative magnitudes of SV, SH and Sh determine whether a rock
is in a normal faulting, strike slip faulting, or reverse faulting stress regime, or a hybrid
transitional state. The orientations of SH and Sh determine the most likely orientation
of maximum fracture permeability. An estimate of the magnitude and orientation of the
principal stress components can, therefore, help predict zones of maximum fracture
permeability, and should be investigated in the early stages of a project. Stress estimates
can be reﬁned as more detailed information becomes available.

                          Stress in units of pressure or megapascals (MPa) cannot be measured directly but can
                          only be derived through a range of techniques of perturbing the rock mass, measuring
                          displacements or strain, or measuring hydraulic parameters. Ljunggren et al. (2003) and
                          Ask (2004) provided good overviews of the different methods for determining stress,
                          their limitations, and applications. Table 4.9provides a summary of their ﬁndings. Among
                          the variety of stress determination methods, not all may be applicable for any given
                          geothermal project, and different methods may be applicable at different stages of the
                          project.

                            Stress does not behave linearly, either laterally or vertically. Therefore, an estimated
                            stress ﬁeld should not be linearly extrapolated to depth. Stress ﬁeld measurements are
                            affected by stress disturbing factors such as geological environment (e.g., nearby faults,
                            geo-mechanical anisotropy in rock mass through variations in lithofacies, diagenesis),
                            borehole location and orientation, and the technical circumstances of the measurement
                            method itself.

                            Figure 4.50presents ﬁve activities that can sometimes be carried out to estimate the key
                            stress parameters during the Exploration Phase. The aim is to derive the orientations of
                            the principal stress axes (S1>S2>S3) and to determine whether the stress regime is in a
                            normal faulting, strike-slip faulting, reverse faulting, or hybrid transitional state.

                            Regional scale stress orientations might be found on the World Stress Map (Heidbach et
                            al., 2008; http://dc-app3-14.gfz-potsdam.de). The World Stress Map provides the trend
                            of the maximum horizontal stress, SH, for many regions (Figure 4.51). However, the map
                            does not show the stress regime for any given location. The question is whether SH is
                            the maximum principal stress, S1, or the intermediate principal stress, S2. If the region is
                            seismically active, then information about the local stress regime might be derived from
                            focal mechanism solutions for local earthquakes. Fault slip and fault throw data from ﬁeld
                            or seismic surveys can also suggest the current stress regime in areas of active faulting,
                            although fossil faults or reactivated faults may reﬂect paleostress regimes rather than the
                            current stress ﬁeld.

                            If rock density is known, then the vertical stress, SV, can be calculated from the density of
                            overburden, the thickness of overburden, and the gravitational constant. The magnitude
                            and direction of horizontal stress axes are harder to determine.
                            If previously drilled and logged boreholes are present in the area, then drilling induced
                            borehole breakouts and tensile fractures might provide indicators of the Sh and SH
                            directions (Figure 4.52). Borehole breakouts can form when the drilling mud pressure is
                            below hydrostatic formation pressure in underbalanced drilling, while tensile fractures are
                            initiated when the mud pressure exceeds the fracture gradient.

                      The magnitudes of horizontal stresses can also be estimated using the concept of limiting
                      stress ratios (Jaeger et al., 2007). This concept is based on the assumption that stresses
                      in the earth’s crust are limited by the frictional strength of rock. The stress limits for
                      normal faulting, strike slip faulting, and reverse faulting stress regimes can be calculated
                      for a certain depth (i.e., estimated reservoir depth) using “best guess” values for pore
                      pressure and frictional strength of rock where




                      and where μ is the friction coefﬁcient, S1eff and S3eff are the maximum and minimum
                      effective stresses, respectively, and P is pore ﬂuid pressure (Moeck et al., 2009). The
                      friction coefﬁcient is a material parameter, ranging between 0.36 and 1.0, and can be
                      derived from the angle of internal friction. Most reservoir rocks have a friction coefﬁcient
                      between 0.6- 0.85, depending of the strength of rock and reservoir depth. The application
                      of this method to geothermal projects is relatively new (Moeck et al., 2009).

                      Fractures parallel to the prevailing maximum compressive stress direction are most
                      likely to exhibit the highest natural permeability, while those critically aligned (i.e., angle
                      of ~25°-45°) with the prevailing maximum compressive stress direction will typically be
                      the ﬁrst to slip during hydraulic stimulation. The degree of slip and the effect of slippage
                      on the average aperture and permeability of a fracture can be investigated using
                      geomechanical modeling.


                      4.4. Conceptual Model
                      As indicated in Figure 4.1, the preliminary survey, exploration, and test drilling phases of a
                      project are all about deﬁning, reﬁning, and testing a “conceptual model” of the geothermal
                      system under investigation; a conceptual model is the schematic representation. A good
                      conceptual model should encapsulate the geological framework, heat source, heat and
                      ﬂuid migration pathways, reservoir characteristics, and surface geothermal features,
                      and should be consistent with all available data and information. The conceptual model
                      is continually reﬁned as each new set of data is collected and assessed, with each
                      reﬁnement adding a new level of detail or conﬁdence to the overall model.
114   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      An initial conceptual model should be developed at the earliest stages of the geothermal
      project. At this time, the model will necessarily be quite crude, perhaps illustrating little
      more than a generic representation of the expected geothermal play type, as shown in
      Figure 2.2 to Figure 2.9in Chapter 2. The model should then be regularly updated as
      new data become available to ensure the model respects and remains consistent with all
      known information. In this way, the most current conceptual model should incorporate all
      available exploration data. By the end of the Exploration Phase, the conceptual model
      should be of sufﬁcient detail to allow an estimate of reservoir depth, temperature, and
      geometry with sufﬁcient conﬁdence to justify and site wells for the Test Drilling Phase.

      The conceptual model can be illustrated with maps, 2D cross sections, or 3D block
      models. These might be simple free-form drawings at the early stages of a project, but
      will develop into robust geological models as more information is incorporated. Cross
      sections should be created at the same scale as the maps that underpin them, preferably
      with a 1:1 ratio between horizontal and vertical scales. All diagrams should include a
      representation of the assumed heat source, an estimate of the subsurface temperature
      distribution (isotherms), some indication of ﬂuid ﬂow directions, and a representation of
      the expected geothermal reservoir, even if these are only approximate.

      A good conceptual model provides clear evidence that the explorer has considered
      and integrated all available data. Nothing in the conceptual model should contradict
      data presented elsewhere, unless a clear rationale is provided. The conceptual model
      demonstrates a justiﬁable understanding of the geology, temperature, and ﬂuid pathways
      within the geothermal system. By utilizing the conceptual model, the explorer can select
      sites for the Test Drilling Phase that maximize the chances for a successful well based on
      all current data.

      All exploration data should be integrated into a conceptual model of the geothermal
      system under investigation. This model must respect and be consistent with all known
      information. Figure 4.54provides a ﬂow chart of typical data that may be used to build
      and develop the model. The model needs to be of sufﬁcient detail to allow a ﬁrst pass
      estimate of resource temperature and size and, in the Test Drilling Phase, is used to
      target deep, full-diameter wells toward particular lithological units and/or structures that
      are judged most likely to deliver commercial rates of geothermal ﬂuidat commercially
      viable temperatures.

                      A geo-referenced database isthe most efﬁcient way to integrate all geospatial data.
                      This facilitates developing maps at uniform scales (changing the scale as needed) and
                      overlaying different data to investigate interrelationships. If a GIS-based approach is not
                      possible, then each data set should be presented at the same scale to facilitate a manual
                      or visual overlay.


                      4.5. Numerical Model
                      Once its suitability has been constructed, the conceptual model can form the basis of a
                      numerical model (Newson et al., 2012). Numerical modeling is used to characterize in
                      a quantitative way the physical processes at work within a geothermal system. These
                      are primarily ﬂuid and heat ﬂow processes, controlled by temperature and/or pressure
                      gradients and permeability pathways. A numerical model can test the validity of the
                      conceptual model to explain the observed distribution of temperature and ﬂow paths.
                      The numerical model can then forecast the future performance of the reservoir under
                      conditions of exploitation (production and injection). This is used to estimate the impact
                      that geothermal exploitation will have on the resource, and hence possible degradation of
                      the reservoir and power output.

                      The development and use of a numerical model involves a number of stages, from
                      initial state modeling to historical matching, and then forecasts under a number of
                      selected scenarios predicting the future behavior of the reservoir under various levels of
                      production.

                      However, the requirements for numerical modeling include data from deep drilling and
                      well testing. An in-depth discussion of numerical modeling is therefore considered to be
                      beyond the scope of this exploration guide.

      4.6. Justiﬁcation to Proceed to Test Drilling
      (Phase 3)
      The aim of all preceding steps is to prepare a pre-feasibility study to evaluate the
      potential for economically viability geothermal power production, to mitigate ﬁnancial
      risk associated with development, and to build a business case for funding support from
      private, public, or institutional bodies to proceed with the project (if deemed viable). The
      data assembled from the technical and non-technical studies and surveys are brought
      together and incorporated into a ﬁnancial model to predict returns on investment and to
      justify the next phase: the high expense and risk of deep drilling.

                          5.1. Introduction
                          Chapter 5 presents the geological, geochemical, and geophysical strategies proven to
                          be most useful for exploring CV1 plays. However, because all geothermal systems are
                          unique, the exact selection and order (sequence in which these techniques are applied)
                          will almost certainly vary from prospect to prospect. Experienced geothermal scientists
                          or engineers will select what they consider the most appropriate sequence of techniques
                          to efﬁciently reduce the uncertainty regarding reservoir characteristics for the geothermal
                          play in which the potential system has developed.


                          5.2. Conceptual Models
                          The starting point for developing an exploration strategy for geothermal systems in CV1
                          plays is to review the conceptual models most widely used:

                           • Volcano/pluton-hosted water-dominated systems
                           • Volcano/pluton-hosted vapor-dominated systems
                           • Graben-hosted water-dominated systems.


                          5.2.1. Water-dominated Volcano/Pluton-Hosted
                          Systems
                          Figure 5.1(modiﬁed after Henley and Ellis, 1983) shows the “classic” water-dominated
                          geothermal system developed beneath elevated volcanic ediﬁces. Such systems are
                          commonly encountered in island arc settings. The heat source can be either magmatic
                          or plutonic. Theyhave thermal features that occur at different elevations. Boiling of
                          geothermal ﬂuids immediately above the heat source causes the dominant gases (CO2
                          and H2S) to partition into the steam phase. Condensation of the steam and gases in the
                          water table results in acid conditions and subsequent acidic water-rock alteration. Deeper
                          ﬂuids progressively boil and degas as they move towards the outﬂow, experiencing
                          ongoing water-rock interaction at progressively lower temperatures until discharging
                          at the surface, typically at boiling temperature. The outﬂowing ﬂuids may mix with
                          groundwater, becoming diluted and cooled.

      Directly above the heat source, near the surface at high elevations, up-ﬂowing acid
      ﬂuids alter the rocks to acid clay minerals (kaolinite and perhaps dickite) plus alunite
      and carbonates. Fumaroles and perhaps gas-generated features might be evident on
      the surface. If the heat source is active magmatism, then magmatic features (sometimes
      discharging hydrogen chloride and hydrogen ﬂuoride) may also be present. The
      chemistry of the surface features changes progressively downslope towards the outﬂow
      of cooled neutral pH hot springs that outcrop at lower elevations. At the outﬂow, the clay
      cap may be evident at the surface, composed of smectite clay minerals. Siliciﬁcation
      may also be present above the up-ﬂow and at the outﬂow. In some systems, where
      high CO2 concentrations occur in the reservoir ﬂuids, the loss of CO2 on boiling results
      in precipitation of carbonate, which can form spectacular surface travertine deposits.
      There may be a distance of several or many kilometers between the up-ﬂow and outﬂow
      features.

      The siliciﬁcation, carbonates, and clays associated with both the acid and neutral
      alteration are very useful surface indicators of a possible geothermal system since they
      may be entirely unsuitable for plant growth, so they are evident as open (bare) altered
      ground. Aerial reconnaissance using satellite imagery, aerial photographs, or visual
      aerial reconnaissance may identify areas of bare (altered) ground and thermal features.
      Discharging surface features (springs and fumaroles) are obvious evidence of an active
      geothermal system. Geochemical surveys, with subsequent geothermometer calculations
      and assessment, are key parts of the early exploration strategies for CV1 plays. Chapter
      4 describes the full range of possible geochemical techniques.

      The relationships between the geology and thermal features can also provide information
      on the geological controls on ﬂuid pathways. For example, is the distribution of thermal
      features controlled by certain rock types? Are thermal features aligned along structural
      trends? Is there evidence of an elevation control on the different chemistries of the
      thermal features? These questions should be addressed during the Preliminary Survey
      Phase if possible.

      Geophysical tools appropriate for CV1 play types tend to focus on mapping the electrical
      resistivity of the ground in order to identity the extent and other characteristics of
      the relatively conductive (i.e., low resistivity) clay cap. Which resistivity tool is most
      appropriate will depend on a range of factors including land access, expected reservoir
      depth, and survey cost. Certain techniques may be rapidly employed for low cost
      while others are more complex, requiring special permits, ground clearing, transfer of
      expensive and delicate equipment, or access for aerial-based equipment.

      Details on the numerous available geophysical techniques are provided in Chapter 4. The
      success of any geophysical technique depends on the existence of a detectable contrast
      in the physical properties of the rocks and ﬂuids within and outside a geothermal system.

                         Systems
                         Some CV1 type geothermal systems evolve as dry steam or vapor-dominated reservoirs.
                         The term vapor-dominated was introduced by White et al. (1971) and emphasized
                         by Truesdell and White (1973), with speciﬁc reference to The Geysers geothermal
                         ﬁeld in California. Other examples include Kamojang and Darajat in Indonesia. Figure
                         5.2is modiﬁed from Figure 5.1and incorporates the modiﬁcations of Ingelbritsen and
                         Sorey (1988) to provide a conceptual model of such vapor-dominated systems. Vapor-
                         dominated zones can be attractive exploration targets from a commercial perspective
                         since you may exploit dry steam rather than the water plus steam output of water-
                         dominated systems of Figure 5.1

                         The Geysers geothermal resource in California is currently the world’s largest exploited
                         vapor-dominated geothermal resource, extending over an area of more than 100 square
                         kilometers (Hulen and Norton, 2000). The top of the steam zone was deﬁned in 1989
                         (Hulen, pers. comm) by contouring the elevations of the ﬁrst (topmost) “commercial”
                         steam entries based on data from an estimated 1,100 wells (Mark Walters, pers. comm).
                         Figure 5.3shows this surface along with the top of the felsite plutonic complex at The
                         Geysers.

                       Volcano-hosted vapor-dominated geothermal systems may have few (if any) surface
                       features in close proximity above the heat source. There may be weak fumaroles or clay
                       alteration; ﬂuid and gas geothermometry on these features may provide early justiﬁcation
                       to proceed with geophysical surveys and test drilling. However, since any outﬂow springs
                       may be many kilometers away from the heat source and main vapor accumulation,
                       these surface springs may have re-equilibrated to suggest low resource temperatures.
                       Exploration for these systems therefore relies less on the geochemistry of the surface
                       features and more on geophysical surveys plus drilling.


                       5.2.3. Graben-Hosted Systems in CV1 Plays
                       In graben settings, convection-dominated geothermal systems may develop with thermal
                       features distributed quite differently to the volcanic models. Figure 5.4shows a conceptual
                       model of a magmatically heated graben-hosted system, based on extensive studies of
                       geothermal systems within New Zealand’s Taupo Volcanic Zone. Similar hydrological
                       settings may occur in parts of the East African Rift Valley.

                       In graben-hosted CV1 systems, the thermal features associated with up-ﬂow and outﬂow
                       zones may have mineralogies and chemistries identical to volcano-hosted CV1 systems,
                       but in close proximity to each other with few or no elevation differences. The exploration
                       strategy for such systems focuses on electrical resistivity methods to map the extent of
                       the hydrothermal alteration.

      5.3. Exploration Methods for Geothermal
      Systems in CV1 Plays
      Several authors have compiled inventories of speciﬁc techniques they consider most
      applicable to exploration for geothermal resources within CV1 play types. They include
      Richter et al. (2010) discussing exploration techniques successful in Iceland; Manzella
      et al. (2010) presenting experiences from Italy; and Hochstein and Hunt (1970) and
      Bibby et al. (1995) reporting on geophysical techniques especially successful in the
      exploration of the Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand. With respect to the United
      States, Thorsteinnsson and Greene (2011) recommended the development of a possible
      exploration technologies roadmap, which has since been reported by Phillips et al.
      (2013). The following sections synthesize the methodologies that might be applied to
      exploration in any CV1 play.


      5.3.1. Satellite Imagery, Aerial Photogrammetry, and
      LIDAR
      More and more potentially useful data are being obtained from satellite and airborne
      sensors, which is more fully described in Chapter 4. Since the majority of exploited CV-1
      systems throughout the world have surface thermal features or altered ground at the
      surface, such features are readily identiﬁed and perhaps quantiﬁed by these techniques.

      The technique is used during the Preliminary Survey Phase (or reconnaissance) at the
      survey design stage. Interpreted data can be added into a GIS database for integration
      with data compiled from surface surveys to produce detailed maps for each project area
      identifying the locations and extent of current or historic surface geothermal features. The
      technique has proven to be especially useful in difﬁcult terrain in tropical regions where
      ground access is difﬁcult. Note, however, that conﬁrmation of thermal or mineralogical
      anomalies always requires on-ground veriﬁcation and assessment.


      5.3.2. Geology and Mineralogy
      Regardless of information gained from the literature review (Section 4.2.3); it is essential
      for an experienced geothermal geologist to visit any speciﬁc project area to verify
      previously collected data and to develop an understanding of the geological setting.
      This typically includes regional geological surveys followed by more focused ﬁeldwork
      to develop an understanding of hydrology, stress regimes, geological history, lithologies,
      and the distribution of alteration minerals. Asummary ofpotentially useful geological and
      mineralogical techniques is presented in Table 5.1.

                 A geological report at the completion of the survey may include the following:

                  • Thorough understanding of the hydrology and geology of the project area and how it
                    ﬁts into the surrounding regional geological and tectonic setting
                  • Geothermal play type to which the possible system belongs
                  • Identiﬁcation of potential geological hazards
                  • Assessment of the accuracy and suitability of existing maps and cross sections by
                    comparing them to ﬁeld observations
                  • Understanding role of structural geology in controlling any potential geothermal
                    system: Is structure-controlled permeability likely to play a signiﬁcant role in ﬂuid ﬂow
                    for the geothermal system?
                  • Identiﬁcation of lithological units that may control or impact both the regional
                    hydrogeology and the ﬂuid ﬂow in the geothermal system
128              BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




                  • Age dating and composition of the volcanic units present within and around the
                    prospect
                  • Identiﬁcation of lithologies that might negatively impact geothermal development
                  • Identiﬁcation of lithologies that might result in ambiguities of interpretation of
                    geophysical data
                  • A review of the quality of previous mapping and/or cross sections: Are they sufﬁcient
                    or what new or additional geologic mapping should be undertaken?
                  • Construction of multiple cross sections through the project area to visualize the three
                    dimensional subsurface structure
                  • Mapping the distribution of alteration minerals and developing an understanding of the
                    their temperature and pH signiﬁcance
                  • Drill hole data and borehole cuttings or cores (If available, the methylene blue
                    technique (Harvey et al., 2000) to identify smectite might be useful to ground-truth
                    resistivity data.)


                 5.3.3. Geochemistry
                 Following a review of previously collected data, a site visit to the project area by an
                 experienced geochemist is an essential step in the early exploration stage. This visit
                 involves identifying, sampling, and analyzing ﬂuids and gases from surface thermal
                 features. Collecting a sample of non-thermal surface water at a range of elevations and
                 locations may provide useful background analyses for mixing models. Analysis and
                 interpretation of the geochemical data is carried out as detailed in Chapter 4. The areal
                 distribution of features may indicate the extent (size) of the geothermal system, while
                 ﬂow rates can provide estimates of the throughput of a system. Table 5.2summarizes the
                 range of geochemical techniques typically useful in exploring for CV1 geothermal plays.

                5.3.4. Geophysics
                Since geophysics plays an especially important role in CV1 systems, a geophysicist
                frequently accompanies the geologist and the geochemist on the initial ﬁeld
                reconnaissance. This gives the geophysicist the opportunity to assess the ﬁeld conditions
                since different geophysical methods require speciﬁc ground conditions to be successfully
                utilized. The geophysicist has a large repertoire of techniques from which to draw
                (see Chapter 4). Table 5.3 provides a general summary of the usefulness of different
                geophysical techniques in CV1 plays. However it should again be emphasized that
                the selection of exactly which techniques are used in CV1 plays relies on input from a
                suitably experienced geophysicist.

      5.3.4.1. Surface Heat Flow
      Heat ﬂow measurement is a relatively inexpensive technique that can permit estimates to
      be made of the extent and throughput of a system. The technique was extensively used
      in early exploration and prioritization of CV1 plays in New Zealand. Measurements in
      temperature gradient wells may be extremely useful or essential to gain an understanding
      of the shallow thermal gradients for carrying out preliminary assessments of a region.

      5.3.4.2. Temperature Gradient Drilling
      Temperature gradient (TG) drilling is commonly used in the exploration for CV1 systems.
      Since it may involve a signiﬁcantly increased level of expenditure beyond surface
      exploration, drilling is most commonly applied towards the end of the Exploration Phase.
      At this time, a reasonably detailed conceptual model has been developed and the drilling
      can focus on clarifying ambiguous data or screening a number of areas to identify the
      most promising area for more detailed exploration. TG drilling may therefore enable

       •   direct measurements to be made of subsurface temperature;
       •   information to be gathered on subsurface lithologies;
       •   ground-truthing of various geophysical interpretations;
       •   sampling of subsurface ﬂuids which may be critical for developing mixing models; and
       •   testing the validity of the conceptual model.

      5.3.4.3. Seismics
      In many countries passive seismic data are collected as a component of seismic
      monitoring networks. Such data may be very useful in regional surveys of CV1 prospects
      by identifying deep structures that may outline the general location of geothermal systems
      or indicate some structural control on the ﬂuid ﬂow (for example, the possible alignment of
      thermal features along faults). In the more advanced stage of investigation of geothermal
      prospects, setting up seismic arrays around an explored prospect may be appropriate
      since induced seismicity may be the result of exploitation of the system.

      Active seismic surveys have been carried out on many CV1 geothermal prospects, but in
      volcanic terrain, the absence of suitable density contrasts of volcanic units may limit its
      effectiveness. However, in the sedimentary sequences at Cerro Prieto (Mexico) seismic
      reﬂection studies provided support for gravity and magnetic interpretations (Fonseca and
      Razo, 1979).

      5.3.4.4. Resistivity (Excluding Magnetotellurics)
      Resistivity methods are used to map the areal extent of clay haloes and the presence
      of conductive ﬂuids above and marginal to convective systems (Bibby et al., 1995).
      Such techniques, including Schlumberger resistivity, audio magnetotelluric (AMT),
      and controlled source audiomagnetotellurics (CSAMT), are especially appropriate for
      reservoirs shallower than 500 meter depth (Cumming, 2009). In early exploration of
      the graben-setting Taupo Volcanic Zone in New Zealand, the Schlumberger resistivity
      technique was extremely successful in mapping the clay cap and presence of conductive
      ﬂuids above numerous active hydrothermal systems. Figure 5.5 provides a regional
      view of the shallow resistivity in the Taupo Volcanic Zone, with red areas representing
      conductive zones. In that setting, the resistivity haloes create “bull’s-eyes” for siting test
      wells.

                       5.3.4.5. Magnetotellurics
                       Magnetotellurics is the standard tool for investigating the resistivity structure deeper
                       than 500 meters, and is widely relied on to infer key characteristics of CV1 geothermal
                       reservoirs (Ussher et al., 2000; Anderson et al., 2000; Cumming, 2009). Interpretation
                       of MT data should be integrated with information obtained from surface geological
                       mapping, shallow temperature drilling, and perhaps clay mineral studies (e.g., methylene
                       blue method of Harvey et al., 2000; Gunderson et al., 2000). Figure 5.6 presents an MT
                       resistivity block model of a developed geothermal system in the Taupo Volcanic Zone,
                       New Zealand. MT surveys may also help constrain the regional tectonic setting. An
                       example is shown in Figure 5.7 in which the subduction of the Paciﬁc Plate beneath the
                       Australasian Plate is imaged by MT data and earthquake hypocenters.

5.3.4.6. Gravity
Gravity surveys may add additional useful information on the distribution of subsurface
structures to improve the understanding of the structural and lithological controls on CV1
type geothermal systems in the subsurface. Microgravity surveys are increasingly being
employed to investigate density variations due to lithology, alteration (siliciﬁcation), and
volcano or basin geometry.

5.3.4.7. Magnetics
At a regional scale, different rock types may be distinguishable by different magnetic
properties, allowing broad structural features to be identiﬁes in magnetic data. Aerial or
ground-based magnetic surveys may also be worthwhile for CV1 type plays since the
host volcanic rocks frequently have small amounts of ferromagnetic minerals such as
magnetite or titanomagnetite. The hydrothermal alteration process may alter these to
non-magnetic minerals such as hematite, pyrite, leucoxene, or sphene (Browne, 1978),
causing the reservoir intervals to become partially or totally demagnetized.

Magnetic surveys in the form of both ground surveys and low-altitude airborne surveys
have been successfully used to map geothermal systems in volcanic terrains in both
New Zealand (Hochstein and Hunt, 1970; Soengkono and Hochstein, 1995) and Iceland
(Bjornsson and Hersir, 1981). In some areas, good correlations have been observed
between magnetic anomalies and zones of low resistivity (Soengkono and Hochstein,
1995, 1996).


5.4. Development and Updating the
Conceptual Model
Combining all the information from the geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys
enables the explorer of CV-1 prospects to develop an integrated conceptual model. It is
never too early to develop a conceptual model (see Section 4.4), but as more and more
data become available from the various exploration techniques, the judicious integration
of data from geological, geochemical, and geophysical surveys enables the conceptual
model to become more and more detailed. There is greater use of computer-based
modelling techniques in the reﬁnement of conceptual models (Milicich et al., 2010).

When updating the conceptual model, the geoscience team should always strive to
identify potential ambiguities in the interpretation of new data. Resolution of ambiguities
can be time consuming and complex. Uncertainties introduced by ambiguities can reduce
the level of conﬁdence in any conceptual model and yet sooner or later, a decision has to
be made to test the conceptual model by drilling.
134   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      5.5. Prioritization of Target Areas
      In many CV1 plays the initial exploration may cover large areas in which there may
      be numerous thermal manifestations. An example is the Taupo Volcanic Zone, New
      Zealand, where possibly 20 active geothermal systems have been identiﬁed (Figure
      5.5). Prioritization of target areas following preliminary exploration of any region may be
      a worthwhile exercise since exploration funds may be limited. Priority should be given to
      the most promising targets that may enable exploration to proceed at the lowest ﬁnancial
      risk. This strategy should enable successful developments to be achieved in the shortest
      possible time. Selection of priority targets may be based on a number of technical
      variables discussed previously, but prioritization may also be based on non-geoscientiﬁc
      considerations such as location access, environmental, cultural, or political issues.

                          6.1. Introduction
                          A lack of magmatic activity does not imply a lack of geothermal systems. In regions of
                          active extension, deep-rooted faults in thinned crust can transport heat and thermal
                          water while thinned crust causes elevated heat ﬂow in general. While extension is clearly
                          associated with divergent margins, it is also encountered in other geological settings.
                          The two regions with the largest extensional rates worldwide are the Basin and Range
                          Province (USA) and the Western Anatolian Extensional Province, Turkey (Figure 6.1).
                          Both regions have proven potential for geothermal energy developments. On a local
                          scale, extension can also occur on convergent or transform margins, especially along
                          segmented strike-slip faults.

                          Active extension is always associated with active faulting along normal to strike-slip
                          faults. Experience has shown that understanding fault controls on the geothermal
                          systems should be the focus of exploration in these extensional domains (e.g., Caskey,
                          2000; Genter, 2010). Faults typically provide the pathways for geothermal ﬂuids within
                          the crust and are therefore the primary control for the efﬁcient transfer of heat from
                          deep to shallow crustal levels in amagmatic regions. Despite the signiﬁcance of faults in
                          controlling geothermal activity in such regions, however, relatively little is known about
                          the most favorable structural settings for geothermal systems (Faulds et al., 2010).
                          Present thinking suggests that dilational to shear-dilational faults are prime structures to
                          channel ﬂuids, whereas compressional faults act mainly as barriers to ﬂow (Sheridan and
                          Hickman, 2004; Anderson and Fairley, 2008).
138   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      The aim of exploration in extensional domains is to identify speciﬁc structural geological
      settings that can cause local extension, dilation, highly interconnected fracture density, or
      highly permeable subsurface layers that can act as reservoirs for ﬂuids convecting from
      deeper levels.


      6.2. Structural Setting of Extensional
      Domains
      In extensional-domain geothermal plays, certain structures within a complex fault pattern
      are more conducive for ﬂuid ﬂow. Understanding the controls on such ﬂow zones would
      help to identify favorable drilling sites, but global understanding of the most favorable
      structural settings for geothermal systems is still developing. In the Basin and Range
      Province, for example, efforts have been made to catalog more than 400 known
      geothermal systems according to their structural setting (Faulds et al., 2012). This work
      has found that most of the geothermal systems are located in step-over regions of
      segmented normal or transtensional faults; a decent number are located at fault tips and
      fault intersections; while only a small number are situated in the accommodation zones
      of major range-front faults and pull-apart basins. One valuable ﬁnding is that zones of
      maximum displacement on faults do not seem to host signiﬁcant geothermal systems.

      Structural settings favorable for convection-dominated extensional-domain geothermal
      plays can be identiﬁed through conventional geologic mapping and appear to be

       •   step-over regions and relay ramps;
       •   intersections of normal faults or with strike-slip faults;
       •   fault terminations, horse tail structures; and
       •   accommodation zones.

      Dilational fault segments may represent favorable targets at depths shallower than 2
      km, while critically stressed shear fractures seem to control ﬂuid ﬂow deeper than 2 km,
      according to studies of the Dixie Valley geothermal system in Nevada (Barton et al.,
      1995). The reason for this may be an increase in normal stresses acting on faults deeper
      than 2 km while normal stresses at shallower levels are small enough to allow dilation of
      faults (Ferrill and Morris, 2003).

      The intersections of faults dipping at different angles detectable through conventional
      surface geologic mapping or seismic interpretation represent a speciﬁc exploration target.
      Such fault intersections may serve as prime fractured reservoirs since intersecting fault
      zones are often associated with high fracture density, hence high permeability. This has
      been observed in the West Anatolian Extensional Province (e.g., E-W trending Gediz
                                                                                                                 139

                         Graben or Menderes Graben), where intersections of high and low angle normal faults
                         generate dilational jogs (Figure 6.2). At this type of fault intersection, thermal water can
                         migrate laterally and vertically, causing hot springs at some locations as evidence of
                         increased permeability. However, these systems can also be concealed or “blind” with no
                         surface manifestations to suggest their presence.

                         The term blind or hidden geothermal system is used in literature for those convection-
                         dominated play types that have no surface expressions such as hot springs, steaming
                         ground, or mud pots. While blind systems can occur in convection-dominated play types,
                         all conduction-dominated play types are blind.



 Example                 Desert Peak, Nevada: fracture-hosted geothermal reservoir at 1.2-1.3 km depth and at
                         218°C. Two installed ORC binary plants with a combined capacity of 33 MWe. Desert
 of a blind
                         Peak is located at a left step-over in a NNE-striking, west-dipping normal fault system
 geothermal              (Faulds et al., 2010). The Desert Peak geothermal system was discovered using heat
 ﬁeld                    ﬂow drilling in the 1970s.
140   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      Another set of targets in these settings are high permeability stratigraphic layers
      (detectable through geologic mapping combined with geophysical methods such as
      magnetotelluric) that can store signiﬁcant amounts of hot ﬂuid transported up intersecting
      faults and subsequently leaking into the permeable layers. These systems might be
      “closed” with the ﬂuid continuously cycling through faults and permeable layers in
      convective loops; or “open” with recharge occurring on bordering ranges. Temperature
      logs through such systems would show temperature inversion, with elevated temperature
      in the horizon where the fault leaks hot ﬂuids in, subsiding to the regional geothermal
      gradient below the leakage formation. Stress ﬁeld analysis (see Section 4.3.6) helps to
      identify dilational or critically stressed fault segments that might channel hot ﬂuids from
      deeper levels.

      There are, therefore, two sub-types of convection-dominated extensional domain
      geothermal play types:

       • Fault zone reservoirs like the detachment faults in the grabens of the West Anatolian
         Extensional Province
       • Tilted, high permeability stratigraphic reservoirs at the rim of grabens


      6.3. Exploration Methods
      As for all other play types, exploration for extensional domain geothermal plays aims to
      build a conceptual model consistent with all available information. In this play type, faults
      exert the dominant control on the geothermal system, commonly in interplay with other
      geological controls such as permeable/impermeable stratigraphic layers. Although the
      ultimate aim of each exploration campaign is to predict isotherms and reservoir quality
      (porosity and permeability), starting exploration at a larger scale is important to ﬁgure out
      the overall regional structural geological setting.

      An overview structural geological framework model can be derived from gravity surveys.
      Gravity maps can be interpreted to identify basin geometry, basement depth, and the
      nature of the basin ﬁll. In general, basins or grabens are expressed by a negative gravity
      anomaly, although the type of basin ﬁll can increase or decrease this anomaly. Gravity
      maps are most reliable, if integrated with surface geological mapping and rock property
      measurements.

      Fault and fracture analyses are a major focus of geological mapping for extensional
      domain plays. Bouguer gravity maps can enhance the depth interpretation of major faults
      by constraining their geometry (Cashman et al., 2009). Shallow temperature drilling,
      geochemistry, and geothermometry are standard methods as for other convective
      geothermal play types. However, geochemistry and geothermometry cannot be
      conducted on blind geothermal systems prior to drilling.
                                                                                         141




A conceptual model for blind geothermal systems must include a mechanism that
prevents ﬂuid and gas leakage to the surface. Possible mechanisms are impermeable
layers as clay caps or a drop of the water table. Inactive sinter or travertine deposits may
indicate former discharge zones and should be included in conceptual models.

A combination of resistivity, hydrothermal alteration, lithology, structural geology, and
hydrogeology data can be relied on for a robust conceptual model. Magnetotelluric
surveys are the prime exploration method for blind extensional-domain geothermal
systems insofar as they help to identify the permeability structure or partial melts
(Cumming, 2009). In faulted regions, different lithologies are juxtaposed directly against
each other, and fault surfaces can contain signiﬁcant amounts of clay (fault gouge),
graphite, or sulﬁdes. Therefore, not all low-resistivity anomalies represent increased
permeability (volumes of brine) or partial melts in these settings. MT and other resistivity
data must be interpreted within the context of the background geology to build the most
likely conceptual model.

Reﬂection seismic techniques can be employed when a signiﬁcant sedimentary ﬁll of
different lithologies allows the identiﬁcation of seismic reﬂectors and faults. Very young
extensional domains often host a relatively homogenous sediment package. In these
cases, reﬂection seismic techniques might only distinguish the basement top (and
therefore total sediment thickness) rather than internal sedimentological boundaries.
Whether reﬂection seismic techniques represent a cost-effective option to minimize
uncertainty in the conceptual model must be decided on a case-by-case basis.

AMT and CSAMT can help to map low-resistivity anomalies at shallow depths. These
anomalies can indicate brine accumulations, but can also relate to other causes of
resistivity lows (clay in particular). Magnetic surveys can help to map near-surface
hydrothermal alteration, as described in Chapter 4. But, again, a magnetic anomaly
cannot always be attributed to a single cause since positive magnetic anomalies can
be caused by iron sulﬁdes and iron-rich volcanic rock. Self-potential methods can be
employed for water table mapping or hydrology mapping, especially in areas of low relief.
High self-potential anomalies can indicate an aquifer, water bearing domains, or strong
lateral groundwater ﬂow since water has a high electrical conductivity compared to rock
or low porosity beds. Self-potential methods are most effective when they are combined
with resistivity methods.

A conceptual model approach to exploration is particularly effective for blind extensional-
domain geothermal plays because the model makes full use of limited data sets and
helps to characterize the shape of isotherms and ultimately well targeting. A conceptual
model also helps to identify gaps in information and the degree of uncertainty so that a
cost-effective heat ﬂow well, for example, can be drilled in speciﬁc zones to constrain
predicted temperatures. Such a shallow well would directly test and revise the conceptual
model.

7.1. Introduction
As with all geothermal plays, exploration for conduction-dominated geothermal play types
is about reducing the uncertainty in estimates of reservoir temperature, transmissivity
(permeability-thickness), and geometry prior to the Test Drilling Phase. All conduction-
dominated geothermal play types share the common characteristic that the distribution
of temperature is mostly controlled by thermal equilibration through conduction.
Temperature gradients (vertical and lateral) are a function of the conductive heat ﬂow
and the thermal conductivity of the rocks, and any disturbance due to the natural physical
movement of ﬂuid is minor. Viable reservoirs might take the form of open faults and
fractures, permeable lithofacies, and fractured crystalline rocks that might be developed
as reservoirs using EGS techniques or a combination of these. Appropriate exploration
methods focus on constraining the stratigraphy, geometry, structural geology, tectonic
stress ﬁeld, heat ﬂow, thermal properties, and porosity/permeability characteristics of the
broad geological setting in three dimensions.

Conduction-dominated geothermal play types (CD1–CD3) tend to be associated
with sedimentary basins in intracratonic settings. They are always, by deﬁnition blind
geothermal systems with no surface thermal manifestations. Geothermal reservoirs
associated with conduction-dominated plays include naturally permeable (either primary
or secondary permeability) sedimentary formations deep within extensional or foreland
basins; and thermally insulated, fractured (normally crystalline) basement rocks amenable
to permeability enhancement through hydraulic, chemical, or thermal stimulation.
Exploration techniques appropriate for conduction-dominated geothermal plays can be
divided into techniques that reveal the three-dimensional geometry (structural exploration)
and lithological composition of the sedimentary basin and basement; techniques that
constrain the distribution of temperature; and techniques that reduce uncertainties in
the estimates of the hydrogeological properties of potential reservoir units. The aim is to
build an increasingly detailed conceptual model of the basin and underlying basement,
constraining their regional extent and variability, stratigraphy, depth, composition,
structural elements, temperature, porosity/permeability distribution, stress ﬁeld, surface
features, and land access issues.


7.2. Techniques that Reveal Basin Geometry
and Composition
Structural exploration of the basin and underlying basement is the ﬁrst goal for
conduction-dominated plays. Basin geometry and composition exploration techniques are
as follows:

 •   Existing geological information
 •   Gravity and magnetics
 •   2D/3D reﬂection seismic techniques
 •   Structural geology

      7.2.1. Existing Geological Information
      Conduction-dominated geothermal plays are usually associated with sedimentary basins.
      As is often the case, any given sedimentary basin will have been explored or exploited at
      some point in the past for other commodities such as groundwater, hydrocarbons, or coal.
      As a result of these previous investigations, regional geological information about the
      general basin structure might already be available. All available material such as peer-
      reviewed or conference publications, student theses, surface geological maps, borehole
      reports (including any reports of subsurface temperature), interpreted seismic lines, rock
      petro-physics, and so on should be evaluated and, if necessary, reinterpreted.


      7.2.2. Gravity and Magnetics
      Previously existing or newly collected aerial or terrestrial gravity or magnetic survey
      data may provide insights into the basin geometry and the depth of the basement.
      Alternatively, the petrological composition of the deeper sediments and basement might
      be inferred from modelled density or magnetic susceptibility valuesbased on such data.
      Note, however, that gravity and magnetics models are inherently ambiguous (see Section
      4.3.4.1).


      7.2.3. 2D/3D Reﬂection Seismic Technologies
      Modern reﬂection seismic technologies represent the most accurate and precise
      technique to explore the structural detail of deeper strata. Interpretations of fault locations
      and orientations are typically more accurate for 3D surveys than for 2D surveys. The
      drilling risk reduction that comes from a detailed structural interpretation (usually possible
      from 3D seismic techniques) must, however, be weighed against the signiﬁcant cost of
      collecting 3D seismic data. The value of 3D seismic data typically increases in proportion
      to the depth and cost of the anticipated exploration wells. Where deep drilling (perhaps to
      6,000 meters) is anticipated, drilling costs will be signiﬁcant and 3D seismic techniques
      might be justiﬁed. For example, collecting 3D seismic data before drilling for geothermal
      energy in the Molasse Basin in Germany is a common practice. As 2D seismic data are
      less expensive to collect, this might be justiﬁed in a greater number of locations.

      Spatial resolution from 2D/3D seismic interpretations might be in the ±10 meter range
      for drilling target depths and for the location of faults. Seismic data, however, are largely
      insensitive to temperature and provide, at best, very limited information on porosity and
      permeability. Seismic images might indicate the position of faults but do not indicate
      whether those faults are open (permeable), closed, or recently active.

      In addition, some lithologies (for example, thick accumulations of coal or basalt) have a
      high anelastic attenuation factor. These lithologies effectively absorb seismic energy and
      conceal reﬂections from underlying structures. The value of reﬂection seismic techniques
      is severely reduced in basins containing such lithologies at shallow levels.
                                                                                          147




7.2.4. Structural Geology
While conduction-dominated geothermal plays assume there is negligible natural
subsurface ﬂuid movement, permeable units or structures are required for the efﬁcient
extraction and reinjection of water during energy production. Faults can act as barriers or
conduits for subsurface ﬂuid movement, depending on their kinematic evolution (history
of movement: magnitude and sense), their position within the current stress ﬁeld, and the
type of rock surrounding them. The dimensions and transmissivity of the fault core and
damage zone depend on the rock type surrounding the fault. For example, sandstone
may develop deformation bands that act as ﬂuid barriers in fault damage zones (Fossen
and Rotevatn, 2012); whereas, under the same conditions, carbonate rocks or granites
may develop a fracture network that acts as a ﬂuid conduit (Agosta et al., 2010). The
kinematic evolution of a fault also inﬂuences the dimensions and transmissivity of the
fault core and damage zone. Faults reactivated multiple times or faults offsetting clay-
rich formations may be ﬁlled with clay (“fault gouge”), becoming barriers to subsurface
ﬂuid movement. In contrast, carbonate rocks may dissolve and “karstify” in the fault core,
turning the fault into a conduit for ﬂuids.

Structural analysis of faults and their possible impact on transmissivity typically requires a
full interpretation of seismic survey data from the surface to at least the base of the target
reservoir. Seismic interpretation should cover the full stratigraphic sequence, not focus on
the target reservoir alone. The aim is to interpret the fault development and reactivation
history.


7.3. Techniques Constraining the Distribution
of Temperature
An assumption of thermal conduction as the dominant heat transfer mechanism allows
subsurface temperature to be predicted through applying conductive heat ﬂow modeling.
Such models, however, require estimates or measurements of thermal conductivity and
heat generation for the full stratigraphic sequence from the surface to at least the depth
of the target reservoir. They also require estimates or measurements of surface heat ﬂow
and/or a number of subsurface temperature measurements to constrain the models.

Thermal gradient is typically not constant with depth or location and varies according to
the thermal conductivity of the strata and the magnitude of heat ﬂow from below (e.g.,
Beardsmore and Cull, 2001). In some speciﬁc geological scenarios, the temperature ﬁeld
can be signiﬁcantly distorted through thermal conduction effects alone. For example, salt
diapirs can act as high conductivity heat “chimneys,” leading to higher temperatures at
shallow depths and lower temperatures at deeper levels compared to the surrounding
temperature ﬁeld. In contrast, low conductivity coal seams act as thermal blankets,
depressing shallow temperatures and leading to higher temperatures at depth beneath
the coal.

It is important at all times to keep in mind that an assumption of thermal conduction as
the dominant heat transfer mechanism down to inferred reservoir depth will not always
prove true in reality. Any component of convective heat transfer above the level of the
inferred reservoir depth will invariably reduce the true temperature of the reservoir relative
to predictions based on conductive models. An anomalously high and/or localized shallow
conductive heat ﬂow anomaly, like that observed in the shallow sediment at Soultz-sous-
Forêts in France prior to deeper drilling into the granite basement (Baria et al., 1992),
could indicate an elevated risk of the presence of a relatively shallow convection cell.
148   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      Speciﬁc temperature exploration techniques for conduction-dominated plays are as
      follows:

       •   Existing subsurface temperature data
       •   Heat ﬂow drilling
       •   Rock property measurements
       •   Numerical conductive heat ﬂow modeling


      7.3.1. Existing Subsurface Temperature Data
      A search of peer-reviewed papers, conference publications, and student theses might
      reveal previous temperature modelling exercises, additional data sources, or evidence
      of non-conductive heat transfer mechanisms in the area of interest. These should be
      identiﬁed and critically assessed prior to commencing any new data collation or collection
      exercise. Previously measured subsurface temperature data represent the most direct
      indicators of natural rock temperature in conduction-dominated geothermal plays, so any
      such data should be collated and critically assessed. Such data could come from wireline
      logging reports, petroleum production tests, underground mines, pumped or artesian
      water bores, or other sources. It is important to correlate each temperature datum to a
      particular depth and location.

      Unless speciﬁcally collected for geothermal purposes, most subsurface temperature data
      are affected to some extent by the wellbore environment and do not exactly represent
      the undisturbed ground temperature. Such impacts can be due to the recent circulation
      of drilling ﬂuid, cooling within the borehole during production, curing of casing cement,
      gas expansion into the well, or other effects. Most of these effects result in temperature
      measurements lower than the natural rock temperature. Older temperature data that
      relied on manual readings from thermometers are also prone to random transcription
      errors. It is important to recognize and allow for all of these potential errors and
      uncertainties in subsequent extrapolations or interpolations of temperature at other
      depths and locations.


      7.3.2. Heat Flow Drilling
      Heat ﬂow drilling, as described in Section 4.3.4.9, is arguably of greater value for
      conduction-dominated geothermal plays than convection-dominated plays. This is
      because the laws of thermodynamics (speciﬁcally conservation of energy) and the
      assumption of conductive heat ﬂow dictate that the heat ﬂow measured at the surface
      can be extrapolated to arbitrary depth to predict temperature. Ideally, this is carried out
      in three dimensions to account for possible lateral heat ﬂow in complex structural settings.

      For overall suitability, the number of wells and locations for heat ﬂow drilling should be
      decided based on the degree of uncertainty over the temperature at inferred reservoir
      depth; cost of heat ﬂow drilling; cost of drilling to inferred reservoir depth; accessibility to
      appropriate sites; and surface conditions. With respect to surface conditions, signiﬁcant
      surface topography can locally affect surface heat ﬂow, so heat ﬂow wells should be
      located at least one kilometer from positive or negative topographic features of 250
      meters or more relative elevation.

      At least two companies in Australia have previously carried out exploration programs of
      heat ﬂow drilling at approximately 15-20 km spacing to constrain 3D heat ﬂow models and
      predictions of temperature at depth across relatively large exploration areas (Holgate et
      al., 2009; Matthews and Godsmark, 2009).
                                                                                          149




7.3.3. Rock Property Measurements
Conductive heat ﬂow models require estimates or measurements of thermal conductivity
and, ideally, heat generation for the full stratigraphic sequence from the surface to at
least the depth of the target reservoir. Representative samples of the relevant lithologies
might be collected from surface outcrops (if relatively unweathered), preexisting core, or
analogues from other locations.

Good practice is to measure several specimens of each lithology or formation in order
to derive an average value and variance. Experienced laboratories should be used for
all measurements. The temperature at which thermal conductivity is measured in the
laboratory should be recorded because conductivity is temperature-dependent and
corrections are required if laboratory conditions vary from in situ conditions, as is usually
the case.

Where no samples can be collected, global average conductivity values can be assumed
for speciﬁc lithologies, although the uncertainty in such values is inherently higher than for
local measurements.


7.3.4. Numerical Conductive Heat Flow Modeling
The differential equations governing the conductive ﬂow of heat are well understood and
relatively simple to solve using ﬁnite difference numerical methods. Different levels of
sophistication are possible with such approaches, from simple one-dimensional models
with static thermal conductivity values (which can be solved with simple spreadsheets) to
much more complex three-dimensional models incorporating temperature dependence of
thermal conductivity. Given the limited market and specialist nature of the requirements
for conduction-dominated geothermal play exploration, identifying and procuring
appropriate software to carry out the modeling can be difﬁcult. A number of geothermal
exploration consulting groups and individuals have conductive heat ﬂow modeling
capabilities, and explorers are encouraged to enlist the assistance of such groups for this
task.


7.4. Techniques Reducing Uncertainties in
Estimates of Hydrogeological Properties of
Reservoir Units
Transmissivity (integrated permeability over a given thickness) is arguably the
hydrogeological property that best characterizes the potential of a given volume of rock
to act as a geothermal reservoir. In the case of conduction-dominated geothermal plays,
target reservoirs are either relatively thick, naturally permeable (primary or secondary)
sedimentary formations; hydraulically “open” fracture and fault networks; or naturally
fractured rocks amenable to enhancement through stimulation.

The natural porosity and permeability of sedimentary formations tend to diminish with
depth of burial due to compaction. Heating and diagenesis can either amplify or suppress
the compaction effect. The degree to which natural permeability is retained is largely a
function of depth, temperature, and lithology. Some predictions can be made based on
sedimentation and burial history models, with a consideration of possible diagenesis.
150   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      Active or critically stressed faults are considered prime targets for deep geothermal
      reservoirs (Barton et al., 1995). Secondary fracture networks often accompany such
      faults, and these remain relatively permeable because any mineralization within the
      fractures is continuously broken up though active slip. Active dilational faults and
      extensional fractures are often conduits for ﬂuid ﬂow at depths less than two kilometers,
      while critically stressed faults provide potential ﬂow paths at greater depths (Ferrill and
      Morris, 2005; Moeck et al., 2009). Mapping the locations and orientations of faults and
      fracture zones was covered in Section 7.2.4. Whether faults are critically stressed or
      dilated depends on their orientation within the present-day stress ﬁeld (Morris et al., 1995;
      Moeck et al., 2009). Stress ﬁeld analysis and rock mechanical modeling are therefore
      important exploration techniques for conduction-dominated geothermal plays.

      Exploration techniques speciﬁcally addressing transmissivity include the following:

       •   Seismic sequence stratigraphy for porosity/permeability prediction
       •   Diagenesis investigation
       •   Seismic signal attributes for porosity estimates
       •   MT polarization for identifying fractured rock
       •   Seismic shear wave splitting for identifying fractured rock
       •   Stress ﬁeld analysis and geo-mechanical modeling


      7.4.1. Seismic Sequence Stratigraphy for Porosity/
      Permeability Prediction
      Reﬂection seismic sections image the sequence and geometry with which sediment
      layers ﬁll basins. The methods of seismic sequence stratigraphy group formations into
      units bounded by unconformities, based on their geometric relationships, and explain
      these units in terms of changes in relative sea level. Clastic units with high initial porosity
      and permeability tend to be associated with periods of low sea level, while initially
      porous calcareous units tend to be associated with periods of high sea level (Ali et al.,
      2010). In this way, making qualitative predictions of reservoir quality based on geometric
      relationships observed in the seismic proﬁles might be possible.

      Moreover, identifying speciﬁc high-energy clastic sediment facies, such as braided river
      systems or basal conglomerates, on seismic proﬁles might also be possible. Such facies
      might host poorly sorted sediment with higher than average porosity.


      7.4.2. Diagenesis Investigation
      According to Ali et al. (2010), “diagenesis is a continually active process by which
      sedimentary mineral assemblages react to regain equilibrium with an environment whose
      pressure, temperature, and chemistry are changing. These reactions can enhance,
      modify, or destroy porosity and permeability.” The processes and controls on the
      diagenesis of any given package of sediment are complex functions of the initial sediment
      composition, pressure and temperature history, and interaction between the sediment
      and chemically varying pore ﬂuids through time. The ﬁeld of diagenesis investigation
      is advancing rapidly, driven by its importance in petroleum exploration for reservoir
      quality. Clearly, this ﬁeld is also highly relevant when exploring for permeable geothermal
      reservoirs in the deeper parts of sedimentary basins.
                                                                                         151




General rules for predicting zones of diagenetically enhanced or retained permeability
are still rare, but some general indicators have become apparent. For example, some
coatings (e.g., chlorite, micro quartz) on quartz grains act as inhibitors to quartz
cementation and can result in the retention of primary permeability (Taylor et al., 2010).


7.4.3. Seismic Attributes for Porosity Estimates
The attributes of reﬂected seismic signals (e.g., wavelet phases and amplitudes) relate to
physical properties of the imaged rocks such as sonic velocity, density, porosity, Poisson’s
ratio, and others. Under certain conditions, “machine learning” or “neural network”
methods might allow a computer algorithm to “learn” the relationship between the
physical properties and the seismic attributes and thus develop an operator or function
to predict the properties from the seismic data. This is only possible where wire-line log
responses (showing the relative variability in the relevant properties with depth) and
high quality 3D reﬂected seismic signal attributes can be correlated against a number
of physical measurements of the relevant properties (e.g., from core samples). These
data sets are only likely to be available for conductive geothermal plays. The accuracy
of the resulting predictions away from the calibration points depends on the accuracy
of all the input data; degree of “learned” correlation between the seismic data and
modeled parameters; distance from the control points; and degree to which the assumed
correlation actually exists in nature.

If high quality 3D seismic data are available, the method might be attempted using
commercial products such as Schlumberger’s Petrel software package. Pavlova and
Reid (2010) presented a case study of this method to predict the porosity of the Pretty Hill
Formation in the Otway Basin, Australia, using 3D reﬂection seismic data, interpreted wire
line sonic porosity, and core-measured porosity.


7.4.4. Magnetotelluric Polarization for Identifying
Fractured Rock
As described in Section 4.3.4.3, magnetotelluric data might be interrogated for evidence
of preferred subsurface fracture orientation. If the electric and magnetic ﬁelds are each
measured along more than one orthogonal axis (or component) during an MT survey,
then several different electric-magnetic (E:H) component ﬁeld strength ratios can be
calculated as a starting point for processing and interpreting. Common practice with
modern instruments is to collect two orthogonal horizontal components of the electrical
ﬁeld and three components of the magnetic ﬁeld. This provides for up to six different
E:H ratios. If different E:H ratios produce different results for the subsurface resistivity
distribution, this might indicate electrical anisotropy in the subsurface. In some instances,
the magnitude and orientation of the anisotropy ellipse might be estimated. While various
explanations might explain the anisotropy, in some instances, this could be due to a
preferred fracture orientation, with the magnitude related to the fracture density. Where
secondary porosity and permeability is being targeted, such MT polarization might be
investigated for its potential to discriminate between areas more and less likely to have
high fracture density.
152   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      7.4.5. Seismic Shear Wave Splitting for Identifying
      Fractured Rock
      Seismic shear wave splitting is a useful technique to determine the fracture orientation in
      conduction-dominated play types and can be used to model potential ﬂuid ﬂow paths in a
      geothermal system.


      7.4.6. Stress Field Analysis and Geo-mechanical
      Modeling
      The development of geothermal reservoirs within basement type conduction-dominated
      plays will almost always require hydraulic stimulation of preexisting fracture networks
      to enhance the overall transmissivity of the rock mass. The success of the stimulation
      program in enhancing the natural permeability of the rock depends on a complex
      interplay between the tectonic stress ﬁeld, orientation and density of preexisting
      fractures, characteristics of those fractures (length, aperture, stiffness, roughness, etc.),
      characteristics of the surrounding rock (coefﬁcient of thermal expansion, hardness, etc.),
      and stimulation parameters (injection pressures, water volumes, water chemistry, water
      temperature, etc.).

      Section 4.3.6presents a detailed description of the methods and signiﬁcance of stress
      ﬁeld analyses. Many of the parameters controlling the response of critically stressed
      fractures to stimulation are poorly constrained prior to drilling (or even after drilling), but
      numerical simulation software (e.g., Universal Distinct Element Code or UDEC produced
      by Itasca Consulting Group Inc.) can be used to investigate the range of possible
      outcomes and the sensitivity of outcomes to speciﬁc rock and fracture characteristics.
      Such packages can also be used to predict locations that are more likely to have existing
      open fracture networks, based on the present stress ﬁeld, rock, and fracture properties.
      This work can help in the design of rock property measurements or well-testing programs.


      7.5. Exploration Outcomes
      At the conclusion of the Exploration Phase for a conduction-dominated geothermal play,
      the explorer should have a clear idea of the nature and location of the target geothermal
      reservoir. The explorer should be able to present a geological model of the basin (or at
      least the relevant region within the basin) and, if appropriate, the underlying basement.
      The model should encompass information about the stratigraphy, depth, composition,
      structural elements, temperature, porosity/permeability distribution, stress ﬁeld, and
      surface features of the location. Importantly, the explorer should be able to communicate
      the uncertainties in predictions of the key reservoir parameters: location, depth, thickness,
      lateral extent, temperature, and transmissivity.

      The combination of exploration methods applied to a speciﬁc conduction-dominated
      geothermal play will be guided by the value of each option with respect to reducing the
      overall ﬁnancial risk of the Test Drilling Phase. In some places, undertaking relatively
      expensive programs of 3D reﬂection seismic or heat ﬂow drilling will make ﬁnancial
      sense, because target reservoirs are deep (expensive to drill) and reservoir temperature
      and/or optimal location and depth are poorly constrained. In other places, progressing
      directly to the Test Drilling Phase to answer questions about depth and temperature might
      be the course of action that represents the lowest ﬁnancial risk.
8. REQUIREMENTS
   FOR THE PRE-
   FEASIBILITY STUDY
                                                                                       155




8.1. Introduction
This chapter provides the geothermal explorer with guidelines on what information and
data should typically be assembled during the preliminary survey and exploration phases
and on how this information should be presented to potential ﬁnanciers. Collectively, this
information forms the basis of the pre-feasibility study to justify proceeding to the Test
Drilling Phase of the project. This chapter repeats some of the non-geoscientiﬁc material
presented earlier in the Guide, to accentuate its importance to the economic viability of
a geothermal project. These guidelines should be considered as suggestions rather than
rigid prescriptions.


8.2. Preliminary Information
Background information should be compiled and presented in such a manner as to
illustrate the explorer understands local requirements and perceptions about geothermal
development. An exploration license should be presented, along with evidence that
development rights will be obtained for any geothermal resource that may subsequently
be discovered.

Relevant data should include information on these topics:

 •   Power market and possible PPAs
 •   Infrastructure issues (roads, water, communication, transmission)
 •   Resource ownership issues
 •   Environmental and social issues
 •   Institutional and regulatory frameworks
 •   Issues relating to political and ﬁnancial stability

All these topics should be discussed in a comprehensive document in which any potential
barriers to development are identiﬁed and addressed. A suggested table of contents is
provided in Appendix A1.


8.3. Environmental Impact and Resource
Protection
A thorough understanding of the local regulations on environmental protection is an
essential early step for any geothermal development. Although geothermal development
is frequently acknowledged as an attractive option for power generation, the fact that a
development of any kind has impacts on environment and land use must be appreciated.
An environmental and social impact statement (ESIS) is a standalone document and is
almost always a prerequisite to embarking on a survey or exploration program. Any such
ESIS should be presented in full to a potential ﬁnancier.
156   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      8.4. Collection of Baseline Data
      Baseline environmental and social data, which essentially deﬁne the starting conditions of
      any development, should be collected as early as possible. In many countries, resource
      permits impose strict conditions relating to any potential impact of a geothermal project.
      For example, permits may specify minimal or no impact on other existing land uses.
      This might cover such impacts as subsidence, air quality, surface geothermal features,
      groundwater quality, visual amenity, and seismic activity. It is important that the potential
      developer identify environmental parameters that might be sensitive issues and address
      these early in the project. Baseline data can be presented as maps, charts, graphs,
      tables, databases, or in other formats as appropriate for reporting, building consensus, or
      pursuing ﬁnancing. Some baseline data collection may also require signiﬁcant time (e.g.,
      collection of background seismic data).


      8.5. Literature Review
      A thorough literature review by experienced geothermal specialists can save the explorer
      signiﬁcant time, effort, and expense in the Exploration Phase of the project. Such a review
      may uncover both essential baseline environmental information and relevant technical
      data. Historical data of previous geothermal exploration can also provide a useful contrast
      to new explorer-generated data, enabling an assessment to be made of the quality and
      consistency of new data against previously collected information.

      All relevant data should be compiled and reviewed to identify gaps in coverage or
      quality. This information should be used to formulate plans for additional surveying
      and exploration. Ongoing exploration efforts can then focus on addressing the gaps or
      augmenting information where needed.

      Examples of data sources to be sought and collated include the following:

       • Academic publications from both local and foreign universities and research programs
       • Data, results and/or reports from previous leaseholders including mining tenements or
         previous exploration campaigns for minerals or oil and gas
       • Reports and documents from relevant agencies of the national government
       • Provincial reports and documents from relevant agencies
       • Municipal reports and documents from relevant agencies
       • Data and information found through Internet searches
       • Maps pertaining to geology, infrastructure, and lease boundaries

      Geo-referenced digital databases (e.g., locations and characteristics of geothermal
      manifestations, topography, roads, other infrastructure, geology, geochemistry,
      geophysics, etc.) should be created whenever possible for ease of analysis and
      presentation, with data compiled by means of summaries, databases, spreadsheets,
      maps, and ﬁgures, depending on the nature of the data. A good outcome upon completing
      the literature review is to have a high level of conﬁdence that all relevant data and maps
      is identiﬁed, collated, and assessed for inclusion in the conceptual model of the resource.
                                                                                       157




Key ﬁndings should be summarized in one or more standalone documents covering
such things as the geologic setting, tectonic history, development history, and so on. This
document(s) should include a comprehensive bibliography of all source material identiﬁed
and reviewed and should note whether any identiﬁed material could not be reviewed
(e.g., due to conﬁdentiality, obscure source, or other reasons.)


8.6. Active Geothermal Features
Active geothermal features are proof of an existing geothermal system on some scale,
although not proof of a system capable of supporting economic power generation.

The location and names of all the geothermal features, as well as the mapped extents of
surrounding geothermal deposits, should be compiled on a single map with geological
and tectonic information for each project area. Characteristic of the geothermal features
should be compiled into tables that correspond directly to what is shown on the map.
Ideally, all of these data would be geo-referenced to include estimates of the rate of
geothermal ﬂuid movement through the system and an idea of the extent, chemistry, and
general geometry of the geothermal system.


8.7. Geology
Identiﬁcation of the likely geothermal play type under investigation is an essential ﬁrst
step. The geological history of the area should be summarized in a separate document,
speciﬁcally covering the age of any local volcanism. Geological data for the project
area should be presented in the form of geological maps, structural maps, stratigraphic
columns, and cross sections. A three-dimensional geological model could be presented
using specialized modeling and visualization software. The data should include lithology,
stratigraphy, hydrothermal mineralization, geological structure, tectonics, and sense of
movement on faults. This information should indicate which units or structures could
provide ﬂuid pathways or host a geothermal reservoir. The geological analysis should
also identify any uncertainties and data gaps that remain unresolved after the Exploration
Phase.
158   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      8.8. Geochemistry
      Fluid and gas geochemical data should be presented on maps, tables, drawings, and
      plots for the project area. Accompanying reports should explain the inferences and
      conclusions drawn from the data; an indication of temperature distribution within the
      geothermal system; a maximum and minimum temperature range for the resource;
      possible indications of future scaling or corrosion issues; and a ﬂuid-mixing model. As
      with geologic studies, the geochemical interpretation should also identify uncertainties
      and data gaps that remain unresolved after the Exploration Phase.


      8.9. Geophysics
      All collected and interpreted geophysical data should be presented as maps, cross
      sections, or 3D models as appropriate. The data and interpretations for each survey
      should be summarized in a document setting out the survey parameters, analytical
      methods, results, and interpretations. A separate summary document might compile the
      salient data and results for all geophysical surveys, as well as any uncertainties and data
      gaps remaining after the Exploration Phase.


      8.10. Drilling Data
      For heat ﬂow wells, drill hole locations and all temperature versus depth data should
      be presented graphically, with a legend listing the dates that each proﬁle (temperature
      log) was made. Presentation of the results of heat ﬂow drilling might include maps of
      temperature at speciﬁc depths or elevations by contouring temperatures or heat ﬂow
      values; and/or cross sections that include the shallow geology and may show how
      temperature varies with depth due to conductive heat ﬂow or advection of heat with
      convecting ﬂuids.


      8.11. Conceptual Model
      All exploration data should be integrated into a conceptual model of the geothermal
      system under investigation. This model must respect and be consistent with all
      known information and be of sufﬁcient detail to allow a ﬁrst-pass estimate of resource
      temperature and size. The conceptual model is the primary guide during the Test Drilling
      Phase for targeting deep, full-diameter wells toward particular lithological units and/or
      structures judged most likely to deliver commercial rates of geothermal ﬂuid and for future
      numerical modelling (Newson et al.,2012). The conceptual model forms the basis for cost
      and revenue estimates for the pre-feasibility ﬁnancial model.
                                                                                           159




A geo-referenced database isthe most efﬁcient way to integrate all of the geospatial data.
This facilitates developing maps at uniform scales (changing the scale as needed) and
overlaying different data to investigate interrelationships. If a GIS-based approach is not
possible, then each data set should be presented at the same scale to facilitate a manual
or visual overlay.

The conceptual model can also be presented as cross sections or maps. Cross sections
should be created at the same scale as the maps, preferably with a 1:1 relationship
between horizontal and vertical scales. Drawings may be free form, particularly if a
concept is illustrated rather than data presented. All diagrams should include estimates of
the subsurface temperature distribution (estimated isotherms) and some indication of ﬂuid
ﬂow directions, even if these are only approximate.

Existing well site(s) and proposed drilling target(s) can be presented on diagrams of the
conceptual model, but should be accompanied by a narrative description of the rationale
for selecting the proposed target(s). This rationale will naturally refer to the conceptual
model, which forms the primary basis for well targeting. However, non-geological factors
might also affect decisions about particular well sites. For example, the number of sites
that can be occupied by a large drilling rig may be limited by terrain or access restrictions,
or certain areas may be off limits for environmental reasons. Any non-geological rationale
of this kind must be clearly discussed when presenting well sites and drilling targets.
Deviated directional drilling may be an option, but its cost implications should be factored
in. Allowance of signiﬁcant funds for detailed well testing and reservoir engineering (Grant
and Bixley, 2011) should also be included in forward planning and costing.

Regardless of the mode of displaying the conceptual model, the magnitude and nature
of uncertainties about key model parameters (depths, temperatures, fault locations and
orientations, lithologies, porosity/permeability, and so on) that remain after the Exploration
Phase should be clearly disclosed to potential ﬁnanciers.


8.12. The Pre-feasibility Study and Financial
Justiﬁcation to Proceed
The data assembled from the technical and non-technical studies and surveys are
brought together and incorporated into a pre-feasibility report that includes a ﬁnancial
model (including an estimated power capacity of the planned power plant) to predict
returns on investment and to justify the next phase: the signiﬁcantly higher level of
funding required for the Test Drilling Phase (Phase 3) and well testing. The speciﬁc
purposes of the pre-feasibility report are

 • to demonstrate a reasonable probability that the geothermal system will support
   economic power production;
 • to mitigate ﬁnancial risk associated with the Test Drilling Phase of development; and
 • to build a business case for funding support from private, public, or institutional bodies
   to proceed with the project.
160   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      Due to the uncertainties in the project before the drilling is complete, the pre-feasibility
      should include an assessment of risks.

APPENDIX A2:
Glossary of Terms
A
Accommodation     The area between two sub-parallel, non-collinear, overlap-
zone              ping faults, transferring displacement or strain from one
                  fault to another fault. Very often oblique shear is involved.
Active fault      A fault pre-dispositioned to further movement due to its ori-
                  entation in the present-day stress ﬁeld and strength of rock.
Advection         The physical transport of a substance (including heat) utiliz-
                  ing the bulk motion of a convecting ﬂuid (see convection
                  below). Note: When applied to subsurface heat transfer, the
                  term convection is often used as a synonym for advection.
                  The rate of heat transfer by advection is proportional to the
                  rate of ﬂuid ﬂow, the phase of the ﬂuid (liquid or vapor), and
                  the speciﬁc heat capacity of the ﬂuid.
Aeolian           Made by wind, also Eolian.
Amagmatic         Absence of magmatic activity.
Andesite          A dark-colored, ﬁne-grained extrusive rock with no quartz
                  and about 75% plagioclase feldspars of which one is ande-
                  sine and widely characteristic of mountain-making process-
                  es on convergent margins.
Aquifer           A large permeable body of underground rock capable of
                  yielding quantities of water to springs or wells. Note: Under-
                  ground aquifers of hot water and steam form geothermal
                  reservoirs.
B
Back-arc basin    Formed by the process of back-arc spreading, which begins
                  when one tectonic plate subducts under (underthrusts) an-
                  other. Note: Subduction creates a trench between the two
                  plates and melts the mantle in the overlying plate, which
                  causes magma to rise toward the surface. Rising magma
                  increases the pressure at the top of the overlying plate that
                  creates rifts in the crust above and causes the volcanoes
                  on the island arc to erupt. Back-arc basins are sites of sig-
                  niﬁcant hydrothermal activity.
Basalt            A ﬁne-grained extrusive maﬁc rock dominated by dark-
                  colored minerals consisting of plagioclase feldspars (>50%)
                  and ferromagnesian silicates. Note: Basalts and andesites
                  represent about 98% of all extrusive rocks.
Baseload plants   Electricity-generating units that are operated to meet the
                  minimum load on the supply system.

      Basement           The deepest geological formation for potential geothermal
                         development. Note: Although different geological formations
                         can be deﬁned as basement depending on the goal of ex-
                         ploration, the term in exploration geology refers to any rock
                         below sedimentary rocks or sedimentary basins that are of
                         metamorphic or igneous origin.
      Basement fault     A fault that cuts the basement, which originated before de-
                         position of cover sediments and which may be reactivated.
      Basement rock      A term sometimes used to deﬁne metamorphic or igneous
                         rocks underlying a sedimentary sequence.
      Binary-cycle plant A geothermal electricity generating plant employing a
                         closed-loop heat exchange system in which the heat of the
                         geothermal ﬂuid (the primary ﬂuid) is transferred to a lower-
                         boiling-point ﬂuid (secondary or working ﬂuid), which is
                         thereby vaporized and used to drive a turbine/generator set.
      Biofacies          A rock unit differing in biologic aspect from laterally equiva-
                         lent biotic groups, identiﬁed by fossils in carbonate rock.
      Boiling point      Temperature at which a single substance, such as water,
                         changes from a liquid to a gas (steam) at a given pressure.
                         Note: Some liquids boil at a lower temperature than water, a
                         principle utilized in binary power plants. Boiling point is also
                         affected by pressure. The greater the pressure, the higher
                         the boiling point. This principle is put to work in geothermal
                         (ﬂash) power plants when geothermal water is brought up
                         wells. Some of the hot water boils to steam when the pres-
                         sure is released as it rises to the surface or passes through
                         surface equipment. This phenomenon also occurs naturally,
                         resulting in such features as geysers.
      Breccia            A rock made up of very angular coarse fragments and may
                         be sedimentary in origin or formed by grinding or crushing
                         along faults.
      Brine              A geothermal liquid containing appreciable amounts of so-
                         dium chloride or other salts.
      C
      Caldera            A bowl-shaped landform, created either by a huge volcanic
                         explosion (which destroys the top of a volcano) or by the
                         collapse of a volcano’s top.
      Cap rocks          Rocks of low permeability that overlie a geothermal reser-
                         voir.
      Carbon dioxide     A gas produced by the combustion of fossil fuels and
      (CO2)              other substances. Note: CO2 also occurs naturally in large
                         amounts in molten magma, which is involved in the explo-
                         sive eruption of volcanoes.
                                                                               167




Carbonates        Rock types such as limestone and dolomite that consist
                  chieﬂy of carbonate (CO32-) minerals (> 50% by weight of
                  carbonate minerals); biochemistry sediments formed in
                  marine environment.
Cascading heat    A process that uses a stream of geothermal hot water or
                  steam to perform successive tasks requiring lower and
                  lower temperatures.
Chalcedony        General name applied to ﬁbrous cryptocrystalline silica with
                  waxy luster; deposited from aqueous solutions and fre-
                  quently found lining or ﬁlling cavities in rocks. See also opal.
Chloride          A compound of chlorine with another element or radical; a
                  salt or ester of hydrochloric acid.
Chloride spring   Chloride springs produce hot or boiling, heavily mineralized
                  alkaline water that is high in chloride and silica.

                  Note: All geysers and springs that produce sinter terraces
                  are chloride springs. Chloride springs are vulnerable to
                  damage from the extraction of the geothermal ﬂuid for
                  other uses, which diverts the chloride water away from the
                  springs.
Chlorite          Family of sheet silicates of iron, magnesium, and aluminum,
                  characteristic of low-grade metamorphism; often of green
                  color.
Condensate        Liquid water formed by condensation of steam
Condense          Change from a gas to liquid. Note: In conventional con-
                  densing geothermal power plants, steam is vented from
                  turbines into a condenser where cooled water is sprayed on
                  the steam to condense it. The condensate can be recycled
                  using a cooling tower to extract more heat. An equivalent
                  system exists for binary power plants, but with the organic
                  liquid being recycled in a closed loop.
Condenser         Equipment that condenses turbine exhaust steam into con-
                  densate.
Conduction        The direct redistribution of heat within a material or between
                  materials in contact with each other. Note: Conduction
                  occurs in any material (solid, liquid, or gas) or across any
                  boundary exposed to a thermal gradient. The rate of heat
                  transfer by conduction is proportional to the thermal gradi-
                  ent and the thermal conductivity of the material.
Convection        The physical motion of liquid or vapor through the subsur-
                  face due to pressure gradients. Note: Gravitational head,
                  thermal buoyancy, salinity contrasts, or other factors can
                  drive convection. Under certain circumstances, convection
                  can result in the advective redistribution of heat (see advec-
                  tion above).
168   BEST PRACTICES GUIDE FOR GEOTHERMAL EXPLORATION




      Convergent plate    Boundary between two tectonic plates moving toward each
      margin              other. Note: Compare divergent plate margin.
      Cooling tower       A structure in which heat is removed from hot condensate
                          through heat exchange with air.
      Crystalline rock    A consolidated rock formed by a mesh of individual mineral
                          crystals that formed in situ; generally implies metamorphic
                          or igneous rocks.
      D
      Dacite              A ﬁne-grained extrusive rock with the same general compo-
                          sition as andesite, but having a less calcic plagioclase and
                          more quartz. Synonym: quartz andesite
      Deposition          The process of natural accumulation of mineral grains
                          through the actions of water, wind, or volcanic activity.
      Diagenesis          The set of processes that cause physical and chemical
                          changes in sediment after being deposited and buried un-
                          der another layer of sediment.
      Diffusion           The natural dispersion of a substance through a medium
                          due to a potential gradient. Note: Diffusion processes do
                          not require bulk motion and should not be confused with
                          convection or advection. Fluids, heat, gases, chemicals,
                          and other substances can all diffuse through a medium. For

Permeability      The capacity of a substance (such as rock) to transmit a
                  ﬂuid. Note: The degree of permeability depends on the
                  number, size, and shape of the pores and/or fractures in the
                  rock and their interconnections. It is measured by the time it
                  takes a ﬂuid of standard viscosity to move a given distance
                  under the inﬂuence of a known pressure gradient. The unit
                  of permeability is the Darcy.

                          mal system and during production. Note: Recharge of water
                          and heat might be by different mechanisms. Recharge of
                          heat has to be by natural means, whereas recharge of wa-

                          km beneath the top of the plug. Note: Many salt plugs have
                          a cap rock of less soluble evaporite minerals (especially
                          anhydrite). The enclosing sediments are commonly turned
                          up and complexly faulted adjacent to the salt plug.
