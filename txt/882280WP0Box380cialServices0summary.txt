          in Africa
Information and communication technologies (ICTs) have
the potential to transform business and government in Africa,
driving entrepreneurship, innovation and economic growth.
A new flagship report – eTransform Africa – produced
by the World Bank and the African Development Bank,
with the support of the African Union, identifies best
practice in the use of ICTs in key sectors of the African
economy. Under the theme “Transformation-Ready”,
the growing contribution of ICTs to Agriculture, Climate
Change Adaptation, Education, Financial Services,
Government Services and Health is explored. In addition,
the report highlights the role of ICTs in enhancing African
regional trade and integration as well as the need to build
a competitive ICT industry to promote innovation, job
creation and the export potential of African companies.
