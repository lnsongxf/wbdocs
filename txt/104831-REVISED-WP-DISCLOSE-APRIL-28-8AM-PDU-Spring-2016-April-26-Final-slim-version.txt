Executive Summary

South Asian           South Asia emerged as the fastest growing region in the world in 2015, posting
growth remains        GDP growth of 7 percent. Weak oil and commodity prices, slowing capital flows
strong amidst         and shrinking global trade contributed towards a deceleration of growth in most
global economic       of the world’s economies. South Asia—as a net importer of oil—was an anomaly,
turmoil               growing significantly on the back of higher private consumption and public
                      investment. Higher remittances and reserve buffers throughout the region offset
                      the fall in exports caused by the drop in global demand. The region is set to
                      maintain real GDP growth above 7 percent over the next few years. However, the
                      tailwinds are now fading —capital flows have declined and remittances are starting
                      to feel the reality of low oil prices.
Aided by low oil      Pakistan, while not growing as quickly as its neighbors, has continued its steady
prices, Pakistan      growth recovery in H1FY16. Strong growth in consumption, rising foreign
continues to post     exchange reserves, fast-growing workers’ remittances and a lower import bill
moderate              compensated for a significant fall in exports. Low oil prices generated a significant
economic              boost, driving a 9.1 percent fall in the import bill and reducing inflation
performance           significantly, in turn creating scope to reduce the policy rate. Private sector
                      consumption, propelled by higher remittances and a loosened monetary policy, is
                      expected to account for over half of FY16 GDP growth.
The policy            While exogenous factors such as oil prices and fast-growing remittances
environment is        undoubtedly contributed to Pakistan’s growth, the policy environment is also
improving,            improving. Macroeconomic stability has improved significantly over the last two
particularly in       to three years, as evident in the steady growth of foreign reserves, reduced fiscal
terms of              deficits and low inflation environment. Further, the government is methodically
macroeconomic         working through plans to improve the country’s grim investment climate by
stability             boosting electricity supply, improving access to credit and increasing tax revenue.
                      While Pakistan continues to score very poorly on doing business indicators, there
                      are some early signs of improvement as a result of these efforts. Private sector
                      credit is showing signs of growth. And structural challenges have not prevented
                      large-scale manufacturing from taking advantage of low global prices for raw
                      materials in H1FY16. Investment is also expected to pick up marginally in FY16
                      after remaining stagnant in FY15 at 15.1 percent of GDP, a dismal figure.
Growth in FY16 is     The growth outlook for FY16 remains modest with growth expected to increase
expected to be        slightly to 4.5 percent of GDP in FY16 from 4.2 percent in FY15, driven by large-
moderate at           scale manufacturing growth of 4.0-4.5 percent and services growth of over
4.5 percent, well     5 percent. The agriculture sector, after suffering a poor cotton harvest, is expected
below the 5.5         to have slowed to between 2.0 and 2.5 percent for FY16, compared with
percent target        2.9 percent in FY15. The near-term outlook will be supported by three major
                      near-to-medium tailwinds—rising investments under the China Pakistan
                      Economic Corridor (CPEC), persistently low international oil prices and the
                      anticipated return of the Islamic Republic of Iran to the international community.
                      The expected growth rate, however, remains well below the 5.5 percent target
                      envisaged under Pakistan’s Annual Plan FY16 and the growth rates of its South
                      Asia peers. A further growth revival will remain contingent on the government

                           making further progress in addressing structural challenges like poor electricity
                           availability, narrow fiscal space and inadequate access to credit.
Fiscal                     Fiscal consolidation, one of the most urgent reform needs, has been central to the
consolidation, a           current government’s economic reform program. And the government’s
key reform priority,       commitment is delivering results. The Federal Board of Revenue (FBR) has
is progressing             posted an impressive 20 percent increase in tax revenue for the first eight months
steadily—the FBR           of FY16 on the back of a broad-based increase in direct and indirect tax
is driving strong          collection. While this is commendable, Pakistan continues to lag in realizing its tax
revenue growth             revenue potential. The tax revenue-to-GDP ratio has increased by 1.5 percentage
                           points over the past three years to 11 percent in 2015, but it remains well below
                           comparator emerging economies and less than half of the 22.3 percent tax
                           capacity recently estimated by the IMF.

growth was                 meaning that the fiscal deficit was over 20 percent lower than that in H1FY15.
restrained in              This positive result was largely due to the federal government’s tight rein on its
H1FY16, leading to         recurrent expenditure, which grew less than 5 percent. Outlays for subsidies also
a much reduced             continued to decline, declining since H1FY13 from 0.7 percent of GDP to 0.27
fiscal deficit             percent of GDP in H1FY16. A positive development has been the commitment
                           of significant resources towards PSDP-related development spending in spite of
                           the broader fiscal restraint—federal PSDP during H1FY16 grew by 24 percent
                           while provincial PSDP registered a growth of 54 percent.
Pakistan also              Also contributing to Pakistan’s improved macroeconomic stability was its

external position,         financial inflows contributed to the sustained build-up of foreign exchange
strengthening              reserves during H1FY16. However, this performance masks the structural
macroeconomic              weaknesses that continue to make the external sector vulnerable. Exports shrank
stability                  by 11.1 percent as an uncertain global economy magnified existing domestic
                           bottlenecks. Imports similarly declined by 9.1 percent during H1FY16. The
                           6.2 percent growth in workers’ remittances continued to compensate for the
                           negative trade balance in absolute terms. However, this steady increase in
                           remittances will come under pressure if oil prices remain low and Gulf
                           Cooperation Council (GCC) countries—key destinations for Pakistan’s offshore
                           workers—cut public expenditure.
…but its narrow            Pakistan exports to a small number of destination markets, making it vulnerable

trade facilitation         economic growth in export destinations and an appreciating Real Effective

trade policies are         Pakistan is constrained by domestic challenges including poor trade facilitation, a

                           countries or East Asia. Pakistan’s import tariffs are also almost twice as high as
                           global averages, putting local manufacturers at a severe disadvantage if they aim to
                           join global supply chains (by importing intermediate goods). 1

has offset a decline   improvement in foreign direct investment (primarily on account of inflows from
in FDI from other      China related to the CPEC), issuance of a US$ 0.5 billion Euro bond in the
sources                international market, and loans from IFIs. However, FDI from other countries
                       has dried up, likely due to global economic uncertainty. Official reserves reached
                       US$ 16.1 billion in the final week of March 2016, an increase of US$ 2.5 billion in
                       the nine months since the start of the financial year. The Rupee remained largely
                       stable in nominal terms against the US dollar with a small depreciation of
                       2.8 percent during the first nine months of FY16.
Inflation was low      While cheap oil imports kept inflation low in H1FY16, the broad-based decline in
in H1FY16 but is       y-o-y inflation seen in FY15 seems to have bottomed out. Headline inflation
now starting to        registered at 3.3 percent at the start of H2FY16 compared with 1.9 percent at the
inch upwards           start of H1FY16. Similarly, y-o-y core inflation (non-food, non-energy) started
                       inching upwards in December 2015, touching 4.7 percent in March 2016 after a
                       low of 3.4 percent in September. However these inflation measures are still
                       significantly lower than those witnessed in the same period last year, likely
                       allowing a continued low policy rate.
Monetary easing        A 50 basis point cut in the monetary policy rate in H1FY16 brought it to a
continued in           decade’s low of 6.0 percent. However, the uptick in headline inflation since
H1FY16 but has         October 2015 has arrested the slide in the policy rate. Monetary aggregates
now been halted in     remained on course, with broad money supply growing by 13 percent during
response to an         H1FY16 compared to 10.9 percent in the same period last year. The government
uptick in inflation    continued to retire its debt to the State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) while borrowing
                       substantially from the scheduled banks, thus expanding the net domestic assets of
                       scheduled banks by 6.8 percent in December 2015. However, fiscal consolidation
                       has led to a decline in government’s incremental borrowing needs. This, coupled
                       with lower interest rates, led to an encouraging increase in lending to the private
                       sector by 9.7 percent as of March 11, 2016 (y-o-y).
Lower interest         The banking sector remains robust, largely because of heavy investment in risk-
rates and the          free government securities. Commercial banks hold about Rs. 6.1 trillion of
government’s           government domestic debt as of December 2015, equal to 43 percent of their

                       asset classes as SME lending grew marginally by 3.7 percent after a downward

                       market analysis, access to data and increased recourse to tax audits. Successful
                       completion of the CPEC will also be crucial to addressing Pakistan’s low
                       investment rates.
Domestic reforms       These structural reforms are particularly important given the shifting winds likely

                       remittances to Pakistan from these countries.
The new poverty        Pakistan’s recent adoption of a new poverty line is a hopeful sign that
line will allow        inclusive growth will continue to be a policy focus. Pakistan registered a
policymakers to        continuously declining poverty trend on the poverty line set in 2001. By 2014,
focus on inclusive     poverty rates fell below 10%, making the old poverty line less policy-relevant. The
growth                 new poverty line incorporates changes in the economy over the past 10 to 15
                       years, and sets a higher bar for inclusive development. The new line identifies
                       almost 30 percent of the population as poor, which is close to 60 million
                       people—as compared to 20 million people who were identified as poor on the old
                       poverty line. This implies the country has committed to focusing more on pro-
                       poor and inclusive development policies.
Stronger growth is     The recent pick-up in growth is encouraging, but at 4.5 percent, it remains
within Pakistan’s      modest—not sufficient to create jobs for the large number of youth joining the
grasp                  workforce every year, and significantly below the growth path that some countries
                       have taken to become strong and confident middle income countries. GDP per
                       capita only increased by about 50 percent over the past 25 years, which is far
                       lower than most of its peers. GDP growth rates closer to that of China would
                       quadruple Pakistan’s GDP per capita within a generation. Given the strong
                       relationship between growth and poverty in Pakistan, strong growth would also
                       allow Pakistan to make a more significant dent on its recently revised poverty

   A. Economic update




   1. Economic growth developments
Amid global           The global economy slowed in 2015, growing at just 2.4 percent compared with
economic turmoil,     2.6 percent in 2014. Weak oil and commodity prices, slowing capital flows and
South Asian           shrinking global trade contributed towards a deceleration in most developed and
growth has            emerging economies. South Asia—led by India—was an anomaly, registering the
remained strong       highest GDP growth in the world at 7 percent as the region benefited from lower
                      international oil prices (being a net oil importer) and relative resilience to external
                      shocks. South Asia is expected to maintain real GDP growth above 7 percent
                      over the next few years. Domestic demand will remain the main driver of growth
                      across the region, and export growth will also weakly recover. However, the
                      tailwinds are fading —capital flows have slowed and remittances are beginning to
                      feel the reality of low oil prices, which is oil-producing economies to cut
                      investment and hire fewer foreign workers. Nonetheless, the region remains
                      sheltered by a strong external position (due to limited trade exposure) and a low
                      inflation environment, albeit with a recent up-tick. On the domestic front, fiscal
                      management has remained a challenge with weak revenue collection in the context
                      of political challenges.

supported by low           from low oil prices, which have reduced the trade deficit (in spite of a notable
oil prices, high           decline in exports) and increased consumption. Fast-growing remittances and
remittances and            rising investments under the China Pakistan Economic Corridor 2 (CPEC) have
CPEC investment            also supported growth in H1FY16. However, growth remains well below the
                           5.5 percent target envisaged in Pakistan’s Annual Plan FY16 and the South Asia
                           average of 7.5 percent.
Structural                 The effects of the high remittances and low oil price windfall (driving such high
challenges prevent         growth rates in the rest of South Asia) are somewhat hampered in Pakistan by its
Pakistan from              continuing domestic structural challenges. Unreliable electricity supply, limited

as its neighbors           Further, Pakistan has been steadily losing market share in global trade because its
                           exports are concentrated in slowing markets, trade facilitation is poor and its trade
                           policy is protectionist and complex (see Section C1).
The government is          The government has made great strides in increasing foreign reserves and has
making progress            recently made progress in power sector and revenue reforms3 but its ambitious
on the structural          reform agenda is necessarily a medium- to long- term plan. (See Section C2 for
reforms that will be       an in-depth discussion on the status of electricity sector reforms.) Given the risks
essential to               presented by the current global economic situation, these reforms will be
safeguard growth           necessary to safeguard Pakistan’s growth. In particular, while low oil prices
                           boosted consumption and reduced the import bill in H1FY16, sustained cheap oil
                           may reduce public investment in GCC countries, ultimately lowering Pakistan’s
                           remittance receipts. A continued slowdown in China will also be damaging,
                           reducing demand for Pakistan’s exports and stifling the recent foreign investment
                           boost driven by the CPEC.4
Investment may be          Investment, a key ongoing challenge in Pakistan’s economy5, is expected to
beginning to               increase marginally in FY16 on the back of increased national savings and public
recover, and               spending on infrastructure, mostly CPEC. Private sector loans for long-term
policymakers have          investment have increased substantially in H1FY16 compared with the
targeted Pakistan’s        corresponding period in the previous year. However, while national savings tend
historically low           to be the most reliable source of funds for investment, Pakistan’s historical rate of
savings rate               savings has been very low. National savings were 10 percent of GDP in the 1960s,
                           increasing to 15 percent in the 2000s but remaining below that level ever since.
                           Furthermore, Pakistan’s saving rate is low when compared to that of its regional
                           counterparts: a five-year average of almost 13 percent compared to India’s 32
                           percent, Bangladesh’s 30 percent and Sri Lanka’s 25 percent6 . For FY16, the
                           government’s Annual Plan has identified a savings rate target of 16.8 percent rate.
                           This, however, seems optimistic given the lack of complementary policies and
                           historical obstacles that continue to persist including high propensity to consume,

                                 remittances and a looser monetary stance. However, recent trends are showing
                                 some departures from historical norms, as the share of the public sector within
                                 overall consumption is growing stronger (see Figure 2).

                       energy supply to the industrial sector.
The services sector    The services sector remains the strongest contributor to growth on the supply
remains the main       side, comprising more than half of GDP in FY15 with an expected growth of
contributor to         around 5.3 percent in FY16. This is slightly better than the 5 percent growth
growth                 witnessed last year and considerably better than the 4.4 percent growth in FY14.
                       While all services sub-sectors are expected to grow, the primary drivers will be
                       transport, storage and communication; finance and insurance; and wholesale and
                       retail trade. In particular, transport, storage and communication, which comprises
                       almost 23 percent of the services sector, is expected to perform well in FY16. This
                       is on account of a hefty increase in automobile (60 percent increase in Q1FY16)
                       and petroleum sales, an improved financial position of Pakistan Railways and
                       higher cargo handling at ports. Communication is also expected to recover after
                       no growth in FY15 due to higher numbers of broadband users, improved cellular
                       and tele-density and lower PTCL losses in H1F16 compared to H1FY15.
‘Messy’ and            A recent World Bank study has highlighted the likely cost of South Asia’s current
‘hidden’               approach to urbanization. While studies have illustrated the potential productivity
urbanization is an     benefits of rapid urbanization, South Asia’s cities have largely succumbed to
emerging concern       congestion pressures, resulting in urbanization that is occurring most quickly in
                       sprawls at the margins of cities (‘messy’ urbanization) and outside the
                       administrative boundaries of urban areas (‘hidden’ urbanization). An independent
                       measure of agglomeration found in 2010 that over 55 percent of Pakistan’s
                       population was living in urban areas, compared with official estimates of only
                       36 percent11 . The unguided nature of urbanization is curtailing the potential
                       productivity benefits of agglomeration, and driving the proliferation of urban
                       slums and poverty. Developing an effective policy response to congestion
                       pressures will be a long and complex process, but the Pakistan government has
                       made a strong start—the Pakistan’s Vision 2025 program places cities at the center
                       of national policy for sustained and inclusive economic growth. (See Section C3
                       for a further discussion on the challenges facing Pakistan’s urbanization. )
Pakistan’s growth      In summary, Pakistan’s economic recovery is promising , but it is fueled equally by
is bolstered by        domestic policy and exogenous factors such as low oil prices. While sizeable
exogenous              domestic growth constraints persist, the government’s efforts to strengthen
factors—more           macroeconomic stability are well progressed and its structural reforms may be just
robust growth will     beginning to yield results. To further boost growth and insure against global
rely on resolving      uncertainty, Pakistan must continue to make progress in its energy sector reforms
structural             and other improvements to the investment climate. Fiscal consolidation efforts—
challenges             which now have some momentum —will be a crucial foundation for the rest of the
                       government’s ambitious reform agenda.

    2. Fiscal update
Pakistan’s fiscal           Pakistan’s fiscal position has undergone a significant consolidation over the last three
balance is                  years as the fiscal deficit (excluding grants) has declined from 8.5 percent of GDP in
improving due               FY12 to 5.4 percent of GDP in FY15. Two factors explain this apparent departure
to greater                  from the past. First, the elected government appears to be more committed to fiscal
discipline and              discipline. Second, the government has prepared an economic reform program with
an economic                 fiscal consolidation as a cornerstone. The program is supported by the IMF under the
reform program              Extended Fund Facility (EFF), which commits the government to actions that lower
                            the fiscal deficit.

The remarkable                  Total revenue performance of the consolidated Government is showing a
revenue increase in             remarkable turnaround on the back of strong performance by the Federal Board
H1FY16 is the                   of Revenue (FBR). FBR revenue during H1FY16 showed robust growth of
result of a                     18 percent, only marginally lower than the 20 percent growth required to meet the
concerted effort by             FY16 revenue target of Rs. 3,104 billion. This is quite remarkable given tax
the Federal Board               collection during Q1FY16 stood at just Rs. 600 billion. Following a Q1 result that
of Revenue                      was well below target, the government adopted quick remedial measures to
                                correct the shortfall before the end of the first half of FY16.12 While these
                                measures were effective at increasing revenue, however, it is worth noting that
                                some may also dampen Pakistan’s export competitiveness (if increased duties raise
                                the price of intermediate inputs for exporters, for example). As a result of this
                                effort, collections from direct and indirect taxes grew by almost 13 percent and 20
                                percent respectively. More importantly, growth within indirect taxes remained
                                broad-based,13 with customs, sales tax, and federal excise duty growing by 33
                                percent, 17 percent, and 15 percent respectively. Sales tax performance exhibited
                                the most improvement, moving from a contraction of 1.9 percent during Q1FY16
                                to a growth of 15 percent despite the overall deceleration in international fuel
                                prices and subsequently lower inflation rate.14 Robustness in customs duties can
                                be attributed to increased tariffs on imported items as well as the impact of


                               12  These include: (i) imposition of regulatory duty in the range of 5 to 10 percent on 61 new imported
                                  items (projected to yield Rs. 4.5 billion); (ii) enhancing regulatory duty by 5 percent on 289 imported
                                  items (Rs. 4.5 billion); (iii) increasing Federal Excise Duty on cigarettes (Rs. 6.5 billion), (iv) additional
                                  one percent customs duty across the board except the exempted items (Rs. 21 billion); and (iv)
                                  additional regulatory duty on imported used and old cars (Rs. 2.5 billion).
                               13 In FY15, Government removed concessions and exemptions within direct and indirect taxes

                                  amounting to Rs. 105 billion. In FY16, the GoP has committed to further removal of exemptions
                                  amounting to Rs. 120 billion. Moreover, the government has strictly limited the authorization of
                                  administrative tax concessions and exemptions through Statutory Regulatory Orders (SROs) to be
                                  temporary and only applicable in a number of exceptional circumstances. Furthermore, The Parliament
                                  approved legislation that permanently removed the FBR’s authority to grant tax concessions or
                                  exemptions, except in a number of specified circumstances in which the Economic Coordination
                                  Committee of the Cabinet can grant exemptions or concessions on a temporary basis.
                               14 Part of this performance can be attributed to increasing sales tax rate on petroleum products over this

                                  period.

Pakistan’s tax                faces significant challenges in realizing its tax revenue potential and thereby, in

22.3 percent of               percent in 2015, it remains significantly below comparator emerging market

current revenues              Thus, a more concerted effort is required over the medium- to long-term to
                              ensure that Pakistan reaches its maximum tax capacity.

Non-tax revenues              Non-tax revenues posted Rs. 366 billion, representing a contraction of 6 percent
fell by 6 percent,            or Rs. 22 billion compared to H1FY15. Although this is not an insignificant fall
due to falling oil            from H1FY14, collection in that year was abnormally high due to the accrual of
prices                        one-off inflows including the universal service fund and the mark-up received
                              from PSEs against the circular debt16 settlement. The revenue collected vide
                              discount retained on crude oil and windfall levy declined for the third consecutive
                              year due to declining international petroleum prices. Similarly, royalties on gas and
                              oil also declined due to a price effect. Meanwhile, other major components such
                              as State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) profits, and Coalition Support Fund (CSF)
                              inflows continued to support the non-tax revenues to some extent.

                          defense spending, and public order and safety expenditures remained almost at
                          the same level as last year. The consolidation effort was further supported by a
                          decline in the subsidy bill—which was Rs. 35 billion lower than the same period
                          last year. It is important to note that this marks the fourth consecutive year of
                          decline in the subsidy bill—from 0.7 percent of GDP in H1FY13 to 0.27 percent
                          of GDP in H1FY16. On the other hand, in a clear break from past trend, the
                          federal government continue to direct significant resources towards PSDP-related
                          development spending. Federal PSDP during H1FY16 grew by 24 percent while
                          provincial PSDP registered 54 percent growth. (See Section C4 for an

                                 (comprising largely of Benazir income support program, which has a 60 percent
                                 share) remained under tight control with expenditure totaling Rs. 4 billion less
                                 than H1FY15. Looking at this trend, it is clear that expense under this category
                                 will remain underspent by Rs. 25-35 billion compared to the targeted allocation of

before the end of                noteworthy given the 50 percent growth in provincial PSDP. It is clear that,

                                 disproportionally on the development side—which has been a practice in the past.
                                 This is a positive development and bodes well for providing necessary stimulus

Pakistan importing      prices declined, Pakistan imported larger quantities of petroleum products and
larger quantities of    crude oil, which grew by 9 and 24 percent respectively (see Figure 5).
petroleum and           Nonetheless, the savings realized from imports of petroleum are neutralized by an
crude oil               increase in the import bill from the non-oil segment (see Figure 6). This category
                        grew by 7.3 percent in H1FY16, though at a slower pace than H1FY15. This
                        growth mainly came from a significant increase in imports of soybean oil by
                        82 percent and raw cotton by 197 percent21, followed by power and electricity
                        generation machinery, fertilizer and insecticide. On the other hand, textile items,

destination             Despite duty-free access to the European markets under the GSP Plus scheme,
markets and             high value-added textile exports witnessed a fall of 0.3 percent against a healthy
domestic                growth of 9.5 percent in the comparable FY15 period. This decline reflected the
bottlenecks             weak economic situation in destination markets as well as persistent structural
                        bottlenecks in the domestic economy. (See Section C1 for further discussion
                        on export competitiveness.)
Pakistan’s exports      Pakistan’s exports are highly concentrated in terms of destination markets. And
are highly              although Pakistan’s export products are relatively diversified relative to peer
concentrated in         countries,24 roughly 60 percent of its export earnings are comprised of textiles and
textiles and US         that share has remained stagnant over many years. The other three major
and European            components are leather products, rice and chemical and pharmaceutical products,
markets                 which together contribute about 17 percent of total exports. Pakistan has not
                        made much progress in diversifying the number of products it exports (see
                        Figure 7). In addition, its exports are highly concentrated to few destination
                        markets. About 63 percent of Pakistan’s exports’ are destined to be sold to ten
                        countries—US, China, UAE, Afghanistan, UK, Germany, France, Bangladesh,
                        Italy and Spain—and over time, the share of exports to these countries has largely
                        remained stagnant (see Figure 8). Among these countries, the highest export
                        earnings come from USA (18 percent) and European countries (20 percent),
                        which together comprise approximately one-third of the total. China, with a 9
                        percent share of total exports, has recently become an important trading partner
                        (see Section C1).



                       21 There has been sharp increase in imports of raw cotton after slump in domestic production —especially
                          in Punjab. Unfavorable weather and pest attack across the cotton growing areas caused this fall in
                          production. Pakistan imported US$ 434 million worth of raw cotton during H1FY16 compared to
                          US$ 146 million in H1FY15.
                       22 Specifically, a decline was observed in iron and steel scrap (-12 percent), jute (-14 percent), rubber

                          crude (-8.2 percent), paper products (-4 percent) and construction machinery (-16.4 percent).
                       23 Rice export — constituting 50 percent of food group exports — declined by 13 percent due to cheaper

                          supplies from India. Basmati rice export was particularly affected with a decline of 31 percent.

                          medium-term, which will limit Pakistan’s potential for export growth. The share
                          of exports to the UAE witnessed a decline in recent years from 8 percent in FY12
                          to 5 percent during the current fiscal year. Furthermore, global prices of cotton

                          exports have also fallen in price and quantity, mostly due to weakening global
                          demand and constrained domestic textile production. Pakistan’s Real Effective

                          Remittances in Pakistan amounted to about 7 percent of GDP in FY15 and are
                          one of the largest sources of non-debt creating foreign exchange inflows.25
If oil prices remain      About two thirds of remittance inflows to Pakistan are from GCC countries, and
low, it is likely that    are currently facing downside risks. There is continuous emigration from Pakistan
GCC countries will        to these countries which, coupled with large public spending in GCC economies
cut public                due to high oil prices in the recent past, has supported rising remittance flows (see
expenditure and           Figure 9). However, many of these oil-dependent economies are now under fiscal
drive down                stress due to much lower international oil prices.26, 27 Given oil prices are expected
remittance inflows        to remain low for some time, the possibility of a further cut in public expenditure
to Pakistan               in GCCs is an important downside risk for Pakistan’s remittance flows. GCC
                          countries were historically able to sustain their public spending in a temporary low
                          oil price environment by drawing on reserves. However, a persistent low oil price
                          may force some GCC countries to dramatically revise their public investments.
                          This occurred between the late 1980’s and the early 2000’s, when oil prices
                          remained very low and drove down remittances flows to Pakistan from Saudi
                          Arabia and the UAE (see Figure 10).




                         25  Remittances in Pakistan not only support the overall current account but have also contributed
                            significantly to supporting private consumption and poverty alleviation. Households that receive
                            remittances tent to increase spending on health and education.

                             generation and oil and gas exploration29. However, FDI from other countries has
                             dried up, likely due to global economic uncertainty. In addition, the energy crisis
                             and weak business environment have contributed towards investors’ dampening
                             sentiments and slowdown in foreign investment. Overall, FDI continues to be a

FY16 saw largely        on banks’ profitability, they are good news for the rest of the economy. Private
positive                sector credit has expanded significantly, with loans for both long-term investment
developments in         purposes and working capital more than doubling in the first half of FY16
the financial sector    compared with H1FY15. Non-performing loans are also falling for both SMEs
                        and consumers. Monetary easing has significantly reduced the average lending
                        rate, although an uptick in inflation is likely to foreshadow a less accommodating
                        monetary stance in the future. The financial sector is likely to grow more slowly
                        going forward, reflecting the recovery in the real economy rather than a
                        continuation of the historic boost from growth in government borrowing.
Monetary easing         Following a 350 basis points cut in FY15, continued improvement in
has continued in        macroeconomic fundamentals during the first six months of FY16 has led to a cut
FY16                    in the policy rate by 50 basis points30, resulting in a decade’s low policy rate of 6.0
                        percent31. However, headline inflation has started inching up since October 2015
                        (y-o-y) and has thus halted the declining trajectory of the policy rate.
Monetary                Monetary aggregates increased sharply in H1FY16. This was driven by unusually
aggregates grew         high seasonal demand for currency in Q1FY16 due to the two Eid festivals, 32 a
substantially           higher volume of cash transactions in anticipation of the government’s imposition
                        of withholding tax on non-cash banking transactions33 and heavy injections in the
                        interbank market (explained below). While reserve money accelerated to 25
                        percent in H1FY16, broad money supply grew by 13 percent during the same
                        period compared with 10.9 percent in H1FY15. A visible improvement in the
                        external account led to a sharp increase in the net foreign assets (NFA) of the
                        banking system. The NFA of the central bank in H1FY16 expanded to almost
                        three times that of the corresponding period of last financial year. This was
                        primarily influenced by substantial official financial inflows34 during the period
                        under review. On the other hand, the government’s retirement of funds to SBP
                        for budgetary borrowing limited the growth in net domestic assets (NDA)35 and
                        also resulted in meeting the net quarterly zero borrowing limit from the central
                        bank under the SBP Act. This was more than substituted by sizeable borrowings
                        from the scheduled banks, in continuation of last year’s trend, expanding the
                        NDA of scheduled banks by 6.8 percent in December 2015 (y-o-y). Despite this,
                        the overall amount of government borrowing from the banking system was down
                        by Rs. 22 billion during H1FY16 compared to same period previous year,

                          In a bid to bring non-compliant taxpayers into the tax net, the government in the Federal Budget
                          2015/2016 imposed 0.6 percent withholding tax rate w.e.f. July 01, 2015 (from existing 0.3 percent)

                           reflecting continued fiscal consolidation efforts. In a positive development,
                           private sector credit also contributed to an increase in the NDA in H1FY16 36 (see

                           comfortably, given OMO cut-off rates stayed mostly above the policy rate and
                           lower than Treasury bill yields. Weighted average yields (WAY) on T-bills have
                           historically remained below the policy rate, however, after May 25, these have
                           largely remained close to the interest rate corridor ceiling rate (see Figure 12).
                           Moreover, the WAYs on 3-month and 6-month T-bills declined by 2.0 percentage
                           points and 1.7 percentage points respectively39 in line with the decline in policy
                           rate.

The equity                       Pakistan’s equity market exhibited pronounced volatility during 2015 with the
market’s volatility              KSE-100 Index increasing only 1 percent during the year compared to 25 percent
has overshadowed                 in 2014. The index fluctuated by 20 percent of its value between 28,927 and
its past upward                  36,228 points as a result of changing expectations on monetary policy and equity
momentum                         market reforms. Market capitalization grew to Rs. 7.4 trillion, of which foreign
                                 investors represent 10 percent.
The corporate                    The corporate bond market experienced an increase in new listing of debt to
bond market is                   Rs. 25 million in CY2015 from Rs. 15 billion in CY2014, however the number of
showing modest                   new listings remained lackluster with only two new issues. The Islamic bond
recovery, with                   market has shown promising signs in the domestic corporate debt market. In
promising signs in               February 2015, the capital market regulator issued Sukuk Rules aligned with the
the Sukuk market                 Accounting and Auditing Organization for Islamic Finance Institutions, aiming to
                                 improve governance standards and strengthen domestic bonds’ appeal to
                                 international investors. Following the issuance of the new rules, Karachi-based
                                 utility K-Electric sold US$ 216 million worth of seven-year Islamic bonds, the
                                 largest listed corporate Sukuk in the country.
The outlook for                  The financial sector has benefited significantly from the government’s he avy
financial sector                 borrowing requirement amidst high interest rates in recent years. Profitability
performance is                   remained high without affecting capital adequacy. However, as the government’s
cautious at best                 borrowing declines and the interest rate remains low, the sector is expected to
                                 witness less profit on investments and will need to resort to relatively riskier asset
                                 classes. Subsequent growth in the sector is unlikely to be driven by government
                                 securities, but will reflect the slow recovery in the real economy. The integration
                                 of the three stock exchanges of the country to a consolidated Pakistan Stock
                                 Exchange (PSX) is now complete, but there is still uncertainty related to
                                 divestment of 40 percent of the PSX to a strategic investor in line with Stock
                                 Exchanges (Corporatisation, Demutualisation and Integration) Regulations 2012.

                                 The debt market may potentially see a higher number of issuances since interest

                                 indicates a pick-up in aggregate demand and improved supply conditions.
                                 Nevertheless, these inflation measures are still far lower than those witnessed in

… largely driven                 Moderate food inflation has been offset by falling transport prices, which are
by both direct and               likely to continue to contain inflation in the near future. Representing the largest
indirect impact of               weight in the CPI basket (almost 35 percent), food and non-alcoholic beverages
food factors                     saw their prices increase by 2.5 percent y-o-y in February 2016.50 As a result,
                                 average food inflation for Q3FY16 increased to 3.3 percent compared to 1.8

   B. Outlook and upcoming challenges




1. Outlook
Global growth is      Global growth in 2015 fell short of expectations at 2.4 percent, held back by weak
expected to           capital flows to emerging and developing countries, weak trade and low
recover only          commodity prices. A modest increase in global growth to 2.9 percent is expected in
modestly              2016, but this is predicated on an orderly rebalancing in China, continued gains in
                      high-income countries, a gradual tightening of financing conditions, and a
                      stabilization of commodity prices. These projections are subject to substantial
                      downside risks, such as a disorderly slowdown in major emerging market
                      economies, particularly China, rising U.S. interest rates, tightening financing
                      conditions, and persistently weak commodity prices. Lower growth and sharply
                      lower commodity prices have narrowed the space for policymakers to respond,
                      especially in commodity-exporting countries, should risks materialize.
Pakistan’s mild       The outlook for Pakistan from FY16 to FY19 is for moderately higher economic
recovery is           growth. GDP growth is projected to accelerate from 4.2 percent in FY15 to 4.5
expected to           percent in FY16 and 5.1 percent by FY18. Growth acceleration will be gradual,
continue              driven by strengthening investment flows and productivity gains in services, large-
                      scale manufacturing and construction. These sectors should benefit from decreased
                      power load-shedding and improvements in the business climate, with construction

                       also profiting from the infrastructure and energy projects associated with the
                       CPEC.
Fiscal                 Fiscal consolidation and a positive external balance should improve financing
consolidation          conditions for the private sector. Provided the upcoming election season does not
agenda is expected     stall the fiscal consolidation effort, continued fiscal improvement is expected to
to continue            reduce the government’s borrowing needs, reversing the crowding out of private
                       sector credit witnessed over the past few years and creating fiscal space for public
                       investment. Successful fiscal consolidation, gradual rebuilding of the external
                       position and lowering of the country’s risk are expected to facilitate external
                       financing and enable the business environment to stimulate private financial flows.
Investment is          Gross fixed investment is expected to increase from 13.4 percent in FY15 to 14.1
expected to            percent of GDP by FY18. Any demand-driven economic expansion as a result of
increase, largely      CPEC’s implementation is expected to be limited in the short-run as increased
driven by the          investment will likely be offset by a significant increase in imports. However,
CPEC                   supply-side effects facilitated by higher power generation capacity and better
                       infrastructure will be beneficial for economy in the medium- to long-term.
While the overall      China’s investment in coal-based power projects under the CPEC has supported
external balance       FDI inflows52. However, slower growth in China and weak global demand,
will likely remain     particularly in the EU, has taken a toll on exports53 in FY16, revealing Pakistan’s
positive, the          vulnerability to a narrow base and high concentration in few products and
current account        destinations54. Imports also contracted in early FY16 but seem to be recovering
deficit is expected    since November 2015, particularly in food and machinery. Resultantly, a decline in
to rise                exports in FY16 (followed by weak export growth forecasts for the next two years)
                       and an expected increase in imports will weaken the trade balance. The current
                       account deficit is projected to increase slightly to 1.3 percent by FY18. The outlook
                       assumes prolonged low oil prices, and subsequently constrained growth in
                       remittances of around 5.5 percent55, chiefly due to tightening fiscal policies of the
                       Gulf, as well as no large volatility in exchange rates over this period. Financial
                       flows, including strengthening FDI, are expected to augment foreign exchange
                       reserves.
Inflation is           Inflation continues in single-digits but expectations are shifting towards a gradual
expected to rise       increase. CPI inflation (y-o-y) has started to rise since October 2015, which has
                       moderated the pace of monetary easing in FY16 relative to last year. Going
                       forward, inflation is expected to steadily rise as the base effect diminishes,
                       domestic energy prices increase, and aggregate demand grows. This may lead to a
                       gradual monetary tightening.

3. Risks and challenges
Further slowdown         Of all the countries in South Asia, Pakistan is most exposed to China. Almost 10

a particular             chromium ores, raw hides, marble and articles of copper. The slowdown in China
concern                  is already impacting exports which shrank by 12.5 percent in the first eight months
                         of FY16. Further slowdown in China could lead to a further decline. Pakistan
                         expects to receive significant FDI from China under CPEC at a time when the
                         Chinese economy is slowing down. The CPEC, if completed, could be a game
                         changer for Pakistan, but is currently facing high political risks.
Reliance on              Pakistan remains one of the largest remittances destinations in the world, and
remittances from         remittances are the principal source of financing the trade deficit. More than 60
GCC is risky             percent of Pakistan’s remittances originate from GCC countries, and this is a
                         source of concern given oil price projections. Remittances from GCC countries
                         have continued to grow in FY16 but at a much slower pace than before 56. Some of
                         this deceleration is explained by the fact that remittances for Eid in 2014 and 2015
                         were both captured in FY15 statistics. But persistently low oil prices may
                         eventually affect public investment in GCC countries, and therefore construction
                         where many Pakistani migrants are employed. It will be important to monitor some
                         of the drivers of remittances, such as government budgets in GCC countries and
                         the resulting restrictions on foreign employment. In a sign of growing fiscal
                         pressure, Bahrain, Oman, Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar are all expected to post
                         fiscal deficits in 2016, likely reaching 16.3 percent of GDP for Saudi Arabia 57.
                         Pakistan should also closely monitor oil price projections; expectations have lately
                         been revised down to US$ 37 for 2016 from the earlier projected US$ 51 due to
                         both supply (Iran, US) and demand factors (weak emerging markets growth).
Elections in 2018        As the election year approaches in 2018, the government may find it difficult to
pose a risk to fiscal    implement difficult decisions, particularly on taxation and energy. This, combined
reform                   with pre-election spending pressures, poses a risk to prudent fiscal policy.
Job creation             Pakistan’s success in poverty reduction is likely to falter if it is driven by

                         have taken to become strong and confident middle income countries. GDP per
                         capita in Pakistan only increased by about 50 percent over the past 25 years, which
                         is far lower than most of its peers. GDP growth rates closer to those of China
                         would quadruple Pakistan’s GDP per capita within a generation. Given the strong
                         relationship between growth and poverty in Pakistan, strong growth would also
                         allow Pakistan to eliminate extreme poverty within a generation.

1. How can Pakistan improve its export competitiveness?
Falling commodity prices and slowing global demand are creating strong headwinds for Pakistan’s export
performance. The steady decline of Pakistan’s share of world trade (see Figure 20) suggests, however, that its
poor export performance is primarily due to a deterioration of its export competitiveness. Diminished export
competitiveness is an outcome of poor trade facilitation, logistics and infrastructure, a protectionist trade
policy, and worsening investment climate.58
Export                    Export performance has been subpar when compared regionally and internationally,
performance has           both as a percentage of GDP and in absolute terms. In 2000, Pakistan’s trade-to-
lagged behind             GDP ratio was close to China’s. Over the past decade, China’s trade -to-GDP ratio

Dismal export                 Lagging export performance is only partly explained by external factors (a fall in
performance is                global commodity prices and slowing global demand) and is more directly
causing Pakistan              attributable to Pakistan’s declining export competitiveness. Pakistan’s market share
to lose market                in world trade has been declining over the years, while that of Malaysia, Mexico,
share in world                and Thailand has doubled, and China’s tripled. Pakistan has lost 1.45 percent
trade                         annually in export market share over the past decade. In an increasingly globalized
                              world where 80 percent of global trade is carried out through global value chains,
                              developing countries are increasingly focusing on trade competitiveness to exploit
                              opportunities for growth and poverty reduction.

geographically and            terms of products60, but is concentrated at the market level leaving the country
labor-intensive               exposed to partner-specific shocks. Geographically, the European Union (EU) and
                              United States (US) represent the most important destinations of Pakistan’s ex ports,
                              with the US absorbing 18 percent and the EU absorbing 20 percent of all Pakistani
                              exports. The technological content of Pakistani export is very low; high tech
                              exports constituted less 2 percent of all exports in 2008. This share, for the most
                              part, has remained unchanged over the past 25 years. Larger export firms (the top

Declining trade               The declining trend in Pakistan’s relative trade performance and export
performance is                competitiveness has structural underpinnings anchored in three areas: 1) trade
explained by three            facilitation, logistics and infrastructure; 2) trade policy; and 3) investment climate.
structural factors            The following paragraphs offer a brief discussion of each of the three areas.
Slow processing               Poor trade facilitation, logistics and infrastructure have inhibited export
times and high                competitiveness and trade growth. Presently, Pakistan’s logistics a re worse than
costs translate to            India’s and the South Asian and global averages. South Asia itself lags behind all
uncompetitive                 regions except Sub-Saharan Africa. Given that more than 90 percent of Pakistan’s
trade facilitation,           international trade is transported by sea and 80 percent of land transport is over
logistics and                 roads, there is a critical need to improve customs and border management for
infrastructure                lowering logistical costs, particularly port operations and customs procedures. A
                              journey in Pakistan takes three times longer than the same length journey in
                              Europe. The typical container dwell time at ports in Karachi (95 percent of
                              Pakistan international trade currently goes through one of the two ports in
                              Karachi) is 7 days, three times that of developed countries and East Asia. The
                              vessel call charge in Karachi Port is nearly US$ 27,000, compared to US$ 2,975 in
                              Singapore and US$ 2,890 in Dubai. Inefficient trade facilitation and logistics are
                              leaving Pakistan at steep competitive disadvantage to regional competitors. As of
                              2015, border and documentary compliance to export from Karachi takes 141
                              hours, in contrast to 20 hours in OECD countries. Similarly, border and
                              documentary compliance to import takes 294 hours, in contrast with 13 hours for
                              OECD countries.
Pakistan is                   Reducing trade costs, upgrading service quality, and improving connectivity
seeking to improve            between domestic and foreign markets can play a decisive role in attaining export
trade facilitation            competitiveness. Pakistan has initiated a series of reforms in recent years to

Protectionist trade    Pakistan’s trade policy has reverted to protectionism over the past decade. The
policy has limited     country embarked on a major trade liberalization program in the mid-1990s which
opportunities for      resulted in reduced trade tariffs, simplification of the overall tariff structure, and
participation in       abolition of most quantitative restrictions. However, gains made in the 90s and
global supply          early 2000s have been gradually losing ground to import substitution policies that
chains                 have discouraged exports. Pakistan is currently the world ’s seventh most protected
                       economy as measured by the Overall Trade Restrictiveness Index (OTRI)62.
                       Pakistan’s tariffs are almost twice as high as the world average and three times
                       more than those in South East Asia. Given that 30 percent of international trade is
                       now comprised of re-exports of intermediate goods, import duties on intermediate
                       inputs used by exporters raise production costs and erode processing margins.
Trade policy is        Pakistan’s trade policy has grown increasingly co mplex and discretionary over

                       materials are mostly free of import restrictions, and products at an intermediate
                       stage of production have moderate tariff levels. By contrast, industries that are
                       competing against imports, especially of finished products, are protected by very
                       high tariff levels. Complexity in the tariff structure is primarily dr iven by Pakistan’s
                       Indigenization Program, which seeks to control and limit the competition and new
                       entrants in specific industries, including through limiting imports. These negative
                       trends have seen some reversal over the past two years. The highest tariff rate has
                       been brought down to 20 percent from 30 percent, and the government is also
                       working on curtailing the use of tariff exemptions and targeted protective tariffs.
…and institutional     Institutional fragmentation within the government has been a challenge in

moves to remove        Commerce, Federal Board of Revenue and Ministry of Finance. Policy decisions
the complexity in      regarding, for example, exchange rate, taxes and refunds are presently driven by
trade policy           fiscal considerations. This partially explains the government’s insistence on
                       maintaining tariffs at a high level given that import duties contribute close to 30
                       percent of Pakistan tax revenues, compared to 2.5 percent in Vietnam and an
                       average of less than 5 percent for comparator countries. Conflict in implementing a
                       coherent public policy is also evident in the delays in GST and duty drawback
                       refunds. Pending sales tax refunds stood at Rs. 97 billion (US$ 970 million) in
                       March 2015, creating a liquidity constraint for exporters.

2. Pakistan’s electricity sector reform—addressing the funding gap
The Pakistan government plans to increase generation capacity by 33,000 MW to eliminate electricity shortages
by 2025. The government has made substantial progress in securing the additional US$ 41 billion required for
generation investment. But complementary investments of US$ 11 billion in transmission and US$ 6 billion in
distribution are also needed (see Figure 25). Private funding will be imperative to closing this gap. To mobilize
private investment, further reforms are vital to address the circular debt, create greater competition through
the development of a wholesale market, privatize distribution and encourage private participation in
transmission.63
The government is          Electricity shortages have long been identified as a major constraint to economic
pursuing a                 growth in Pakistan, and the current government has taken significant steps to
dramatic increase          improve supply. It has raised tariffs and reduced subsidies, while also making efforts
in electricity             to improve the technical and commercial efficiency of the electricity distribution
generation                 companies (Discos). The government has announced that it is pursuing the
                           development of several thousand megawatts (MW) of new generation capacity. This
                           special section looks at the size and composition of the generation investment and
                           the need for complementary investment in transmission and distribution, and finally

significantly              between 2016 and 2025. Preliminary findings of a generation and transmission
                           system expansion plan64 forecast peak demand to increase to over 37,000 MW in
                           2020 and 48,400 MW by 2025 (JICA 2015). Pakistan’s p rogram to increase
                           electricity generation capacity to address its power shortage forecasts a net addition
                           of addition of over 32,800 MW by 2025, sufficient to meet peak demand in that year
                           (see Figure 22).
Increased                  To deliver this program of increased generation capacity, some US$ 41 billion of
generation is              investment is needed between 2016 and 2020 (JICA 2015) and this fleet of new
contingent on              plants will depend upon:
financing and fuel
supplies                              significantly increased natural gas supplies to come mainly through LNG
                                       imports (6,600 MW);
                                      initial development of Thar coal fields (3,100 MW) as well as imported coal
                                       (4,600 MW);
                                      additions from hydropower projects under construction (5,700 MW); and
                                      additions to Pakistan’s nuclear power generation fleet (700 MW) as well as
                                       new solar (1,050 MW) and wind (1,825 MW) installations.

Most of the                      For the 2016-2020 period, funding commitments of about US$ 36 billion have
funding has been                 already been secured. Of this total, over two-thirds or nearly US$ 25 billion is
secured for                      expected to come from the private sector (mostly from IPPs and some from K-
expanding                        Electric). Most of the rest (nearly US$ 10 billion) is expected to be financed by the
generation from                  federal government, donors and International Financial Institutions (IFIs). A similar
2016 to 2020                     mix of investment sources is expected for the 2021-2025 period.
But the electricity              In recent years, the capacity constraints of Pakistan’s power transmission and
transmission and                 distribution networks have become more visible. Figure 23 shows the number of
distribution                     overloaded 11 kV feeders (which mainly serve neighborhoods) has increased by 57
networks are also                percent between FY10 – FY14. During the same period, planned and forced
overloaded                       outages of inter-city 220 kV and 500 kV transmission lines have increased by 49
                                 percent (see Figure 24).
A complementary                  An expansion of Pakistan’s generation capacity will require commensurate
investment in                    upgrades to transmission and distribution networks. JICA estimates Pakistan must
transmission is                  invest US$ 11.3 billion in transmission between 2016 and 2020. Against this need,
required – but only              only US$ 3.1 billion of funding is available: US$ 2.6 billion is committed from the
a fraction of                    public sector and US$ 268 million from donors for the NTDC network. K-Electric
necessary funding                plans a little over US$ 400 million for its own transmission lines. There is,
is available                     therefore, a substantial funding gap of US$ 8.2 billion for 2016-2020. Comparable
                                 NTDC expenditures on system expansion between 2010 and 2015 were around
                                 US$ 1 billion. Hence even if there is a substantial overestimate of the financing
                                 need for transmission expansion, it seems almost inevitable that there will be a
                                 significant shortfall.
There is also a                  The investment needs in the distribution sub-system are smaller than those of
sizeable funding                 generation, but the funding gap is a much larger proportion of the required funds
gap facing the                   (see Figure 25). Figure 26 shows the actual investment by DISCOs in FY10-
distribution sub-                FY15 compared with the petitioned (and NEPRA-approved) investment level for
system                           each year. It also shows the total investment requirement associated with the
                                 coming rise in generation capacity. In the 2016-2020 period, the JICA-projected
                                 investment requirement for distribution is US$ 5.6 billion. Against this

Private funding                 The large investment in generation is chiefly expected through private
will be necessary               participation. Investment in transmission is largely expected to come from public
to close the                    sector financing but on present plans the amount available is likely to be
funding gaps                    considerably less than that required. Whether there is adequate investment in
facing the                      distribution hinges on the likelihood and timing of privatization, because the new
transimission and               owners of Discos will be required to implement investment programs as part of
distribution sub-               the conditions of purchase. It follows that if privatization is delayed, there will be
systems                         continued dependence on public sector funding, which on present plans will be
                                less than the amounts foreseen in the Discos’ five-year investment plans.
                                Underinvestment will lead to a continuing shortage of transmission and
                                distribution capacity. Not only will this result in poor reliability and quality of
                                service, but it also implies that scarce resources will have been misallocated with
                                too much allocated to generation assets and too few to transmission and
                                distribution.
                                If the investment in generation that is already committed is not to be under-
                                utilized, there must be commensurate investment in transmission and distribution.
                                Public sector funding is limited, and so there has to be a change in the way they are
                                financed, which implies significant reform is required. Four reforms stand out as
                                important and which require bold and timely actions.

more attractive to             as long as it remains or there is a risk of its re-emergence, the private sector will

                               efforts to eliminate subsidies will also be needed. A financially sustainable sector
                               will provide significant comfort to all investors.

3. The opportunities and challenges of Pakistan’s urbanization
250 million more people are expected to live in cities in South Asia over the next 15 years. Urbanization
provides South Asian countries, including Pakistan, with the potential to transform their economies to join the
ranks of richer nations in both prosperity and livability. A new World Bank report finds the region, while
making strides, has struggled to make the most of the opportunity. Official statistics show that urbanization is
occurring relatively slowly in the region, and particularly in Pakistan, suggesting that cities are struggling to
overcome congestion forces. As a result, urbanization has been messy and hidden – manifesting in slums and
urban sprawl, and growing most quickly outside metropolitan limits. To address these problems, Pakistan and
the rest of South Asia should ensure that infrastructure, basic services and land and housing markets stay
abreast of growing urban populations. This will require Pakistan to equip local governments with the
discretion, resources and accountability to address local congestion challenges. It won’t be easy but such
actions are essential in making cities prosperous and livable.66

South Asia,                Transformation for Prosperity and Livability, finds the region, while making strides, has
including Pakistan         struggled to make the most of the opportunity. With recent elections throughout
                           Pakistan and a new mayor to be named in Karachi, the ability to concentrate on
                           urban reforms with renewed energy is an opportunity that should not be
                           squandered.67
The urbanization           Pakistan has been presented with an enormous opportunity to boost its
of vast numbers of         development trajectory as its population urbanizes in vast numbers. Urbanization
people can drive           can foster productivity through the agglomeration of both people and enterprises in
dramatic                   towns and cities. This can produce ‘agglomeration economies’, which include the
productivity               benefits arising from, for example, the spillover of ideas and knowledge between
growth through             firms and workers, the better matching of firms and workers, and the existence of
the agglomeration          dense networks of local suppliers of intermediate inputs. South Asia’s urban
of people and              population is poised to grow by almost 250 million people by 2030. This could
enterprises                propel the region toward greater economic growth and prosperity. But to realize
                           these benefits, policymakers must effectively manage the congestion forces that can
                           stifle the productivity benefits of urbanization and diminish liveability in cities and
                           towns.
Productivity gains         Agglomeration economies do not accrue indefinitely. As settlements grow and
rely on effective          become more dense, pressures grow on infrastructure, basic services, land, housing
management of              and the environment. These congestion pressures undermine the exploitation of
congestion forces          agglomeration economies and the ability to compete in international export markets.
                           An economy’s ability to access the potential gains from urbanization will depe nd on

                       livability for many of their inhabitants
                       (see Figure 27). Around half of
                       Pakistan’s urban population lives in
                       slums. For the very poorest in

                       These vulnerable urban dwellers often
                       live in informal settlements
                       characterized by poor construction,

Many of these          There are two dominant features of South Asia’s urbanization that may illustrate
challenges are         why the region is not yet fully enjoying the livability and prosperity that can
driven by the          accompany growing cities. The process of urbanization in South Asia—and in
messy and hidden       Pakistan specifically – has been both messy and hidden. Messy urbanization refers
nature of South        to the proliferation of urban sprawl and slums while hidden urbanization, a related
Asia’s                 concept, refers to urbanization that is not captured in official statistics, often on the
urbanization           peripheries of major cities. The following paragraphs discuss these phenomena in
                       greater detail.
A failure to           Following a process of messy urbanization, a sizable proportion of South Asia’s
manage land and        urban population lives in slums. Cities have grown outward, spilling over their
housing markets        administrative boundaries, rather than upward through the construction of taller
has led to messy       buildings. Messy urbanization is reflected in faster population growth on the
urbanization,          peripheries of major cities in areas beyond municipal boundaries – this is occurring
where cities are       in Pakistan as it is in much of South Asia. The spillover of cities across their
growing most           boundaries creates challenges for metropolitan coordination in the delivery of basic
quickly on their       services and the provision of infrastructure. Estimates suggest that at least 130
peripheries            million of South Asia’s urban residents live in slums and are disproportionately
                       deprived of basic infrastructure and access to basic services. The prevalence of
                       urban slums in South Asian cities reflects a failure to adequately manage land and
                       housing markets. And with growth occurring beyond city limits, much urbanization
                       has been hidden — a growing number of people in the region live in places that
                       possess strong urban characteristics but that are not officially recognized as urban.
Around 20 percent      Hidden urbanization stems from official national statistics that understate the share
of all Pakistanis      of Pakistan’s population living in areas with urban characteristics. An alternative
live in urban areas    measure of urbanization, the Agglomeration Index — which, unlike official
outside                measures, is comparable across countries and regions — shows that official statistics
administrative         may substantially understate the number of people living in areas that look and feel
boundaries, and        urban, even if they are not counted as such in national population and housing
are ‘hidden’ from      censuses. According to the index, the share of Pakistan’s population living in areas
official figures       with urban characteristics in 2010 was 55.8 percent. This compares to an official
                       estimate of just less than 36 percent, suggesting the existence of considerable hidden
                       urbanization.
This is leading to     The combination of messy and hidden urbanization has led to a phenomenon
multicity              known as multicity agglomerations, defined as a continuously lit belt of urbanization
agglomerations,        containing two or more cities70 . As these cities sprawl and grow, they eventually
which present          meet, forming a long corridor or mass of development. Pakistan saw a net decline
governance             in multicity agglomerations from 12 to 10 during the period 1999-2010 as the
challenges but         formation of new agglomerations was outpaced by the merging of existing

to yield enormous      Gujranwala, Gujrat, Lalamusa, and Sialkot. This explains the increase in the average

                       making Pakistani agglomerations the largest in the region. The fusing of existing
                       agglomerations points to an increasingly connected network of cities across South

                                experienced in Pakistan’s cities have constrained both urban growth and
                                agglomeration benefits by making cities less attractive places to migrate to and by
                                encouraging cities to grow outward rather than upward.

To manage                       The strength of congestion forces can be largely mitigated if investments in

right direction        provinces in 2013, have started to re-empower local governments after the
                       expiration of the 2001 Local Government Act.71
However, urban         Most urban local governments in South Asia suffer from unclear institutional roles

are still              uncertain authority and limited power to make decisions for most service delivery
disempowered           obligations. They depend greatly on transfers from upper tiers of government, and
                       the reporting requirements for budget approvals are heavy. Functions and resources
                       assigned to Pakistan local bodies are very limited. Only about 5% of Pakistan’s
                       public spending is undertaken at the local level.
Institutional roles    Empowering urban local governments will require a dedicated commitment to
for each level of      clarifying intergovernmental fiscal legal frameworks by amending existing laws,
government             enforcing them, and in some cases, establishing new and simpler laws. In Pakistan’s

                       as the primary agent for service delivery, local economic development and economic
                       and social outcomes, which may ultimately require legislative change.
Fiscal transfers to    Local government revenue mobilization is constrained by established fees and tax

are significant but    formal discretion over setting local tax rates but are generally subject to strong state
constrained            and provincial revenue regulations and oversight. In addition, most South Asian
                       countries have some type of formula-allocated transfers from central to urban local
                       governments, with relatively large allocations in Pakistan. However, although the
                       transfers are officially unconditional, they often come with higher-level rules and
                       “guidance” on use, limiting the discretion of local governments to determine
                       priorities. Across the region, the key challenge is to design and implement more
                       effective intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

                       government (at all levels) and citizens. In addition, local elections need to be
                       transparent and sufficiently competitive to give voters meaningful choices. Non-

and rejuvenating      national level, how cities are connected as a system through flows of goods, labor,
city cores            and ideas is important.
                      To bolster opportunities for prosperous and livable cities, planners and government
                      decision makers can focus on four strategies:
                             The first is to invest in strengthening transport links that improve
                              connectivity between urban areas—between large and secondary cities, and
                              secondary cities and towns. Better transport links will lead to the
                              development of more efficient systems of cities.
                             The second strategy is to adopt forward-looking planning approaches to
                              guide expansion where it is most rapid —on city peripheries.
                             As a complement, the third strategy is to unlock the potential of city cores,
                              rejuvenating those in decline. The Government of Sindh has started work
                              on a Karachi Transformation Strategy that will ensure a good
                              understanding of the city’s structural challenges, investment needs and
                              priorities, as well as focus on the livability and quality of life of its citizens.
                              For example, a pedestrianized street in front of the Custom House opened
                              in December 2015.
                             Fourth, to facilitate the formation of more vibrant neighborhoods, granular
                              spatial planning approaches can permit greater variation in land uses and
                              development. Such planning should be flexible, allowing land uses to adapt
                              within a framework that takes a long-term view of a city’s development.
Congestion also       Highly congested land and housing markets are exacerbating an affordable housing
requires innovative   crisis and undermining cities’ livability. It is not just the poor, but also many
housing finance       middle-income households, that lack access to affordable housing. To turn back the
and a greater         tide of proliferating slums, Pakistani cities must embark on land and housing
supply of             reforms and foster innovative housing finance. The extent of construction—both
affordable housing    formal and informal—on the edge of Karachi is remarkable, creating longer
                      commutes and the need for increased infrastructure. City and suburban
                      governments need to go beyond slum upgrading and embrace measures to stimulate
                      the supply of affordable housing. Also needed are infrastructure to open up land for
                      residential development, easy-to-use land titling and registration systems, and greater
                      access to construction and mortgage finance.
Resilience to         By concentrating people and property in disaster risk-prone areas, such as deltas,

effects of climate    exposure of people and property to natural hazards. Cities in Pakistan that lie along
change                the Himalayan range are at risk of earthquakes and many are also at risk of heavy
                      inland flooding. The first step in developing a resilience strategy is to accurately
                      identify and quantify the national, subnational, and city risks. Governments at all
                      levels should conduct risk assessments to identify the vulnerabilities of communities
                      and the potential exposures to given hazards.

4. Provincial development spending in Pakistan – the case of Punjab
Provinces have enjoyed a large expansion in fiscal space since the 2010 7th NFC Award. As a result, Punjab —
with a population of over 100 million people—now accounts for almost a third of total Pakistan development
spending. Punjab’s development expenditure has more than doubled since FY11. While such a rapid increase
presents enormous opportunities to strengthen infrastructure and services in the province, it also puts
considerable pressures on the bureaucratic systems managing the development budget. This section aims to
give particular attention to the structural issues impeding the effectiveness of development expenditure in
Pakistan’s provinces by examining Punjab’s Annual Development Plan (APD) as a case study. 72
Punjab accounts          One fourth of total consolidated government PSDP-related development spending
for a large share        takes place in Punjab. Over the last four years, average consolidated government
of Pakistan’s            budgeted development spending stood at Rs. 919 billion, of which 31 percent was
overall                  spent in Punjab. This is not surprising given Punjab is the largest province in
development              Pakistan accounting for roughly three-fifths of the country’s population and income;
spending                 and its economy therefore has a major influence on national economic and social
                         indicators.
Development              Punjab development expenditure for FY16 is budgeted at Rs. 400 billion or 38
expenditure in           percent higher than FY15 revised estimates. This allocation includes Rs. 67 billion for

                         the energy sector with extra weight assigned to resources for Southern Punjab.
Punjab has               Punjab development expenditure has increased significantly during the period of 7 th
directed its large       NFC Award. During FY06-FY10, provincial development expenditure grew by 90
fiscal increases         percent, and this growth accelerated to 207 percent during the period of 7 th NFC
towards                  Award (FY11-FY16). In comparison, the growth of recurrent expenditures of the
development              province averaged around 76 percent during the period under the 7th NFC Award
expenditure              compared to 100 percent growth during FY06-FY10. This suggests that the increased
                         fiscal space which became available to the province during the 7th NFC award has
                         been directed towards fulfilling development needs.

number of new                   increasing portion of the development program consisting of new projects, the
projects in the                 portfolio is getting younger every year. Between FY13 and FY16, the share of new

allocation to them              past two years allocations to ongoing projects have exceeded allocations to new
remains too high                projects (see Figures 32 and 33). In FY16, allocations to ongoing projects stood at
                                53 percent of the total – significantly higher than 38 percent in FY12. This is a
                                positive trend, as it improves the prospects of ongoing projects being completed

Block allocations               On the other hand, block allocations have declined in recent years. This is a positive
have reduced                    trend insofar as it indicates that the planning and preparation of high-profile
                                projects may have improved, and are now reviewed and financed under the regular
                                ADP rather than from block allocations (see Figure 37).
Per-capita ADP                  Per-capita ADP allocations vary significantly across districts. Analysis based on per
allocations vary                capita average allocation over the past three years shows Mianwali district as the top
significantly                   recipient with Rs. 3,606 per capita allocation, followed by Multan (Rs. 3,331),
across districts—               Lahore (Rs. 3,097), Bahawalpur (Rs. 2,644), and Gujranwala (Rs. 2,569). The
requiring further               districts receiving the lowest per capita allocation include Gujrat (Rs. 691), Sargodha
policy action                   (Rs. 725), Jhang (Rs. 729) and Lodhran (Rs. 829). Moreover, a review of the past
                                three years’ average per capita allocations shows that the top ten districts, which
                                account for an estimated 35 percent of the provincial population, receive one third
                                of ADP allocation (see Figure 38). By contrast, the bottom ten districts, which
                                account for about 26 percent of the population, received only 8 percent of ADP
                                funds. To address the infrastructure gaps and lagging economic and human
                                development indicators across districts in Punjab, the Government would need to
                                rebalance ADP allocations even further.

Several steps can                This analysis suggests a number of recommendations:
be taken in the
short- and                                 There is a need to review alignment of the ADP in line with the province’s
medium-term to                              medium-term development strategy such as the Growth Strategy.
improve the                                Setting a threshold for the size of projects submitted for inclusion in the
effectiveness of                            ADP may improve portfolio consolidation.
ADP spending                               A close scrutiny of non-performing projects is required, particularly those
                                            that have not met disbursement and physical milestones for two fiscal years.
                                           It is essential to minimize or altogether eliminate unapproved projects from
                                            the ADP.
                                           Start preparation for an automated ADP monitoring system. Required
                                            functionalities would include: (i) link with FABS for obtaining real-time
                                            data on commitments and disbursements; (ii) capacity to include project
                                            GIS data and data on physical progress; (iii) coverage of the whole project
                                            cycle; and (iv) data aggregation and analysis capabilities, ideally through user
                                            dashboards.
                                           Start preparation of a unified assets register. Ensure that all line
                                            departments and LGUs record all new assets, and start tracking movable
                                            assets through property numbers (ideally in the form of barcodes) and
                                            expand geo-tagging of immovable assets. The Government may also start
                                            conducting valuations of newly completed assets and record them in the
                                            assets register.
