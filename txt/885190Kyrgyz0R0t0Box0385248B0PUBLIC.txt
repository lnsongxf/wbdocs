I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:
       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in the
        Kyrgyz Republic perceive the Bank;
       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in the Kyrgyz Republic regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in the Kyrgyz Republic;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in the Kyrgyz
               Republic; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in the Kyrgyz Republic.
       Use data to help inform the Kyrgyz Republic country team’s strategy.

II. Methodology
In February-March 2013, 300 stakeholders of the World Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic were
invited to provide their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a
country survey. Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President;
the office of the Prime Minister; the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian;
employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation agency; consultants/
contractors working on World Bank-supported projects/programs; project management units
(PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or staff; bilateral and
multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations; the financial
sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent
government institutions; trade unions; faith-based groups; academia/research institutes/think
tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 166 stakeholders participated in the country survey
(55% response rate).
Respondents received questionnaires via mail, courier or email and returned them accordingly.
Some respondents completed questionnaires with a representative of the fielding agency.
Respondents were asked about: general issues facing the Kyrgyz Republic; their overall attitudes
toward the Bank; the World Bank’s effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge work and
activities; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s future role in the Kyrgyz Republic; and the
Bank’s communication and information sharing in the Kyrgyz Republic.
Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the World Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are
identified throughout the survey report.

A. General Issues Facing the Kyrgyz Republic: Respondents were asked to indicate whether the
   Kyrgyz economy is headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most
   important development priorities in the country, and which areas would contribute most to
   reducing poverty and generating economic growth in the Kyrgyz Republic.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in the Kyrgyz Republic, Bank staff
   preparedness to help the Kyrgyz Republic solve its development challenges, their agreement
   with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the Bank is an
   effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the sectoral areas on
   which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the Bank’s greatest
   values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most effective instruments in helping to
   reduce poverty in the Kyrgyz Republic, with which stakeholder groups the Bank should
   collaborate more, and to what reasons respondents attributed failed or slow reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in the Kyrgyz Republic, the extent to
   which the Bank meets the Kyrgyz Republic’s needs for knowledge services and financial
   instruments, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-two development areas, such
   as economic growth, public sector governance, job creation, education, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant of a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, the Bank imposing reasonable conditions
   on its lending, disbursing funds promptly, increasing the Kyrgyz Republic’s institutional
   capacity, and providing effective implementation support.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic: Respondents were asked to rate
   how significant a role the Bank should play in the Kyrgyz Republic’s development in the
   near future and to indicate what the Bank should do to make itself of greater value.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s websites.
   Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to Information policy,
   past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement that they use more data
   from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also
   asked about their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank
   and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in the Kyrgyz Republic, and their geographic location.
When possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey were
compared to responses from the 108 respondents (54% response rate) who completed the survey
in FY 2006 and the 114 respondents who completed the survey in FY 2002. Notations and/or
charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Specific Areas of Effectiveness (continued)
       There were significant differences across stakeholder groups in their ratings of the Bank’s
        effectiveness in four of these thirty-two areas:
             “Anti-corruption”.
             “Basic infrastructure”;
             “Domestic private sector development”; and
             “Foreign direct investment”.

       Respondents from the Office of President/Prime Minister/Minister gave the highest
        ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in anti-corruption whereas respondents from the
        private sector/financial sector/private banks gave significantly lower ratings. Respondents
        from bilateral/multilateral agencies gave the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness
        in basic infrastructure whereas employees of ministries/ministerial departments/
        implementation agencies gave significantly lower ratings. Respondents from the media
        tended to have the highest ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness in domestic private sector
        development and foreign direct investment whereas respondents from the private
        sector/financial sector/private banks tended to have significantly lower ratings. (See
        Appendix B for full details.)

       There were significant differences between geographic locations across two of these
        thirty-two areas. In both instances, respondents from Bishkek city had significantly
        higher ratings for the Bank’s effectiveness than respondents from Oblast centers:
             “Transport”; and
             “Regulatory framework”.

Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in the Kyrgyz Republic, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-two specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results increase.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in the Kyrgyz Republic. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             Social protection;
             Poverty reduction; and
             Education.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in the Kyrgyz Republic, suggesting
        that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key
        drivers from these analyses were:
                Social protection;
                Poverty reduction;
                Economic growth; and
                Agricultural development.

VIII. How the World Bank Operates (continued)
The World Bank as an Effective Development Partner
         There were significant stakeholder group differences in their ratings across four of these
          aspects of the World Bank as an effective development partner: responsiveness,
          inclusiveness, and flexibility in terms of the Bank’s products/services and in terms of
          changing country circumstances. For the most part, respondents from bilateral/
          multilateral agencies tended to give the highest ratings for these aspects whereas
          respondents from academia/research institutes/think tanks tended to give significantly
          lower ratings (see Appendix B for full details).
