INTRODUCTION



Dear Colleague,

Thank you for joining us in our efforts to collect data on student assessment systems around the world. We are
excited to work with you. Your efforts are an important contribution to the SABER program, and a valuable
input into the SABER-Student Assessment domain in particular.

What is SABER?

The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) is an evidence-based program of the World Bank to
help countries systematically examine and strengthen the performance of their education systems. The World
Bank launched the SABER program to support the implementation of its Education Strategy 2020. The initiative
is being led by the Education Global Practice of The World Bank. Information on SABER can be found at
http://go.worldbank.org/NK2EK7MKV0.

What is SABER-Student Assessment?

SABER-Student Assessment is one of the domains of the SABER program. The purpose of SABER-Student
Assessment is to benchmark student assessment systems in developed and developing countries with the goal
of promoting stronger assessment systems that contribute to improved education quality and learning for all.
The World Bank is committed to supporting countries in their development of more effective student
assessment systems; SABER-Student Assessment is a key component of this support.

The SABER-Student Assessment domain uses standardized questionnaires to collect information about a
country’s assessment system in the following areas: Classroom Assessment, Examination, National -Large Scale
Assessment, and International Large-Scale Assessment. The data collected with these questionnaires are used
to benchmark the country’s assessment system, indicating the level of development (latent, emerging,
established, or advanced) of each assessment type.

What is Your Role in the SABER-Student Assessment Data Collection Efforts?

As the person responsible for collecting the data needed to complete the SABER -Student Assessment
questionnaires for a particular country, you have an important role. The information you collect will be used to
benchmark the country’s assessment system, produce a report that describes the strengths and weaknesses of
this system, and generate policy options for the country to consider. The information that you collect will also
be made publicly available on the SABER website.

We are here to support you in your data collection efforts. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have
questions.

FOCUS OF THE SABER-STUDENT ASSESSMENT QUESTIONNAIRES

Each SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire focuses on a different facet of the assessment system:

Classroom Assessment Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information
on classroom assessment policies and practices for both primary and secondary education and public and private
schools. The first section of the questionnaire focuses on enabling factors and quality assurance procedures that
support classroom assessment activities while the second section inquires about the uses of classroom assessment
information.

Examination Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example, country) information on
examination programs for both primary and secondary education and public and private schools. For each program,
the questionnaire collects data on overall characteristics (section 1), as well as the specifics of the last few
examination rounds (sections 2 and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each examination round
for which data are being collected.) The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that do not have
an examination program in place; it collects information that is relevant for developing such a program in the
future.

National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of system-level (for example,
country) information on NLSA programs in primary and secondary education. For each NLSA, the questionnaire
collects data on overall characteristics (section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few rounds (sections 2-4). (A
separate questionnaire should be answered for each NLSA round for which data are being collected.) The last
section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that do not have an NLSA program in place; it collects
information that is relevant for developing such a program in the future.

International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA) Questionnaire: Allows for the collection of general information on a
system’s participation in one or more ILSAs during the last decade ( section 1) as well as the specifics of the last few
ILSA rounds (sections 2 and 3). (A separate questionnaire should be answered for each ILSA round for which data
are being collected.) The last section of the questionnaire applies only to systems that have not participated in an
ILSA in the last 10 years; it collects information that is relevant for future participation in such assessments.




                                                                                                                      3
BEFORE STARTING DATA COLLECTION

Before you start completing this SABER-Student Assessment questionnaire, please:
 Identify the point person on the SABER-Student Assessment team with whom you will work to complete
  this questionnaire. You can get this information from the country Task Team Leader (TTL) with whom you
  have been communicating regarding the SABER-Student Assessment initiative.

 Confirm with the country TTL the level at which you will be completing this questionnaire. The
  questionnaire asks for information at the “system level. ” In most instances, this will mean the country or
  national level. However, it may, as required, also be used to refer to state, provincial, or other levels of the
  system. Please answer all questions with regard to the chosen level of the system, as confirmed by the
  country TTL.

 Familiarize yourself with the layout of this questionnaire. This questionnaire has four sections. Section 1 asks
  for general information about International Large-Scale Assessments (ILSAs) carried out in the system. Sections
  2 and 3 ask about a specific ILSA round that took place in the system or is in progress. Section 4 is to be
  completed for systems in which no ILSA has taken place in the last 10 years.

 Familiarize yourself with the format of the questions. Response options for questions that employ the
  “drop-down” function in the electronic version of this questionnaire are listed in full in Annex 1.

 Confirm with the country TTL the ILSA(s) for which you will be collecting detailed information. In order to
  obtain as stable and accurate a picture as possible of ILSA activity in the system, it is recommended that you
  complete a set of up to four questionnaires, one for each of the three most recently completed ILSA rounds,
  plus any ILSA round currently in progress. In each questionnaire, you will need to indicate the particular ILSA
  round for which you are gathering data. If the information for different rounds is the same, you can complete
  one questionnaire for these rounds and indicate this by selecting the corresponding ILSA rounds and further
  explaining in the “Comments” section of question 2.

 Identify key individuals you will contact who have primary knowled ge of the ILSA(s) and access to relevant
  information. Please provide information on the individuals who contributed to answering this questionnaire in
  the “Respondent Contact Information” section. You are also expected to use other sources of information (for
  example, reports, documents) as necessary. Please utilize multiple sources of information to validate your
  responses.

 Consult official sources. Responses to certain questions require information as published in official sources
  (for example, written policies, guidelines, or equivalent). Please refer to the relevant documents to provide
  the requested information.
 Carefully read the definitions provided and keep them in mind as you answer the questio nnaires. This is
  important to ensure the comparability of data collected across countries and education systems.

 Answer every question unless otherwise indicated. Each question has a “Comments” section. Please use this
  area to provide additional information supporting your answer selection. For a question to which you do not
  know the answer, indicate “Do not know” and note the efforts that you made to obtain the requested
  information.



                                                                                                                     4
COMMONLY USED TERMS


During your data collection efforts, you may come across certain terms. Please find below definitions of commonly-
used assessment terms.

Classroom assessment: The process of collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting information on student learning to
aid in classroom decision making, support future student learning (that is, formative assessment), or judge student
performance at a specific point in time (that is, summative assessment). Primarily carried out by teachers and
students in their classrooms, it encompasses grading or scoring of student work, informal observations of students,
oral quizzes, peer-to-peer assessment, student self-assessment, and end-of-year testing.

Curriculum: The body of material that operationalizes learning standards or goals and guides their translation into
classroom instruction. Includes teaching materials, student learning materials, and learning activities.

Cutoff score: A value on a score scale that sets the boundary between one category and another. For example, the
cutoff score for reaching a proficient level of achievement might be set at 500 points on an 800-point scale. Two or
more cutoff scores can be used to define several categories or performance levels on a scale (for example,
advanced, proficient, needs improvement).

Data processing: The procedures for capturing data (for example, scanning), cleaning data (for example, treating
multiple responses to a multiple-choice question as incorrect), computing scores (for example, computing mean
performance on different tests), and running statistical procedures (for example, computing precision of individual
scores, classifying students into performance levels).

Data reporting: The process of producing communication tools (for example, reports, brochures, online resources)
and communicating assessment results to the public, key stakeholders, or individual students.

Examination: A high-stakes assessment, the results of which are typically used to certify students (for example, for a
secondary school diploma) or select them into further education (for example, university entrance examination).
Usually covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies, knowledge, and skills) of the school curriculum,
typically organized into subject areas (for example, language arts, mathematics). Usually involves standardized
administration of a test(s) to a cohort of students under strict security conditions. School-based assessment is a
special type of examination that uses assessments generated, designed, and/or administered in schools and
evaluated by students’ own teachers. School-based assessments typically involve some form of external moderation
or standardization that ensures at least a minimum acceptable level of comparability across different schools.




                                                                                                                    5
International Large-Scale Assessment (ILSA): Measures student performance with the aim of comparing overall
performance levels across countries or education systems. Information is collected using standardized procedures
on nationally-representative samples of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides information
on related or contributing factors that may affect student performance. Results can be used to inform both
education policy and practice. The best-known ILSAs include the Latin American Laboratory for Assessment of the
Quality of Education [Laboratorio Latinoamericano de Evaluación de la Calidad de la Educación ] (LLECE), Programme
for the Analysis of Education Systems [Programme d'analyse des systèmes éducatifs de la CONFEMEN ] (PASEC),
Progress in International Reading Literacy Study (PIRLS), Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA),
Southern and Eastern Africa Consortium for Monitoring Educational Quality (SACMEQ), and Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).

ILSA administration: The procedures required to contact schools, register participating schools and students, train
proctors, and administer the ILSA to students.

ILSA design: All of the processes that lead to the construction of the final and/or official ILSA. These include creating
the ILSA framework; developing questions, items, or tasks and assembling them into test booklets; piloting these
questions, items, or tasks; and selecting them for the final and/or official administration.

ILSA framework: Also referred to as the ILSA specifications or blueprint (there is considerable variation in how these
terms are used by different people), the ILSA framework provides an understanding of what is being assessed
(domain) and an outline to guide the development of tests. Typically it provides a definition of the domain;
describes the specific content and skills to be measured; and indicates the number of questions, items, or tasks to
be included in the ILSA test. This information is usually summarized in a table of specifications or test blueprint.
Usually based on a learning standards or curriculum document.

ILSA round: One full cycle of ILSA design, administration, data processing, and results reporting. For the purposes of
this questionnaire, you will be collecting data on one or more ILSA rounds.

Item bank: Pool of questions, items, or tasks that can be retrieved for the preparation of a test or, in some
instances, use in classroom instruction. Typically, the questions, items, or tasks are classified by subject area,
instructional objectives, skills, and difficulty level, among other groupings. These classifications make it possible to
retrieve questions, items, or tasks with known characteristics and build tests that match given test specifications. It
also makes it possible for teachers and students to retrieve those that match their pedagogical and learning needs.

Learning standards: An outline of what is valued, recommended, or required for educators to teach and for
students to know and be able to do. Meant to provide clear expectations for students and enable better
preparation and communication among teachers, principals, parents, and education system leaders. They typically
include three components: content standards (what students should know and be able to do), process standards
(the cognitive skills that students should master, such as reasoning, problem solving, analyzing, and synthesizing),
and performance standards (the degree to which students are expected to demonstrate their knowledge and skills
in order to be considered successful learners).




                                                                                                                       6
National Large-Scale Assessment (NLSA): Measures student performance with the aim of describing overall
performance levels in the education system as a whole. Usually covers the main domains (behaviors, competencies,
knowledge, and skills) of the school curriculum or what is deemed important for life in modern society (for example,
language arts, mathematics, problem solving, and use of technology). Usually involves standardized administration
of tests to a sample or population (census) of students at a particular age or grade level. Typically provides
information on related or contributing factors that may affect student performance levels. Results can be used to
inform both education policy and practice, and consequences may be attached to the results.

Performance level: Involves classifying and describing student performance on a test in terms of the corresponding
degree of competence in the domain (that is, subject area, behavior, skill) being tested. Performance levels define
the knowledge and skills that students must typically demonstrate to be considered at a particular level of
competence (for example, advanced, proficient, needs improvement) in the domain.

Private schools: Schools that are not fully owned, operated, and financed by the government. These include
independent private schools (schools that operate completely separate from any government contracts, ownership,
or finance), government-funded private schools (schools that are privately operated but receive payments or
subsidies from the government), and privately managed schools (the state contracts with nongovernmental
organizations to manage publicly-owned schools).

Public schools: Schools that are owned, operated, and financed by the government.

Stakeholder: A person or collective entity that has an interest or concern in education, such as students, parents,
teachers, policy makers, business leaders, teacher unions, parent organizations, nongovernment al organizations,
and the media.
