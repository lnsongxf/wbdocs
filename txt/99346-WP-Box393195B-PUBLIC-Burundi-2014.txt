                                             Introduction
 Enterprise Surveys
 The Enterprise Surveys focus on the many factors that shape the business environment. These factors can be
 accommodating or constraining for firms and play an important role in whether a country will prosper or not. An
 accommodating business environment is one that encourages firms to operate efficiently. Such conditions
 strengthen incentives for firms to innovate and to increase productivity —key factors for sustainable development.
 A more productive private sector, in turn, expands employment and contributes taxes necessary for public
 investment in health, education, and other services. In contrast, a poor business environment increases the
 obstacles to conducting business activities and decreases a country ’s prospects for reaching its potential in
 terms of employment, production, and welfare.

 The Enterprise Surveys are conducted by the World Bank and its partners across all geographic regions and
 cover small, medium, and large companies. The surveys are administered to a representative sample of firms in
 the non-agricultural formal private economy. The sample is consistently defined in all countries and includes the
 entire manufacturing sector, the services sector, and the transportation and construction sectors. Public utilities,
 government services, health care, and financial services sectors are not included in the sample.* The Enterprise
 Surveys collect a wide array of qualitative and quantitative information through face to face interviews with firm
 managers and owners regarding the business environment in their countries and the productivity of their firms .
 The topics covered in Enterprise Surveys include infrastructure, trade, finance, regulations, taxes and business
 licensing, corruption, crime and informality, finance, innovation, labor, and perceptions about obstacles to doing
 business.

 The qualitative and quantitative data collected through the surveys connect a country ’s business environment
 characteristics with firm productivity and performance. The Enterprise Survey is useful for both policymakers and
 researchers. The surveys are repeated over time to track changes and benchmark the effects of reforms on firms
 performance.




 Country Profiles

 The Country Profiles produced by the Enterprise Analysis Unit of the World Bank Group provide an overview of
 key business environment indicators in each country, comparing them to their respective geographic region and
 group of countries with similar incomes.** Breakdowns by firm size are presented in the Appendix of the
 document along with all indicators used to make the graphs. The same topics are covered for all countries with
 slight variations in indicators, subject to data availability. This format allows cross country comparisons. All
 indicators are based on the responses of firms.

 To learn more about the firms sampled for this Country Profile, tabulations for these and other indicators
 presented by firm size, industry, national region, etc., or to obtain profiles of other countries, please visit

                                       Business Environment Obstacles
 The Country Profile for Burundi is based on data from the Enterprise Surveys conducted by the World Bank. The
 benchmarks include the averages for the group of countries in Sub -Saharan Africa and the      Burundi income
 group.

 Below is a snapshot of the biggest business environment obstacles as perceived by firms. The first graph
 presents the top 10 constraints as identified by firms in Burundi benchmarked against the regional average. The
 second graph shows the top 3 constraints broken down by large, medium, and small firms in Burundi.

Average Firm

The Enterprise Surveys collect information
from a representative sample of the
non-agricultural formal private economy. In
addition to collecting information on the
business environment the surveys collect
information on the characteristics of the
firms interviewed. Consequently, the data
collected provides a description of the
representative private firm in the country
and also an estimate of how some of the
attributes   of    the   average      firm  are
distributed across the population of firms.

The first indicator shows the distribution of
firms according to their age measured by
the number of years they have been in
operation.    The    effect  the    business
environment can have on the private sector
may depend on firms’ experience and
longevity. Seasoned firms and young firms
may differ in their ability to successfully
navigate the business environment.

The second set of indicators provides an
illustration of female participation in
management and firm ownership. These
indicators can help assess whether gender
can a determinant of the effect of
regulations on the firm and the level of
exposure of the firm to external factors,
such as corruption, access to finance, and
technology.

The third indicator shows the participation
of the domestic private sector, the
government, the foreign sector and other
sectors in the ownership of the typical firm.
The distribution provides insight into their
levels of equity in the private sector of the
economy.

Infrastructure

A strong infrastructure enhances the
competitiveness of an economy and
generates      a    business    environment
conducive to firm growth and development.
Good infrastructure efficiently connects
firms to their customers and suppliers, and
enables the use of modern production
technologies. Conversely, deficiencies in
infrastructure create barriers to productive
opportunities and increase costs for all
firms, from micro enterprises to large
multinational corporations.

The Enterprise Surveys capture the dual
challenge      of   providing     a   strong
infrastructure for electricity, water supply,
telephone connections, etc., and the
development of institutions that effectively
provide and maintain public services.

The first set of indicators shows the extent
to which firms are faced with failures in the
provision of electricity and the effect of
these      failures  on   sales.    Inadequate
electricity supply can increase costs,
disrupt production, and reduce profitability.

The second set of indicators measures the
efficiency of the water supply for the
manufacturing        sector.***    Many
manufacturing sectors depend on reliable
and efficient sources of water for their
operations.

The third set of indicators evaluates the
efficiency of infrastructure services by
quantifying     the    delays    in   obtaining
electricity,      water,    and     telephone
connections.      Service     delays    impose
additional costs on firms and may act as
barriers to entry and investment.




http://www.enterprisesurveys.org                  Enterprise Surveys: BURUNDI - 2014   6
Trade

Open markets allow firms to expand, raise
standards for efficiency on exporters, and
enable firms to import low cost supplies.
However, trading also forces firms to deal
with     customs    services  and     trade
regulations, obtain export and import
licenses, and in some cases, firms also
face additional costs due to losses during
transport.

The Enterprise Surveys collect information
on the operational constraints faced by
exporters     and     importers       and also
quantifies the trade activity of firms.

The first set of indicators provides a
measure of the intensity of foreign trade in
the private sector. The first graph shows
the percentage of firms who export directly
or indirectly, i.e. using an intermediary.
The second panel shows the percentage of
manufacturing firms who use inputs or
supplies of foreign origin.***

The second set of indicators measures the
average number of days to clear customs
for imports*** and exports. The delay in
clearing customs for imports or exports
creates additional costs to the firm, can
interrupt production, interfere with sales,
and result in damaged supplies or
merchandise.

The third set of indicators shows the
percent value of exports lost during
transport due to merchandise theft, and
breakage     or    spoilage, reflecting  the
transport risks firms face during the export
process.

Regulations, Taxes, and
Business Licensing

Good economic governance in areas such
as taxation, regulations, and business
licensing is a fundamental pillar for the
creation    of  a   favorable    business
environment.

Effective   regulations   address    market
failures that inhibit productive investment
and reconcile private and public interests.
The number of permits and approvals that
businesses need to obtain, and the time it
takes to obtain them, are expensive and
time consuming. The existing legislation of
a country also determines the mixed of
legal forms private firms take and
determines the level of protection for
investors thus affecting the incentives to
invest.

The Enterprise Surveys provide qualitative
and quantitative measures of taxation,
regulations, and business licensing.

The first set of indicators focuses on the
efficiency of business licensing and permit
services. The indicators evaluate the
delays faced when demanding these
services.

The     second    set  of   indicators first
approximates the “time tax” imposed by
regulations: it measures the time spent by
senior management in meetings with
public officials. Second, it measures the
average number of tax inspections or
meetings with tax inspectors in a given
year.

The third indicator shows the relative use
of the different legal forms in the private
sector. Most legal forms around the world
can     be     classified    into  shareholding
companies with shares traded privately or
non-traded at all (closed), shareholding
companies publicly traded (open), sole
proprietorships, partnerships, and limited
partnerships.     A     residual   category   is
included to capture legal forms not easily
classified into the other categories.

Corruption

Corruption by public officials may present
a major administrative and financial burden
on firms. Corruption creates an unfavorable
business environment by undermining the
operational efficiency of firms and raising
the costs and risks associated with doing
business.

Inefficient    regulations     constrain    firm
efficiency as they present opportunities for
soliciting bribes where firms are required to
make “unofficial” payments to public
officials to get things done. In many
countries bribes are common and quite
high and they add to the bureaucratic
costs in obtaining required permits and
licenses.     They    can     be   a     serious
impediment       for   firms’    growth     and
development.

The first set of indicators measures a
composite index of corruption, the Graft
Index****, that reflects the proportion of
times a firm was asked or expected to pay
a bribe when soliciting six different public
services, permits or licenses.

The second set of indicators identifies the
extent to which specific regulatory and
administrative    officials   require    bribe
payments     during     meetings    with   tax
inspectors or in order to secure a
government contract.

The third set of indicators focuses on
bribes to obtain specific licenses or
permits, and shows the share of firms that
are expected to make informal payments
to secure import and operating licenses
and to obtain a construction permit.




http://www.enterprisesurveys.org                   Enterprise Surveys: BURUNDI - 2014   9
Crime and Informality

Crime imposes costs on firms when they
are forced to divert resources from
productive uses to cover security costs.
Both foreign and domestic investors
perceive crime as an indication of social
instability, and crime drives up the cost of
doing       business.   Also,    commercial
disputes between firms and their clients
occur regularly in the course of doing
business. Resolving these disputes can be
challenging when legal institutions are
weak or non existent.

Similarly, a large informal sector has
serious consequences for the formal
private sector. The informal sector may
pose unfair competition for formal firms.

The Enterprise Surveys           capture key
dimensions of the effect of     crime on firm
sales, the extent to which       entrepreneurs
identify courts as fair, and   the degree of
informality in an economy.

The first indicator shows the share of firms
that recognize the functioning of the courts
as being fair, impartial, and uncorrupted.

The second set of indicators measures the
direct costs of security incurred by firms
as well as their direct losses due to crime.
These resources represent an opportunity
cost since they could have been invested
in productive activities.

The third set of indicators shows the
percentage of firms that started operation
without begin formally registered. It is an
approximation       to    the   prevalence of
informality in the private economy.

Finance

Developed     financial    markets  provide
payment services, mobilize deposits, and
ease     investment     financing. Efficient
financial markets reduce the reliance on
internal funds and on money from informal
sources such as family and friends by
connecting firms to a broad range of
lenders and investors.

The Enterprise Surveys provide indicators
of how firms finance their operations and of
the   characteristics  of    their  financial
transactions.

The first set of indicators compares the
relative use of various sources to finance
investment. Excessive reliance on internal
funds is a sign of potentially inefficient
financial intermediation.

The second set of indicators measures the
use of financial markets by individual firms.
It presents the percentage of working
capital that is financed by external sources
to the firm, and a measure of the burden
imposed by loan requirements measured
by collateral levels relative to the value of
the loans.

The third set of indicators focuses on the
use of financial services by private firms
both on the credit side, by measuring the
percentage of firms with bank loans or
lines or credit, and on the deposit
mobilization  side,   by    measuring   the
percentage of firms with checking or
savings accounts.

Innovation and
Workforce

The Enterprise Surveys provide indicators
that    describe    several   dimensions    of
technology use and innovation. They also
collect information on the characteristics of
the     workforce       employed    in    the
non-agricultural private economy.

The first set of indicators measures the
extent to which firms invest in obtaining
recognized certificates of production and
accounting       practices.         Obtaining
international quality certifications can open
doors to technology and innovation and
they also provide a sign of high quality that
may open markets.

The second set of indicators demonstrates
the use of information and communications
technologies        (ICT)      in  business
transactions. ICT, such as the Internet, are
important tools for all firms because they
provide even the smallest of enterprises
with the ability to reach national and
international markets at low cost.

The third set of indicators presents the
composition of the firm's workforce by type
of contract and gender. Labor regulations
have a direct effect on the type of
employment favored by firms and they may
have a different impact by gender. The first
two indicators present the composition of
the workforce classified into temporary and
permanent workers. The last indicator
reflects the participation of women in
regular full-time employment.

  Notes:
  * The sample for each country is stratified by industry, firm size, and geographic region. The level of detail of the stratification by industry depends on the size of the
  economy. Stratification by size follows the three levels presented in the text: small, medium, and large. Regional stratification includes the main economic regions in each
  country. Through this methodology estimates for the different stratification levels can be calculated on a separate basis while, at the same time, inferences can be made for
  the non-agricultural private economy as a whole. For more details on the sampling strategy, review the Sampling Note available at www.enterprisesurveys.org .
  ** Regional and income group indicators are calculated as the averages of country -level indicators in the respective region and income group using country data available at
  the time of publication.
  *** These indicators are computed only for the manufacturing sector.
  **** The Graft Index is the proportion of instances in which firms were either expected or requested to pay a gift or informal payment when applying for six different public
  services.
