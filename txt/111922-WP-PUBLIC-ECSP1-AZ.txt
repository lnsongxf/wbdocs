Overview


The presidential elections were held in October 2013 and incumbent President Ilham Aliyev was elected
for the third term. He won by a substantial margin, securing 85 percent of the votes. This election outcome
was largely in line with expectations.

Economic growth continued to be powered by spending of previously accumulated oil-related proceeds,
although the stabilization of oil production also helped. The non-oil sector grew by 10 percent in 2013,
essentially aided by public investment. In addition, efforts aimed at stabilizing oil production bore fruit and
resulted in an increase of 0.9 percent in oil output. However this stabilization is likely to be short lived and
in the absence of a new production sharing agreement (PSA), oil production is expected to decline over the
medium-term. Gas production will provide some reprieve but to what extent will be evident only after 2019
when Azerbaijan starts exporting gas to Europe. In the meantime, with modest progress on improving human
capital and the business environment and limitations to the public investment driven growth model, economic
expansion will see a significant moderation to around 4.5–5 percent per year.

The fiscal surplus narrowed to 1.8 percent of GDP in 2013 because of lower oil revenues and sustained
expenditures, and the non-oil fiscal deficit continues to be high. While oil production did not change much
from 2012, lower oil prices—which averaged $108 a barrel in 2013 compared with $112 a barrel in 2012—
resulted in lower oil-related revenues. Despite the decline in revenues, total expenditures were maintained
at the level of the previous year. As a percent of non-oil GDP, the non-oil fiscal deficit narrowed marginally to
48 percent in 2013 from 49 percent a year ago, driven by higher non-oil revenue collections. Fiscal dependence
on oil—similar to the dependence of exports and GDP on oil—continues although the government is taking
steps to enhance non-oil tax collections. The 2014 budget signals fiscal consolidation, essentially through lower
public investments, a step in the right direction.

With the announcement of 2014 as the ‘Year of Industry’, the authorities intend to prioritize adoption
of the competition code, establishment of special economic zones and techno parks, winemaking, and
other agricultural products. An action plan for 2014, focusing on the above mentioned areas, is in the making
and will be finalized soon. Such policies, targeting specific sectors, however have a low success rate and
should be guarded against. A modest increase in public expenditures on health and education in 2014 adds to
the concerns that the government’s efforts at diversification might not be focused on strengthening its asset
base.

A. Recent Political Developments


The presidential elections were held on October 9, 2013 and incumbent President Aliyev was elected for
his third term. He scored a landslide victory with 85 percent of the votes while the opposition party garnered
a mere 10 percent. However, the election process was disputed both within and outside the country. The
Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) mission for monitoring the elections concluded
that in most of the regions there were substantial violations of election rules. This statement was supported
by the European Union (EU) and the United States (US) though observers from the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) countries declared the elections to be fair. Protest meetings were organized in Baku
by opposition parties both before and after the elections. Contrary to past experience, the government allowed
these gatherings to congregate peacefully although participation was not very high.

President Aliyev retained most of his team although a few changes in key positions were made. The
Minister of Agriculture was appointed as the deputy prime minister and Haydar Asadov was appointed to this
position. In addition, the Defense Minister (Safar Abiyev) and the Minister of Labor and Social Protection of
Population (Fuzuli Alakbarov) were not included in the new government. Zakir Hasanov is the new Defense
Minister of Azerbaijan while Salim Muslumov is the new Minister of Labor and Social Protection of Population.
Two new deputy prime ministers were appointed although their area of responsibilities is still unclear.

The President declared 2014 as the ‘Year of Industry’ and enhanced the mandate of the Ministry of
Economic Development to include industries and to prepare an industrial development program for
2014. The ministry was renamed as the Ministry of Economy and Industry and is required to produce an action
plan for this year in the first quarter of 2014. In addition, the Cabinet of Ministers is required to draft a state
program for the development of industries during 2015–2020 by April 2014. Some of the areas which will be
prioritized include adoption of the competition code, establishment of special economic zones and techno
parks, winemaking, and other agricultural products. However, the overall emphasis seems to be on sector
specific policies—something that the government needs to guard against as such policies have a low success
rate.

Peace talks between Armenia and Azerbaijan on the disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh resumed
but no solution seems likely over the medium-term. The two presidents met in Geneva in November, 2013
after a two year hiatus. This meeting was followed by meetings between the two ministers of Foreign affairs.
Despite these developments, a resolution of the problem looks unlikely in the medium-term.

production grew by 14.4 percent (Figure 1 and 2). Stabilization of oil production came as a result of measures
undertaken by British Petroleum (BP) after a series of negotiations with the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan
Republic (SOCAR). These negotiations led to technological upgrades and optimization of the extraction process
resulting in output increase. In addition, in January 2014, production started at the West Chirag oil platform
which will provide a small boost to the sagging oil production. However, with the current PSA, oil production
will follow a downward trajectory over the medium- to long-term.

of public investments have been on building the
road network. In the past 5 years the government’s share in total investments has remained over 50 percent. In
2013, public investments accounted for 14.3 percent of GDP compared with 11.6 percent by the private sector.




Inflation


Increases in administered fuel prices and higher prices for food raised the average inflation rate
to 2.4 percent in 2013, marginally higher than 2012. An increase in the administered price of gasoline
in December 2013 raised the end-of-period inflation to 3.5 percent. Price of fuels, on average, increased by
30 percent and this was long overdue since the last price increase had happened in 2007          . Price of gasoline
with octane number of 92 and 95 increased by 33 percent and 27 percent respectively while the price of diesel
increased by 33 percent. Despite these increases in price levels, inflation continued to be below the Central
Bank’s targeted band of 5–6 percent and as a result, the policy rate was reduced. A further increase in energy
tariffs is expected in 2014 and this would have a significant implication on inflation for this year.




External Accounts


An increase in imported machinery by the oil sector reduced the trade surplus to 18 percent of GDP
in 2013 compared with 20.7 percent in 2012. Oil exports were at the same level as 2012 while gas exports

increased by 8.4 percent in 2013. Non-oil exports continued to be marginal and grew by 6 percent in 2013, led
by fats and oil, sugar and tea. Total imports however grew by 11 percent in 2013, thereby, worsening the trade
balance (Figure 4). Growth in imports was led by machineries, which grew by 7       .5 percent, and was used as
inputs in the oil sector. In addition, cereal imports also expanded by 16 percent. The non-oil trade deficit stayed
at 21 percent in 2013, almost the same as in 2012 (Figure 5).

In terms of export destinations, Azerbaijan’s exports are well diversified, thereby, reducing vulnerabilities
arising from economic difficulties in specific regions. Total exports are more evenly spread out across the
world while non-oil exports are largely concentrated in the ECA region and Middle-East and North Africa. The
top three destinations for total exports were Italy, France, and the US while for non-oil exports they were
Russia, Iraq and Turkey. Over the past few years, Azerbaijan significantly diversified its export destinations for
total exports. However, non-oil exports became more concentrated in the CIS countries, possibly resonating
quality concerns.

The current account surplus narrowed to 15 percent of GDP in the third quarter of 2013 from 19 percent
in Q3 2012, driven by the surge in oil sector service imports and the reduced trade balance. The deficit
in services trade widened from 3.4 percent of GDP in Q3 2012 to 4 percent of GDP in Q3 2013. Import
of services increased by 11 percent during the period, mostly driven by the oil sector. Service exports are
dominated by traditional services which include travel and transport, although, Azerbaijan does not have a
revealed comparative advantage in either traditional or modern services. There was also a deficit on the net
income from abroad, essentially because of profit repatriation by foreign oil companies.

Oil and gas related FDI inflows narrowed the deficit on the capital account by 5 percent in the third
quarter of 2013 compared with Q3 2012. The ongoing investments to halt the decline in oil production along
with new investments in the Shah Deniz gas field increased FDI inflows. Capital outflows were led by trade
credits which accounted for 56 percent of the total, along with deposits and loans resulting in a deficit of
$6.5 billion in the capital account.

The current account surplus together with the reduced deficit in the capital account led to a balance
of payments surplus of $3.3 billion in the first three quarters of 2013. By the end of the year, Azerbaijan’s

official reserves were at $14.1 billion, an increase of 17 percent from last year, and covering 11 months of
imports. In addition, the assets of the Oil Fund were at $35.8 billion accounting for 50 percent of GDP, providing
further cushion on the external front.

Azerbaijan did not initial the Association Agreement with the EU in Vilnius in November 2013 but it has
no plans to join the Russian Customs Union since Armenia is now a member of the latter. In November
2013, the EU and Azerbaijan however did sign an agreement on visa facilitation which will ease travel for citizens
between Azerbaijan and the Schengen area and is expected to come into effect during 2014. Discussions
are also underway to sign an agreement on Strategic Modernization Partnership which complements the
Association Agreement and supports modernization and reforms in Azerbaijan, including those in the areas of
good governance, human rights and democracy. On WTO accession, there was no significant progress in 2013.
With Armenia joining the Russian Customs Union in 2013, Azerbaijan has made it clear that it has no intentions
to follow a similar path.




Employment and Labor Markets


In line with output expansion, new jobs were created in the non-tradable sectors which led to a decline
in the unemployment rate to 4.9 percent in 2013 from 5.2 percent in 2012. The number of jobs increased
by 1.7 percent in 2013 and the main contributors were the construction sector, hotels and restaurants and retail
trade. Although there was a rebound in oil production as well, it had no perceivable impact on employment
because of the capital intensive nature of the industry. In Azerbaijan, the oil sector accounts for less than
1 percent of total employment.

Informal employment, however, continues to be a problem. The share of people working with formal labor
contracts is about 33 percent and this has not changed much over the last few years. This problem is more
acute in regions outside Baku. In Baku, formal employment accounts for 60 percent of the total while in the
regions, this figure ranges between 10 and 30 percent.

The marginal decline in unemployment and pick-up in economic growth in 2013 did not have a significant
impact on wages. Nominal wages grew by 5 percent in 2013, much lower than the 9 percent growth in 2012.
Real wage growth was lower at 2.5 percent (Figures 6 and 7). The wage difference between the mining sector
and other sectors as well as between Baku and other regions persisted.




Poverty


The government’s social assistance programs helped to reduce the poverty rate further to 5.3 percent
in 2013 from 6 percent a year ago. Social assistance plays a major role in income redistribution and forms a
significant share of household incomes. All social transfers combined finance over a third of total household
consumption. The most important transfer is pensions, which accounts for half of overall transfers, followed
by the Targeted Social Assistance (TSA) program (one third), and disability benefits (11 percent of all transfers).
The remaining four social transfers (benefits to civil servants, child and family benefits, unemployment benefits,
and other benefits) are much less important. The disparity in poverty rates between urban and rural areas is
not substantial. At the national poverty line of AZN 115 for 2012, urban and rural poverty was at 5.2 percent and
6.8 percent, respectively. There are however significant variations among regions. While Baku has the lowest
poverty rate of 1.3 percent, Guba-Khachmaz has the highest at 11 percent (Figures 8 and 9). The government’s
expenditure on pensions and social benefits accounted for around 8 percent of consolidated expenditures, both
in 2012 and 2013.

Fiscal Policy


With lower oil revenues and sustained expenditures, the fiscal balance reduced to 1.8 percent of GDP in
2013 from 4.2 percent a year ago. Lower oil prices in 2013 contributed to reduced oil revenues even though oil
production stabilized during the year. Higher non-oil revenue collections however helped to narrow the non-oil
primary deficit to 48 percent of non-oil GDP in 2013 from 49 percent a year earlier. The 2013 fiscal performance
was however better than what was originally
budgeted. Against a budgeted consolidated deficit          Table 2. Consolidated budget expenditures
of 6.6 percent of GDP for 2013, the country recorded       percent of GDP
a surplus of 1.8 percent. This was because of higher                                              2012 2013 2014

The decline in average oil prices in 2013 lowered the overall revenue collections compared with the
previous year. Oil prices averaged $108/barrel in 2013 compared with $111.7/barrel in 2012 contributing to the
decline in oil revenues even though production did not change much between the two years. It also led to the
decline in the share of oil revenues in consolidated budget revenues to 72 percent compared with 75 percent in
2012. With robust non-oil growth, non-oil revenues increased in 2013 to 11.1 percent of GDP from 10.5 percent
a year ago.

Driven by increased transfers to the state budget and higher extra-budgetary spending, the Oil Fund
saved only 10 percent of its revenues in 2013 compared with 23 percent in 2012. The revenues of the
Oil Fund did not change appreciably between 2012 and 2013 (Figure 10). However, the government made
increasing demands on the Fund to finance its budget. Such transfers have traditionally financed over 50 percent

but it remains the same as a share of GDP   , at 7 percent. In addition, there is also an effort to raise the share
of non-oil revenues by 4.5 percent in 2014 compared with the previous year. Fiscal policy in the medium term
will continue to focus on infrastructure and social assistance expenditures and on raising non-oil revenues.
However, the benefits from the government’s efforts at improving tax administration and moving to a simpler
tax regime could be nullified by the foregone revenues arising from the variety of tax holidays granted to Special
Economic Zones.

Monetary and Exchange Rate Policies


With inflation below target, the central bank reduced the policy rate by 25 basis points to 4.75 percent in
January 2013. Average interest rates on commercial bank loans in local currency dropped from 15.2 percent
in 2012 to 14.1 percent. However, interest rates continue to be high reflecting weaknesses and rigidities in the
financial system.

With a stable nominal exchange rate and inflation lower than among its key trading partners, the real
exchange rate depreciated by 0.9 percent in 2013. The CBA intervened in the foreign exchange market much
more than in 2012 to maintain the fixed exchange rate (Figure 12). Interventions in 2013 totaled $2.4 billion
compared with $1.5 billion in 2012. There are no plans to move to a more flexible exchange rate system over
the medium-term. The impact of the tapering of quantitative easing in the United States will be limited on
Azerbaijan because of its low reliance on external savings and capital inflows.

is in the form of cash balances (Figure 13). The government is making concerted efforts to reduce the amount
of cash transactions and some of the measures in this direction include expansion of electronic payment
systems, promoting e-filing for tax returns, and equipping retailers with electronic payment devices.

In the financial sector, the main cause of concern is the decision to recapitalize the International Bank
of Azerbaijan without restructuring it. IBA holds 33.4 percent of the total assets of the banking system and
there is a need to restructure its operations and governance in line with internationally accepted practices. In
the absence of this restructuring, it could pose a systemic risk to the banking system and a fiscal risk to the
government. The four-year recapitalization plan was adopted in the meeting of the supervisory board of the
Bank in October 2013 and it envisages raising AZN 500 million.

Otherwise, the banking system showed an improvement in 2013 as measured by prudential indicators.
The ratio of non-performing loans to the total reduced to 5.1 percent in 2013 from 6.1 percent a year back. The
return on assets strengthened to 1.5 percent by the end of 2013 compared with 0.9 in 2012. The banks are
adequately capitalized with a capital adequacy ratio of over 18 percent in 2013. The CBA extended for one year
the deadline for banks to meet the new capital requirement of AZN 50 million.




Structural Reforms


Azerbaijan’s ranking in the 2014 Doing Business report did not change compared with the previous year,
neither did its performance on the sub-indicators where it performs poorly. It was ranked 70th out of
189 countries in the 2014 Doing Business Report (Table 4). This was somewhat similar to last year’s ranking
since the number of countries increased in this year’s exercise. Azerbaijan ranks 10th and 13th, respectively, in
‘starting a business’ and ‘registering property’. However, the country is one of the worst performers in ‘dealing
with construction permits’, ‘getting electricity’ and ‘trading across borders’.

communication technologies (ICT) and has developed other supporting infrastructure to support border control
activities. The locally developed automated clearance system is fully operational. Past the customs gateway,
all information is in digital form, with no hard copy documents used to process or control transactions. To
support and manage all of this, a comprehensive modernization strategy (the United Automated Management
System, ‘UAMS’) is in place and is led by a capable and technically knowledgeable person. However, the
upgraded technical infrastructure has not led to the creation of a more facilitative trading environment. Most
improvements in operational capacity are directed to improving control and border security, more generally. The
government uses its customs machinery to ensure national security, above all other considerations. Support
to domestic industries (protection from import competition) and community protection (product standards and
conformity) are also high on the priority list. Despite all investments on ICT in an effort to automate customs
clearance, there is still an intensive, manual pre-approval process that takes place between the trader and the
approval agency.

Azerbaijan was ranked 39th (out of 148 countries) in the 2013–14 Global Competitiveness Report, an
improvement from last year’s rank of 46. This improvement primarily stemmed from a better macroeconomic
environment in which the country advanced from the 18th position in 2012 to 8th in 2013. The ranking on
institutions also improved from 63rd to 59th. Within institutions, the biggest improvement was in the category
of irregular payments and bribes which advanced from the 110th position in 2012 to 87th in 2013. The ASAN
service centers could possibly account for this improvement. However, unfair competition and monopolization
of the economy continues to remain an issue in Azerbaijan. Azerbaijan ranked 128 (out of 148 countries) in the
pillar on ‘Intensity of local completion’ and 127th in the ‘Effectiveness of anti-monopoly policy’ according to
GCR 2013–14. The Competition Code was drafted in 2004, and is expected to be approved in 2014. The code
was prepared with the aim of boosting competition, improving market access and transparency and preventing
practices which inhibit competition. However, even though the initial draft has been assessed as satisfactory
by the international community, the latest draft, as assessed by international community, is not a significant
improvement over the existing legislation. For the most part, it is just a consolidation of the existing laws and
does not promote competition any better than the existing rules.

A new inspections law was enacted in July 2013 which consolidates inspections by different public
entities into a single system. All government agencies are required to register their inspections under the
unified system. In addition, a registry of business inspections was created under the Ministry of Justice.
Authorities plan to amend the law to exclude the supervision of the banking and insurance sectors from the
overall scope of the inspections law.

D. Outlook



Near-Term Outlook


Economic growth in 2014 will be supported by stabilization in oil production and continued growth in
the non-oil sector, albeit at a slightly lower pace. With the on-streaming of the West Chirag oil platform, oil
production is likely to be maintained at 2013 levels. This, coupled with the signs of a nascent recovery in Europe,
Azerbaijan’s main export market for oil, bodes well for the country. Non-oil growth will be a bit lower because of
reduced public investment expenditures. As a result, the economy is expected to grow at 5.1 percent in 2014.
While a fiscal deficit of 4.2 percent of GDP is expected during the year, the budget makes important strides
towards fiscal consolidation.




Medium-Term Outlook


Growth over the next 3 years is expected to moderate to an average of 4.6 percent a year, with lower
public investments and declining oil production. This moderation will be driven by the expected decline in
oil production, efforts at fiscal consolidation, limited progress on diversification of assets and large scale gas
production still being a few years away. Under the current PSA, the country will face a declining trajectory for
oil production. Gas production could provide a boost but that will start only from 2019 onwards when Azerbaijan
will start exporting gas to Europe. As with all commodities, hydrocarbon prices will also have an important
bearing on the country’s fortunes.

The non-oil economy will continue to be the main engine of growth over the medium-term. However,
it might continue to be driven by the public sector which could run into fiscal sustainability issues. With the
announcement of 2014 as the ‘Year of Industry’, there is a possibility that the government may end up pursuing
sector-specific policies which could be detrimental to the long-term growth prospects of the country. A modest
increase in public expenditures on health and education in 2014 adds to the concerns that the government’s
efforts at diversification might not be headed in the right direction. In 2015, the country will host the first
