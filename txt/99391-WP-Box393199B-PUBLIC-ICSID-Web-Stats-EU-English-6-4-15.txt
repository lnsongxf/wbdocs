This issue of the ICSID Caseload – Statistics (Special Focus – European Union) provides an
overview of the ICSID caseload involving Member States of the European Union (EU). It is based
on ICSID cases registered as of April 30, 2015.

This document looks at cases involving an EU member State as the State Party to the dispute and
illustrates the number of cases registered, the type of cases registered, the basis of consent to
ICSID jurisdiction invoked in such cases, the economic sectors involved, and the geographic origin
and type of investors involved in such cases. It also contains data on outcomes in arbitration
proceedings involving an EU member State, including further information on disputes decided by
tribunals and on settled or discontinued cases.

This document further looks at cases involving investors from an EU member State and illustrates
the number of cases registered, the type of cases registered, the basis of consent to ICSID
jurisdiction invoked in such cases, and the economic sectors concerned in disputes involving EU
investors. It also contains data on outcomes in ICSID arbitration proceedings involving an investor
from an EU member State, including further information on disputes decided by tribunals and on
settled or discontinued cases.

Finally, this document looks at the nationalities and geographic origins of arbitrators, conciliators
and ad hoc committees members appointed in all ICSID cases.

The analysis considers all ICSID cases involving an EU member State irrespective of their date of
registration.

Chart 11: Basis of Consent Invoked to Establish ICSID Jurisdiction in Cases Registered under the ICSID Convention and
Additional Facility Rules involving Investors from EU Member States:


Of the ICSID cases involving an investor from an EU member State, 65% were based on the State’s consent to arbitrate in
bilateral investment treaties negotiated by the State. Sixteen percent (15%) relied on an ICSID dispute settlement provision
in an investment contract between the investor and the Host-State. The remaining cases invoked the State’s consent to
ICSID jurisdiction in the Energy Charter Treaty (10%), and the State’s consent found in the investment law of the Host-
State (10%).
