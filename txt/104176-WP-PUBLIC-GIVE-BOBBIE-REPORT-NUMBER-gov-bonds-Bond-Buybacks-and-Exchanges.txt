    May 2015
Background Note1
This note on bond buybacks and exchanges is part a series of background notes produced under the World Bank Group
Government Bond Markets Advisory Services Program as a by-product of its strategy to support the development of liquid
local currency bond markets. Topics selected have been a key focus in Advisory Services’ work area because of their catalytic
impact on debt market development. Six notes have been produced so far: Domestic Syndications, Bond Buybacks and
Exchanges, Securities Lending and Related Standing Facilities, Primary Dealer Systems, Electronic Trading Platforms, and
Repo Markets.
Bond buybacks and bond exchanges are an essential component in the management of public debt because they can be
used to pursue a wide variety of objectives. The objective of this background note is to review the various functions of these
important liability management instruments and to illustrate their usage with some country examples.
Production of this background note was led by Olga Akcadag. Baudouin Richard was the primary author, working in
collaboration with Anderson Caputo Silva, Olga Akcadag, and Indhu Raghavan, all of the World Bank Group Government
Bond Markets Advisory Services Program Team.
The authors wish to thank Thordur Jonasson, Senior Financial Sector Expert, MCMDM, IMF, and Mike Williams, Senior
Consultant, WBG, for reviewing the note. A special thank you to country questionnaire respondents,2 David Anderson,
who edited this background note, and Aichin Lim Jones, who provided the design and layout.

        1. Introduction



Bond buybacks and exchanges are liability management tools widely used in government
securities markets to manage refinancing and liquidity risks. In addition to their capacity to
pursue different objectives, they are closely linked to the implementation of a benchmark
issuance policy, which is itself one of the prerequisites for an efficient government securities
market. Bond buybacks and exchanges are therefore usually implemented at a relatively
early stage in the life of a market to support and accelerate its development. This is possible
because using these tools may require only focused capacity building at the start.
This background note focuses on the use of bond buybacks and bond exchanges in
the domestic government securities market. The objective is to provide an overview of
their functions and of the procedures that facilitate their implementation, using country
examples as illustrations. The note is organized as follows: First, it defines bond buybacks
and exchanges, and it makes an inventory of the functions that they can fulfill. It then
describes the different bond buyback and exchange methods. It also analyzes their respective
risks and advantages, and it reviews some of the procedures involved. After summarizing
the results of a recent survey of the prevailing practices in Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, the note underlines the importance of
market communications and concludes with a summary of sound market practices.

         2. Definition of Bond
         Buybacks and Exchanges


Bond buybacks enable issuers to retire an outstanding debt before its maturity date against
a cash payment. Bond exchanges achieve the same result but in combination with the
issuance of a new debt. Both transactions are liability management operations. They
provide no additional funding, but they affect the composition of the debt portfolio by
restructuring an outstanding debt.2

  Additional funding can be generated in some occasional cases of liability management operations, for
example, by doing off-market interest rate swaps. However, the additional funding is normally not the
objective of the transaction, and the amount of new funding generated is usually quite small.

        3. Functions of Bond
        Buybacks and Exchanges


3.1. Bond Buybacks and Exchanges Increase Market Liquidity
The principal functions of bond buybacks and exchanges are to enhance market liquidity
and to mitigate refinancing risks. These two functions are closely connected. On the
one hand, retiring illiquid off-the-run bonds from the market offers additional issuance
opportunities, which enables the faster building of benchmarks. On the other hand, the
gradual buyback of bonds as they approach maturity mitigates the refinancing risk and, as
a result, enables the issuance of benchmarks of a larger size. In both cases, market liquidity
is enhanced.
Bond buybacks and exchanges have a wide array of other potential uses. The availability
of additional opportunities for issuance enables increased stability and regularity in the
issuance calendar. The ability to retire from the market undervalued bonds and to refinance
high-coupon bonds enables the correction of market distortions and the ability to book
budget savings. Bond buybacks and exchanges can contribute to stabilizing the market
during periods of stress by restoring price transparency. Last but not least, bond buybacks
can offer profitable opportunities to invest surplus cash. The list is not exhaustive (see
appendix 3).

      “Smooth” does not mean “even.” As a consequence of the time value of money, the present value of longer maturities is smaller than their
    nominal amount. Therefore, bonds can be issued for larger amounts as their maturity lengthens.

      A “rump” gilt is one declared by the DMO, in which gilt-edged market makers are not required to make two-way markets. The current list of
    rump gilts is published on the DMO website (www.dmo.gov.uk). Rump gilts are those that have been reduced in size to less than £850 million
    (nominal) in issue. The government will not sell further amounts of “rump” gilts to the market, but the DMO is always prepared, when asked
    by a GEMM, to bid a price of its own choosing for such gilts.

      Legacy bonds are those denominated in the former national currencies of the member states of the European Monetary Union..

            4. Types of Buybacks



Buybacks can be done bilaterally or with a reverse auction. In the first case, buybacks are
done one at a time over a certain period. In the second case, several buybacks may be done
simultaneously.

4.1. OTC Buyback
An OTC buyback can be done bilaterally or in the framework of a buyback window.
Bilateral buybacks are concluded at a negotiated price. The price, generally not published,
is negotiated by the issuer, either directly with the counterpart or using an intermediary.
In the latter case, the issuer gives a mandate to a primary dealer to buy back a specific
bond within a specified deadline. The DMO then sets the amount, the settlement date,
the maximum price, and the intermediary’s fee. This procedure has been used in Italy, for
example. Using an intermediary has the advantage of potentially minimizing the impact of
the transaction on market prices. The drawback is a lack of transparency.
A buyback window means that an issuer makes a standing offer to the market to buy back
some securities. The offer is valid over a certain period. The price is published, and it is
generally set for the duration of the window.

4.2. Reverse Auction
A reverse auction is the mirror image of a standard auction. In a standard auction, the
issuer sells securities and receives cash. In a reverse auction the issuer buys securities and
pays cash. Reverse auctions seem to be predominantly of the multiple-price category. The
reason is fewer potential counterparts because their number is limited to the investors
holding the relevant securities. The willingness of investors to sell a security is also more
difficult to gauge than their interest in buying it. The securities may be concentrated in a
small number of portfolios and/or some investors may be reluctant to sell them because
they are held against specific liabilities or otherwise fit in the portfolio.12 Therefore, issuers
tend to find it safer to average out the prices offered by the market rather than agreeing to
buy back all securities at the lowest accepted price.


12
     The fit in the portfolio is mainly the result of insulation from market price movements, such as a hedge.

        Exchanges


Bond exchanges can be done in five ways: a tender at a fixed exchange ratio, an auction, an
auction combined with a tender, two separate auctions, and a bilateral exchange.

5.1. Tender at a Fixed Exchange Ratio
The exchange ratio is set by the DMO. Different types of exchange ratios have been used:
for example, a dirty price destination bond/dirty price source bond (Denmark, Ireland,
Sweden, and the United Kingdom) or clean price destination bond/dirty price source bond
(Belgium).
Fixed-spread ratios are attractive to both investors and traders. Investors have no winner’s
curse risk. Traders are effectively offered a call option at a fixed spread by the issuer.
The market risk—the risk of an adverse change in market prices while processing the
operation—is borne by the issuer.

5.2. Auction
The exchange ratio is set by the market. Bids can be submitted according to two different
formats. Either the DMO sets the clean price of the source bond and the market bids a clean
price for the destination bond (e.g., Australia, Denmark, Hungary, Poland, Sweden, the
United Kingdom), or the DMO sets the price of the destination bond and the market bids
a clean price for the source bond (e.g.,, the Netherlands, Slovenia, Spain). The exchange
ratio is generally calculated using dirty prices. The objective is to make a cash-neutral
settlement. Market practice varies as to whether the auction is a single price (Belgium,
Denmark, Spain, the United Kingdom) or multiple prices (Finland, Sweden, the United
Kingdom).
The advantage for the issuer of an auction over a fixed-price exchange is that the auction
creates no market risk; the risk is borne by the bidders. The size of the transaction can also
be larger than in a fixed price exchange because the issuer can adjust the price to the level
asked by the market.

     is unsuccessful, the issuer will have issued larger volume              the counterpart.
     than what was required. For investors wanting to exchange
     their old bonds for new it also presents a risk, because if
     they are unsuccessful in either the sell or the buyback, they
     will need to adjust their positions in the secondary market,
     which implies a market risk that they would increase the
     borrowing cost.




     13
        A bond exchange attracts only those investors who are interested both in selling the old bond and in acquiring the new one (although a PD
     an intermediate between different groups). By contrast, a bond buyback attracts all investors interested in selling, and an auction attracts
     all investors interested in buying, the relevant security. The two groups of investors need not overlap.

        6. Risks Common to Bond
        Buybacks and Exchanges



Three risks are common to both procedures: first, the risk of market price manipulation
after the announcement of the operation; second, the budgetary cost if a premium has to be
paid to obtain a significant amount of the source bond; and, third, the possibility of locking
in an unattractive forward rate for the acquired bond.
An additional risk is the lack of market interest. The DMO then has a “reputation risk”
(image risk) if the operation is not successful. To manage market expectations, many DMOs
announce that they have no target amount to exchange or buy back because their principal
concern is to be of service to investors by offering them an efficient way to rebalance their
securities portfolio.
When retiring a bond from the market, a few DMOs inform the market that they will
maintain a sufficient size of the outstanding bond to ensure a minimum tradability. Such
an announcement is fair to the extent that a DMO may wish to avoid giving investors
the sentiment that they are being trapped. At the same time, the announcement can be
counterproductive because the risk of confronting an altogether illiquid market is an
incentive for investors to sell the relevant securities. The offer of a buyback window for
investors who want to sell after bond buyback and exchange operations have ended is
perhaps a better procedure. It offers investors a way out, but the price is at the DMO’s
discretion.

                   7. Respective Advantages
                   and Drawbacks of Bond
                   Buybacks and Exchanges

           Buybacks have two advantages relative to bond exchanges. They are an easier and more
           flexible procedure. They are also a more powerful instrument because they can attract a
           wider investor base. Any investor holding the relevant security is a potential seller. By
           contrast, investors participating in a bond exchange have to have an interest both in selling
           the source bond and in buying the destination bond (it requires an efficient PD system
           to make the link between the two categories of investors by standing in between them).
           However, buybacks create two risks for the DMO: a refinancing risk and an unknown
           exchange ratio when the bond buyback is followed by the auction of a benchmark to fund
           the operation.
           Bond exchanges also have some advantages. The issuer bears no refinancing risk. The
           investors have no execution risk because the reinvestment of their funds is automatic.
           Exchanges may help investors in restructuring their portfolio (e.g., when a bond is included
           in a bond index and is bid strongly as a result). However, an exchange alters the duration
           of the debt when the two bonds involved do not have a similar remaining life to maturity.
           Altering the duration of the debt portfolio through an exchange may be an explicit goal
           of the DMO (e.g., to lengthen the duration of the debt portfolio). However, it can also
           be an unintended consequence of the operation, in which case investors may be reluctant
           to utilize exchanges to avoid any unintended alteration of the duration of their portfolio.
           Bond exchanges are thus more complex transactions.
                                                                     8. Procedures                19




            8. Procedures


An issue specific to bond exchanges is the number of bonds included in the exchange. Market
practice varies from one source bond to multiple destination bonds (e.g., Belgium during
the 1990s: one short-dated source bond against up to eight destination bonds) to a 1:1 ratio
(the Netherlands, Sweden, the United Kingdom). A 2:1 ratio is applied in Ireland and Spain.
Four procedural items are common to buybacks and exchanges: the timing of the
announcement, the eligible participants, the price-setting reference, and the accounting.

8.1. Timing of the Announcement
A widespread practice is to inform the market that the DMO is ready to repurchase bonds
with a short14 remaining life to maturity (Belgium, Finland, Sweden, the United Kingdom)
and/or to repurchase off-the-run illiquid bonds that have a relatively small amount
outstanding (Italy, the United Kingdom).
Other practiced procedures are an annual calendar of planned operations (Belgium up
to 1998), three weeks’ advance notice (the United Kingdom), one week’s advance notice
(Finland, Sweden), and two days’ advance notice (Ireland).

8.2. Eligible Participants
The most common practice is to limit participation in a buyback or exchange event to the
primary dealers (PDs). All holders of bonds must then submit their bids through a PD.
However, there are exceptions. For example, in Denmark, all entities authorized to trade
on the Copenhagen Exchange are eligible to participate. In Spain, all market members can
participate, although some extra time to bid is given to PDs. In the United Kingdom there
is a distinction between conversions, which seek to exchange all an outstanding bond and
are open to all holders, and switch auctions, which are partial conversions only and aim to
leave the source bonds sufficiently liquid; in those cases it is only PDs who participate. Full
conversions have been done in the United Kingdom on an exceptional basis, and they seem
to have been discontinued in the late 1990s.

     In the euro zone, the European System of Accounts provides
     that the amount of capital gains and losses on bonds
     issued earlier and bought back or exchanged (hereinafter
     referred to as “old bond”) is recognized up front in the
     outstanding amount of the debt. This regime is consistent
     with the accounting of the public debt on a nominal basis,
     as opposed to a mark-to-market basis. The cancellation
     of the old bond is considered to be a financial transaction
     neutral to the budget balance. By contrast, the premium
     or discount on the new bond is accounted for as interest,
     and it is prorated over the life of the bond. The accounting
     procedure implemented at the Belgian Debt Agency for
     capital gains and losses is appended as an illustration (see
     appendix 1).

        9. Prevailing Practices in
        OECD Countries


The OECD15 conducted a survey in 2011 of 33 of its 34 member countries to enquire
about their practices with respect to bond buybacks and exchanges. The main conclusions
of the survey are summarized below.
A significant majority of countries use bond buybacks and exchanges (29 out of 33 or 88
percent). The percentages mentioned below are expressed by reference to the 29 countries
that use bond buybacks and exchanges. Bond buybacks are used more often than exchanges
(85 percent versus 55 percent; many countries use both tools). Transactions are done on
an ad hoc basis more often than on a regular basis (68 percent for bond buybacks and
61 percent for bond exchanges). Auctions are the most used mechanism for both bond
buybacks and exchanges. For bond exchanges, auctions are used by close to 100 percent
with a small number of countries using simultaneously other mechanisms.16 For bond
buybacks, 54 percent use reverse auctions versus 46 percent OTC. Multiple-price auctions
seem to prevail over uniform-price auctions (no global percentages are reported). Ad hoc
transactions prevail over calendar announcements (61 percent for bond exchange, 68
percent for bond buyback).
For bond exchanges, DMOs set the price of the source bond more often than the price of
the destination bond (11 DMO versus five). The average reduction in the refinancing risk
on the final maturity date of large benchmark bonds is between 30 and 40 percent of the
total issued amount.

        10. Importance of
        Communication


Good internal and external communications are a prerequisite for the success of the
transactions. Within the government, the key requirements are internal approval and buy-
in, uniformity of message, and consistency of the contemplated strategy with the overall
borrowing plan and budget planning. Outside the government, the market has to be
prepared and educated. Investors have to understand the DMO’s strategy, the instruments,
and the benefits of the transactions for them. The DMO should consult the market,
about both procedures in general and specific proposals, to keep abreast of its needs and
expectations.
A clear announcement of policy is particularly important. As an illustration, the Belgian
Debt Agency (BDA) ensures that the market is well aware of two standing rules. First, any
bond with a remaining life to maturity equal to, or less than, 12 months can be subject to
repurchase or exchange by the government. Second, the BDA will assess the quality of the
prices offered by the market by reference to the price levels prevailing in the market before
the announcement of the transaction. The implicit message is that there is no point in
trying to manipulate market prices.

        11. Policy Issues



11.1. Legal
The public debt law has to include bond buybacks and exchanges among the authorized
purposes for borrowing. The law should also define the objectives to be pursued by the
transactions, preferably in an indicative manner. There are many possible objectives, and a
limitative list might not be exhaustive.

11.2. Institutional
The authority to execute the transactions has to be delegated by the Minister of Fiannce
to the DMO. The delegation includes the determination of the objective pursued by any
specific transactions being considered. This will in turn determine which securities should
be retired from the market by priority and which mechanism should be used. In practice,
the selection of the mechanism and of the relevant securities is often made following the
same procedure as for bond issuance, and the pricing is decided by the same committee as
the one in charge of pricing at the auctions.
                                                 12. Sound Market Practices                      27




        12. Sound Market
        Practices


No “one-size-fits-all” procedure is found in government securities markets. Yet some
procedures seem to often work well and can therefore be considered as sound market
practices. The objective of this section is to review these procedures

12.1. Bond Buyback and Bond Exchange Policy
The DMO is transparent about the objectives pursued and the mechanics of the procedure.
Specifically, the DMO informs the market about three things: first, that the primary
objective of these operations is either to increase market liquidity by issuing benchmarks to
retire illiquid bonds from the market or to smoothen the redemption profile of public debt
by reducing the amount outstanding of large bonds with a short remaining life to maturity;
second, for illiquid bonds, that the securities selected for the operations will usually be
chosen by the DMO after consulting with the market (i.e., PDs in countries that have a
PD system); and, third, for bonds with a large amount outstanding and a short remaining
life to maturity, the securities may begin to be bought back or exchanged a certain number
of months (usually 12) before their maturity date.12.2. Calendar
The decision as to whether transactions should be implemented on a calendar or on an
ad hoc basis is country specific. Transactions on an ad hoc basis dominate in mature
government securities markets presumably because few illiquid bonds are left in the debt
portfolio and DMOs have the adequate means (technical and know-how) to buy back
OTC bonds with a large amount outstanding and a short remaining life to maturity. They
may nevertheless indicate their general intention in the annual strategy or financing plan, or
in regular market consultations. For the other government securities markets, the number
of bonds involved in the buyback or exchange program may help in making the choice. A
calendar may be appropriate to streamline frequent transactions. If not, transactions done
on an ad hoc basis have the advantage of providing flexibility.

     standard auctions follow the uniform-price system, DMOs
     should consult market participants about the potential
     merits of standardization, as for bond exchange auctions
     (see previous paragraph). In countries with a PD system,
     the prevailing market practice is that only PDs have direct
     access to the auctions, the same as for a bond exchange.




     17
        The price of the benchmark that will be issued in the framework of the exchange is easier to determine when the benchmark has recently
     been auctioned.

        For example, exchanges during the first six months followed by buybacks during the next six months.

            A new bond is issued at 98 to buy back an old bond at 104.
            The nominal value of both bonds = 100
            The cash shortfall is financed by the issuance at par of a short-term security of 6.

            •	 New bond issued: 100                           •	 Old bond cancelled: (104)
            •	 Old bond cancelled: (100)                      •	 New security: 6

            Appendix 2: Benchmark
            Features and Development
            Techniques


1. Introduction
Building benchmarks requires a comprehensive debt management strategy. Both issuance
policy and liability management operations are involved in the process. For emerging
markets, several reforms are typically required in both the primary and the secondary
markets.

2. Importance of Market Liquidity
A market is liquid when a large value of securities can be bought or sold promptly, at little
cost and with no significant impact on market prices. In other words, a security is liquid
when it can be easily converted into cash and vice versa.
Investors are willing to pay a premium to buy securities that are liquid. They allow a more
flexible investment strategy than securities that are difficult to acquire or to sell. Since the
yield of a fixed-income security decreases when its price rises, DMOs have a vested interest
in enhancing the liquidity of their government securities market because this reduces their
funding cost.
Several prerequisites have to be met for a market to be liquid. A security is liquid when it
is widely traded. For a security to be widely traded, it must be easy for investors to find
a matching trading interest. To simplify the matching of trading interests, the amount
outstanding of the relevant security must be large, and the price must be easy to determine
(“price transparency”). One of the advantages of issuing benchmark bonds is to enhance
the price transparency of other bonds.

3. Definition of a Benchmark Bond
A benchmark bond19 is a standard against which the yield of other bonds can be measured.
For example, if a five-year bond yields 5 percent and a six-year bond yields 5.25 percent, and
if the five-year bond is a benchmark, then the yield of the six-year bond can be expressed
as “benchmark + 0.25 percent.”


19
     The word “bond” is used here as a shortcut for “security.” A Tbill can also be a benchmark..

     The purpose of expressing the yield of a bond by reference                  3.	Ideally, a market-maker program should be put in place
     to a standard is linked to the difference between the level                    to maximize liquidity and price transparency.
     and the shape of a yield curve. The level of a yield curve is
     volatile as interest rates fluctuate up or down. By contrast,               4.	Risks created by large benchmarks need to be managed.

        A transition period may be needed for a bond to reach benchmark size.

        There is also a technical justupon. This implies that the market price of the bond will be at, or close to, par. In general, only recently issued
     bonds quote at, or close to, par.
