     Box 1: Kenyan Licensing Regime
     Like its regional counterparts in Rwanda, Uganda and Tanzania the CCK has adopted a technology neutral
     unified licensing framework (ULF). Network operators and service providers are licensed under a market
     structure consisting of the following broad market segments:-

     Network Facilities Provider (NFP) - Licensees under this category can own and operate any form of
     communications infrastructure (based on satellite, terrestrial, mobile or fixed). The NFP category is further
     divided into National NFP and International NFP. Investors who wish to land a submarine cable in Kenya
     require a Submarine Cable Land license while those interested in building system for the provision of
     international voice/data services are required to get a license for international Systems and Services. An
     International NFP (Incl. submarine cables and international gateway facilities) costs KHS 15 million as an
     initial fee, and the higher of 0.5% of Annual Gross Turnover or KES 5 million (US$ 60,170) per annum. The
     spectrum fee payable is based on bandwidth and coverage.

     National NFP are described based on the use of spectrum. National NFPs are further identified as Tier 1
     (exclusive use of spectrum countrywide), Tier 2 (exclusive use of spectrum regionally) and Tier 3 (exclusive
     utilization of spectrum by Administrative District). The initial license fee for Tier 1 and Tier 2 NFP licenses is
     KES 15 million; the fee for Tier 3 NFP licenses is KES 200,000. (US$ 2400) In addition a spectrum fee is
     payable based on bandwidth and coverage.

     Applications Service Provider (ASP) - Licensees under this category are permitted to provide services to
     end users using the network services of a facilities provider (NFP). The initial license fee is KES 100,000, and
     an annual fee of the higher of KES 100,000 (US$1200) and 0.5 percent of Annual Gross Turnover is payable.

     Content Services Provider (CSP) - Licensees under this category can provide content services material,
     information services and data processing services. The initial license fee is KES 100,000 (US$1200) and an
     annual fee of the higher of KES 100,000(US$1200) and 0.5 percent of Annual Gross Turnover is payable.

     Box 4: BPO Bandwidth Capacity Support

     The Kenya ICT Board supports the Local BPO industry by providing bandwidth capacity support
     funding. The purpose of this capacity support is to reduce the cost of bandwidth making local
     operators competitive on a global scale. The BPO “Bandwidth Capacity Purchase Scheme” is aligned
     with Kenya’s Vision 2030 and was conceived as a transitional and non-discriminatory support with a
     sunset clause so as to be compatible with Kenya’s existing commitments under the WTO. The period
     of validity was initially between 1st July 2007 to 31st December 2008, pending the landing of the
     undersea cables which were expected to significantly reduce retail rates. This period has however been
     extended and the subsidies are still available pending an evaluation of retail reductions.
     .
     BPO operators are licensed by the CCK and eligibility for the support is open to all operational BPO
     operators in Kenya. The subsidy is provided by means of a reimbursement of monies paid for
     bandwidth as indicated on the ISPs invoices to the BPO operator.

   Box 5: Judiciary Telepresence Project
   “The Judiciary ICT Committee” which is chaired by the Judge of Appeal. This Committee oversaw
   the formulation of the ICT Policy and Strategic Plan 2011-2013 which eventually led to the
   establishment of the “Telepresence” and other ICT based projects.

   Through a PPP initiative between a broadband provider, an equipment vendor and the Ministries of
   ICT and Justice, the judiciary in Kenya has ushered in the digital era by commissioning a
   telecommunication link that connects courts in Nairobi with those in Mombasa. Using
   “Telepresence” it is anticipated that Kenya will ease court processes and help in curbing cases of
   corruption. The private sector offered the technical support for this project which will enable sitting
   judges to preside over cases remotely, a move that will effectively cut down on travel costs incurred
   by judicial personnel.

   Apart from video conferencing there are other applications that will be instituted in the judicial
   Telepresence scheme. A system for recording, preserving and retrieval of court proceedings will be
   put in place. In relation to this, there will be imaging and automation of court records. In order to
   manage the telecommunication link for distant court stations, a Wide Area Network is in place while
   Local Area Networks will be used within individual court stations. Other applications include a web
   portal for judicial information, an Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS), and
   an Integrated Personnel and Payroll Database (IPPD).

     Box 6: Mobile Money Meets E-Commerce
     In a recent innovation launched in early 2011, registered customers of mobile phone money transfer
     service, M-Pesa, can withdraw cash in any currency from Visa branded automated teller machines
     (ATMs) anywhere in the world. They can also make purchases in accepted merchant outlets or shop
     online moving it from a money transfer service to a mobile commerce innovation, still for the
     unbanked. This innovation will move M-Pesa from a service conducted primarily over 2G networks,
     to one whose relevance will increase over broadband networks in light of the ability to use it to shop
     online and across borders.

     PesaPal1 is a payment platform that enables Kenyans to buy and sell on the Internet using M-Pesa,
     Zap and Credit Cards and has targeted e-commerce, school payment, and e-ticketing as value
     propositions. It is an online based service that uses the popular mobile money accounts that were
     launched in Kenya, or credit cards to:
         • Get receipts immediately for payments,
         • Get email and SMS notifications.
         • Load money once and use it for multiple payments using PesaPal Credit,
         • Make payments (such as school fees) in instalments,
         • Request and receive payments from other members,
         • Receive protection from fraudulent sales
         • Buy tickets for events in Kenya online
         • Buy products and services from vetted merchants.

The option of holding a beauty contest rather than an auction to award licenses is attractive for
governments interested in assessing each applicant’s vision and long-term business plan before making
final selections. In a beauty contest the request for proposals focuses on technical criteria rather than
price, and includes questions that request prospective operators to address equity in coverage especially
in rural areas, job creation, service provision, and to also provide strong indication of financial viability.
Further, the option of the beauty contest provides space for new entrants or aspiring operators who are
not as well financed to compete against incumbents that may be better positioned financially and with a
stronger customer base. Although a beauty contest may be perceived as less transparent than an
auction, a significant benefit is that winners typically do not pay the large amounts that an auction entails,
which theoretically should result in lower prices for consumers.
In the case of Morocco, ANRT ran a beauty contest in 2006 to award three 3G licenses and the results
were astounding – mobile broadband subscriptions increased 530 percent between 2007 and 2008.
Today, mobile broadband accounts for three quarters of the country’s broadband market share. As it
wished to expand competition in the marketplace and push for universal access, ANRT designed a
proposal that would ensure that the license would be awarded to the best technical and quality oriented
bid. In addition to the technical requirements, a fixed license fee was set at MAD 360 million plus an
additional MAD 36 million for the re-organization of the radio frequencies. In the end, bidders included
Maroc Telecom, Méditel, WANA (Maroc Connect at the time) and Maroc Nejma (a Kuwait-based
company). The evaluation was based on four criteria: 1) deployment of infrastructure, 2) service quality
engagement, 3) diversity, innovation, and incentive packages to customers, and 4) financial viability of
bidder and shareholder relations.
The aspiring operator WANA made a great impression and was ranked first, followed by Maroc Telecom
and Méditel. The introduction of a third operator in the market reaped benefits for both ANRT and the
newly licensed company. WANA’s launch of its restricted mobility service (branded as Bayn) in 2007 and
full mobility service (branded Wana Mobility) in 2008 expanded mobile broadband as well as its own
public reach and penetration. So large was this achievement, however, that WANA became a victim of
its own success. When the company launched WANA mobility using CDMA technology as opposed to the
GSM standard Méditel and Maroc Telecom use, they also followed the policy of giving away free phones
(two for the price of one). The promotion was so popular that WANA sales exceeded expectations and
the company faced two major challenges: 1) a still under-developed infrastructure that could not handle
the burden of so many users at once, and 2) technology incompatibility resulting in unexpected roaming
issues (most neighboring countries were using GSM). Eventually, many of the customers switched back to
Maroc Telecom and Méditel and the surge of customers leveled.
A lesson learned and improved upon – since 2010 WANA was recapitalized through new investments by
the Zain Group, changed management, and adopted a new brand name “INWI” phasing out WANA
mobility and upping its sale figures. INWI currently claims the greatest 3G coverage, providing
CDMA2000/EVDO for all new customers and 1X (an IMT-2000 technology but slower) where coverage
areas have not yet been enhanced with EVDO technology.

Employees of the Bureau d’État Civil (BEC) in the Moroccan city of Fez previously had to search for birth
certificates through hundreds of handwritten records and transcribe by hand information from the
original birth certificate to provide citizens with copies needed for applying for a job. It could take hours,
if not days, to fill this request along with the many others received that day. Applying for these
certificates could take days. Although under-the-table bribes were common, the process could still be
unbearably long. Those who finally received their documents were often so elated that they fail to
double-check the handwritten copies, resulting in a return visit to the BEC to fix poorly transcribed entries
that had not been accepted at their final destination.
In an effort to remedy this problem the local Al-Akhawayn University developed the e-Fez Action
Research Project, funded by Canada’s International Development Research Centre (IDRC) to design,
develop, and implement an e-government system to automate delivery of citizen-oriented services. With
a two-year grant from IDRC, the university had to prioritize. It opted for automating one of the most
widely used services in BEC offices: providing birth certificates. A pilot project, undertaken in partnership
with the Université Laval in Québec and in collaboration with the Fez municipal government, was
planned for the Agdal district. Its BEC office was set up in 1986, and had registered approximately 15,000
citizens.
The research team soon discovered that automation required more than they had bargained for. Every
birth certificate in the Agdal office would have to be digitized. This meant installing the necessary
infrastructure in the office, which previously had no computers or Internet connections. Even the
electrical service was prone to interruptions. The municipality of Fez played a major role by installing new
electrical lines, Internet connections, and computers; the project provided cables and servers. The
municipality was so highly motivated that it began automating two other offices at the same time.
The team then needed to find a way to digitize the existing records. They tried scanning, but the error
rate was 60%. The only viable alternative was to enter the information on each birth certificate into a
database. The result was unprecedented. For the first time ever, Moroccan citizens’ records were
digitized. Data entry began in February and ended in November 2005.
Citizens now have three choices for obtaining a birth certificate. Rather than wait days to receive a
handwritten copy, they can provide office staff with their serial number and the computer system
generates and prints a copy of the certificate.
The impact of the e-Fez Action Research Project has been far-reaching. At the local level, some 15,000
registered citizens now have access to government services instantly. Services are transparent and take
less time and effort. The project generated collaboration between various sectors of society in Fez. An
academic institution, citizens, elected officials, government employees, and an international
organization worked together to make better local governance a reality. The project has won
widespread recognition, winning Morocco’s National Prize for Electronic Administration: e-Mtiaz 2006.
And in 2007 the project earned a Technology in Africa Award (TIGA) and a United Nations Public Service
Award (UNPSA).
Building on e-Fez, Al Akhawayn University launched another project with IDRC and IT+46 of Sweden and
with support from the city and the ANRT to deploy a WiMAX network interconnecting government offices
and providing public access through hotspots. The Wireless Metropolitan Area Network @ Fez
(Wman@Fez) project is the first WiMAX community network in the country. It has been extended to
several other towns in the Middle Atlas region.

Global efforts to build community-based Wi-Fi networks have emerged as a solution for people to access
free broadband. One such example is FON established circa 2007 in Madrid, Spain.1 Today, the network
has over four million hotspots in 24 countries. Morocco is the only country in the Middle East and North
Africa region with members formally registered with the network.
In 2007, Abdesselam El Omari, an IT entrepreneur based in Rabat heard of the newly established FON
network. When Abdesselam contacted the company to join, he received four routers free of charge and
was requested to keep one for himself while giving the remaining three to others with broadband
connections and interested in becoming part of the movement.1 As a member, he received an identifier
that would allow him to connect to any FON wireless network around the world and could potentially
make enough money to subsidize his monthly broadband connection costs if traffic was sufficient. This was
made possible because the company also sold prepaid cards that would allow anyone to connect to the
community network. Money generated by these cards would be split between the company and the
owner of the router to which the prepaid card holder connects to at any given time.
Abdesselam installed one router in his apartment and one in his parent’s house as they live next to the
Hilton Hotel with promising potential for traffic. He gave the two other routers to friends in Casablanca.
After speaking to a lawyer about this opportunity and his desire to expand it in country, he was dissuaded
from continuing as it posed two types of legal problems:
    •   The first challenge was in regards to his ISP and rules against reselling Internet access. Sharing was
        permissible but selling was not.
    •   The second was related to fiscal issues and declaration of unauthorized income. Making money
        without declaring it and receiving VAT from users was problematic.
As a result, Abdesselam stopped the service. While in principal, the network provided an alternative
solution to accessing broadband the incentive model does not take into consideration local telecom
regulations in regards to sharing versus reselling bandwidth. Also, the emergence of mobile devices to
connect to broadband reduced the market base. Nonetheless, community-based Wi-Fi networks remains
relevant where creative solutions are needed to provide broadband access in poorly served areas.

xix Initially, ONPT rented out its bandwidth to ISPs through leased lines and the ISPs then sold dial-up services to customers. With

dial up, customers were paying a connection fee in addition to minutes since their phone service was billed on a pay per use basis and
this continued until the introduction of broadband. When Maroc Telecom was formed in 1998, it modified its policy and began selling
services directly to customers making it difficult for smaller ISPs to compete. In 1999, Casanet was bought by Maroc Telecom which
then became its Internet subsidiary Manara; Maghrebnet canceled its internet provision and only providing network services,

commercial customers, as well as providing network security, technical know-how, and ICT applications for social and economic
development purposes.

This report was drafted by Helani Galpaya of LIRNEasia, with significant contributions by Michael Minges,
who directed the case studies for the Broadband Strategies Toolkit. The project was carried out under the
supervision of Tim Kelly (infoDev) and Carlo Rossotto (ICT Sector Unit), with the Telecommunications
Management Group Inc. (USA) providing overall project coordination. Philippe Dongier, Sector Manager
(ICT Sector Unit) and Valerie D’Costa, Program Manager (infoDev), provide overall management guidance
for the development of the toolkit. Samhir Vasdev edited the report and prepared it for publication.

This case study is one of an initial series of seven that will contribute to the Broadband Strategies Toolkit, an
online resource for policy-makers and regulators, especially in developing countries (see www.broadband-
toolkit.org). The case studies are generously funded by the Korean Trust Fund (KTF) on Information and
Communications for Development (IC4D). The KTF is a partnership between the government of the
Republic of Korea and the World Bank Group whose purpose is to advance the ICT4D agenda to contribute
to growth and reduce poverty in developing countries.

Sri Lanka, an island nation located in the Indian                     minutes of use per user enabled operators to make
Ocean just south of India, has lately experienced                     positive EBITDA margins even though the
an explosion in the use and availability of                           Average Revenue per SIM was low, around USD
broadband services. The increase is primarily due                     2 – 5.
to the high rate of adoption of third generation                      This budget model of telecom that was first
(3G) mobile technologies such as HSPA and                             developed for the voice business is now being
HSPA+ dongles and associated SIM cards. This                          applied to mobile broadband in Sri Lanka. In
trend is typical of Sri Lanka and many other South                    particular, enabling pre-paid mobile broadband

Access to affordable broadband has become a priority for many countries, which is perceived as important
for social and economic development. The interaction of individuals, communities, and organizations with
broadband has contributed to the development and enhancement of social networks, access to and
generation of new knowledge, and the creation of diverse innovative processes.

The World Bank commissioned this study of the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) sector
and specifically broadband within the Federation of Saint Christopher and Nevis. It forms part of a series of
case studies carried out to analyze broadband in a representative sample of developing economies as
background research for the World Bank Broadband Strategy Toolkit.

The study analyses the environment within the small island developing state that facilitated the uptake of
broadband technologies and applications, to the extent that St. Kitts and Nevis has the highest fixed
broadband subscription rate among all countries of the Latin America and Caribbean region, and even higher
than some developed economies.

This achievement can be attributed in part to the small physical size of St. Kitts and Nevis that has enabled
faster rollout of the physical infrastructure, facilitated more effective marketing, and promoted maximum
impact for government-led ICT initiatives. Among the Caribbean islands however smallness is certainly not
unique. The study therefore explores other factors that have contributed to high broadband penetration.

The phrase “strength in depth” is borrowed from the world of soccer, the most popular sport on the island.
The phrase is used to underscore the point that the strength of the island’s achievement in the broadband
sector, lies in its commitment to nurturing the foundational components of the broadband ecosystem.
Promotion of basic education and digital literacy, building technology awareness, facilitating access to ICT,
and encouragement of a competitive telecommunications environment are but a few examples of the
country’s core strengths.

However, as in any ecosystem, sustainability and growth can be threatened by internal weaknesses. As of the
date of this report, mobile broadband has yet to be launched and the lack of appropriate legislation is holding
back the development of interactive e-commerce and e-government applications. Other challenges included
the high cost of services, an unstable power supply and quality of service issues.

Chapter 1 of the report provides a socio-economic overview of St. Kitts and Nevis. Chapter 2 examines key
policies and laws that govern the ICT sector, identifies key institutions and service providers and presents
data on the size of the telecommunications market. Chapter 3 looks at the broadband market including
penetration, pricing and quality. Chapter 4 reviews factors that have an impact on broadband demand.
Chapter 5 summarizes the country’s success factors as well as remaining challenges impeding the realization
of a sustainable broadband ecosystem.

In order to provide regional context, the report provides comparative data for other Eastern Caribbean
countries, specifically Dominica, Grenada, Saint Lucia, and Saint Vincent and the Grenadines.

This report was drafted by Diana Anius based on interviews conducted in St. Kitts and Nevis between
December 2010 and January 2011 as well as the documents referenced in this study. The author wishes to
acknowledge the support of Ms. Cheryl Hector of the Eastern Caribbean Telecommunications Authority
(ECTEL) and Mr. Christopher Herbert of the Department of Technology, Government of St. Kitts and
Nevis. The report was drafted with significant contributions by Michael Minges, who directed the case studies
for the Broadband Strategies Toolkit. The project was carried out under the supervision of Tim Kelly
(infoDev) and Carlo Rossotto (TWICT), with the Telecommunications Management Group Inc. (USA)
providing overall project coordination. Philippe Dongier, Sector Manager (TWICT) and Valerie D’Costa,
Program Manager (infoDev), provide overall management guidance for the development of the toolkit. Samhir
Vasdev edited the report and prepared it for publication.

This case study is one of an initial series of seven that will contribute to the Broadband Strategies Toolkit, an
online resource for policy-makers and regulators, especially in developing countries (see www.broadband-
strategies.org).. The case studies are generously funded by the Korean Trust Fund (KTF) on Information and
Communications for Development (IC4D). The KTF is a partnership between the government of the
Republic of Korea and the World Bank Group whose purpose is to advance the ICT4D agenda to contribute
to growth and reduce poverty in developing countries.

1.1     Background
Geographically, the Republic of Turkey is
located at a point connecting the continents of
Europe, Asia and Africa. Because of its
geographical location the mainland of Anatolia
possesses an extraordinary geo-strategic value. In
the past, it was an important expansion post to
many great political powers including Hatti,
Hittite, Ancient Greek, Urartu, Phrygia, Ionia,
Persia, Roman, Byzantine, Arab, Seljuk and
Ottoman. It has also been prominent as a center
of commerce because of its land connections to
three continents and the sea surrounding it on
three sides (Figure 1-1).
Modern Turkey was founded in 1923 by Mustafa

acquiring an additional share of the Government's stake in TT. The Turkish Government plans
to divest a further 15-20 per cent of its stake via an initial public offering. The remaining 15 per
cent stake in the operator is already listed on the Turkish stock exchange.
One of the key benefits of TT’s privatization is the fact that it has lost the special status of a
state-owned company and as a result is obliged to follow the same regulations as any other
Turkish telecoms operator. TT is likely to remain aggressive within the telecoms marketplace
and in the regulatory process as it tries to maintain its leading position. Thus, the low level of
competition in the broadband internet is partly due to the strategic behavior of Turk Telekom
to prevent the entry of alternative Internet service providers. In most countries incumbent
operators such as Turk Telekom have been under the regulatory obligation of allowing new
entrants to use the existing network to provide their own DSL service In a landmark decision
taken in November 2008, the Competition Authority has imposed a fine of 12.4 million TL
(about €6.2 million) on Turk Telekom for abusing its dominance in the wholesale broadband
Internet market through price squeeze in the retail Internet market. In its decision, the
Competition Board stated that Turk Telekom and its Internet subsidiary TTNet endured
operating without profits for long periods of time and implemented campaigns that would
not cover losses in reasonable amounts of time and that these strategies were executed in
order to monopolize the sector. In a recent decision the Competition Authority stated that
Türk Telekom should provide naked DSL services. Provision of naked DSL means that Turk
Telekom can no longer bundle voice and data services together and that the subscriber can
subscribe to DSL services alone, without having to pay for voice services as well.
In recent years Turksat with its UYDUNET cable services has increased its market share by
winning some 274 thousand broadband customers as of 2010. However since the cable TV
infrastructure is operational mostly in urban areas and lacking somewhat more effective
business models the company has not made a major breakthrough in the domestic market.
Another striking development was the introduction of 3G services which had a significant
impact on the broadband sector. The three mobile operators, Turkcell, Avea and Vodafone,
are trying to find new sources of revenue in anticipation of the difficulties associated with
increasing subscriber numbers in the saturating market. All three won 3G licences in
December 2008 and launched 3G services at the end of July 2009. Avea allocated TRY 1
billion to be spent mostly on 3G network development during 2009. Vodafone followed suit
with a TRY 1.3 billion investment allocation. At the end of December 2010, there were
1,448,020 mobile broadband subscribers, showing a 265 per cent growth over the last 12
months. At the end of 2010, the number of customers on 3G networks reached 19.4 million
With the emergence of alternative network technologies TT is now under pressure for
adopting a more business oriented strategy rather than enjoying its domination in the fixed
market. TT introduced its new Internet speed package days before 2011 which enables
speeds of up to 32 Mbps with VDSL2 and up to 8 Mbps through ADSL. TT shall begin offering
packages with speeds of up to 50 Mbps and 100 Mbps with VDSL2 technology, and shall
increase the speed up to 16 Mbps with ADSL2+.
TT will need to work hard to retain its market dominance however, as mobile operator Turkcell
is investing in considerable fibre infrastructure through its subsidiary Superonline. Vodafone
Turkey also bought a major alternative operator in late 2009. Another point is that EU
candidacy is prompting Turkey’s telecoms regulator to strengthen the regulation of the sector
and curtail TT’s monopolistic powers.

About infoDev


infoDev is a global development financing program among
international development agencies, coordinated and served by an
expert Secretariat housed at the World Bank Group, one of its key
donors and founders. It acts as a neutral convener of dialogue—and
as a coordinator of joint action among bilateral and multilateral
donors—supporting global sharing of information on ICT for
development (ICT4D), and helping to reduce duplication of efforts
and investments. infoDev also forms partnerships with public and
private sector organizations who are innovators in the field of ICT4D.
infoDev is housed in the Financial and Private Sector Development
(FPD) Vice Presidency of the World Bank Group.

operators had already conducted trials of
WiMAX services, it is thought that WiMAX
would emerge as the preferred technology for
developing 4G networks. The MIC sought to
ensure that either WiMAX or LTE technology
could be used for deploying 4G wireless
broadband.
In September 2010, the MIC granted trial LTE
licenses to five operators: VNPT, Viettel, FPT
Telecom, CMC and Vietnam Television,
Technology, Investment and Development
Company (VTC). According to the terms of the
license, the companies will be allowed to operate
LTE networks over a trial period of 12 months.
The MIC’s Telecommunications Department
director said that operators will be required to
participate in an auction in order to be granted a
4G license.
Also in September 2010, it was announced that
Vietnam Data Communication Company (VDC)
and Russia’s Antares had reached an agreement
to build a trial LTE network.9 The Russian firm
plans to invest US$2 million while VDC will be
responsible for obtaining the license and
securing the infrastructure and equipment.
Testing with 15 LTE base transceiver stations
began on October 20, 2010 in Hanoi.
