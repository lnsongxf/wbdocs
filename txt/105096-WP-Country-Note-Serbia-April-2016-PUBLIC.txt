   5,214 to RSD 5,329 (approximately €50). Employers’ monthly contributions to voluntary pension funds up
   to RSD 5,329 per employee are exempt from the personal income tax and compulsory social contributions.
   The same amount of contribution by direct debit from salary is also tax-exempt. Since May 2013, tax relief
