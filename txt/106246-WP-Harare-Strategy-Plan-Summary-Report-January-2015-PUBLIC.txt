Preface
The	   severe	   conditions	   in	   Zimbabwe,	   which	   reached	   a	   nadir	   in	   2008	   and	   2009,	   led	   to	   a	  
collapse	  of	  basic	  systems	  including	  the	  reliability	  and	  safety	  of	  water	  supply	  and	  sanitation	  
services,	   leading	   to	   an	   outbreak	   of	   cholera	   with	   more	   than	   4,000	   deaths	   and	   over	   90,000	  
people	  infected.	  
In	  this	  context,	  the	  City	  of	  Harare	  requested	  the	  World	  Bank	  to	  provide	  technical	  assistance	  
to	   support	   the	   city	   to	   improve	   water	   supply	   and	   sanitation	   services.	   The	   request	   followed	  
technical	  assistance	  provided	  to	  the	  city	  to	  improve	  the	  operational	  efficiency	  of	  water	  and	  
wastewater	   treatment	   plants	   and	   the	   Harare	   Water	   Summit,	   held	   on	   30	   March	   2012,	   to	  
discuss	   the	   water	   and	   sanitation	   situation	   in	   Greater	   Harare,	   encompassing	   the	   City	   of	  
Harare,	  Epworth,	  Ruwa,	  Chitungwiza,	  and	  Norton.	  	  
The	   support	   activities	   had	   three	   key	   goals:	   (1)	   to	   improve	   the	   operational	   performance	   of	  
water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   in	   Greater	   Harare;	   (2)	   to	   create	   the	   institutional	   platform	  
through	   which	   these	   improvements	   could	   be	   achieved	   and	   sustained;	   and	   (3)	   to	   create	  
conditions	  conducive	  to	  raising	  financial	  resources	  for	  the	  necessary	  investments.	  
This	  Summary	  Note	  summarises	  the	  key	  elements	  of	  the	  work	  undertaken	  and	  makes	  a	  set	  
of	   recommendations	   to	   the	   City	   of	   Harare,	   the	   adjacent	   local	   authorities	   of	   Chitungwiza,	  
Epworth,	   Norton	   and	   Ruwa,	   and	   Government	   of	   Zimbabwe	   to	   inform	   a	   strategic	   plan	   to	  
improve	  water	  and	  sanitation	  services	  in	  the	  greater	  Harare	  area.

Introduction
The	  World	  Bank	  provided	  Technical	  Assistance	  (TA)	  to	  the	  City	  of	  Harare	  to	  improve	  water	  
and	   sanitation	   services	   in	   the	   period	   October	   2012	   to	   June	   2014	   to	   the	   value	   of	  
approximately	   $600	   000.	   The	   budget	   was	   primarily	   for	   the	   provision	   of	   advisory	   services,	  
with	  a	  limited	  amount	  set	  aside	  for	  leadership	  and	  management	  training.	  The	  TA	  was	  unable	  
to	  provide	  funds	  for	  small	  investments	  or	  for	  more	  extensive	  training,	  which,	  together	  with	  
other	  reasons	  explained	  in	  this	  report,	  turned	  out	  to	  be	  limiting	  factors	  for	  the	  success	  of	  the	  
TA.	  This	  Summary	  Note	  sets	  out	  the	  context	  at	  the	  commencement	  of	  the	  TA,	  summarises	  
the	   work	   undertaken	   in	   the	   TA	   and	   the	   outcomes	   from	   this	   work,	   and	   makes	  
recommendations	  for	  the	  way	  forward.

The	   context	   in	   Harare	   specifically,	   and	   in	   Zimbabwe	   more	   broadly,	   found	   at	   the

1.2       Changing politics
Elections	  in	  2008	  were	  closely	  contested.	  The	  accompanying	  violence	  led	  to	  an	  agreement	  to	  
form	   a	   government	   of	   national	   unity	   (GNU)	   in	   early	   2009.	   	   The	   resulting	   macro-­‐economic	  
policies,	  together	  with	  increased	  development	  partner	  assistance,	  resulted	  in	  a	  stabilisation	  
of	   the	   economy	   as	   described	   above.	   It	   was	   in	   this	   context	   that	   the	   World	   Bank	   was	  
requested	  to	  provide	  technical	  assistance	  to	  the	  City	  of	  Harare.	  	  	  
The	   elections	   in	   July	   2013	   were	   won	   by	   ZANU-­‐PF.	   The	   newly	   formed	   government	   developed	  
the	   Zimbabwe	   Agenda	   for	   Sustainable	   Socio-­‐Economic	   Transformation	   (ZimAsset)	  
programme.	  ZimAsset’s	  focus	  is	  on	  the	  full	  exploitation	  and	  value	  addition	  to	  the	  country’s	  
own	   abundant	   resources.	   Infrastructure	   and	   utilities	   is	   one	   of	   the	   four	   identified	   clusters	  
(others	   are	   social	   services	   and	   poverty	   eradication,	   food	   security	   and	   nutrition,	   and	   value	  
addition	   and	   beneficiation).	   Fiscal	   reforms,	   improvements	   in	   public	   administration	   and	  
governance,	   and	   the	   introduction	   of	   results-­‐based	   performance	   management	   measures	  
underpin	   the	   programme.	   The	   programme	   is	   to	   be	   financed	   through	   a	   variety	   of	   sources	  
including	  tax	  and	  non-­‐tax	  revenue,	  leveraging	  resources,	  a	  Sovereign	  Wealth	  Fund,	  issuance	  
of	   bonds,	   accelerated	   implementation	   of	   Public	   Private	   Partnerships,	   securitization	   of	  
remittances,	  re-­‐engagement	  with	  the	  international	  and	  multilateral	  finance	  institutions	  and	  
other	  financing	  options,	  focusing	  on	  Brazil,	  Russia,	  India,	  China	  and	  South	  Africa.6	  
A	   recent	   review	   of	   the	   Zimbabwe’s	   pathways	   to	   international	   reengagement	   concluded	   as	  
follows:	   “The	   past	   year	   [2013]	   has	   seen	   more	   business	   closures	   in	   Zimbabwe	   than	   at	   any	  
time	  since	  2008;	  emigration	  has	  increased,	  as	  has	  the	  cost	  of	  living;	  and	  poor	  service	  delivery	  
remains	  a	  national	  bone	  of	  contention.	  In	  order	  to	  improve	  the	  economy,	  the	  government	  
needs	   to	   engage	   and	   partner	   with	   local	   stakeholders.	   It	   must	   also	   upgrade	   its	   portfolio	   of	  
international	   economic	   relations.	   Although	   Zimbabwe	   had	   engaged	   with	   the	   international	  
financial	   community	   under	   the	   GNU,	   the	   latest	   economic	   crisis	   is	   pushing	   the	   government	   to	  
try	   to	   accelerate	   progress	   on	   the	   ‘re-­‐set’	   with	   the	   World	   Bank,	   the	   International	   Monetary	  
Fund,	   the	   African	   Development	   Bank,	   the	   Paris	   Club	   and	   other	   international	   financial	  
institutions”	  (own	  emphasis)7.

                                                     The	  economic	  collapse	  led	  also	  to	  a	  severe	  collapse	  in	  the	  
                                                     functioning	   of	   water	   services.	   Overall	   access	   to	   urban	  
                                                     water	  supply	  decreased	  from	  97%	  in	  1990	  to	  60%	  in	  2008.	  
                                                     The	   specific	   case	   of	   Harare	   is	   detailed	   in	   the	   following	  
                                                     section.

                                                     to	   take	   reasonable	   legislative	   and	   other	   measures,	   within

                                                     A new water policy
                                                     Within	   this	   context,	   a	   new	   National	   Water	   Policy	   was

normalised	  phase.	  	  
Responsibility rests with urban councils with flexibility on who provides services
This	  policy	  designates	  Urban	  Local	  Authorities	  (Urban	  Councils)	  as	  Water	  Services	  Authorities	  
who	   have	   a	   duty	   to	   ensure	   efficient,	   affordable	   and	   sustainable	   access	   to	   water	   services	   are	  
provided	   for	   all	   their	   current	   and	   potential	   consumers.	   Water	   Services	   Authorities	   may	  
delegate	  operational	  responsibility,	  through	  a	  contract,	  to	  a	  Water	  Services	  Provider,	  that	  is,	  
any	   legal	   entity	   (public	   or	   private)	   capable	   of	   carrying	   out	   water	   supply	   and	   sanitation	  
services	   on	   behalf	   of	   the	   Urban	   Council.	   Service	   Providers	   will	   be	   legal	   entities	   (public,	  
private	  or	  mixed)	  that	  have	  the	  capacity	  to	  provide	  water	  supply	  and	  sanitation	  services	  to	  
Service	  Authorities.	  
Provision for an independent regulatory unit
The	   policy	   provides	   for	   the	   establishment	   of	   an	   independent	   Water	   and	   Wastewater	  
Services	   Regulatory	   Unit	   to	   monitor	   sector	   performance,	   receive	   and	   assess	   tariff	  
applications	   and	   oversee	   the	   licensing	   of	   Water	   Service	   Providers	   by	   Water	   Services	  
Authorities.	  

A right to primary water
‘Primary	   Water’	   is	   defined	   as	   the	   water	   required	   to	  
meet	  basic	  human	  needs,	  and	  is	  given	  the	  status	  of	  a	  
right	   for	   all	   Zimbabweans	   in	   the	   National	   Water	  
Policy.	  	  
Ring-fenced revenues
The	   policy	   states	   that	   “local	   Authorities	   will	  
undertake	   cost	   accounting	   and	   will	   ring-­‐fence	  
revenue	  from	  water	  sales.”	  
Cost recovery and financing
Water	   services	   revenues	   are	   dependent	   on	   water	   and	   sanitation	   tariffs	   and	   user	   charges.	  
These	   revenues	   were	   wiped	   out	   by	   the	   hyperinflation.	   Although	   there	   has	   been	   some	  
recovery	   after	   the	   dollarization	   of	   the	   economy,	   revenues	   have	   not	   been	   restored	   to	   pre-­‐
crisis	  levels.	  The	  government	  is	  not	  able	  to	  provide	  operating	  subsidies	  to	  the	  water	  services	  
sector	   due	   to	   its	   weak	   fiscal	   position,	   hence	   the	   sector	   had	   no	   choice	   but	   to	   implement	   a	  
policy	   of	   full	   recovery	   of	   operating	   costs	   for	   urban	   water	   and	   sanitation	   services,	   while	  
providing	   for	   capital	   subsidies	   (in	   the	   form	   of	   grants	   and	   concessionary	   loans)	   for	  
investments	  in	  rehabilitation	  and	  expansion	  of	  infrastructure.8	  Over	  time,	  it	  is	  envisaged	  that	  
the	   sector	   will	   again	   be	   fully	   financially	   self-­‐sufficient	   as	   it	   had	   been	   in	   the	   past.	   However,	  
this	  is	  dependent	  also	  on	  a	  full	  economic	  recovery.	  This	  is	  stated	  in	  the	  policy	  as	  follows:	  
             Water	   pricing	   will	   reflect	   the	   full	   costs	   of	   provision	   of	   water	   for	   all	   uses	  
             (capital	  and	  recurrent	  costs),	  except	  for	  primary	  water	  where	  the	  price	  will	  
             at	   least	   reflect	   the	   operation	   and	   maintenance	   costs	   during	   the	   recovery	  
             period	   and	   gradually	   shift	   towards	   full	   cost	   recovery	   during	   normal	  
             development.	  
             During	   the	   recovery	   period,	   Government	   will	   provide	   special	   grant	  
             financing	  to	  UWSS	  and	  RWSS.	  Thereafter	  Central	  Government	  will	  allocate	  
             money	   on	   a	   loan	   basis,	   based	   on	   the	   performance	   of	   Urban	   and	   Rural	  
             Councils	  against	  agreed	  performance	  benchmarks.	  
Pricing of primary water
The	   policy	   states	   that,	   in	   urban	   settings,	   “because	   water	   treatment,	   transmission,	   storage	  
and	   distribution	   through	   networks	   is	   expensive,	   primary	   water	   needs	   are	   based	   on	   lifeline

          Affordable standards
          The	  policy	  provides	  for	  appropriate	  service	  standards	  that	  will	  not	  compromise	  the	  benefits	  
          of	   basic	   water	   supply	   and	   sanitation	   and	   for	   which	   the	   recurrent	   costs	   are	   affordable	   to	  
          users,	  in	  particular	  during	  the	  recovery	  phase.	  
          Promotion of public-private partnerships
          The	   policy	   promotes	   PPPs	   as	   a	   vehicle	   for	   improved	   financing	   of	   WSS	   and	   states	   that	   the	  
          Government	   will	   continue	   to	   work	   with	   Development	   Partners	   to	   provide	   safety	   nets	   for

serve	  as	  satellite	  residential	  areas	  for	  Harare.	  
Harare	   is	   situated	   at	   the	   headwaters	   between	   the	   Manyame	   catchment	   to	   the	   south	   and	  
west	  and	  the	  Mazowe	  catchment	  to	  the	  north	  and	  east.	  Other	  than	  the	  small	  parts	  of	  Harare	  
to	   the	   north	   and	   east	   (Hatcliffe,	   Borrowdale,	   Highlands,	   Greendale	   and	   Caledonia)	   which	  
drain	   north	   into	   the	   Mazowe	   River,	   the	   remainder	   of	   the	   city	   together	   with	   all	   of	   Ruwa,	  
Epworth,	  Chitungwiza	  and	  Norton	  drain	  to	  the	  west	  into	  the	  Manyame	  River.	  This	  leads	  to	  
the	  unfortunate	  position	  whereby	  Harare,	  Chitungwiza,	  Epworth	  and	  Ruwa	  are	  all	  situated	  
upstream	  of	  the	  main	  water	  supply	  dams	  of	  Lake	  Chivero	  and	  Lake	  Manyame,	  and	  even	  for	  
Norton	  drainage	  is	  to	  the	  north	  directly	  into	  Lake	  Manyame.	  
As	   the	   capital	   of	   Zimbabwe,	   Harare	   strongly	   dominates	   Greater	   Harare	   in	   terms	   of	   area,	  
population	  and	  development	  of	  commerce	  and	  industry.	  Harare	  has	  a	  well	  defined	  Central	  
Business	   District	   (CBD)	   but	   this	   is	   lacking	   for	   the	   other	   centres	   of	   Chitungwiza,	   Epworth,	  
Norton	   and	   Ruwa.	   In	   each	   case	   plans	   exist	   for	   development	   of	   a	   town	   centre	   but	   these	   have	  
yet	   to	   be	   developed.	   As	   the	   capital	   city,	   Harare	   also	   supports	   the	   bulk	   of	   the	   institutional	  
development,	   in	   particular	   hosting	   a	   large	   number	   of	   national	   organizations.	   For	   the	   other	  
centres,	   institutional	   development	   is	   limited,	   the	   most	   numerous	   organizations	   being	  
schools	  and	  churches.	  
Harare	  also	  includes	  the	  largest	  industrial	  areas.	  Chitungwiza,	  Norton	  and	  Ruwa	  each	  have	  
some	   industry;	   indeed	   the	   modern	   development	   of	   Norton	   and	   Ruwa	   was	   specifically	   in	  
order	   to	   reduce	   pressure	   on	   industrial	   areas	   in	   Harare.	   Despite	   previous	   industrial	  
development	   in	   these	   smaller	   centres,	   many	   of	   the	   large	   companies	   have	   now	   ceased	  
operation	   or	   have	   relocated.	   This	   is	   largely	   due	   to	   the	   prevailing	   national	   economic	   malaise,	  
but	  has	  been	  compounded	  by	  erratic	  water	  supplies	  to	  these	  towns.	  
Population	  growth	  in	  Ruwa,	  Norton	  and	  Epworth	  has	  been	  higher	  than	  for	  the	  City	  of	  Harare	  
itself	  due	  to	  land	  release	  policies	  and	  practices	  (Table	  1).

City of Harare
The	   City	   of	   Harare	   supplies	   bulk	   water	   to	   the	  
Greater	   Harare	   area.	   The	   Harare	   water	   supply

capacity	   of	   614	   Ml/day	   (one	   of	   the	   largest	   in	   Africa	  
at	  the	  time	  of	  its	  construction)	  and	  Prince	  Edward	  
WTW	  with	  a	  nominal	  design	  capacity	  of	  90	  Ml/day	  
intended	   for	   peak	   season	   use.	   Actual	   water	  
production	   is	   around	   75%	   of	   nominal	   capacity.	  
Water	  must	  be	  pumped	  from	  the	  treatment	  works	  
into	   reservoirs	   supplying	   the	   distribution	   network	  
and	   there	   are	   16	   treated	   water	   pumping	   stations,	   Figure 3: Morton Jaffray Water Treatment Works

received	  a	  24/7	  supply	  prior	  to	  2005.

Compromised water quality
An	  intermittent	  supply	  results	  in	   contamination	  of	  water	  in	  pipes	   and	  further	  degradation	  of	  
the	   network.	   Even	   if	   the	   water	   supplied	   by	   the	   treatment	   works	   is	   safe	   to	   drink,	   an	  
intermittent	  supply	  results	  in	  low	  pressures	  in	  pipes	  and	  consequent	  risks	  of	  contamination	  
by	   ground	   water.	   	   In	   addition,	   the	   hydraulic	   shocks	   arising	   from	   refilling	   pipes	   accelerate	  
network	   degradation.	   An	   intermittent	   supply	   is	   much	   more	   difficult	   to	   manage.	   There	   are	  
therefore	  compelling	  reasons	  to	  restore	  the	  network	  to	  a	  continuous	  24/7	  supply.	  


High non-revenue water
Non-­‐revenue	   water	   is	   very	   high	   at	   an	   estimated	  
50–60	  percent.	  
Poorly performing sewer network and
wastewater treatment
There	   was	   a	   parallel	   collapse	   in	   the	   sewer	   network	  
and	   wastewater	   treatment	   over	   the	   same	   period	  
(2008–09).	   Consequently,	   sewer	   spills	   into	   streets	  
were	   frequent,	   and	   a	   large	   volume	   of	   untreated	  
sewage	   ran	   into	   the	   water	   sources	   on	   which	  
Greater	   Harare	   is	   reliant.	   Emergency	   works	  
involved	   getting	   pump	   stations	   working,	   doing	  
emergency	   repairs	   at	   the	   treatment	   works,	   and	  
addressing	  the	  worst	  of	  the	  spills.	  
Heavily polluted water sources
Raw	  water	  sources	  are	  heavily	  polluted.	  Harare	  has	  
four	  raw	  water	  sources	  all	  on	  the	  Manyame	  River.	   Figure 6: Excessive aquatic plant growth due to raw

                           The	  main	  water	  sources	  are	  downstream	  of	  the	  city	  and	  as	  a	  result	  are	  heavily	  polluted	  from	  
                           the	  raw	  sewage	  from	  settled	  areas,	  industries	  and	  farming	  activities	  (Figure	  6).	  The	  result	  is	  
                           that	  it	  is	  very	  expensive	  to	  treat	  the	  water	  and	  there	  is	  a	  potential	  risk	  to	  consumers	  if	  the

                           Insufficient treatment capacity

                           of	   the	   sewage	   generated.	   Heavily	   constrained	   financial	   resources	   means	   that	   it	   will	   be

2 Methodology and approach
2.1       Diagnostic
The	   diagnostic	   phase	   was	   launched	   in	   October	   2012.	   The	   purpose	   was	   to	   appreciate	   the	  
current	   conditions	   (symptoms)	   and	   fully	   understand	   the	   underlying	   causes	   of	   these	  
symptoms.	   The	   work	   focused	   on	   the	   City	   of	   Harare	   on	   the	   understanding	   that	   the	   service	  
conditions	  in	  the	  other	  four	  towns	  were	  at	  least	  as	  poor	  as	  those	  experienced	  in	  the	  City	  of	  
Harare	   area,	   and	   that	   service	   improvements	   in	   Greater	   Harare	   were	   dependent	   on	  
improvements	  in	  the	  performance	  of	  Harare	  Water,	  the	  bulk	  water	  supplier	  for	  the	  region.	  
The	   work	   involved	   site	   visits,	   presentations,	   reviews,	   and	   workshops	   and	   culminated	   in	   a	  
management	  team	  diagnostic	  workshop	  with	  Harare	  Water	  and	  a	  meeting	  with	  the	  Mayor	  in	  
January	  2013.	  
The	   core	   diagnostic	   was	   summarized	   in	   the	   diagnostic	   workshop	   in	   January	   2013.	   A	  
combination	  of	  poor	  reliability	  and	  lack	  of	  water	  services	  resulted	  in	  high	  public	  health	  risks	  
(typhoid,	  cholera,	  and	  diarrhea).	  Lack	  of	  reliability	  of	  services	  led	  to	  low	  levels	  of	  credibility	  
on	   the	   part	   of	   the	   water	   providers	   (Harare	   Water	   and	   the	   other	   towns	   providing	   water	   in	  
Greater	   Harare)	   and	   low	   levels	   of	   trust	   by	   customers.	   This	   contributed	   to	   poor	   payment	  
levels.	   Harare	   Water	   had	   a	   substantially	   incomplete	   customer	   database	   leading	   to	   the	  
under-­‐realization	   of	   revenues.	   The	   low	   revenues	   meant	   that	   the	   service	   provider	   did	   not	  
have	  the	  resources	  to	  maintain	  and	  operate	  the	  services,	  leading	  to	  a	  further	  deterioration	  
in	   services.	   The	   low	   level	   of	   resources	   together	   with	   low	   levels	   of	   trust	   on	   the	   part	   of	  
customers	   contributed	   to	   poor	   working	   conditions	   and	   an	   unmotivated	   staff.	   This	   was	   a	  
vicious	  cycle	  leading	  to	  worsening	  conditions	  over	  time.	  The	  strategy	  needed	   to	  break	   this	  
cycle,	   creating	   instead	   a	   virtuous	   cycle	   of	   improving	   revenues	   and	   services	   over	   time,	  
increasing	  levels	  of	  trust	  and	  improving	  staff	  working	  conditions	  and	  motivation.	  This	  would	  
require	  that	  all	  key	  aspects	  of	  the	  business	  be	  addressed:	  customer	  management,	  revenue	  
management,	   investments,	   rehabilitation	   and	   maintenance	   of	   existing	   assets,	   and	   human	  
resources	  management.	  	  

2.2       Assumptions informing the design of the technical assistance
A much lower population than previously estimated
The	   strategy	   process	   commenced	   prior	   to	   the	   release	   of	   the	   population	   census	   data.	   At	   that	  
time,	   city	   officials	   estimated	   the	   population	   in	   Greater	   Harare	   to	   be	   about	   4.5	   million,	  
although	  it	  was	  recognized	  that	  this	  was	  uncertain.	  The	  census	  data	  released	  in	  early	  2014	  
showed	  that	  the	  population	  was	  much	  lower	  (Table	  1).	  
Sufficient water to provide a 24/7 supply
The	   request	   at	   the	   Harare	   Water	   Summit	   in	   March	  
2012	   was	   for	   the	   urgent	   building	   of	   Kunzvi	   Dam	   in	  
order	   to	   increase	   water	   supplies,	   based	   on	   an	  
assumed	   demand	   of	   1200	   Ml/day.	   However,	   the	  
nominal	   production	   capacity	   of	   600	   Ml/d	   is	   able	   to	  
provide	   a	   water	   supply	   into	   the	   network	   of	  285	   litres	  
per	   person	   per	   day	   for	   a	   population	   of	   2.1	   million	  
people	   (more	   than	   3000	   litres	   per	   connection	   per	  
day).	   This	   is	   sufficient	   water	   to	   maintain	   a	   24/7	  
supply	   in	   the	   distribution	   network.	   This	   suggested	  
that	   investment	   priorities	   should	   be	   focussed	   on	  
restoration	   of	   production	   capacity	   and	   non-­‐revenue	   Figure 9: Manual entry and calculation of water
water	  reduction	  rather	  than	  on	  increasing	  supply.	                        production

                      A strategic approach to improving system knowledge
                      In	   October	   2012,	   water	   production	   was	   estimated	   to	   be	   about	   600	   Ml/day.	   However,	   no	  
                      bulk	  meters	  were	  installed,	  and	  pumping	  volumes	  were	  estimated	  based	  on	  pump	  running	  
                      time	   and	   pump	   efficiency.	   Similarly,	   not	   a	   single	   meter	   was	   working	   for	   the	   26	   reservoir	  
                      outlets.	   The	   City	   of	   Harare	   had	   177,000	   customers	   on	   their	   database,	   but	   it	   was	  
                      acknowledged	   that	   it	   was	   likely	   that	   there	   were	   many	   unregistered	   or	   illegal	   connections.	  
                      Knowledge	   of	   the	   location	   and	   status	   of	   meters,	   service	   connections	   and	   the	   state	   of	   the	  
                      distribution	  network	  was	  poor.	  	  	  
                                                                                     An	   improved	   knowledge	   of	   actual	   production,

                      knowledge	  and	  experience	  rather	  than	  what	  is	  appropriate	  and	  part	  of	  a	  common	  standard	  
                      for	  Zimbabwe	  and/or	  Harare.	  
                      Alternatives to investment in existing wastewater treatment plants should be explored	  
                      The	  treatment	  of	  a	  small	  proportion	  of	  wastewater	  to	  a	  high	  standard	  may	  not	  be	  the	  best	  
                      use	  of	  scarce	  investment	  resources.	  Alternatives	  should	  be	  considered.	  
                      It is possible to significantly raise revenues and cash collection in the short term
                      It	   is	   important	   to	   determine	   realistic	   revenue	   and	   cash	   collection	   targets	   for	   the	   medium	  
                      term.	   For	   example,	   if	   water	   production	   of	   600	   Ml/d	   is	   attained	   and	   sustained,	   if	   sales	   are	  
                      increased	   to	   60	   percent	   of	   water	   produced	   and	   if	   collection	   efficiency	   is	   increased	   to	   80	  
                      percent,	  then	  cash	  collected	  for	  water	  and	  wastewater	  services	  could	  increase	  to	  over	  $140

Improved services must be linked to increased payments and vice versa
Increase	   in	   cash	   revenues	   need	   to	   be	   accompanied	   by	   investments	   in	   improving	   water	  
distribution	   (across	   geographic	   areas	   and	   in	   terms	   of	   reliability).	   As	   services	   are	   improved,	  
customers	   need	   to	   contract	   to	   pay	   for	   the	   improved	   service.	   This	   creates	   a	   virtuous	   circle	  
where	   increased	   revenues	   leads	   to	   improved	   services	   which	   in	   turn	   leads	   to	   increased	  
revenues.	  The	  study	  tour	  to	  eThekwini	  Municipality	  showed	  how	  practical	  strategies	  can	  be	  
developed	  and	  applied	  to	  increase	  revenues,	  and	  that	  good	  customer	  management	  is	  key.	  
It is possible to reduce losses and move towards a 24/7 supply
With	   available	   investment	   resources,	   and	   through	   increasing	   cash	   collections,	   it	   may	   be	  
possible	   to	   extend	   24/7	   coverage	   to	   a	   much	   larger	   proportion	   of	   the	   population.	   This	   will	  
require	  a	  practical	  and	  strategic	  approach,	  making	  the	  best	  use	  of	  available	  resources.	  
The satellite towns are dependent for water on Harare Water
Satellite	   towns	   may	   cooperate	   and	   align	   interests	   if	   Harare	   Water	   can	   demonstrate	  
improved	   performance	   and	   good	   faith	   in	   distributing	   water	   more	   equitably	   across	   the	  
region.	  The	  timing	  and	  sequencing	  of	  the	  discussion	  with	  satellite	  towns	  on	  cooperation	  and	  
combined	   strategies	   are	   therefore	   important.	   Services	   need	   to	   be	   paid	   for	   in	   order	   to	  
support	   the	   financial	   viability	   of	   the	   utility	   and	   enable	   ongoing	   sustainable	   provision	   of	  
services.	   In	   October	   2012,	   Norton	   was	   not	   collecting	   any	   revenues	   for	   water	   services	   and	  
Chitungwiza	  was	  not	  paying	  for	  the	  water	  that	  they	  received	  from	  the	  City	  of	  Harare.	  	  
Attracting investment finance
The	  ability	  of	  the	  towns	  of	  Greater	  Harare	  to	  attract	  new	  investment	  financing	  for	  water	  and	  
sanitation	   will	   be	   significantly	   enhanced	   if	   significant	   operational	   improvements	   are	  
achieved	  during	  the	  process	  of	  developing	  the	  strategy.	  	  For	  this	  reason,	  a	  strong	  emphasis	  
was	   placed	   during	   the	   strategy	   development	   on	   measures	   that	   support	   practical	  
improvements	   in	   actual	   operations	   on	   the	   ground.	   These	   improvements	   are	   a	   much	   more	  
powerful	   message	   than	   a	   ‘paper	   perfect’	   plan	   that	   is	   disconnected	   from	   what	   is	   actually	  
happening	  in	  practice.	  
Fiscal reforms will be necessary before ring-fencing of water can be achieved
Local	   authorities	   are	   understandably	   reluctant	   to	   let	   go	   of	   water	   revenues	   because	   this	   is	  
one	  of	  their	  few	  sources	  of	  funds.	  For	  this	  reason,	  the	  creation	  of	  a	  water	  utility	  for	  Greater	  
Harare	  is	  unlikely	  until	  local	  government	  is	  allowed	  alternative	  sources	  of	  local	  revenues	  to	  
sustain	   services.	   This	   will	   require	   local	   government	   financial	   reforms	   that	   are	   the	   remit	   of	  
the	  ministry	  in	  charge	  of	  local	  government.	  
Availability of funds for investments
The	  City	  of	  Harare	  had	  access	  to	  investment	  resources	  in	  the	  form	  of	  a	  $14	  million	  grant	  and	  
a	  $144	  million	  loan	  that	  could	  be	  used	  to	  support	  the	  necessary	  short-­‐term	  improvements	  in	  
water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   with	   further	   funding	   possible	   to	   support	   the	   necessary	  
medium	  and	  longer	  term	  investments.	  
Working with management to improve services
The	   observed	   improvements	   in	   performance	   from	   January	   2009	   up	   October	   2012	   showed	  
that	   a	   capable	   management	   team	   was	   in	   place	   and	   that	   further	   performance	   improvements	  
could	   be	   achieved	   through	   the	   provision	   of	   advisory	   services	   and	   technical	   support	   to	   this	  
team.	  
Basic management structure adequate
The	   management	   structure	   comprised	   a	   Director	   of	   Harare	   (with	   overall	   responsibility	   for	  
Water	   and	   Sanitation	   in	   the	   City	   of	   Harare)	   and	   managers	   for	   bulk	   water	   production,	  
wastewater	   collection	   and	   treatment,	   the	   water	   reticulation	   network,	   maintenance,

               function	  from	  the	  three	  technical	  operations	  managers	  was	  considered	  to	  be	  a	  problem	  and,	  
               as	  a	  result	  of	  a	  recommendation	  made	  in	  the	  TA	  project,	  maintenance	  responsibilities	  were	  
               moved	   to	   the	   three	   operations	   managers	   (bulk	   water,	   wastewater,	   and	   water	   network).	   The	  
               management	  structure,	  thus	  reformed,	  was	  considered	  an	  adequate	  basis	  to	  proceed	  with	  
               operational	   improvements	   in	   the	   short-­‐term	   pending	   the	   consideration	   of	   more	   significant	  
               institutional	  reforms	  (also	  to	  be	  investigated	  as	  part	  of	  the	  TA).	  

               2.3        Approach
               The	   strategy	   was	   developed	   at	   two	   levels:	   first,	   at	   an	   operational	   level,	   to	   support	   the	  
               management	   team	   of	   Harare	   Water	   to	   improve	   operations	   through	   an	   organizing	   goal	   of	  
               reestablishing	  a	  24/7	  supply;	  and	  secondly,	  at	  a	  strategic	  level	  to	  do	  the	  necessary	  research	  
               work	  to	  understand	  and	  advise	  on	  the	  key	  questions	  that	  would	  inform	  future	  investments,	  
               institutional	   arrangements,	   and	   the	   overall	   medium-­‐	   and	   long-­‐term	   strategic	   plan.	   The	  
               support	  activities	  were	  organized	  in	  four	  distinct	  but	  interrelated	  work-­‐streams:

3.1        Purpose
The	  key	  purpose	  of	  the	  technical	  assistance	  in	  this	  stream	  of	  work	  was	  to	  provide	  practical	  
support	  to	  the	  management	  and	  staff	  of	  Harare	  Water	  to	  improve	  operational	  performance.	  
The	  World	  Bank	  arranged	  for	  Neil	  Macleod,	  Head	  of	  Water	  and	  Sanitation	  at	  the	  eThekwini	  
Metropolitan	   Municipality	   in	   South	   Africa,	   and	   members	   of	   his	   management	   and	   technical	  
teams,	   to	   visit	   the	   City	   of	   Harare	   on	   a	   number	   of	   occasions,	   and	   for	   the	   management	   of	  
Harare	  Water	  to	  visit	  eThekwini.	  During	  and	  through	  these	  visits,	  a	  set	  of	  action	  plans	  were	  
developed	   by	   the	   Harare	   Water	   management	   team.	   Practical	   advice	   and	   assistance	   was	  
provided	   on	   the	   specification	   and	   procurement	   of	   equipment,	   chemical	   costs,	   the	  
development	   and	   roll-­‐out	   of	   a	   rapid	   customer	   survey	   using	   handheld	   GPS	   loggers,	   credit	  
control	   policy,	   standard	   operating	   procedures	   and	   related	   matters.	   	   These	   activities	   took	  
place	   in	   a	   context	   of	   investment	   funding	   being	   provided	   by	   ZIMFUND	   ($14	   million)	   for	  
emergency	   rehabilitation	   work,	   mainly	   at	   Morton	   Jaffray	   treatment	   works	   and	   the	  
availability	  of	  a	  $144	  million	  loan	  from	  China	  Export	  Import	  Bank	  (Exim	  Bank).	  	  In	  addition,	  
leadership	   training	   was	   provided	   to	   the	   management	   team	   with	   the	   support	   and	  
involvement	  of	  the	  World	  Bank	  Institute.	  Sessions	  were	  held	  on	  adaptive	  leadership	  and	  on	  
influence	  mapping.

Securing	  production	  
Although	  Harare	  Water	  has	  managed	  to	  restore	  production	  back	  to	  about	  600	  Ml/day	  after	  
the	   crisis	   in	   2008	   and	   2009,	   production	   was	   vulnerable	   to	   breakdowns.	   Therefore,	   a	   key	  
priority	  of	  improving	  services	  was	  to	  stabilise	  and	  secure	  reliable	  production	  at	  the	  level	  of	  
600	   Ml/day	   or	   above.	   Over	   and	   above	   planned	   short-­‐term	   investments	   in	   rehabilitation	   of

           working	  properly	  and	  improve	  chemical	   and	  pumping	  efficiencies.	  It	  was	  recommended	  that	  
           the	  sludge	  processing	  plant	  be	  put	  out	  to	  a	  public-­‐private	  contract.	  	  Chemical	  contracts	  were	  
           coming	   to	   an	   end	   and	   there	   was	   a	   need	   to	   review	   chemical	   dosing	   regimes	   and	   to	   secure	  
           new	  procurement	  contracts	  at	  competitive	  prices.	  	  
           Efficient and effective spending on chemicals
           In	   light	   of	   concerns	   about	   the	   high	   cost	   of	   chemicals,	   a	   review	   of	   chemical	   procurement	   was	  
           undertaken	  and	  the	  following	  findings	  and	  recommendations	  made:	  
                 1. It	   was	   recommended	   to	   appoint	   an	   independent	   expert	   to	   carry	   out	   testing	   of	  
                    alternative	   chemical	   dosing	   regimes	   to	   find	   the	   most	   appropriate	   and	   cheapest	  
                    option	   for	   treating	   Harare's	   water	   supply	   given	   the	   complexities	   involved.	   This	  
                    person	  needs	  to	  be	  independent	  of	  any	  particular	  chemical	  supplier.	  
                 2. The	   manufacturer	   of	   liquid	   aluminium	   sulphate	   in	   Harare	   is	   selling	   its	   product	   for	  
                    much	  more	  than	  its	  counterpart	  in	  Durban.	  	  In	  fact,	  it	  is	  cheaper	  to	  coagulate	  using	  
                    imported	   granular	   aluminium	   sulphate	   than	   to	   use	   the	   local	   product.	   	   Harare	   should	  
                    seek	   to	   negotiate	   a	   more	   competitive	   price	   with	   the	   supplier.	   	   Failing	   success	   with	  
                    this	  strategy,	  it	  should	  consider	  switching	  to	  the	  imported	  granular	  product.	  
                 3. The	  prices	  paid	  by	  Harare	  for	  granular	  aluminium	  sulphate,	  HTH,	  lime	  and	  chlorine	  
                    gas	  are	  similar	  to	  what	  is	  paid	  by	  eThekwini	  after	  correction	  for	  transport	  and	  import	  
                    tax.	  
                 4. The	  price	  currently	  paid	  by	  Harare	  for	  powdered	  activated	  carbon	  is	  lower	  than	  the	  
                    price	   for	   this	   product	   imported	   from	   China	   under	   the	   contract	   with	   CMEC	   but	   the	  
                    quality	  should	  be	  checked.	  
                 5. The	  price	  paid	  by	  Harare	  for	  locally	  manufactured	  sulphuric	  acid	  is	  less	  than	  it	  would	  
                    cost	  to	  import.	  
                 6. Harare’s	   monthly	   costs	   will	   be	   lower	   if	   alternative	   coagulants	   to	   aluminium	   sulphate	  
                    are	  used.	  	  The	  lowest	  cost	  would	  be	  obtained	  with	  polyaluminium	  chloride	  imported	  
                    from	   China.	   However,	   monthly	   costs	   are	   very	   sensitive	   to	   the	   applied	   dose	   and	  
                    Harare	  is	  strongly	  advised	  before	  committing	  to	  a	  product	  to	  confirm	  the	  optimum	  
                    dose	  and	  performance	  with	  jar	  tests	  and	  full-­‐scale	  trials.	  
                 7. At	   Morton	   Jaffray	   there	   are	   deficiencies	   in	   raw	   water	   metering	   and	   inlet	   control	  
                    valves	  that	  must	  be	  resolved	  in	  order	  to	  ensure	  accurate	  chemical	  dosing.	  
                 8. Harare	  should	  pay	  for	  chemicals	  from	  cash	  generated	  from	  the	  sale	  of	  water	  and	  not

Warren Control rehabilitation and 24/7 launch
Warren	   Control	   pumpstation	   is	   the	   main	   pump	   station	   Figure 15: Mainline integrity action plan	  
used	   to	   supply	   the	   distribution	   reservoirs.	   If	   this	  
pumpstation	   is	   not	   functioning,	   no	   water	   can	   be	   distributed	   to	   much	   of	   the	   network.	   This	  
pumpstation	  was	  in	  need	  of	  major	  rehabilitation	  and	  would	  have	  to	  be	  brought	  off	  line	  for	  2	  
to	   3	   days.	   The	   maintenance	   activities	   would	   have	   to	   be	   carefully	   planned	   and	   clearly	  
communicated	  with	  the	  public.	  In	  discussion	  with	  Harare	  Water	  staff	  it	  was	  realised	  that	  this	  
‘low	   point’	   in	   the	   production	   would	   be	   an	   opportune	   time	   to	   launch	   the	   24/7	   strategy	  
publicly,	  with	  a	  view	  to	  progressive	  improvement	  of	  the	  water	  supply	  situation	  thereafter,	  as	  
all	  of	  the	  action	  plans	  get	  implemented.	  (See	  Customer	  Engagement	  below.)	  
Improved reservoir management
Management	   of	   the	   29	   reservoirs	   was	   being	   done	   manually,	   with	   written	   level	   recordings	  
being	   communicated	   once	   or	   twice	   daily	   after	   the	   fact.	   The	   lack	   of	   ‘real	   time’	   data	   made	  
reservoir	   and	   distribution	   network	   management	   reactive	   and	   much	   less	   effective	   than	   it	  
could	  be.	  	  Mechanisms	  to	  use	  simple	  cell	  phone-­‐based	  technology	  to	  communicate	  reservoir	  
levels	  on	  a	  more	  timely	  basis	  were	  discussed	  and	  practical	  support	  to	  set	  this	  system	  up	  was	  
given.	  	  The	  action	  plan	  for	  improved	  reservoir	  management	  included	  the	  following	  actions:	  
Implement	  cell	  phone	  and	  web-­‐based	  monitoring	  of	  reservoirs,	  inspect	  and	  repair	  reservoir	  
outlet	   meters,	   get	   meter	   agent	   out	   to	   assess,	   isolate	   reservoir	   zones	   and	   prioritise	   zones	   for	  
pressure	  reduction	  and	  leak	  repair.

Progress
The	  maintenance	  department	  was	  separate	  from	  the	  three	  main	  operations	  departments	  –	  
water	   production,	   network	   management	   and	   wastewater	   treatment.	   It	   was	   recommended	  
that	  the	  maintenance	  teams	  be	  integrated	  back	  into	  these	  three	  key	  operational	  areas	  and	  
this	  recommendation	  was	  implemented.	  
Some	  progress	  was	  made	  on	  a	  24/7	  action	  plan,	  but	  this	  plan	  was	  not	  fully	  operationalized.	  	  
Detailed	   planning	   for	   a	   Warren	   Control	   pumpstation	   shut	   down,	   to	   coincide	   with	   the	   launch	  
of	   the	   24/7	   strategy	   was	   not	   undertaken.	   Basic	   maintenance	   tasks	   were	   hampered	   due	   to	  
the	  lack	  of	  cash	  flow.	  
A	   process	   to	   use	   cell	   phones	   to	   monitor	   reservoirs	   was	   developed	   and	   piloted	   (Figure	   16).	  
(See	  Working	  Paper	  5.)	  

Customer	  engagement	  and	  revenues	  
Trust	  with	  customers	  needed	  to	  be	  rebuilt.	  This	  would	  depend	  on	  honest	  communications	  in	  
a	   context	   of	   practical	   actions	   that	   were	   leading	   to	   service	   improvements	   over	   time.	   Three	  
key	   areas	   were	   identified:	   improved	   knowledge	   of	   customers	   through	   a	   rapid	   GIS-­‐based	  
survey;	  improved	  meter	  reading,	  billing,	  and	  cash	  collections	  packaged	  together	  in	  a	  revenue	  
enhancement	  strategy,	  and	  communications,	  including	  the	  establishment	  of	  a	  call	  centre.	  
Management of the customer services function
It	  was	  strongly	  recommended	  that	  a	  suitably	  skilled	  (non-­‐technical)	  person	  be	  appointed	  as	  
a	  dedicated	  customer	  services	  manager	  for	  water,	  and	  that	  a	  customer	  services	  strategy	  be	  
developed,	   encompassing	   these	   three	   activities.	   However,	   an	   appointment	   was	   not	   made	  
and	  the	  revenue	  enhancement	  and	  customer	  services	  strategies	  were	  not	  developed.

A rapid GIS-based survey
The	  World	  Bank	  and	  eThekwini	  teams	  worked	  with	  Harare	  Water	  management	  and	  officials	  
to	  guide	  them	  in	  undertaking	  a	  rapid	  survey	  of	  their	  customers.	  The	  aim	  was	  to	  transform	  
the	   meter	   reading	   system	   to	   achieve	   greater	   accuracy,	   transparency	   and	   feedback	   by	  
implementing	  a	  simple	  cell-­‐phone	  based	  reading	  system	  with	  the	  following	  features:	  meter	  
readers	   to	   locate	   and	   position	   all	   meters,	   meter	   readers	   to	   update	   customer	   data,	   meter	  
readers	  to	  document	  all	  leaks	  they	  see	  (photograph	  with	  location,	  report	  back).	  	  At	  the	  same	  
time,	   the	   water	   distribution	   network	   was	   to	   be	   placed	   on	   GIS.	   The	   City	   would	   purchase	  
satellite	  images.	  	  Using	  the	  visual	  overlay,	  the	  existing	  piped	  network,	  active	  meter	  positions,	  
and	  software	  from	  eThekwini	  to	  digitise	  physical	  structures	  (houses	  etc.),	  it	  would	  then	  be	  
possible	  to	  understand	  the	  extent	  of	  service	  gaps	  and	  likely	  locations	  of	  illegal	  connections.	  
This	   would	   enable	   a	   much	   more	   accurate	   estimate	   of	   demand	   to	   be	   developed.	   	   The	   City	  
preferred	  to	  use	  dedicated	  GPS	  units	  rather	  than	  cell-­‐phones	  for	  this	  exercise	  and	  adopted	  a	  
more	   detailed	   and	   slower	   suburb-­‐by-­‐suburb	   strategy.	   Progress	   was	   also	   delayed	   by	  
procurement	  and	  funding	  issues	  and	  the	  City	  was	  therefore	  not	  able	  to	  achieve	  the	  progress	  
and	  outcomes	  that	  were	  originally	  hoped	  for	  –	  a	  more	  informed	  strategic	  overview	  of	  their	  
customer	  base.	  (See	  Working	  Paper	  5	  for	  further	  detail.)	  	  

Revenue and cash collections
Raising	   sufficient	   revenues	   (billing),	   and	  
collecting	  this	  efficiently	  as	  cash,	  lies	  at	  the	  
heart	  of	  any	  successful	  strategy	  to	  improve

               Harare	  Water	  and	  is	  an	  indicator	  of	  poor	  management	  performance.	  The	  opportunity	  cost	  of	  
               this	   poor	   performance	   is	   massive,	   amounting	   to	   about	   $60	   million	   over	   30	   months	   and	  
               about	  $4	  million	  per	  month	  in	  the	  later	  period.	  

               Status	  of	  action	  plans	  
               Although	   achieving	   the	   24/7	   supply	   goal	   involves	   significant	   technical/engineering	  
               challenges	  (for	  example,	  reestablishing	  reliability	  of	  production,	  reducing	  system	  pressures,	  
               fixing	   leaks,	   replacing	   pipes),	   these	   actions	   on	   their	   own	   are	   not	   sufficient	   to	   achieve	   24/7	  
               supply.	   In	   addition	   to	   meeting	   the	   engineering	   challenges,	   the	   revenue	   management	   and	  
               customer	  service	  functions	  needed	  to	  be	  substantially	  overhauled	  and	  improved.	  
               The	  action	  plans,	  however,	  remained	  incomplete	  and	  needed	  to	  be	  further	  integrated,	  with	  
               clearer	   priorities,	   targets,	   deadlines,	   and	   resources	   attached.	   A	   customer	   services	   action	  
               plan	   still	   needed	   further	   elaboration	   and	   the	   revenue	   enhancement	   strategy	   needed	  
               development.	   These	   actions	   could	   be	   further	   improved	   through	   a	   Rapid	   Results	   Initiative.	   At	  
               the	   time	   it	   was	   considered	   prudent	   to	   launch	   the	   24/7	   strategy	   after	   the	   elections.	   It	   was	  
               also	   recognized	   that	   an	   action	   plan	   for	   the	   launch	   o	   f	   the	   24/7	   strategy	   needed	   to	   be	  
               developed.	  In	  the	  end,	  the	  action	  plans	  were	  not	  improved,	  an	  action	  plan	  for	  the	  launch	  of	  
               the	   24/7	   strategy	   was	   not	   developed,	   the	   Rapid	   Results	   Initiative	   methodology	   was	   not	  
               taken	  up	  and	  the	  24/7	  strategy	  was	  not	  launched.

               In	   a	   context	   of	   scarce	   resources	   (both	   operating	   revenues	   and	   investment	   funds)	   it	   is	  
               especially	   important	   that	   existing	   resources	   are	   used	   wisely	   and	   efficiently.	   Reviews	   were

               described	   above,	   but	   did	   not	   lead	   to	   a	   specific	   action	   plan.	   Key	   findings	   are	   therefore

Accounting and reporting
Recent	   audited	   financial	   statements	   for	   Harare	   Water	   are	   not	   available.	   	   Reported	   revenues	  
are	  not	  reliable	  due	  to	  problems	  with	  meters	  and	  meter	  reading	  and	  large	  dependence	  on	  
estimates.	   There	   are	   large	   variances	   between	   budgeted	   amounts	   and	   actual	   reported	  
expenses.	   Accounting	   practices	   are	   deficient.	   Management	   reports	   of	   expenditure	   include	  
VAT	  and	  there	  is	  no	  accounting	  for	  depreciation.	  Financial	  data	  is	  inconsistent	  and	  financial	  
controls	  need	  improvement.	  
Short-term investments
The	   City	   of	   Harare	   (CoH)	   entered	   into	   a	   contract	   with	   China	   National	   Machinery	   and	  
Equipment	   Import	   and	   Export	   Corporation	   (CMEC)	   for	   the	   rehabilitation	   of	   water	   and

contract	  was	  US$144	  million.	  The	  World	  Bank	  undertook,	  on	  request	  by	  the	  City	  of	  Harare,	  a	  
review	   of	   the	   CMEC	   contract.	   	   Risks	   identified	   in	   this	   review	   were	   conveyed	   to	   the	   City	   of

Greater	   Harare	  was	   even	   more	  serious	  than	   previously	   thought	   and	   that	   the	   situation	   was	  
deteriorating	   rather	   than	   improving.	   Although	   some	   improvements	   had	   been	   achieved	   after	  
the	  social	  and	  economic	  crisis	  in	  2008–09,	  and	  there	  was	  reasonable	  stability	  in	  the	  system	  
over	   the	   period	   2010	   and	   2011,	   there	   had	   been	   a	   deteriorating	   trend	   in	   billed	   revenues	   and	  
from	   about	   September	   2011	   and	   cash	   collections	   had	   dropped	   significantly	   from	   September	  
2012	  through	  May	  2013	  from	  about	  $6	  million	  per	  month	  (60	  percent	  collection	  efficiency)	  
to	  below	  $4	  million	  per	  month	  (40	  percent	  collection	  efficiency).	  This	  placed	  severe	  pressure	  
on	   cash	   flows	   and	   the	   ability	   to	   fund	   essential	   inputs,	   maintain	   and	   repair	   assets,	   and	   pay	  
creditors.	   Water	   production	   dropped	   had	   also	   dropped	   significantly	   from	   December	   2012	   to	  
levels	  last	  seen	  during	  the	  cholera	  epidemic	  in	  late	  2008	  and	  early	  2009.	  A	  detailed	  analysis	  
showed	   that	   the	   reduced	   cash	   flows	   contributed	   to	   the	   subsequent	   reduction	   in	   water	  
production	  due	  to	  shortages	  of	  water	  treatment	  chemicals.	  	  
There	   was	   a	   very	   significant	   danger	   of	   a	   continued	   negative	   spiral	   where	   lack	   of	   cash	   results	  
in	   reduced	   production	   that	   in	   turn	   leads	   to	   even	   lower	   reliability	   of	   supply	   and	   a	   further	  
reduction	   in	   payments	   by	   customers.	   At	   that	   point,	   more	   than	   half	   of	   customers	   were	   not	  
paying	   for	   water	   and	   no	   effective	   sanctions	   for	   non-­‐payment	   had	   been	   implemented.	   The

exacerbated	  the	  situation.13	  The	  risk	  of	  another	  public	  health	  crisis	  could	  not	  be	  discounted.	  	  
The	  underlying	  causes	  of	  this	  situation	  was	  discussed	  with	  the	  management	  teams	  at	  both	  
the	  City	  level	  (Directors)	  and	  in	  Harare	  Water	  (Managers).	  A	  consensus	  was	  reached	  on	  six	  
contributing	   factors:	   (1)	   The	   lack	   of	   cash	   means	   that	   Harare	   Water	   finds	   it	   difficult	   to	   pay	   its	  
chemical	  suppliers	  and	  other	  creditors	  and	  does	  not	  have	  the	  money	  to	  undertake	  essential	  
repairs	   and	   maintenance; 14 	  (2)	   The	   Harare	   Water	   managers	   alleged	   that	   a	   network	   of	  
informal	   money	   flows	   within	   and	   related	   to	   the	   Harare	   Water	   system	   bled	   resources	   from	  
the	   system; 15 	  (3)	   The	   political	   environment	   up	   to	   the	   elections	   in	   July	   2013	   made	  
enforcement	   of	   credit	   control	   difficult;	   (4)	   Poor	   systems	   related	   to	   metering,	   billing,	   and	  
cash	  collection	  contributed	  to	  inefficiencies	  and	  reduce	  the	  ability	  to	  monitor,	  manage,	  and	  
control	   cash	   flows	   effectively;	   (5)	   poor	   services	   reduced	   willingness	   to	   pay;	   and	   (6)	   the	  
overall	  weak	  economy	  reduced	  the	  ability	  to	  pay.	  

Agreed	  actions	  
There	   is	   a	   significant	   amount	   of	   money	   at	   stake	   for	   the	   City	   (cash	   flow	   losses	   amount	   to	  
between	  $2	  million	  and	  $4	  million	  per	  month)	  and	  thus	  the	  importance	  to	  the	  City	  of	  getting	  
this	  right	  is	  hard	  to	  overstate.	  	  It	  is	  possible	  to	  reform	  a	  public	  utility.	  	  However,	  this	  requires	  
strong	  leadership	  together	  with	  an	  appropriately	  supportive	  political	  environment.	  Internal	  
reforms	  thus	  far	  have	  not	  yielded	  good	  results	  and	  a	  different	  strategy	  is	  needed.	  
In	   this	   context,	   a	   set	   of	   urgent	   actions	   were	   agreed	   in	   discussions	   with	   the	   City	   of	   Harare	  
Directors	   and	   Harare	   Water	   management	   over	   the	   period	   June	   2013	   to	   May	   2014.	   These	  
included:	  
       •      Develop,	  approve	  and	  implement	  an	  effective	  credit	  control	  policy;	  
       •      Appoint	  a	  supervising	   consultant	  to	  oversee	  the	  implementation	  of	  capital	  spending	  
              by	  contractors;	  
       •      To	  decide	  on	  the	  creation	  of	  a	  Harare	  Water	  utility,	  a	  corporatized	  entity,	  owned	  by	  
              the	   City,	   to	   provide	   water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   effectively	   and	   efficiently;	   (See	  
              Section	  5);	  and,	  	  
       •      To	  issue	  a	  letter	  of	  request	  for	  technical	  assistance	  from	  the	  World	  Bank	  to	  explore	  
              partnerships	   and	   contracting	   options	   to	   assist	   with	   the	   creation	   of	   a	   corporatized	  
              water	  utility	  and	  to	  improve	  revenue	  and	  debt	  management.	  
At	  the	  time	  of	  writing	  this	  report	  (June	  2013),	  these	  actions	  had	  not	  been	  undertaken.	  


4 Investing for the long term
A	   water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   investment	   plan	   for	   Greater	   Harare	   was	   developed.	   This	  
work	  was	  jointly	  funded	  by	  the	  African	  Development	  Bank	  who	  had	  provided	  funding	  for	  the	  
development	   of	   investment	   plans	   in	   six	   cities	   –	   Harare,	   Chitungwiza,	   Mutare,	   Masvingo,	  
Kwekwe,	   and	   Chegutu,	   and	   the	   World	   Bank	   who	   funded	   the	   extension	   of	   this	   work	   to	  
include	   Norton,	   Epworth	   and	   Ruwa	   and	   to	   prepare	   an	   investment	   plan	   for	   the	   Greater	  
Harare	   area.	   	   The	   Investment	   Plan	   is	   fully	   described	   in	   a	   separate	   report.	   Key	   features	   of	   the

(Table	  3).	  	  
The	   project	   area	   included	   the	   current	   municipal	   boundaries	   as	   well	   as	   anticipated	   future

Investments	   were	   prioritised	   in	   light	   of	   scarce	   resources	   and	   affordability	   concerns.	   The	  
following	  priorities	  were	  identified:	  (1)	  Stabilise	  water	  production	  through	  rehabilitation	  of	  
existing	   water	   treatment	   plants;	   (2)	   reduce	   the	   high	   physical	   losses	   in	   the	   transmission

pressure	   reduction	   valves,	   zone	   metering	   and	   improved	   reservoir	   management	   to	   enable	  
existing	   production	   to	   service	   more	   people	   more	   reliably;	   (3)	   reduce	   the	   high	   aparent	   losses	  
(non-­‐physical	   losses),	   increase	   revenues	   &	   cash	   collection	   through	   improved	   management

maintain	  the	  system;	  (4)	  reduce	  the	  highest	  priority	  health	  risks	  by	  paying	  attention	  to	  sewer	  
spills,	   initiating	   a	   prioritised	   project	   to	   provide	   on-­‐site	   water	   to	   residents	   in	   Epworth,	   and

5 Institutional options for sustained improvements
A	   study	   was	   undertaken	   to	   better	   understand	   the	   possible	   institutional	   options	   for	   the	  
effective	   provision	   the	   water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   in	   Greater	   Harare	   taking	   into	   account	  
current	   circumstances	   and	   lessons	   from	   international	   experience,	   to	   present	   a	   set	   of	  
preferred	  options	  to	  senior	  officials	  and	  decision	  makers	  so	  that	  these	  decision	  makers	  can	  
make	   informed	   decisions	   on	   future	   institutional	   arrangements;	   and	   to	   develop	   a	   roadmap	  
for	  institutional	  alignment	  and	  reform.	  	  This	  study	  is	  reported	  on	  in	  Working	  Paper	  2.	  

5.1        Factors for and against integrated provision

Factors	  favoring	  integrated	  provision	  across	  Greater	  Harare	  
There	   are	   strong	   arguments	   for	   providing	   water	   and	   sanitation	   services	   for	   the	   entire	   region	  
through	  a	  single	  service	  provider.	  
Lower	  costs	  through	  economies	  of	  scale	  and	  avoided	  costs:	  Water	  provision	  in	  the	  smaller	  
satellite	   towns	   have	   low	   economies	   of	   scale	   (Figure	   22).	   Provision	   by	   a	   single	   entity	   could	  
lower	   overall	   costs	   by	   reducing	   overhead	   costs,	   reducing	   procurement	   costs,	   reducing	  
transaction	   costs,	   reducing	   planning	   costs,	   avoiding	   the	   duplication	   of	   services	   and	   lower	  
unit	  treatment	  costs	  as	  a	  result	  of	  greater	  scale.	  	  
Enhanced	   professional	   capacity	   in	   larger	   scale	   of	   operation:	  A	  larger	  more	  financially	  viable	  
entity	   has	   a	   greater	   ability	   to	   attract	   and	   retain	   professionals—managers,	   engineers,	  
planners	  and	  other	  technical	  personnel.	  It	  is	  hard	  for	  small	  operations	  to	  attract	  and	  retain	  
professional	  staff.	  
Integrated	   water	   resources	   management:	   The	   urban	   areas	   of	   Greater	   Harare	   fall	   largely	  
within	   a	   single	   catchment	   (Figure	   2),	   and	   the	   water	   system	   in	   the	   Greater	   Harare	   area	   is	  
highly	  interconnected.	  All	  areas	  rely	  on	  the	  same	  resource	  for	  most	  of	  their	  supply	  and	  most	  
of	   the	   wastewater	   flows	   back	   into	   the	   same	   resource.	   It	   is	   imperative	   that	   this	   cycle	   be	  
better	  managed.18	  Having	  a	  single	  entity	  play	  a	  significant	  role	  in	  this	  cycle	  will	  make	  it	  much	  
easier	  to	  manage	  compared	  to	  the	  situation	  where	  multiple	  entities	  are	  involved.	  
Access	   to	   finance:	   A	   single,	   larger,	   and	   financially	  
viable	   entity	   has	   a	   much	   greater	   chance	   of	   accessing	  
investment	   finance	   compared	   to	   a	   few	   small	   entities.	  
The	   financing	   transaction	   costs	   are	   also	   reduced	   for	   a	  
single	  entity	  compared	  to	  multiple	  entities.	  
Private	   sector	   participation:	   Private	   sector	  
participation—through	   a	   management	   contract,	   for	  
example—is	   much	   more	   feasible	   for	   a	   single	   entity	  
than	  for	  multiple	  entities.	  
Ability	  to	  average	  costs	  across	  the	  region:	  	  A	  regional	  
entity	   can	   apply	   average	   costs	   across	   the	   region,	  
thereby	   eliminating	   high	   tariffs	   to	   cover	   costs	   in	  
                                                                                             Figure 22: Relative settlement scale Greater Harare

              specific	   circumstances	   within	   the	   region.	   For	   example,	   in	   the	   case	   of	   Norton,	   it	   is	   must	   more	  
              cost	   effective	   for	   the	   town	   to	   purchase	   bulk	   water	   from	   Harare	   Water	   than	   it	   is	   to	   supply	   its	  
              own	  water	  through	  a	  separate	  scheme.	  

              Factors	  favoring	  disaggregation	  	  
              Although	  the	  arguments	  for	  integration	  are	  strong,	  there	  are	  a	  number	  of	  factors	  that	  pull	  in	  
              the	  opposite	  direction.	  	  
              The	   National	   Water	   Policy	   supports	   decentralization	   and	   gives	   responsibility	   for	   water	   and	  
              sanitation	  provision	  to	  local	  government.	  This	  policy	  implies	  that	  local	  governments	  have	  the	  
              right	  to	  decide	  on	  how	  water	  supply	  and	  sanitation	  services	  are	  provided	  for	  their	  area.	  
              Poor	   performance	   on	   the	   part	   of	   Harare	   Water	   (as	   regional	   bulk	   provider)	   and	   the	  
              inequitable	   distribution	   of	   water	   between	   settlements	   provide	   strong	   incentives	   for	   the	  
              satellite	  towns	  to	  develop	  and	  manage	  their	  own	  independent	  supplies.	  
              Town	  councils	  will	  lose	  revenue	  through	  aggregation	  under	  the	  current	  fiscal	  dispensation	  in	  
              which	  local	  municipalities	  have	  few	  local	  revenue	  sources	  and	  where	  water	  is	  a	  major	  source	  
              of	  local	  revenue.	  Unless	  there	  is	  fiscal	  reform	  of	  inter-­‐government	  finances	  and	  the	  ability	  of	  
              local	   government	   to	   raise	   local	   revenues,	   it	   is	   unlikely	   that	   local	   governments	   will	   want	   to	  
              give	  up	  control	  of	  water	  services	  distribution	  and	  the	  revenue	  stream	  attached	  to	  it.

             However,	  this	  option	  does	  not	  solve	  the	  service	  integration	  issue.	  
              Option 2: Creation of a water utility by City of Harare
              The	   City	   of	   Harare	   can	   create	   its	   own	   water	   utility.	   This	   utility	   can	   then	   enter	   into	   service	  
              agreements	  with	  the	  other	  towns.	  The	  advantage	  of	  this	  is	  that	  there	  is	  more	  transparency	  
              in	  relation	  to	  the	  allocation	  and	  reporting	  on	  revenues	  and	  costs	  associated	  with	  the	  service.	  
              This	   may	   give	   the	   other	   towns	   greater	   confidence	   and	   result	   in	   more	   willingness	   to	   enter	  
              into	  service	  agreements.	  This	  would	  be	  attractive	  to	  the	  other	  towns	  if	  the	  utility	  performs	  
              well.	   This	   option	   does	   not	   solve	   the	   service	   integration	   issue	   but	   could	   be	   considered	   as	   a	  
              step	  toward	  integration.	  
              Option 3: Consolidation through a metropolitan-wide entity
              In	   this	   option,	   the	   five	   municipalities	   agree	   to	   form	   a	   jointly-­‐owned	   municipal	   entity	   to

provide	  water	  and	  sanitation	  services	  to	  the	  metropolitan	  area.	  Each	  municipality	  will	  have	  
both	  an	  ownership	  agreement	  (shareholder	  agreement)	  and	  a	  separate	  services	  agreement	  
with	   the	   utility.	   This	   is	   a	   complex	   and	   potentially	   unstable	   arrangement,	   being	   subject	   to	  
changes	   in	   the	   politics	   in	   the	   different	   municipalities.	   Current	   trends	   of	   service

would	  be	  required	  to	  enter	  into	  service	  agreements	  with	  the	  metropolitan	  water	  entity.	  This	  
option	  is	  similar	  to	  the	  previous	  ZINWA	  dispensation	  except	  that	  the	  public	  utility	  is	  set	  up	  
specifically	   to	   serve	   the	   metropolitan	   area	   (whereas	   ZINWA	   had	   a	   country-­‐wide	   mandate).	  
This	   option	   may	   be	   strongly	   contested	   by	   local	   government,	   especially	   where	   their	  
experience	  of	  management	  of	  their	  water	  and	  sanitation	  by	  ZINWA	  was	  not	  favorable.	  
Option 5: Local government is reformed to create a single metropolitan area
In	  this	  option,	  the	  local	  governments	  within	  Greater	  Harare	  are	  amalgamated	  into	  a	  single	  
metropolitan	  government	  through	  local	  government	  boundary	  reforms.	  This	  reform	  would,	  
at	   the	   same	   time,	   solve	   the	   service	   integration	   issue.	   The	   single	   metropolitan-­‐wide	  
government	   could	   then	   provide	   water	   services	   through	   its	   own	   metropolitan	   government	  
department,	   or	   it	   could	   establish	   a	   corporatized	   water	   utility	   wholly	   owned	   by	   the	  
metropolitan	  government	  to	  provide	  the	  service	  on	  its	  behalf.	  

5.3        Assessment of options
The	  above	  options	  were	  presented	  and	  discussed	  at	  a	  workshop	  with	  officials	  from	  the	  five	  
cities/towns	   (town	   clerks	   and	   town	   engineers	   or	   their	   equivalents)	   and	   officials	   from	   the	  
ministries	   of	   local	   government	   and	   water	   in	   April	   2013.	   The	   outcome	   of	   the	   assessment

water	  utility	  with	  substantially	  improved	  performance	  to	  provide	  metro-­‐wide	  services.	  This	  
reform	   was	   considered	   necessary,	   in	   any	   event,	   to	   achieve	   improved	   performance	   for	   the	  
City	   of	   Harare.	   In	   addition,	   this	   option	   could	   be	   an	   important	   stepping-­‐stone	   toward	  
improved	  integration	  and	  service	  provision	  for	  Greater	  Harare.	  The	  four	  other	  towns	  would	  
have	   a	   greater	   incentive	   to	   request	   services	   from	   this	   utility	   if	   it	   performed	   well.	  
Interestingly,	   the	   preferred	   reform	   path	   is	   very	   similar	   to	   the	   actual	   reform	   path	   undertaken	  
in	  Lusaka	  (Box	  1).	  

5.4        Taking reforms forward
These	  recommendations	  from	  the	  officials	  need	  to	  be	  taken	  forward	  at	  a	  political	  level	  with	  
firm	  commitment	  to	  a	  chosen	  reform	  pathway,	  and	  led	  by	  a	  reform	  champion.	  Substantial	  
technical	  and	  management	  support	  will	  be	  needed.

Very	   large	   investments	   (up	   to	   $2	   billion)	   are

institutional	  reforms	  as	  the	  critical	  next	  step.	   Figure 24: Investment plan implementation steps	  
While	  these	  reforms	  are	  being	  initiated,	  the	  municipalities	  can	  commence	  undertaking	  the	  
more	  detailed	  planning,	  feasibility	  and	  design	  studies	  necessary	  to	  put	  investment	  packages	  
to	  tender	  for	  construction.	  
2. Create a conducive external environment for better utility performance
Harare	  Water	  needs	  to	  be	  given	  a	  clearer	  mandate	  by	  creating	  a	  company	  structure	  with	  a	  
company	  charter	  and	  board	  of	  directors.	  Directors	  need	  to	  be	  independent	  and	  appointed	  
based	   on	   competence.	   Management	   and	   staff	   appointment	   need	   to	   be	   merit-­‐based	   with	  
operational	  responsibility	  delegated	  to	  the	  management	  team.	  Tariffs	  need	  to	  be	  set	  at	  an	  
appropriate	   level	   to	   ensure	   sufficient	   resources	   to	   operate	   and	   maintain	   the	   system.	  
Revenues	  from	  the	  sale	  of	  water	  need	  to	  be	  ring-­‐fenced	  and	  used	  for	  improvements	  to	  the	  
service.	   Credit	   control	   needs	   to	   be	   effectively	   enforced.	   Financial	   accounts	   need	   to	   be	  
regularly	   audited	   and	   up	   to	   date.	   	   The	   utility	   needs	   to	   report	   in	   a	   transparent	   way	   on	   its	  
performance	  to	  the	  board,	  its	  shareholder	  and	  to	  its	  customers.	  Strong	  political	  leadership	  
will	  be	  necessary	  to	  create	  these	  conditions.	  
3. Reform local government finances so that water revenues can be ring-fenced
Local	   governments	   are	   heavily	   reliant	   of	   water	   and	   wastewater	   revenues.	  Local	   government	  
finances	   will	   need	   to	   be	   reformed	   at	   the	   same	   time	   as	   the	   utility	   is	   financially	   ring-­‐fenced	  
and	   its	   finances	   and	   operations	   separated	   from	   the	   rest	   of	   the	   city.	   This	   exercise	   could	  
benefit	  from	  further	  technical	  assistance.

4. Improve the technical capability and management of Harare Water
Existing	  technical	  capability	  needs	  within	  Harare	  Water	  needs	  to	  be	  enhanced,	  particularly	  at	  
the	  engineering	  and	  technical	  supervision	  levels.	  	  Much	   more	   attention	   needs	  to	  be	  given	  to	  
improving	  the	  overall	  management	  of	  the	  utility	  in	  general,	  and	  the	  management	  of	  finances	  
and	   customers	   in	   particular.	   	   It	   is	   the	   World	   Bank’s	   view	   that	   this	   will	   require	   external	  
management	   expertise	   to	   achieve	   substantial	   improvements	   in	   performance.	   Getting	   cash	  
collections	  up	  from	  40%	  to	  over	  90%,	  and	  reducing	  non-­‐revenue	  water	  from	  60%	  down	  to	  
25%	   are	   very	   challenging	   tasks.	   The	   utility	   will	   benefit	   from	   managers	   who	   have	   achieved	  
these	  results	  in	  other	  contexts	  and	  can	  bring	  their	  skills	  and	  experience	  to	  bear.	  
5. Obtain external management support
It	   is	   the	   World	   Bank’s	   recommendation	   that	   the	   City	   of	   Harare	   seek	   external	   professional	  
expertise	  to	  turn	  the	  utility	  around	  in	  the	  context	  of	  establishing	  an	  autonomous	  legal	  entity.	  
This	  can	  be	  achieved	  through	  a	  management	  contract	  although	  other	  modalities	  (such	  as	  a	  
lease	  or	  affermage	  contract)	  are	  also	  possible.	  Implementing	  performance	  contracts	  in	  the	  
absence	  of	  bringing	  in	  additional	  management	  expertise	  is	  unlikely	  to	  succeed.	  
6. Raise the necessary investment finance on appropriate terms
The	  quantum	  of	  investment	  finance	  required	  is	  unlikely	  to	  be	  to	  be	  made	  available	  through	  
grant	   finance	   alone.	   While	   some	   grant	   finance	   may	   be	   available,	   a	   significant	   share	   will	   have	  
to	   be	   raised	   through	   loans.	   	   Financiers	   will	   want	   assurance	   that	   the	   loans	   can	   and	   will	   be	  
repaid.	   Significantly	   improved	   performance	   of	   Harare	   Water	   is	   necessary	   in	   order	   to	   make	  
the	  repayment	  of	  loans	  possible.	  
7. Implement the investments
Implement	  the	  investments	  as	  per	  the	  steps	  set	  out	  in	  Figure	  24.	  


Afterword
In	  late	  May	  2014,	  the	  ministers	  responsible	  for	  water	  and	  local	  government	  respectively	  had	  
indicated	  their	  support	  for	  the	  recommended	  reforms,	  in	  response	  to	  a	  presentation	  of	  the	  
core	  content	  of	  this	  Summary	  Note.	  Some	  clear	  milestones	  to	  indicate	  commitment	  to	  the	  
process	   had	   been	   set	   –	   implementation	   of	   an	   effective	   credit	   control	   policy,	   appointment	   of	  
a	  professional	  supervising	  consultant	  to	  oversee	  the	  short-­‐term	  investments,	  and	  a	  written	  
request	   for	   further	   technical	   assistance	   to	   take	   forward	   the	   institutional	   reform	  
recommendations.	  These	  matters	  were	  outstanding	  since	  June	  2013.	  At	  the	  time	  of	  finalising	  
this	  Summary	  Note	  (January	  2015),	  progress	  on	  these	  action	  items	  had	  not	  been	  reported.

   Water production held up for three months following the decline in cash collection but then declined in December 2012,
initially as a result of a shortage of chemicals. The long-term chemical contracts came to an end in December 2012 and Harare
Water had to make cash payments for chemicals with money they did not have.
11
   Billing data is not reliable. The drop in production in December 2012 did not have the expected reduction in sales indicating a
problem with the sales data that appears to rely largely on estimates rather than on actual water used. Many meters are not
working and intermittent supply also contributes to the problem.

   More up to date financial data was not available.

   Creditors for chemical supplies stood at $7.8 million in May 2013, having increased from $3.5 million over 12 months. Long-
term contracts for chemical supplies ended in December 2012 and supplies thereafter have been based on cash payments.
15
   A stakeholder net-mapping exercise was undertaken with the Harare Water management team in April 2013. During this
exercise the managers alleged that there was an extensive network of informal money flows that detracted from the objective of
achieving 24/7.
16
   Note that Kunzvi Dam was originally motivated as a priority investment in order to meet a current nominal demand of 1200
Ml/day. The analysis in the TA showed that this demand was overstated and the restoring existing production capacity to 700
Ml/day would be more than sufficient to meet existing demand. The investment plan analysis showed that Kunzvi was still
necessary, for the purposes of increasing security of supply (not meeting a high nominal demand). The original assumption that
short-term investments should prioritise restoration of production capacity is still correct.
17
   Cost are based on quotations from reputable manufacturer’s agents in the region were developed into rates with the addition of
transport, handling charges, profit and overhead charges and installation costs. For the major overall works component of pipe
installations and civil works involving earthworks, the rates have generally been worked up from first principals using basic
earthworks rates from the higher end of the market spread. For investment items where works are similar to recent tenders under
the UWSSRP Phase 1 works currently under execution, the rates tendered by the contractors have been used. The rates do not
include VAT and other taxes. It is further assumed that import duty will be waived on all materials and equipment that will be
imported for the purpose of these investments.
18
   This issue is also longstanding. See, for example, “Integrated water quality management in Harare Zimbabwe” (Gumbo
Bekithemba, 23RD WEDC Conference, 1997).
