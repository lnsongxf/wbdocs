EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This report describes the activities, outputs and results of a three year non-lending
technical assistance program that allowed lessons from community-managed food and
nutrition security initiatives in Andhra Pradesh and the rest of India to be incorporated in
low income states of India, particularly Bihar in Eastern India. This report also describes
how aspects of food security and nutrition can be embedded in rural livelihood programs
being implemented throughout the country and especially in low income states in Eastern
and Central India. These programs target the 250 million poorest households through
social and economic empowerment of women through self-managed self-help groups and
federations. These programs are supported primarily by local community resources, the
government and commercial banks. The World Bank is supporting the Indian government
and 16 Indian state governments to implement these programs.

The report is organized into nine sections, the first section is on context; the second on
objective and key outputs; the third on technical assistance and outputs; the fourth on
technical assistance for integrating health, nutrition and sanitation; the fifth on knowledge
products; the sixth on food production, productivity, availability and affordability; the
seventh on knowledge dissemination and events; the eighth on outcomes of The South Asia
Food and Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI) supported non-lending technical
assistance, knowledge and learning programs and the ninth on dissemination. In addition,
there are four annexures, the first a table of malnutrition in states of India; the second on
financial statements; the third on deliverables and the fourth the result framework.

In erstwhile Andhra Pradesh (now Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) there has been a
significant investment in social and economic empowerment of women, particularly from
poor households, since the year 2000. These programs have reached significant scale,
creating one of the largest institutional platforms of organized communities. Eleven million
poor households have been mobilized into multi-layered community institutions—
including self-help groups and their federations—in more than 36,000 villages. Nearly 90 %
of poor households in the state are members of these community institutions. Some of the
key outcomes include savings at the household level of more than US$1 billion and
significant financial inclusion with credit access over the last ten years of more than
US$10.5 billion. In addition, 3.8 million acres of land (~1.2 million farmers) have been
brought under sustainable agricultural practices and 257,000 dairy farmers in 3,800
villages have been linked to formal dairy markets. These programs have been facilitated by
the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP), an autonomous institution promoted by
the Government of Andhra Pradesh.

In this context, SERP worked on testing and developing a community managed health and
nutrition approach in selected villages. This approach combined universal and targeted
interventions. The universal interventions included: (i) fixed health and nutrition days for
                                                                                           8
self-help groups and women members to enable regular growth monitoring, promotion and
social audits to enable community organizations to focus on nutrition outcomes; (ii) access
to regular health savings funds, health insurance and a community managed health risk
fund to keep health care costs affordable and accessible; and (iii) community kitchen
gardens to reduce anemia and increase micronutrient uptake. The targeted interventions
include community managed and assisted Nutrition and Day Care Centers (NDCCs). These
NDCCs serve as a one stop shop for providing nutrition and related services, including
providing a balanced diet to pregnant and lactating women, as well as children under 2
years.

In Andhra Pradesh (AP) SERP has facilitated 4,264 community-managed health and
nutrition centers (NDCCs) covering about 100,000 households. These community managed
health and nutrition services have reduced malnutrition levels in pregnant women and
children and improved maternal health indicators, health-seeking behavior of households,
and access to various services — including access to neo-natal care, safe delivery and
immunization rates. These approaches demonstrate proof of concept for using community
managed approaches for effective delivery of health and nutritional services at the
household level. This enabled the institutional platform developed for financial and
economic inclusion to be used for delivering health and nutrition services.

Jeevika (Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society, BRLPS) is an independent society
created by the Government of Bihar in 2007 and supported by the World Bank with the
objective of enhancing the social and economic empowerment of the rural poor. BRLPS
facilitates social, financial, and economic inclusion of the poor. In Bihar, 4.2 million rural
households have been mobilized into 360,000 self-help groups (SHGs), 14,000 village
organizations, and 300 cluster-level federations through community-to-community scale
up. In Bihar however health and nutrition status is one of the lowest in the India. More than
half the children below five years of age were underweight or stunted, indicating chronic
malnutrition. Malnutrition was one of the biggest factors of morbidity in the state at around
45 % of total mortality for children under 5 years of age. The Government of Bihar and
Jeevika studied the program in AP and requested technical assistance and knowledge
management from the World Bank to use what had been learned in AP for Bihar.

The objective of the SAFANSI supported project was to support technical assistance, cross
learning and capacity building in Bihar, learn from other community based approaches in
India, particularly AP, and use this knowledge and learning to pilot these approaches. The
technical assistance approach used community-to-community, project-to-project and
thematic area to thematic area interaction and exchanges. A series of outputs including
training manuals, diagnostic reports, framework documents, implementation plans and
application software for mobile based tracking systems were developed as part of the
technical assistance.

SERP provided technical assistance to Jeevika to develop capacity in Bihar within
government, project staff, and community organizations; provide access to handholding and
                                                                                            9
technical expertise from AP and develop an implementation and intervention framework to
implement a community based health and nutrition service delivery program on a
significant scale. The TA project has implications on health and nutrition services in other
low income Indian states such as Orissa, Jharkhand and Madhya Pradesh, where similar
community institutional platforms were being mobilized. The South Asia Food and
Nutrition Security Initiative (SAFANSI) supported this proposal. Technical assistance from
SERP helped Jeevika establish and support 92 Community-managed Health & Nutrition Care
Centers (CHNCC) at the village level to address malnutrition among vulnerable poor
communities—especially pregnant and lactating women and children up to 2 years of age.
The CHNCC facilitates linkages with government health services, such as immunization of
pregnant women and children and services available at the primary health centers (PHCs).
By mid-2015, 3882 pregnant women and 4254 lactating mothers had enrolled in the
CHNCCs and 82% of their children were found to have a birth weight higher than 2.5 kg
compared to the baseline average weight of 2.1 kg in non-treatment households. Each
community is also being mobilized to access health financing through a health risk fund,
improve the quality of service provision at the PHCs through the placement of Case
Managers (Swastha Mitra), and increase access to PHCs through greater awareness and
mobilization by the Health Worker (Jeevika Saheli). At the grassroots level, sahelis act as
catalysts of change and play a critical role as conduits of information for the target women.
These interventions complemented the CHNCCs to develop a one stop shop approach for
pregnant women in the context of Bihar.

The activities supported through the SAFANSI TA grant have resulted in leveraging three
strategic partnerships with other agencies and programs that want to work in the area of
health and nutrition services using the institutional platform of SHGs and their federations.
The first activity proposed working with 150,000 SHGs supported by the Bill and Melinda
Gates Foundation (BMGF) integrating maternal and child health, nutrition, family planning
and sanitation services in partnership with Project Concern International. The second
activity supports community sensitization through Participatory Learning and Action (PLA)
methodology on health, nutrition and sanitation issues with the Bihar government
implemented BTAST/DFID1 in 5 Districts. The third activity involves Food Fortification
work with GAIN and NIDAN2. These activities will have to be assessed and evaluated to
determine the differential impact of various interventions.

Jeevika’s approach to Health and Nutrition has incorporated food security: access and
diversification of diets through agriculture and related interventions. The supported


1 BTAST/DFID is known as Bihar Technical Assistance and Support Team/ Department of
International Development.

2GAIN /NIDAN GAIN /NIDAN The Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN) is an international
organization driven by the vision of a world without malnutrition.


                                                                                           10
activities include increased access to food through productivity enhancement, timely access
to the Public Distribution System, collective purchase of food grains through a dedicated
Food Security Fund and grain banks. It also includes diet diversification through increased
access to pulses and vegetables through System of Crop Intensification (SCI) and the
development of the dairy and poultry sectors.

Jeevika’s SCI program enables very small famers to undertake intensive farming and
produce significantly higher outputs from small plots of land. This approach, which began
with rice, has been used for wheat, green gram, oil seeds and vegetables in Bihar.
Production diversification has significantly increased yields for vegetables (20%), pulses
(56%), oil seeds (50%), wheat (72%) and rice (86%). SCI is supported through community
managed extension approaches organizing farmer field schools and extension through
participatory development of content and videos through digital libraries for farmers. These
approaches were documented, analyzed, and disseminated using SAFANSI funds and made
into an implementation framework.

More recently, Jeevika has integrated sanitation into the health and nutrition agenda in view
of the increasing evidence of links between nutrition and sanitation. This included a number
of diagnostic activities being carried out in Bihar in partnership with the Water and
Sanitation Program (WSP) of the Bank. The SAFANSI project supported a National
Workshop on links between sanitation and nutrition; Community Lead Total Sanitation
(CLTS) and enterprise-based approaches for sanitation services organized for various low
income states, including Bihar and Orissa. Subsequently, an exposure visit to Bangladesh to
look at innovations adopted by BRAC was organized jointly with WSP with all senior
functionaries from Bihar introduced to sanitation services relevant to their state. This
resulted in the development of Project Implementation Plans for implementing community-
lead approaches in six districts in Bihar. At the policy level, a memorandum of
understanding (MoU) has been signed between the Public Health and Engineering
Department (PHED) and Jeevika to smooth the flow of funds to community organizations
and their clients under Swachh Bharat Abhiyan (Clean India Mission).

The second major set of activities supported by SAFANSI included production of a series of
knowledge products to inform the next generation of multi sectoral health and nutrition
programs in poorer regions of AP and Telangana: Andhra Pradesh Rural Inclusive Growth
Project (APRIGP) and Telangana Rural Inclusive Growth Project (TRIGP). These programs
work on converged service delivery (demand and supply), developing entrepreneurial
approaches to providing health and nutrition services, designing and implementing social
safety nets and conditional cash transfers, a one-stop-shop for e-governance and service
delivery, data analytics and use of Information Communications and Technology (ICT) for
feedback and decision making.

Various knowledge and learning products were produced to inform the design of the AP and
Telangana programs. Large-scale programs were analyzed and studied. These included the
Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS), a national program for delivering nutrition
                                                                                          11
services in India; the Comprehensive Rural Health Project (CRHP) in Jamkhed, Maharashtra,
one of the earliest community managed public health initiatives in India; and
Progresa/Oportunidades, an international best practice conditional cash transfer program
administered by the Federal Government of Mexico. Lessons from a South-South Knowledge
Exchange program between SERP and Progresa were also incorporated. The studies looked
at key outcome variables in terms of health and nutrition indicators and the costs
associated with it. The study aimed at understanding the strengths and weaknesses of each
program to draw lessons for design and implementation.

The second study looked at the characteristics of health and nutrition security at the
household level. The study highlighted the factors that lead to enhanced nutrition in Poorest
of Poor (POP) households. This was collected at the level of day care center and primary
health center. Based on the data, strategies to induce nutrition-seeking behavior in these
households were recommended. The data collected showed a high correlation between the
weight for age characteristics of children, extent of non-anemic women, access to backyard
gardens (vegetable consumption), dairy animals (milk consumption), and poultry assets
(egg and meat consumption). The study showed that programs enabling access to
productivity enhancement assets and practices should precede supplemental nutrition
programs.

The SAFANSI grant has been in integrating health, nutrition and sanitation thinking in
community managed rural livelihood programs. It has helped deepen technical expertise
and content in these areas. This grant has created a platform and ecosystem for innovation,
piloting, and learning in the area of community managed nutrition and health services. It
has also enabled governments in low income states of India, especially Bihar, to develop a
large scale proof of concept for implementation and initiating multi-stakeholder platforms
in partnership with other agencies. Results from these programs have the potential to be
replicated through another national program, the National Rural Livelihood Mission
(NRLM), which works with 250 million households, particularly in low income states of
India.

I) CONTEXT
Sectoral/Institutional Context and Relationship to CAS: India is home to the world’s
largest hungry population, where over 200 million are food insecure. According to the 2008
Global Hunger Index (GHI-2008), the state of Madhya Pradesh had the most severe hunger
levels, followed by Jharkhand and Bihar. The malnutrition scenario in India is a cause for
concern. Child malnutrition levels are worse in India than in Sub-Saharan Africa, despite
large expenditures under programs like the Integrated Child Development Scheme (ICDS),
Mid-Day Meal Scheme (MDM), Reproductive and Child Health programs (RCH), etc. The
status of food availability and nutritional status of poor in high poverty states is given in
Annexure 1. Nearly 40 % of children under three are underweight and 45 per cent are
stunted. 36 % of adult women and 34 % of adult men suffer from chronic energy deficiency.
Twenty two to thirty per cent of children are born with low birth weight.

Food and nutritional outcomes are closely linked with issues of livelihood opportunities.
Social mobilization of the poor into community based institutions is a key instrument for
reducing poverty. It also strengthens demand for services provided by the state and ensures
better outcomes for members in the form of improved food security, improved health
indicators and an eventual decline in poverty.

The proposed initiative is consistent with the Country Assistance Strategy (CAS 2009-12)
through engagement with high poverty states to help India achieve the MDGs and make
growth more inclusive. The experiences of state-supported rural livelihood programs has
shown that investments in social and economic mobilization of the rural poor leads to
increased voice, participation and representation of the rural poor in local governments and
creates demand-side accountability and pressure for improvements in local governance and
last mile service delivery.

These include better targeting of the development programs, increased access to nutrition
services, reduced malnutrition and infant and maternal mortality, increased access to social
safety nets including the Mahatma Gandhi National Rural Employment Guarantee Scheme
(MGNREGS), pensions, PDS entitlements and insurance services.

Andhra Pradesh

In erstwhile Andhra Pradesh (now Andhra Pradesh and Telangana) there has been a
significant investment in social and economic empowerment of women, particularly from
poor households since 2000. These programs have reached significant scale, creating one of
the largest institutional platforms for women. Eleven million poor households have been
mobilized into community institutions including self-help groups and their federations in
more than 36,000 villages. Nearly 90 % of poor households in the state are members of
these community institutions. Some of the key outcomes include savings at the household
level of more than $1 billion and significant financial inclusion, with credit access over the
last ten years of more than $10.5 billion. In addition, 3.8 million acres of land (~1.2 million
farmers) have been brought under the sustainable agricultural practices and 257,000 dairy
farmers in 3,800 villages have been linked to formal dairy markets.i In addition, youth from
poor households have received skills and placement services resulting in more than half a
million youth getting access to jobs in the formal labor market (Fig. 1). These programs
                                                                                            13
have been facilitated by the Society for Elimination of Rural Poverty (SERP), an autonomous
organization promoted by the Andhra Pradesh. This program has been supported by the
World Bank through series of investment lending programs.




Figure 1: Community-Based Institutional Platform.

In this context, SERP worked on testing and developing a community managed health and
nutrition approach in selected villages. This approach included a combination of universal
and targeted interventions. The universal interventions included: (i) fixed health and
nutrition days for self-help groups and women members to promote and monitor regular
growth and social audits to enable community organizations to focus on nutrition
outcomes; (ii) access to regular health savings funds, health insurance, and a community
managed health risk fund to keep health costs affordable and accessible; and
(iii) community kitchen gardens to reduce anemia and increase micronutrient uptake. The
targeted interventions include community managed and assisted Nutrition and Day Care
Centers (NDCCs). These NDCCs serve as a one-stop-shop for providing nutrition and related
services, including providing a balanced diet to pregnant and lactating women and children
under 2 years.




                                                                                        14
Figure 2: The community managed health and nutrition approach used in AP.




In Andhra Pradesh (AP) SERP has facilitated 4,264 community-managed health and
nutrition centers (NDCCs) covering about 100,000 households. These community managed
health and nutrition services had an impact on reduced malnutrition levels in pregnant
women and children, improved maternal health indicators, health-seeking behavior of
households, and access to various services — including access to neo-natal care, safe
delivery and immunization rates. Some of the key impacts included more than 9 kg mean
weight gain for pregnant women, increase in mean birth weight for children of up to 2.9 kg ,
increased detection of anemia during pregnancy, higher numbers of safe deliveries,
frequency of ANC visits, increase in colostrum feeding, breastfeeding and rate of
immunization.ii These approaches demonstrated proof of concept for using community
managed approaches for effective delivery of health and nutritional services at the
household level. This allowed the institutional platform developed for financial and
economic inclusion to be used for delivering health and nutrition services.

The following chart summarizes the impact of community-based health and nutrition
approach on various health and nutrition indicators (Fig 3).




                                                                                         15
Figure 3: Impact of community-based approach on various health and nutrition indicators from 2007-
11iii.



An independent impact study carried out by CESS3 for households illustrated the impact of
community organization membership on access to food and health services at the
household level. Households which participated in the program reported an increased
access of 3.28 kg of cereals from the Public Food Distribution System (PDS) as compared to
the non-participants. The number of unsafe deliveries the participating women declined by
9%.

Bihar

Jeevika (Bihar Rural Livelihoods Promotion Society, BRLPS) is an independent society set
up by the Government of Bihar in 2007 and supported by the World Bank with the objective
of enhancing the social and economic empowerment of the rural poor. In Bihar, 4.2 million
rural households have been mobilized into 360,000 SHGs, 14,000 village organizations, and
300 cluster-level federations through community-to-community scale up. Bihar however
has some of the lowest health and nutrition status in India. More than half of children under
five years of age were underweight or stunted, indicating chronic malnutrition. Malnutrition
was one of the biggest factors of morbidity in Bihar at around 45% of total mortality of
children under 5. The Government of Bihar and Jeevika studied the program in AP and
requested the World Bank to provide technical assistance and knowledge management

II) OBJECTIVE AND KEY OUTPUTS
The project development objective was to enhance institutional capacity of rural livelihood
projects for effective planning, designing, implementation and monitoring of food security
and nutrition initiatives in the context illustrated above.

The objective of the SAFANSI supported project was to support technical assistance, cross
learning and capacity building in Bihar, learn from other community based approaches in
India, particularly AP, and use this knowledge and learning for piloting of these approaches.
The technical assistance was aimed at developing capacity in Bihar within government,
project staff and community organizations, getting access to handholding and technical
expertise from AP and developing the framework to implement a community-based health
and nutrition service delivery program on a significant scale. The NLTA project has
implications on health and nutrition services in other low income states of India like Orissa,
Jharkhand and MP where community institutional platforms have been mobilized through
other World Bank supported programs like National Rural Livelihood Project, which has
been implemented in 13 high poverty states. The SAFANSI supported project helped create
knowledge and learning products that could be used in Andhra Pradesh and Telangana to
develop next-generation rural inclusive growth programs with significant nutrition and
food security components.

The total funding received for SAFANSI TA was US $300,000. Project expenditures totaled
US $297, 538. The funds were spent on technical assistance to state livelihood missions,
development and preparing knowledge materials and dissemination of the project outputs,
results and findings. A detailed breakdown of expenditures in each category is provided in
Annex 2.

                      Categories                     Amount (US$)
                      Technical Assistance           1,63,573
                      Knowledge Products             1,08,019
                      Dissemination                  21,600


The technical assistance approach was used in community-to-community, project-to-project
and thematic area to thematic area interaction and exchanges. A series of outputs including
training manuals, diagnostic reports, framework documents, implementation plans and
application software for mobile-based tracking systems were developed as part of the
technical assistance. These are illustrated in Annex 3.

Various knowledge products were prepared under the project. These included stocktaking
reports, learning notes, case studies, blogs, analytical studies and other thematic papers.
Some of these have been published and web links have been provided. A list of these
outputs is illustrated in Annex 3.


                                                                                           17
Figure 4 provides a summary of activities, outputs and broader outcomes of the project.

SAFANSI TA was used to experiment with different approaches, learn from them and apply
their findings to the livelihoods projects. We looked at trends to try to understand what
other studies had found about health and nutrition in the Jeevika project.

In the following sections we provide detailed description of various activities supported by
the SAFANSI project, outputs and outcomes of the program over a three year period (2012-
2015).



III) TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE
Technical assistance aimed to develop capacity in Bihar within Government, project staff
and community organizations, get access to handholding and technical expertise from AP
and develop implementation and intervention framework to implement a community-based
health and nutrition service delivery program on a significant scale.         The technical
assistance approach used community-to-community, project-to-project and thematic area
to thematic area interaction and exchanges. A series of outputs including training manuals,
diagnostic reports, framework documents, implementation plans and application software
for mobile based tracking systems were developed as part of the technical assistance.
The following sections summarize the various aspects of technical assistance carried out
under the project:
                                                                                          18
         A) TECHNICAL IMMERSION VISITS IN AP AND SCOPING MISSIONS
            CONDUCTED BY SERP IN BIHAR AND CRHP IN JAMKHED,
            MAHARASHTRA
This involved organization of orientation cum immersion program on the community-based
health and nutrition activities carried out in AP for program leadership and field staff from
Jeevika. The immersion programs included understanding the programmatic aspects of the
program and field immersions in three districts to learn from program implementation and
community management. The aspects covered included the inter-sectoral orientation of the
health and nutrition activities, particularly links with financial inclusion and livelihood
aspects in consultation with other thematic staff. They also interacted with various Project
Directors to understand program management aspects. After returning to Hyderabad, the
three teams exchanged their experiences and underwent reflective debriefing and learning.
This phase of orientation and immersion helped the Bihar team understand the context
where these activities were being implemented. They also understood the program content
and management architecture and developed a better understanding of what could and
what could not be adapted to work in Bihar. The team developed a better understanding of
which thematic interventions to pilot and how. They accessed various manuals, films and
training program curriculum developed by SERP over the years.

The team was exposed to the Community Rural Help Project (CRHP)4 in Jamkhed for three
days to understand the mother project (CRHP) that had inspired SERP in AP. During that
period they had the opportunity to understand the community health approach and interact
with village health workers and master trainers. The purpose of organizing this visit was to
provide an opportunity to understand the successful community health model implemented
by CRHP Jamkhed since decades and expose them to the various systems, protocols and
processes CRHP had used to build capacity of the community managed Village Health
Workers. Once the participants had an overall understanding of CMH&N programs
implemented by SERP and the CRHP Jamkhed’s support for a systematic capacity building of
the Health Activists, they could visualize the overall approach that the SERP adopted and
implemented. SERP facilitated a design and diagnostic workshop where participants from
Bihar were able to analyze Bihar’s health and nutrition situation vis-à-vis the public health
and nutrition service delivery system and analyzed the role of Jeevika as a whole.

Figure 5 presents a schematic view of various aspects covered in the three programs.




4 From the initial 30 villages in 1970, the project had expanded to a region of over 250,000 people
after the first 25 years. Infant mortality fell from over 176 per 1,000 births to 23 per 1,000 (and was
at its lowest down to 17 per 1,000 for some villages). Link:

         B) TECHNICAL DIAGNOSTICS OF VARIOUS HEALTH AND
            NUTRITION INTERVENTIONS OF JEEVIKA CHNCC
The initial technical consultation and field visits helped BRLPS (facilitated by SERP) to
diagnose of the existing Community Health and Nutrition Care Centers CHNCCs and create
strategies for strengthening CHNCCs. The priority was to create architecture for community
managed health and nutrition interventions and supplement the architecture with an action
plan for improving implementation. The three key aspects included in the action plan were:

    1. Village Organization (VO) ownership in establishment and day-to-day management.
    2. Involvement of all the field staff facilitated the process for quick grounding of
       CHNCC activities.
    3. During the diagnostic phase a Strength Weakness Opportunity and Threat SWOT
       analysis was done (Fig 6).




                                                                                       20
SWOT methodology was based on immersions visits of BRLPS staff in SERP projects, field
visits of SERP staff in BRLPS health and nutrition projects. The visits were followed by
consultations and group discussions.




Figure 6: SWOT analysis of CHNCC in Bihar.



Based on SWOT analysis the following recommendations were made for Bihar:

    •   Ensure the VOs to develop as pressure groups rather than involving themselves
        only in implementation;
    •   Encourage the VOs to develop internal facilitators/CRPs rather than wait for
        external support;
    •   Continue hand holding and regular capacity building of VOs and their functionaries;
    •   Enhance technical knowledge and skills of facilitators at all levels;
    •   Have a Technical Advisor with Public Health and Nutrition expertise for the project;
    •   Track member-wide details, do community based monitoring and review outcomes;

    SWOT analysis suggested that NDCC interventions should be designed around
    sustainability. The major elements of sustainability identified were a revenue
    generation stream, reduced diet cost, convergence with other government programs
    and internal spearhead teams. The following figure summarizes the sustainability
    features of NDCC:
                                                                                         21
Figure 7: Income generation activities and NDCC.



A summary of recommendations from the diagnostic work was incorporated into the design
of H&N interventions under Jeevika. The main recommendations from the diagnostics that
are part of interventions are: Incorporating Standards of Practice such as life cycle
approach, balanced diet, CHNCC ambience, financial management and sustainability and
diet cost reduction measures. In addition other recommendations, --Community based
monitoring and review systems to measure the outcomes, CRPs development from existing
centers and scheduling growth monitoring were included in the design and project
implementation.
The final project design took an integrated and holistic approach. For example, health and
nutrition has been included in the agenda of self-help group meetings and functioning. Self-
help groups include health and nutrition in their household micro-plan. VOs often act as a
pressure group to improve the function of the Public Distribution System (PDS). In some
cases, VOs have been franchised dealerships of PDS. VOs are playing an important role on
the demand side by facilitating convergence of the project with ICDS, the Social Welfare
department and the Health department. An MOU has been signed with ICDS and the Social
Welfare department for users to give systematic feedback. A community report card is
being developed by VOs on health and nutrition services. Wherever possible the VOs are
encouraged to take up the PDS dealership themselves.


Following the diagnostics a framework was developed for health, nutrition and sanitation.



                                                                                         22
         C) FRAMEWORKS FOR DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION OF
            HEALTH, NUTRITION, FOOD SECURITY AND SANITATION
            PROGRAMS

The various diagnostics and design exercises and workshops lead to development of
various frameworks that have been used in Bihar and are available to other states
implementing rural livelihood programs. Some of the key frameworks are described below:

     1. FOOD AND NUTRITION SECURITY FRAMEWORK

This framework envisages the institutional platform of women self-help groups and
empowerment as the key vehicle for food and nutrition security. The four key pillars of this
holistic framework are nutrition sensitive agriculture interventions, an enterprise
approach to ensure availability of nutritious food in local stores, improving health, nutrition
and sanitation seeking behaviors and practices, especially in the 1000 day cycle, and
community managed initiatives to access safety nets and entitlements. The framework also
suggests multiple pathways for attaining food and nutritional security. Pathway choice
depends on situation and scale.




Figure 8: Multiple Pathways to Improve Food and Nutrition Security.



Nutrition sensitive agriculture incorporates three key dimensions: food security, access to
food and diet diversification. It envisages increased access to food through multiple
mechanisms. These include productivity enhancement, timely access to the Public
Distribution System, collective purchase of food grains through a dedicated Food Security
Fund, and village grain banks. Diet diversification is envisaged through increased access to

                                                                                            23
pulses and vegetables through System of Crop Intensification (SCI) and development of the
dairy and poultry sectors.
     2. HEALTH, NUTRITION AND SANITATION (HNS) INTERVENTION FRAMEWORK

The HNS Framework envisages that the project considers key health outcome indicators of
poor households as part of Health, Nutrition and Sanitation framework of livelihood project
rather than IMR/MMR/TFR. The project envisages a comprehensive health, nutrition and
sanitation intervention that encompasses a balance between preventive and curative
approaches for achieving better health outcomes. The major focus however should be to
promote behavior change with correct information and knowledge dissemination as well as
improved communication skillsets of front line service providers. The correct health
information at household level and SHG level will lead to dialogue, decision and action at the
individual and collective level. Building blocks of interventions and key ingredients of
community managed health and nutrition intervention in each block are shown (Fig. 9).




Figure 9: Health, Nutrition, and Sanitation Framework-key areas of intervention.



The HNS framework suggested the following key outcome indicators for monitoring the
project:

Categories               Indicators
Health                   Reduction in the health expenditures.
                         Institutional or safe delivery in hospitals.
                         Reduction in anemia among pregnant and
                         lactating mothers.
                         Reduction in the diarrhea cases.
Nutrition                Increase consumption of nutritional food in
                         terms of food quantity and frequency.
                         Reduction in anemia among pregnant and
                         lactating mothers.
                         Normal weight of newborn baby.
                         Improved child growth as per WHO
                                                                                           24
                         standard through IYCF practices.
                         Reduction in trend of Moderate & Acute
                         Malnutrition (MAM) and Severely Acute
                         Malnutrition (SAM) cases in children under
                         of 3 years of age.
Sanitation               Cleanliness of houses.
                         ODF Households and village.
                         Reduction in the diarrhea cases.


     3. VALUE CHAIN APPROACH TO DESIGN OF INTERVENTIONS FOR HEALTH
        SERVICES AND OUTCOMES

This framework looks at three key aspects of delivery of health services in a value chain
perspective and looks at intervention design with three elements. These are preventive and
promoted health care, curative care, financing and service delivery. The framework is
illustrated below (Fig. 10).
In the agriculture program a set of indicators have been included, they are related to diet
diversification and access to food. The Jeevika Health and Nutrition approach incorporates
food security, access and diversification of diet through agriculture. It includes increased
access to food through productivity enhancements, timely access to the Public Distribution
System, collective purchase of food grains through a dedicated Food Security Fund and
grain banks. It includes diet diversification through increased access to pulses and
vegetables through System of Crop Intensification (SCI) and also development of dairy and
poultry sectors.

        D) TRAINING MATERIAL AND MANUALS

To improve the performance of NDCC functionaries and volunteers, training materials were
created in the local language. These training materials are visual and easy to read and
understand. They cover topics such as pre-natal and post-natal care, mother and child
health care and nutrition for pregnant women, lactating mothers and children under age of
5. The material also covers sanitation issues at the household and community level. These
materials have been developed by BRLPS and are being used in CHNCC Bihar. They have
been contextualized and translated into local languages. A number of videos in local
languages have been produced and disseminated at the community level.



        E) TA FOR ICT APPLICATION IN COMMUNITY MANAGED
           HEALTH AND NUTRITION ACTIVITIES

In Andhra Pradesh, a community managed tracking system to assess progress and
outcomes known as mNDCC has been developed using mobiles phones and ICTs . The
mNDCC captures and track attendance, health outcomes, and sustainability at the village-
level nutrition NDCC using mobile phones has been developed. The outcome indicators
tracked by community level functionaries and field staff include immunization, ANC and
PNC coverage, nutrition status of children and pregnant mothers and other data for NDCC.
An overview of the architecture of the mNDCC is provided (Fig 11).
Bluefrog (a software company) originally developed the mNDCC application in the context
of Andhra Pradesh. The application won a mHealth Alliance Award sponsored by the
United Nations Foundation. Under the project, Bluefrog supported Jeevika to develop and
adapt the software application to be used in Bihar using the local language through field
trials and local calibration.




                                                                                      26
Figure 11: Mobile application menu of mNDCC.




         F) TA FOR ICT APPLICATION IN BACKYARD POULTRY

In Bihar over 50 % of landless and marginal farmers depend on poultry and rearing small
ruminants for their livelihoods. The poultry sector provides direct employment to over two
million people and poultry supplements household-level nutrition by providing good
quality protein through eggs and meat. The Backyard Poultry supported by Jeevika has
carried out a successful intervention with 28000 households. The intervention has been
inclusive as 76% of the households belong to the poorest and most marginalized Scheduled
Caste (SC) community. Independent studies show that the intervention has resulted in an
additional net income of US $$350-650 per household per year. Localizing the poultry
sector with an emphasis on developing tightened backward and forward linkages and
embedding ICT based monitoring and support, is a challenge Jeevika has been trying to
address.

The SAFANSI TA was used to study and diagnose the problem associated with backyard
poultry and improve ongoing backyard poultry activity. The study looked at the entire value
chain of the backyard poultry and provided recommendations on relevant such as, with the
help of ICT applications. This could include the provision of real-time application
information on income and produce and using it among other parameters that will be
available to the team in real time for targeting and customized interventions. The GIS
application can be used with the best practices to search for villages with similar
ecosystems. This process will help rapid scaling of the program. Furthermore this study
provided how ICT can be used with backyard poultry. These recommendations are under
discussion and being used to develop an assessment if ICT application is feasible in
backyard poultry.

        G) HEALTH AND NUTRITION EVALUATION FRAMEWORK

With the support of SAFANSI TA an Evaluation Framework of the impact of Livelihoods
Project has been developed to assess the degree to which the project's interventions
improve income, human development indicators -- particularly Health, Nutrition and
Sanitation -- and access to social safety nets and services. The proposed evaluation would
follow a quasi-experimental approach, constructing a control group of villages from similar
non-project sub-districts, where interventions would not be implemented.
   The evaluation will answer key Health, Nutrition and Sanitation questions, such as:
        Are households in program villages better able to access health services when needed?

       Do households in program villages have more individual latrines and follow better
       hygiene practices?

       Do households in program villages have access to more nutritious food and do they
       achieve better nutritional outcomes?

   The aim of the Evaluation Framework is to provide a clear direction to the project
   implementation to achieve higher order Health, Nutrition, and Sanitation indicators.




IV) TA FOR INTEGRATING HEALTH NUTRITION AND
  SANITATION

In response to discussions in India over the last year on stronger sanitation-nutrition
linkages and the need to work concurrently on sanitation issues at the community level, the
SAFANSI project hosted a number of learning events and workshops at the state and
national levels to stimulate interest in working on integrated approaches to preventive
aspects of health and nutrition. These events focused on behavioral change among
households, women, men and children to understand the linkages between sanitation,
malnutrition and stunting. These events also targeted senior decision makers from both
federal and state Government and senior functionaries of state level rural livelihood
projects as well as water and sanitation programs. Participants included best practitioners,
reputed NGOs, the private sector, social entrepreneurs from various states of India and
other countries with similar experiences. This program was organized in close
collaboration with WSP program Sanitation Team at the World Bank. This program has led
to the development of significant sanitation and nutrition components in World Bank
supported rural livelihood programs in Bihar, Maharashtra, Andhra Pradesh, Telangana and
Tamil Nadu.



                                                                                          28
The first major activity was facilitating scoping visits and two state level workshops by Prof.
Robert Chambers of IDS Sussex.5 He facilitated two major learning workshops, one in Patna
and the other in Hyderabad on ”Participatory Approaches to promote ODF - Rural Spaces”.6
These workshops were attended by many senior government secretaries, directors, CEOs
and functionaries of World Bank supported programs along with field practitioners,
including the community members. Data highlighted the magnitude of the problem and
links between sanitation and malnutrition in context of India and Bihar. Fifty three % of the
households in India practice open defecation. Forty eight % of the children below 5 years
are stunted and 32.6 % of the children are malnourished. There is high correlation between
open defecation, stunting and malnutrition. Globally, 60 % of the households practicing
open defecation are in India. Bihar has the second highest number of malnourished children
per square km after UP in India. Annually, 212,000 children die from diarrhea in India.

5 Prof. Chambers is an international expert, practitioner and trainer on participatory approaches
including Community Lead Approaches to sanitation (CLTS). He has also extensively researched and
written on the relationship between sanitation, stunting and malnutrition in India and advises many
programs working on this agenda.

given State for both urban and rural) and stunting.

Similar data was presented on AP and Telangana. This laid the context and raised
awareness among senior decision makers and staff members about the magnitude, nature
and urgency of the challenge.

The second part of the discussion focused on how the institutional platform of SHGs and
federations should work to implement community managed sanitation and nutrition
programs and what should be the content, focus and process of such programs. The key
issues and recommendations included the use of self-help groups and federations as
triggers, change agents and catalysts for community lead sanitation. Most participants
agreed that SHGs should enable the change of focus of sanitation program from
“construction of toilets” to “use of toilets”, which involves behavioral change. The data also
shows that in spite of significant increase in resources for toilet construction since, the use
of toilets has not expanded significantly.




                                                                                                    30
Figure 14: Reported and surveyed rural sanitation coverage vs funds released.

Other recommendations included decentralized social mobilization for CLTS for behavioral
change, community management of the toilet construction accompanied by availability of
material through rural sanitary marts, flexible financing arrangements, assured supply
chain fund flow managed through micro plans made by VOs, community and ICT based
monitoring and maintenance of toilets and institutionalized institutional collaboration
between government, CSOs and community organizations.

The National Workshop on community-led and entrepreneurial approaches to provisioning
sanitation and nutrition services focused on innovative and entrepreneurial approaches
used in India and other countries, including Rajasthan in India and BRAC in Bangladesh,
Ethiopia and Indonesia. The results from BRAC work on sanitation demonstrated that 80 %
of the users continue to use the toilets.




                                                                                     31
Table 1: Use of sanitation facilities in BRAC’s projects.




The International Consultancy Monitor Group has examined the possibility of creating an
entrepreneurial ecosystem to provide for provision of sanitation services in Bihar also
presented a possible approach and framework illustrated below (Figs. 16-18). These
examples have stimulated interest among the rural livelihood projects in the five states to
look at entrepreneurial approaches to delivering sanitation services through self-help
groups, village organizations and federations. This learning caused senior decision makers
and project staff to visit Rajasthan and BRAC in Bangladesh to see the work firsthand and
interact with local counterparts. This has resulted in the design of sanitation and nutrition
components in rural livelihood programs.

V) KNOWLEDGE PRODUCTS
         A) A STOCKTAKING OF MAJOR INITIATIVES AND PROJECTS

Stocktaking exercises are key community-based initiatives in India related to Health, Nutrition and
Sanitation services. These included 29 initiatives representing a large cross section. The key filters
used for developing the typology included maternal and newborn care services; programs helping
poor households to manage food shocks; programs on monitoring, evaluation, accountability and
advocacy as well as programs delivering integrated food, nutrition and WASH services. Typology
and project profiles were developed to enable learning of lessons, particularly for Bihar and other
low income states.

         B) ANALYTICAL COMPARISON OF LARGE SCALE HEALTH AND
            NUTRITION PROGRAMS

Various knowledge and learning products were produced to design the next generation of AP and
Telangana programs in India. Secondary data from large scale programs delivering health and
nutrition services in India were analyzed and studied along with an international comparator from
Mexico. The paperiv looked at four public health programs that work primarily with rural
households to offer similar service packages comprised of maternal and child health care, nutrition
and health education, immunization, hospital check- ups and referrals to secondary or tertiary care
facilities. These programs are:

1. ICDS -- Integrated Child Development Scheme -- Government of India.
2. CRHP Jamkhed -- Comprehensive Rural Health Project, Jamkhed, Maharashtra, India.
3. CMHN SERP -- Community Managed Health and Nutrition, Society for Elimination of Rural
Poverty, Andhra Pradesh, India.
4. Progresa (Oportunidades) -- Federal program of the Mexican Government.

The paper used investment per person and the resulting change in health outcomes to compare
project performance. These performance ratios offer a way to measure the cost effectiveness of
these public health programs and provide insights into why some programs fare better or worse
than others. This paper looks at four projects with similar objectives and compares their
performance over nine indicators. It also compares methods of service delivery and incentive --
benefits transfer through supplementary nutrition (ICDS); complete nutrition (CMHN); cash
(Progresa) or intensive investment in community capacity development (CRHP).

Descriptive features of programs:

Table 1 gives a snapshot of the scale, time period and major activities of ICDS, CRHP, CMHN and
Progresa. Table 2 provides their performance rates with respect to key health and nutrition
indicators. While the first three are from India, Progresa is a conditional cash transfer program of
the Mexican Government. CRHP Jamkhed is the longest running of the four and CMHN is the most
recent. All four projects cover PLM (Pregnant and Lactating Mothers) and children up to 6 years.
CRHP and Progresa also cover other members of the household. ICDS and CMHN are more targeted
towards PLM and children and offer a range of maternal and child services comprised of direct
transfer of nutrition, immunization, pre- and post-natal check-ups and health education sessions
focused on care during and after pregnancy. ICDS is one of the largest child centric nutrition
programs in the world, with centers across India. It has different variants in several states, with the
Tamil Nadu model showing the most promising results. This variant has thus been included to show
health outcomes in an ideal ICDS implementation model.

Progresa transfers benefits in the form of cash transfers to the female head of the family are
conditional upon compliance with requirements such as compulsory enrollment of children in
school, regular pre- and post-natal check-ups of PLMs and annual check-ups of all family members.
The CMHN program provides three balanced meals a day for PLMs and supplementary nutrition
(milk, eggs and fruits) for children. ICDS provides packaged or cooked food as supplementary
nutrition to PLM and children. CRHP Jamkhed focuses on village health worker capacity building
and dissemination of health awareness about preventable diseases and hygiene practices.
CMHN and CRHP require a one-time investment in a village with a five year period to stabilize the
projects. Thereafter, the projects are self-sustaining and managed by community members. ICDS


                                                                                                    36
and Progresa require recurring investments with the disbursement of biweekly or monthly benefits
to beneficiaries. The amount of investments for each program is given in Table 1.

Methodology and data sources:

1. Data for indicators in Tables 2, 3 and 4 was collected through a review of secondary literature on
the four programs. For studies in India, data was also cross-checked with NFHS data before being
included in this report.


                                                                                                             37
2. The calculation of annual investment per beneficiary was done on an annual basis for ICDS and
Progresa. For CMHN and CRHP, the initial investments of US $5,818 and US $45,000 were spread
over a 5 year period per beneficiary.

3. Limitations: All efforts were made to include only studies of good econometric rigor in this paper.
However, several ICDS studies have been included that did not use matching controls or propensity
score matching. RCT studies were available only for CRHP and Progresa. Due to the absence of
recent studies or national surveys in 2012, most of the reported 2012 figures are projections based
on available data. Quality was not evaluated in determining access or use levels of services. The
indicators chosen for evaluation are highly dependent on the functioning of the National Rural
Health Mission (NRHM) in India. NRHM performance has not been included in this study and its
effect has been assumed to be uniform across all projects in India.

Indicators:
The objectives common to all programs discussed above were chosen as indicators to compare
performance. Values per program are listed in Table 3.
1. Infant Mortality Rate (IMR): The Infant Mortality Rate is defined as the number of children
dying before their 1st birthday per 1,000 live births. CMHN shows the lowest IMR (10) among the
four programs while CRHP has the highest absolute reduction (156). The rate IMR decline is the
highest in CMHN (7.8). While this rate looks lower for Progresa with regard to other programs, it is
noted that IMR in Mexico is extremely low (13) and thus, reductions occur more slowly than in
India where the IMR is much higher (54.3).
2. Maternal Mortality Ratio: The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is the ratio of the number of
maternal deaths during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same time period. It
is noteworthy that it took CRHP Jamkhed 40 years to reduce the MMR to 8, while the MMR was
reduced to <1 by CMHN in 5 years. However, the absolute difference in MMR is larger for CRHP,
from 532 in 1970 to 8 in 2010, compared to all other programs. ICDS has had a substantially
smaller absolute reduction in MMR, but it is decreasing at a promising rate of 15.6 per year.
3. Low Birth Weight (LBW) babies: Studies show that babies born with a birth weight < 2.5 kg are
much more likely to have arrested physical and mental development as well as higher likelihoods of
staying malnourished and developing weak immune systems. The number or % of low birth weight
babies is thus an important measure of the efficiency of health and nutrition programs. Progresa
has the best outcome in this aspect, with only 5% babies being < 2.5 kg, followed by CMHN at 5.4%.
This data was not available for CRHP Jamkhed. The ICDS figures stand the poorest, at 29%. The
annual rate of decline in LBW babies is the lowest for ICDS at 0.87% per year and highest for CMHN
at 5% per year.
4. Mean birth weight: The current mean birth weight of Indian babies in 2.7 Kg. The same for
Progresa beneficiaries in Mexico is 3.4 kg. CMHN babies have the highest mean birth weight (3.1 kg)
among Indian programs in this comparison followed by CRHP (2.9kg). It is interesting to see that
Progresa is able to maintain a 25gm/year gain in birth-weight even after a substantially higher
baseline compared to Indian programs. CMHN has the fastest growth rate at 80gm/year followed
by CRHP at 13.33gm/year.
5. Immunization: Complete immunization for children up to 1 year old is a key determinant of
child mortality and morbidity. CRHP and CMHN achieved 100% immunization followed by ICDS at
90%. Assuming constant rate of growth at 3.57% per year, ICDS can achieve 100% immunization by
2016.

                                                                                                   38
6. Stunting: Among all measures of chronic malnutrition, stunting is considered the most accurate.
Stunting is defined as having a lower height for a particular age than normal. This comparison is
obtained from country specific growth charts issued by WHO. Children who fall below the 2nd or
3rd standard deviation of height for their age are considered chronically malnourished. CRHP
Jamkhed tops the performance in this indicator with <1% stunted children, followed by Progresa at
8%. The rate of stunting is declining fastest for Progresa at 5% per year. ICDS fares the poorest and
CMHN data is not available.
7. Access to public services: This primarily includes the % of households that accessed public
health services for pre- or post-natal care. CRHP and CMHN achieved 100% access and use of public
services, followed by Progresa at 90%. The rate of increase in use was highest for Progresa at 8.4%
per year followed by CMHN at 7.9% per year.
8. Anemia in women ages 18-45: Iron deficient anemia (IDA) is one of the most widespread
reasons for morbidity in women and complications in pregnancy and labor. Maternal IDA is
associated with adverse health outcomes, including low infant birth weight, inferior newborn
health and maternal mortality. An analysis of several studies showed there was a higher incidence
of iron deficiency among infants born to mothers with IDA during pregnancy, compared to infants
born to mothers with adequate iron status. Iron deficiency at birth has also been associated with
postpartum depression and developmental delays in children. At present, 51.8% of women
between the ages of 18-45 in India suffer from IDA. The number for ICDs is higher at 54%. CRHP
has the lowest IDA % among Indian programs, at 37.3%. Progresa has the lowest % of women with
IDA (20%) across all four programs. IDA data is not available for CMHN.
9. Safe Deliveries: A leading cause for high MMR is the delivery of babies in unsafe conditions
without the supervision of a trained birth assistant. Safe deliveries, either at a hospital or at home
in the presence of a nurse or mid-wife, are an important indicator of success for public health
programs, especially in India. At present, 54% deliveries in India are safe, with CRHP having the
best performance at 100% safe deliveries followed by CMHN at 88.6%. CRHP has also seen the
fastest rate of increase in safe deliveries per year (3% per year). The growth rate of safe deliveries
per year for CMHN is 1.46% per year and 0.6% per year for ICDS.

Key findings

1. IMR and MMR reductions are eventual outcomes of increased birth weight, reduced anemia,
access to services and safe deliveries. It is noteworthy that even though Progresa has better
performance with regard to mean birth weight, safe deliveries, anemia and utilization of public
services, CMHN performs better with regard to IMR and MMR. This can probably be attributed to
providing three balanced, nutritious meals every-day, along with personalized training and follow-
ups by the village health activist.

Studies show that among the entire population of children receiving supplementary nutrition,
children of relatively wealthier families have much higher improvements in weight and morbidity
outcomes than poorer households. For such children, it is possible that supplementary nutrition is
enough to ensure nutrition security. The poorest quartile however, in ICDS, CMHN and Progresa,
require higher amounts of assistance and supplementary nutrition is not enough to bridge their
daily nutrition gap.
3. Progresa has demonstrated that it is possible to reduce chronic malnutrition in a relatively short
period of time. The inadequacy of ICDS is further pronounced with the highest absolute % of
stunted children as well as the slowest rate of decrease in stunting per year. This is probably due to
the combined reasons of poor targeting and inadequate supplementary nutrition.
4. It is clear from Table 3 that CMHN should make concerted efforts to monitor anemia in women
and anthropometric measures in children. In the absence of this, it will be difficult to make
conclusive judgments about long-lasting health benefits due to the program. It is possible that
Progresa has maintained a mean birth weight of 3.4 kg and an annual increase of 25 gm per baby
because of lower levels of anemia in women.
5. CMHN should follow the CRHP model in safe deliveries. CRHP trains all village health workers to
conduct safe deliveries, which is reflected in their achievement of 100% safe deliveries. CMHN can
consider training its village Health Activists in similar skills for increasing its % of safe deliveries.

6. The analysis above indicates that CMHN and CRHP are much more cost effective compared to
ICDS and Progresa. Both of these programs rely on a very important aspect of social mobilization
and cannot operate in isolation. CRHP has created a strong support system of water and sanitation,
adolescent girl groups, entrepreneurial activities such as manufacturing of the Jaipur foot and
agriculture assistance to farmers. Similarly, CMHN is built on a strong foundation of women’s self -
help groups in convergence with social security schemes, sustainable agriculture and livelihood
services. Creating a nurturing ecosystem is therefore very important in achieving cost effective
outcomes. In the absence of such an ecosystem of support mechanisms, investment-heavy program
like ICDS are inadequate to meet desired outcomes.
7. The annual cost per person in reducing IMR by 1 may be compared between ICDS and CMHN.
ICDS is 5 times more expensive than CMHN and about 3 times more expensive than CMHN with
respect to annual cost per person for reducing MMR by 1.
8. CMHN relies heavily on accessing publicly available services. CRHP on the other hand has its own
mobile health team and tertiary care hospital. Beneficiaries of CRHP thus have a self-sufficient
system. It is possible that this is the reason it has marginally higher costs than CMHN in key
                                                                                                      40
outcomes. The question then becomes, should CMHN also invest in its own tertiary care systems or
should it wait for strengthening the service delivery capabilities of the government systems? In the
case of Progresa, public service systems were strengthened from the start of the program. It is not
easy to replicate that in India given the contextual differences, but It is unknown which strategies
should be pursued over the short and long term?

Key findings:

1. The analysis above indicates that CMHN and CRHP are much more cost effective than ICDS and
Progresa. Both programs rely on a very important aspect of social mobilization and cannot operate
in isolation. CRHP has created a strong support system of water and sanitation, adolescent girl
groups, entrepreneurial activities such as manufacturing of the Jaipur foot, and agriculture
assistance to farmers. Similarly, CMHN is built on a strong foundation of women’s self-help groups
in convergence with social security schemes, sustainable agriculture and livelihoods services.
Creating a nurturing ecosystem is therefore very important in achieving cost effective outcomes. In
the absence of such an ecosystem of support mechanisms, investment-heavy program like ICDS are
inadequate for meeting desired outcomes.



                                                                                                 41
2. It is interesting to compare the annual cost per person in reducing IMR by 1 between ICDS and
CMHN. ICDS comes out to be 5 times more expensive than CMHN. It is also about 3 times more
expensive than CMHN with respect to annual cost per person for reducing MMR by 1.
3. CMHN relies heavily on accessing publicly available services. CRHP on the other hand has its own
mobile health team and tertiary care hospital. Beneficiaries of CRHP thus have a self-sufficient
system. It is possible that this is the reason it has marginally higher costs than CMHN in key
outcomes. The question this observation begs is, should CMHN also invest in its own tertiary care
systems or should it wait for the government to strengthen service delivery capabilities systems?

 In the case of Progressa, the strengthening of public service systems was pursued aggressively
right from the start of the program. It is certainly not easy to replicate that in India, given the
contextual differences, but it is unknown what strategy should be pursued over the short and long
run.



        C) A MICRO-STUDY OF POOREST OF THE POOR HOUSEHOLDS, THEIR
           NUTRITIONAL STATUS AND FACTORS THAT AFFECT NUTRITION-
           SEEKING BEHAVIORv

The second study looked at the characteristics of health and nutrition security at the
household level. The sample size was 95 households with positive deviant households
identified and reasons for positive deviance ascertained. The study highlighted the factors
that lead to enhanced nutrition in Poorest of Poor (POP) households. This was collected at
the level of day care center and primary health center. Based on the data, strategies were
recommended to induce nutrition-seeking behavior change in these households. The data
collected showed a high correlation between the weight for age characteristics of children
and the extent of non-anemic women (women with hemoglobin levels >= 10 mg/dl) and
access to backyard gardens (vegetable consumption), dairy animals (milk consumption)
and poultry assets (egg and meat consumption). The study showed that supplemental
nutrition should be preceded by programs enabling access to productivity enhancement
assets and practices. The key findings of the study and the quantitative distribution of
households is indicated in the following analytics:

    Finding 1: Children who had a backyard kitchen garden at home were more likely to be
    healthy compared to those who did not.




                                                                                                42
Finding 2: Women with backyard kitchen gardens were more likely to be healthy (non-
anemic) compared to women without back yard gardens.




Finding 3: Women of households with either dairy or poultry animals were more likely to
be healthy compared to those without.




Finding 4: Children who were fed weaning powder from 6 months of age were more likely
to be healthy compared to those who were not.


                                                                                    43
Finding 5: Children of households with either dairy or poultry animals were more likely to
be healthy compared to those without.




Finding 6: Children of POP women who attended NDCC regularly during pregnancy were
more likely to be healthy compared to others.




Finding 7: POP women who attended NDCC regularly during pregnancy were more likely
to be healthy compared to others.

                                                                                       44
     Among the factors producing a major difference in the nutrition status of POP women, NDCC
     enrollment has the highest magnitude (67%), followed by dairy and poultry (49%) and
     backyard kitchen garden (46%). Table 5 presents this in decreasing order of magnitude:


Table 5: Factors affecting maternal nutrition




     Similarly, child nutrition is affected by a combination of household backyard gardens and
     vegetable consumption, weaning food, consumption of dairy and poultry, and care provided by
     NDCC (Table 5).

Table 6: Factors affecting child nutrition




        Based on the study a strategy to build nutritional services ecosystem in a village was
     suggested based on household stratification by food production, affordability and access.
     These included self-sufficient producer households, insufficient producer households, non-

                                                                                             45
     producer households including the landless who can afford regular purchase and non-
     producer households who cannot afford regular purchase (Fig. 19). The key elements of the
     service delivery ecosystem include production support, distribution support and distribution
     support through subsidies or entitlements.




Figure 19: Strategies for building a nutrition ecosystem.



The study also suggested an organization strategy of service delivery and behavioral
communication to implement a program to build this ecosystem. The strategy includes blocks as
shown in figure 20. Details of the strategy are as follows:

Nutrition Transformation Teams: There is a need for Nutrition Transformation Teams to
examine possible ways to ensure nutrition safety in a holistic manner. These teams should consist
of people from across the agriculture, dairy, health, social protection, water and sanitation sectors.
They should develop customized solutions for POP households by linking Farmer field schools,
Krushe Marts, Rural Water Supply and behavior change communication together. Each Nutrition
Transformation Team should develop a guidance that forms backward and forward linkages to
ensure local availability of nutritious food for household production.

Consumption Counseling: Households with efficient production and distribution mechanisms will
not be able to improve their nutrition unless they understand the reasoning behind nutritious
consumption. There is a need for special communication methods (Digital Green videos, TV, radio,
print media and personal counseling) that explains why nutrition is important and how it affects a
person’s progress in life. This must be combined with knowledge transfer of diet composition and
                                                                                                   46
demonstration of cooking methods. So far, we have focused on explaining how to improve nutrition,
but in order to affect behavior change; all members of a household must now learn why nutrition
should be a priority and how available resources can be leveraged to achieve desired outcomes.

WASH: Behavior change communication has to be accompanied with access to clean water supply
for daily consumption, construction of toilets, effective messaging for toilet use and adoption of
sanitary practices. This will have to be done in convergence with NREGS and Swach Bharat Mission
(SBM). SBM has a provision where households are offered NREGS wages for constructing a toilet in
their homes with a small contribution from the household. Schemes like these will have to be
leveraged to implement WASH in all POP families.

VI) FOOD PRODUCTION, PRODUCTIVITY, AVAILABILITY
  AND AFFORDABILITY
The Jeevika Health and Nutrition approach incorporates food security, access and diet
diversification through agriculture and related interventions. It includes increased access to food
through productivity enhancement, timely access to the public distribution system, collective
purchase of food grains through a dedicated Food Security Fund and grain banks. It also includes

                                                                                                 47
diet diversification through increased access to pulses and vegetables through System of Crop
Intensification (SCI) and development of dairy and poultry sectors.



           A) AGRICULTURAL LIVELIHOODS THROUGH SYSTEM OF CROP
              INTENSIFICATION FOR SMALL AND MARGINAL FARMERSvi

Through the community institutional platform, Jeevika has been implementing System of Crop
Intensification (SCI). SCI enables small and marginal famers to undertake intensive farming and
significantly increase productivity over a range of crops from small parcels of land.
SCI has been implemented by Jeevika and the learning note was prepared with the support of
SAFANSI TA.


The System of Crop Intensification (SCI) evolved from a well-known farming method called System
of Rice Intensification. It has been customized and adapted for wheat, green gram, oil seeds and
vegetables in Bihar by a community managed extension and technology transfer model though
farmer field schools. Crop intensification has helped in diversifying options for production and
consumption, particularly for poorer households. Diversification has improved balanced nutrition
uptake through consumption of such as pulses and vegetables.

A panel survey was conducted in 2012 on a sample of about 6,242 farmers for rice interventions
(5,684 participants and 558 non-participants) and 2,699 for wheat intervention participants. Data
were analyzed and documented in the form of a learning note, prepared and disseminated using
resources from the SAFANSI project. Key results are illustrated and described below7:

                                                                                                                      48
Figure 21: Diversification of cultivation and consumption using SCI.

This approach, starting from rice, has been used for wheat, green gram, oil seeds and vegetables in
Bihar. Production diversification has enabled significant increase in yields for vegetables (20%),
pulses (56%), oil seeds (50%), wheat (72%) and rice (86%).




Figure 22: Crop-wise increase in yields after SCI.


The increase in productivity of various crops has improved food security in poor and vulnerable
households. According to a 2012 independent study, a significantly higher proportion of participant
households that faced food shortage in 2007 became food secure in 2010. These approaches were
documented, analyzed and disseminated in the form of a learning note under the SAFANSI project
and converted into an implementation framework.

Inspired by the success of Jeevika’s SCI intervention, the Bihar government has made a policy to
cover 10 % of paddy and wheat cultivable areas under SCI. According to current estimates, there
will be 8 million acres for paddy and 5.7 million acres for wheat. This will help thousands of
smallholder and marginal farmers across all districts in Bihar.vii


B) COMMUNITY MANAGED FOOD SECURITY PROGRAMS



                                                                                                49
Other initiatives which to ensure food security were documented throughout the project and are as
follows:


   Food Security Fund

   An exclusive Food Security Fund is earmarked to finance village organizations. Nearly 5,000
   Village Organizations have taken up this activity. The intervention involved identifying the
   requirements of all poor households who do not have access to sufficient food in bulk and
   are undertaking collective procurement to purchase food in the lean period. Households
   have the option to pay back the amount in installments or one lump sum when they sell
   their crop at harvesting season. The interest income earned by the village organization is
   used to meet the costs of running the scheme and reducing the price at household level in
   subsequent purchases. A study by the Social Observatory, with a sample of 1,530 households,
   found that the SHG members in the treatment villages were able to eat the quantity of food
   that they desired 0.2 days per week more than residents in control areas. SHG members in
   the treatment villages were able to eat the type of food that they desired 0.4 days per week
   more than residents in control areas


   Grain Bank
   The bank is run by poor women with minimal support funding from the project. During
   harvesting members deposit their grain into the bank and withdraw at the time of food
   scarcity (especially during flood and drought) with the commitment of repaying with 25%
   more in the next harvesting session. More than 200 Grain Banks are running in different
   districts of Bihar, such as Patna, Bhojpur Jamui, Saharsa and others. The concept is being
   replicated in other project areas.

   Enhancing access to the Public Distribution System (PDS)
   Ensuring access to PDS is another important strategy. This includes SHGs and VOs exercising
   their bargaining power to improve PDS functioning. To do so, village organizations are
   systematically building capacity and the necessary facilities to ensure they can engage with
   agencies implementing PDS to ensure regular and on time delivery.

   VOs taking over PDS management:
   In some locations the VOs have been given the responsibility of running the PDS dealership
   by the Civil Supplies Department. The necessary management training of the PDS is provided
   to the VOs.


        C) INNOVATIVE AGRICULTURE EXTENSION APPROACHES FOR SMALL
           AND MARGINAL FARMERS viiiAND DIGITAL LIBRARIES



                                                                                                  50
This initiative is supported through community managed extension approaches involving
organizations of farmer field schools and extension through participatory development of content
and videos through digital libraries for farmers. Community-driven programs traditionally used
local facilitators to disseminate information and external best-practices. The massive scale of these
programs however has made this strategy both times consuming and expensive. Livelihoods
Projects in Bihar and eight other states in India have prompted an innovative ICT-based Rural
Digital Libraries project in collaboration with Digital Green, a social enterprise in India. Digital
Green trains members of local communities on group facilitation, videography and basic video
production. These videographers create digital content locally, highlighting both internal and
external best practices. The videos are stored at the village level as well as uploaded to Youtube,
creating a local and online digital library disseminated widely through a network of village resource
people using low-cost pico-projectors. These libraries are a decentralized, localized solution that
combines the institutional platform with a digital knowledge platform to create multiple nodes of
communication and learning in rural communities across the country. Initial results have shown
that this approach can triple the adoption rate compared to traditional extension systems at one-
fifth the cost. In Bihar small and marginal farmers are participating at village-level video screenings,
rural digital libraries offer a promising solution for faster and more accessible livelihood knowledge
sharing and extension in geographically dispersed communities. Leveraging a video production and
screening platform, community organizations have started to develop a localized, scalable model
for agricultural extension, financial literacy, health and nutritional awareness and technology and
livelihood training.




Figure 23: Participatory Bottom-Up Knowledge Creation.

Jeevika and Digital Green partnership, with the help of local communities, produced videos that can
be viewed online and offline. The videos cover questions such as how to prepare nutritious food at
home using locally available ingredients at low cost. The food produced by this method is
recommended for pregnant women and lactating mothers. Videos of kitchen gardening, backyard
                                                                                                     51
vegetable gardening, household and community sanitation practices were also produced and
screened. Many households learned health and nutrition practices and how to sell their products to
CHNCCs.

This program was documented in the form of learning note and a blog through SAFANSI resources.

SAFANSI TA supported organizing the 2nd Bihar Innovation Forum. The forum offered an
important opportunity to enable the key social entrepreneurs working in the country to present
innovative solutions to the problems faced by poor households in Bihar across different sectors in
the areas of rural livelihoods, agriculture, livestock , food security, health and nutrition, ICT and
service delivery . The forum also included the sharing of knowledge, ideas and innovations among
social entrepreneurs, rural livelihood programs in the country and senior decision makers from
government, private sector foundations, civil society, incubation fund managers, financial agencies
and social enterprise community. The top innovators were selected by a jury and were enrolled in
a public private partnership program rendering them eligible for mentoring and financial support
to work with poor households in Bihar with Jeevika. After the forum a database was created of 79
innovators working in Food Security, Health and Nutrition area. This database is used for accessing
innovators and developing partnership when needed. A few examples of innovators who were
selected for further assistance are: SEWA BHARAT, Rite Water Solution, Rural Health Care
Foundation, Embrace India, Gram Vikas and Real Medicine Foundation. A small documentary was
also produced capturing the experience of the Bihar Innovation Forum.8 The documentary is
available      on      Youtube       and        can       be     viewed       with      the      link:

This section describes some of the key outcomes attributable to the SAFANSI supported program.
There are many other variables that have influenced the outcomes. Those outcomes attributable to
the SAFANSI program or that were triggered and catalyzed by the program are illustrated. Various
levels of analysis were carried out from household level to ecosystem level. The report did not look
at direct causality in a rigorous manner as it was beyond the scope of a small project, but instead
examined various data sources including quantitative, qualitative and descriptive data and
information. An overview of knowledge products and their linkages leading to overall improvement
of projects and policies as follows:

A) IMPACT ON HEATH AND NUTRITION STATUS

Ninety two Community Managed Health and Nutrition Care Centers (CHNCC) centers were
established by 2014. By Mid-2015, 3,882 pregnant women and 4254 lactating mothers were
enrolled in these centers and 1,986 children were born to mothers at these centers. Of these, 82%


                                                                                                 54
children were found to have birth weight higher than 2.5 kg and 76% of these deliveries
were institutional. 9

An independent impact assessment by the Bill and Melinda Gate Foundation comparedix the health
and nutrition outcomes for SHG members that carried out health-related mobilization with a
control group that did not do so. The sample was comprised of female members and group leaders
of SHGs groups overseen by Jeevika, recruited from the eight districts in Bihar, namely Patna,
Saharsa, East Champaran, West Champaran, Samastipur, Begusarai, Gopalganj and Khagaria. Survey
participants were comprised of women belonging to SHGs (n=2,407) and SHG leaders (n=747).
Information on norms related to family health and sanitation behaviors among backward castes
and other castes was collected from key informants including panchayat members, political leaders,
community social workers, frontline health workers, SHG mobilizers, doctors, nurses, NGO staff,
and SHG mobilizers (n=295).


Female members of self-help groups were asked about their knowledge, practice, and social norms
for Maternal, Newborn, Child Health and Sanitation (MNCHS) behaviors, comprising:

a. MNCHS behaviors, specifically ANC; pregnancy complications; birth preparedness; safe and
institutional delivery; PNC, STSC, and clean cord care; newborn care; early and exclusive
breastfeeding; age appropriate complementary feeding; FP, and compliance with recommended
immunization schedule.

b. Water and sanitation behaviors, specifically hand washing with soap and water; safe storage and
handling of potable water; toilet access and usage and safe waste disposal.

c. Collectivization characteristics, specifically leadership; enabling environment; collective efficacy;
collective agency and collective action.

d. Individual psychosocial beliefs, specifically self-efficacy; self-confidence and individual agency
and control.

The performance variables measured for the study included the % of institutional deliveries, extent
of breastfeeding within 1 hour of birth and immunization rate. These results are summarized in
Figure 25. The study results indicate that SHGs with health-related mobilizations and activities are
performing better in terms of reproductive and child health care. The difference is most
pronounced in case of the breastfeeding practices for mothers who are members of SHGs.

The Food Security Fund is a revolving fund managed by the village organization (VO). The VO is
given an initial grant of USD 1,700 to start a food security fund (FSF) and members are given the
chance to take an in-kind loan of food grains that they pay back over next three months at 0%
interest, plus a small service charge. After members have repaid, the cycle starts anew. A study was
conducted in 2014 with a sample of 18 clusters of 6 blocks assigned to have their VOs either start
the FSF program (treatment) or not start (control)10. A baseline survey of 1,530 households in 5
VOs per cluster was done in mid-2012, the midline survey covering the baseline HH’s was done in
Feb-Mar 2013, end line survey covering the same households completed in the end of 2013. One
measure of nutritional health is called the z-score of weight for age, which measures how much a
child of a given age and gender weighs relative to how much that child should weigh (according to
World Health Organization standards). This measure increases by 0.2 standard deviations in
children age 0.5-5 years. The above improvement is equivalent of a five year old girl being
17.70 Kg in the control or 18.22 Kg in the treatment, a gain of 0.52 Kg (Fig. 26).




10   This study was conducted by the Social Observatory Team in Bihar.



                                                                                                 56

B) IMPROVED HOUSEHOLD AND COMMUNITY SANITATION IN BIHAR

BRLPS initially implemented Swach Bharat Abhiyan (SBA) programs in three districts (Gaya, Purnia
and Nalanda) through collaboration with PHED Dept. of Bihar. BRLPS supported construction of
3,800 toilets through Village Organizations in 10 blocks. Each block received USD 15,000 per nodal
Village Organization as CIF funds as a revolving sanitation fund. An intensive approach was
implemented where villages had been identified by the “Swachhata Mitra” (Case Managers) and
Community Resource Persons (CRPs) after a health and sanitation survey. This program focused on
highly needy villages. UNICEF provided technical assistance for launching the sanitation campaign.
The key aspects of community management and implementation included mobilization by SHG
members, procurement of materials by the Procurement Committee of Village Organizations;
training and skill development of female masons for toilet construction, development of toilet
monitoring by Village Organization Office bearers and final reimbursement of incentives for toilet
construction as per PHED norms and guidelines. A significant change has been seen in many
villages where women are aware of the need for sanitation services and are involved in mobilizing
through songs and storytelling. There is increased demand for toilets in villages, but the focus is on
the use of toilets.


 SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUTREACH OF HEALTH, NUTRITION AND SANITATION ACTIVITIES
IN BIHAR


SAFANSI TA has helped increase outreach of various activities undertaken by Jeevika in partnership
with various governmental and non-governmental programs.

     C) BRLPS FACILITATED MULTI-STAKEHOLDER PARTNERSHIP WITH
        FOUNDATIONS AND TRUSTS

                                                                                                   58
In Bihar leveraging community platforms such as self-help groups (SHGs) and their federations has
been identified by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation as one of the key strategies to achieve its
goals. Over the last three years, the Foundation has leveraged SHGs and built partnerships with
National Rural Livelihoods Mission (NRLM) and state Missions viz., Jeevika/BRLPS in Bihar and
Prerana/UP SRLM in UP where the World Bank team has played a catalytic role.

The primary objective of the proposed investment with the World Bank is to leverage the existing
investments made and partnerships built by the Bank over the years in advance of integrating
various thematic interventions in SHGs and strengthening Foundation collaborations with NRLM
and state missions especially in Bihar and UP with Jeevika and Prerana. It is expected that this
investment will provide an enabling environment to support and complement the existing
investments made by the Foundation to leverage community platforms. This partnership will build
on existing efforts to integrate health, nutrition and family planning interventions in Bihar and UP,
as well as provide new opportunities to initiate layering of agriculture and sanitation interventions
in community platforms across Bihar, UP, Odisha and Jharkhand.

The proposed technical support from BMGF to the Bank would enable the creation of quality groups
in Bihar and UP through ongoing monitoring and handholding support by resident representatives
placed in each state. Advocacy efforts for state and national missions would integrate and scale up
health, nutrition, family planning, sanitation and agriculture interventions to ensure integration of
different thematic interventions in the larger context of livelihood promotion under NRLM. This
investment would also provide greater potential to experiment and scale up the BMGF work on
agriculture and sanitation with the state rural livelihood missions (SRLMs) funded by the Bank over
next two years viz., Bihar Rural Livelihoods Project, Odisha Rural Livelihoods Project and the
National Rural Livelihoods Project (with a focus on Uttar Pradesh and Jharkhand). The intended
outcome of this grant is to complement existing efforts of the Foundation to build capacity of the
SRLMs and support them in demonstrating proof of concept, evolving suitable protocols, guidelines
and systems for successful integration and scale up of specific thematic interventions.

Jeevika has also initiated community sensitization through Participatory Learning and Action (PLA)
methodology on health, nutrition and sanitation issues in 35 blocks in partnership with BTAST, and
a DFID funded initiative.

The Bihar innovation Forum has enabled many social entrepreneurs with innovative ideas and
solutions to work with Jeevika and community organizations.

The TATA 11administrative services have agreed to depute two of its officers in rural livelihood
projects to provide private sector thinking and skills to these programs in the area of nutrition.

The SAFANSI technical assistance program has created an enabling ecosystem and now Jeevika is
leveraging resources and partnering with key stakeholders in health, nutrition and sanitation
sector for investment in poor households in Bihar.

11TATA is the largest corporate house in India with a significant development wing called Tata Trust working
on health, nutrition and livelihoods.



                                                                                                         59
D) BRLPS AND WASH PARTNERSHIP
BRLPS has partnered with the WASH program supported by WSP. The key policy impact of BRLPS
and WASH partnership is that a MoU has been signed between PHED and BRLPS to smooth the flow
of funds to VOs and their clients under SBM and increase use of Jeevika and VOs as facilitators of
SBM. BRLPS is increasing investments to improve access to food security, health, nutrition and
sanitation services. The project envisions a comprehensive health, nutrition and sanitation
intervention that encompasses balance between preventive and curative approach for achieving
better health outcome. To ensure the economic gains made through livelihoods investments are not
drained off, the projects are increasing investing to improve access to food security, health and
sanitation services by the poorest households.

The financial leverages, approach, entry strategy, key interventions, scale and scope, enabling
environment of this partnership has been mapped (Fig. 28).

    d. Telangana has piloted innovative Behavior Change Communication (BCC) campaign using
       street plays, folk theater and Digital Green platforms


E) DEVELOPMENT OF INSTITUTIONAL ECOSYSTEM FOR HEATH, NUTRITION,
   LIVELIHOOD AND SANITATION SERVICES IN BIHAR

The SAFANSI TA has created an institutional ecosystem (Fig. 28) for integrating livelihoods, health,
food and nutrition services at the household level in a holistic manner.

As part of deepening livelihood interventions, the project has mobilized nearly 1,522 producer
organizations; 762 for agriculture, 500 dairy cooperatives and 260 for non-farm activities. Seventy
two poultry mother units were established to mobilize poultry producer organizations among
21,600 households. These producer organizations are leading to improved food security and
nutritional outcomes. The project continues to strengthen convergence initiatives that enable
access to entitlements such as the public insurance programs and social security pensions, PDS and
MGNREGA.

F) TWO NEXT GENERATION RURAL INCLUSIVE GROWTH PROJECTS (APRIGP
   AND TRIGP)

                                                                                                 61
The second major set of activities supported by SAFANSI TA included the production of a series of
knowledge products to inform the next generation of multi-sectoral health and nutrition programs
in poorer regions of AP and Telangana: Andhra Pradesh Rural Inclusive Growth Project (APRIGP)
and Telangana Rural Inclusive Growth Project (TRIGP). These programs work on converged
service delivery (supply and demand), developing entrepreneurial approaches to providing health
and nutrition services, designing and implementing social safety nets and conditional cash
transfers, a one stop shop for e-governance and service delivery and data analytics and use of ICT
for feedback and decision making.

The analysis and knowledge products, especially those related to health and nutrition and a South-
South Knowledge Exchange between SERP and Progresa Mexico, helped in designing two new
projects: Andhra Pradesh Rural Inclusive Growth and Telangana Rural Inclusive Growth. The
project will be implemented in the 300 most backward and remote mandals of AP and Telangana.
In these mandals the majority of population is STs, SCs, and PoP. They are socially and
geographically excluded. Both projects take an enterprise-approach to achieving food, nutrition
and sanitation outcomes and are developing a converged institutional approach combining
community, public and private efforts.




IX) DISSEMINATION

The project has taken an approach of concurrent dissemination of various products and learning
materials. Significant amounts of material produced as a result of NLTA has been disseminated in
the form of implementation manuals, training materials and communication materials in local
languages during implementation of the program in Bihar. Frameworks for implementation,
interventions and monitoring have been included in various policy documents and included in
Project Implementation Plans produced by implementing agencies. Various knowledge products
including learning notes, innovation briefs, analytical studies and workshop reports disseminated
through both offline and online mechanisms. On occasion blogs were written and disseminated
based on key learnings and findings. Many of these outputs have been presented and disseminated
at state and national level workshops. Some of the results have been disseminated at various
learning events within the Bank at the last AG FORUM attended by all staff of AG GP. Brown bag
seminars have been also organized to disseminate some findings. Key outputs will be converted
videos and materials for e-learning. Outputs will also be disseminated through the SAFANSI portal.
Finally, joint dissemination with NRLM and State Governments is planned in the next phase.
