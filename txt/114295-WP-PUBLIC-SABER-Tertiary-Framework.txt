                                              ABSTRACT
The main objective of this paper is to outline what policies matter most for an effective tertiary education
(TE) system. It is crucial to ask not simply whether a system is working, but whether it is working to cope
with current and expected demand in nations across the world. The paper presents the conceptual
background and operational tools of the Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER)-TE
domain. These tools are intended to be used by government education policy makers to assess policy
areas of relevance to a country’s tertiary education system, benchmarking national policies against
international best practices. The instruments are designed to be sensitive not only to the aggregation and
benchmarking of best practices, but also to the disaggregation of the often-unintended effects of
traditional tertiary education policies and practices.

SABER-TE is intended to collect, synthesize, and disseminate comprehensive information on tertiary
education to enable policy makers, the World Bank Group (WBG) staff, and development partners to learn
how countries address similar policy challenges.

The paper first provides a historical perspective on the World Bank’s involvement in tertiary education.
Next, it discusses the importance that tertiary education has in today’s society and presents a brief review
of the most significant issues and trends in tertiary education worldwide. In the second part of the
document, the SABER-TE guiding principles are discussed, as well as the policy areas that the framework
assesses. The document then describes instruments for data collection; a rubric for scoring,
benchmarking, and analyzing the data; and methodological approaches for collecting and disseminating
the findings of a SABER-TE assessment.

                                              INTRODUCTION
Since the enactment of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, the world has experienced
remarkable progress in achieving universal primary education. With the exception of Sub-Saharan Africa
and South Asia, primary school enrolment is at least 90 percent around the globe (United Nations, 2014).
Millions more children are now in school as a result of more effective education and development policies,
plus sustained national investments. Even in the poorest countries, average primary school enrollment
rates surged above 80 percent and completion rates, above 60 percent. Globally, the number of out-of-
school children of primary school age fell from 106 million in 1999 to 58 million in 2011. Despite these
achievements, great challenges remain ahead in creating equitable opportunities across educational
levels. Consider the fact that close to 175 million young people—that is, one-quarter of the youth
population in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs)1 — are barely literate (UNESCO 2014).
These statistics show the need for ongoing concerted and consistent action at the primary and secondary
educational stages.

As part of its Education Strategy 2020: Learning for All, the World Bank Group (WBG) has committed to
aiding its country clients in achieving universal education goals, recognizing that simply increasing access
is not enough (World Bank 2011). A new approach is necessary in the face of rapid social changes, including
a surge of young people eager to enroll in secondary and tertiary education in most emerging economies,
growing urbanization in the developing world, a record 210 million people out of work worldwide (ILO and
IILS 2012), and the rise of new middle-income countries anxious to boost their economic competitiveness
by training more skilled, adaptable workforces. These circumstances call for transforming gains in
schooling into improved learning outcomes and better adapting education to new social and economic
needs. Indeed, success at the primary and then secondary level breeds demand for greater participation
in tertiary education, a demand that is further amplified by the changing requirements of employers
globally. To participate in the global society and economy requires increased access to and success in
tertiary education. Only such access will enable developing countries and economies to catalyze increased
primary and secondary educational attainment into increased economic and social development.

The WBG's Learning for All Strategy aims at giving all people equitable opportunities to acquire the
knowledge and skills that they need to have healthy and satisfying lives, to be good citizens, and to be
productive contributors to their countries’ economic and social development. This aim is fully concordant
with the WBG’s twin goals of eliminating extreme poverty in the world and boosting shared prosperity
(see World Bank 2013b). This endeavor requires working across the entire education system—from early
childhood development to better teacher training to tertiary education (TE) and skills development—to
ensure that education is effective in supporting progress towards those goals. After all, tertiary education
is the key to enhancing primary and secondary education, as tertiary institutions prepare the teachers,
administrators, leaders, and other educational professionals who staff the schools and are the key
components of human capital that contribute to increased educational quality and attainment in schools.

on World Bank data and estimates.

 Box 1. Defining Tertiary Education

 Tertiary education (TE) broadly refers to all education (whether public or private) that occurs following secondary
 education. The term "tertiary education" is usually distinct from "higher education (HE),” which refers more
 narrowly to education offered in universities and colleges that award academic degrees and professional
 qualifications. The more encompassing term "tertiary education" includes not only universities and colleges, but
 the entire diverse set of public and private postsecondary institutions in a given country—including technical and
 vocational education and training (TVET) institutes, community colleges, nursing schools, research laboratories,
 centers of excellence, distance-learning centers, and many more. For the purposes of this paper, “tertiary
 education” follows the formal definition of the International Standard Classification of Education (ISCED), the
 reference classification administered by UNESCO that organizes education programs and related qualifications by
 level and field. According to the ISCED, tertiary education includes levels 5 to 8.*
 *A more detailed list of types of academic programs and corresponding codes is included in annex 1.


Despite the manifold benefits of investing in and strengthening tertiary education offerings, the policy
environment in many countries remains deeply inadequate. That is, national policy does not ensure
equitable access, retention, and the success of all qualified students, regardless of background. For
significant change to take place it is essential that decision making in tertiary education be based not only
on concrete evidence of current performance, but also on the ability of current policies and programs to
drive future performance. It is also essential that policies be grounded in considerations and models
appropriate to the needs and conditions of the local economy and society, rather than tertiary models
geared toward quite different economies and student populations who do not represent the global
majority.

In recent years, the WBG launched a comprehensive initiative known as the Systems Approach for Better
Education Results (SABER). This initiative helps countries systematically examine their education-relevant
policies using benchmarking methodologies. Work is underway in several SABER policy domains (see
Figure 1). By 2014, SABER had been applied more than 200 times in more than 100 countries, resulting in
55 country reports and related data (available on the SABER website at http://saber.worldbank.org (World
Bank 2014). Its results have been used to guide policy dialogue in a variety of educational areas. In the
context of both great potential and challenge, the WBG has identified tertiary education as a subsector of
the education system in which this methodology may help governments and institutions better assess
their policies in terms of readiness and implementation. To date, however, only partial analytical work
has been carried out in the form of an initial methodology for analyzing governance policies in the
subsector.

The main objective of this paper is to outline a framework for a SABER-Tertiary Education (henceforth
referred to as SABER-TE) benchmarking tool intended to help policy makers and other stakeholders make
informed decisions on how to achieve system-wide goals for tertiary education. SABER-TE collects,
synthesizes, and disseminates comprehensive information on tertiary education to enable policy makers,
WBG staff, and development partners to learn how countries address similar policy challenges and to track
differences among countries in terms of needs, policies, and practices.

The paper first provides historical perspective on the involvement of the World Bank in tertiary education.
Next, it discusses the importance of tertiary education in today’s society and briefly reviews the most
significant issues and trends in TE worldwide. It then discusses the guiding principles of SABER-TE, as well
as the policy areas that it assesses. The document goes on to describe the instruments used for data
collection; the rubric for scoring, benchmarking, and analyzing the data; and the methodological
approaches for both collecting and disseminating the findings of the assessment instrument and for

                                                                                                                       7
recalibrating parts of a tertiary system that require such work. The latter step is often overlooked when
implementing decisions to improve organizational performance and educational results; part of a systems
approach is to provide a feedback loop within a system, ensuring that knowledge about how a system is
operating is obtained in order that that parts of that system can be refined, reset, or re-engineered, as
needed.

             SYSTEMS APPROACH TO BETTER EDUCATION RESULTS (SABER)
Within the SABER initiative, a consistent benchmarking system has been established for analyzing a
number of specific education policy domains covering the span from early childhood to entry into the
workforce (figure 1). For each SABER domain, a series of diagnostic tools have been developed to assess a
country’s level of educational policy development and to allow for cross-country comparisons.

SABER is intended to help education systems align their governance, management, incentives, financing
mechanisms, human resources, and quality assurance systems more effectively around the goal of
improving learning outcomes. Countries select the SABER policy domains they find most valuable and
relevant to their context and work with the World Bank to apply SABER toolkits to their education systems.

As noted in the introduction, SABER-TE offers a conceptual framework and benchmarking tools to help
policy makers and other stakeholders make informed decisions to achieve system-wide goals for tertiary
education. SABER-TE collects, synthesizes, and disseminates comprehensive information on tertiary
education to enable policy makers, WBG staff, and development partners to learn how countries address
similar policy challenges. At the same time, it helps the system target distinctive challenges and
opportunities within particular regional, national, and local contexts.

SABER-TE is an evidence-based diagnostic tool designed to evaluate tertiary education systems. It helps
improve their ability to evaluate data quality and the systems themselves in order to enhance educational

                                                                                                              9
quality at the tertiary education level. It follows a descriptive assessment approach, focusing on elements
of tertiary education systems that are observable and appraisable to an evaluator with expert knowledge
of the structure and conventions of a tertiary education system in a given country. Evaluations are based
on direct observations, consultations with key stakeholders and experts in the country, as well as review
of relevant primary sources and literature.

Government education policy makers can use SABER-TE to assess policy areas of relevance to a country’s
tertiary education system and then benchmark them against international best practices. The tool’s
evidence-based framework is also envisioned as a means to evaluate intended policies and their
implementation in particular contexts.

      PAST AND PRESENT WORLD BANK GROUP WORK IN TERTIARY EDUCATION
Since 1963 the WBG has actively supported the growth and diversification of tertiary education systems
in developing countries and has promoted essential policy reform in the subsector. In the 1960s and 1970s,
a time of great social and geopolitical upheaval, the WBG primarily focused on supporting technical and
manpower training initiatives aimed at poverty alleviation. In the 1970s and 1980s, much of the support
provided by the WBG to tertiary education projects was piecemeal, with a narrow focus on the
establishment of new programs or discrete quality improvements in existing teaching and research
activities, especially at the institutional level (World Bank 1994). Up until the late 1980s, the WBG did not
have an explicit, official policy for the tertiary education subsector.

In the early 1990s, the WBG undertook an internal review of implementation experience with tertiary
education projects, as well as an assessment of recent and ongoing interventions in the subsector.
Significantly, these initiatives led to the recognition that tertiary education systems are a key priority for
development and that the Bank’s existing approach did not offer the long-term comprehensive support
necessary for the effective performance of these systems (World Bank 1994).

In 1994 the WBG published a landmark report, Higher Education: The Lessons of Experience. 2 The report
drew on the Bank's operational and policy analysis experience, a review of existing literature, and original
studies in an effort to explore options and strategies for improving the performance of tertiary education
systems in developing countries. The report identified four main directions for reform:

         1) Greater differentiation of institutions—including the creation of non-university institutions such
            as polytechnic institutes, community colleges, and technical and vocational education and
            training (TVET) institutions—as well as promoting the introduction of private tertiary education
            providers.
         2) Incentives for public institutions to diversify sources of funding, including cost sharing and
            linking government funding to performance.
         3) Redefining the role of government in tertiary education.
         4) Introducing policies specifically designed to address quality and equity objectives. To a large
            extent, these strategies have remained pillars of the Bank’s ongoing policy strategy for helping
            tertiary education drive economic and social development (World Bank 1994).

The report was not exempt from criticism. Although it outlined recommendations for focused WBG
involvement in tertiary education, the document stressed that such involvement should not distract
governments from addressing policy priorities and directions in primary education. This narrative was
interpreted by some as a directive to de-invest in tertiary education (Samoff and Carrol 2004). The report
indicated that the existing evidence showed that investments in tertiary education had lower social rates
of return than investments in primary and secondary education, and that investments in primary
education could have a more direct impact in poverty reduction because they tended to improve income
equality. Primary and secondary education, stated the report, would continue to be the highest-priority
subsectors in the Bank’s education lending (World Bank 1994).

In 1998, in collaboration with the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization
(UNESCO), the WBG convened a Task Force on Higher Education and Society, which brought together
education experts from 13 countries to explore the future of tertiary education in developing countries.

    At the time, the World Bank had not yet adopted the broader "tertiary education" term.

                                                                                                           11
The Task Force highlighted the need to develop the teaching and research capacity of national tertiary
education systems in order for developing countries to be competitive in the knowledge economy. Among
the main innovations introduced by The Task Force's final report, Higher Education and Developing
Countries: Peril and Promise (World Bank 2000), were calls: to 1) expand the pool of students with
specialized skills and support a general education that encouraged flexibility and innovation; 2) increase
access to tertiary education, especially by students from disadvantaged backgrounds; and 3) expand and
improve opportunities for lifelong learning, so that individuals could upgrade their skills as needed in a
changing economic environment.

Since then, the WBG has strived to develop more productive ways of supporting tertiary education reforms
and innovations. It does so through observation and analysis of tertiary education reforms in client
countries, promotion of best practices and benchmarking exercises from an international perspective, and
the provision of financial support to country governments and institutions.

Currently, the Bank has a highly diversified portfolio of more than 80 lending and technical assistance
projects in tertiary education, which deal with a variety of specific areas, including quality assurance,
institutional diversification, performance-based funding schemes, alignment of academic offerings with
market and societal needs, financing of equitable access programs, public-private partnerships, science
and technology, and governance reform, among others. The tertiary education portfolio represents, on
average, 20 percent of the total WBG investment in education (figure 2). From 2003 to 2012, the Bank lent
US$ 3.34 billion to 110 education projects with tertiary education components in 58 countries. Also, as of
June 2014, the International Financing Corporation (IFC) —the private sector arm of the World Bank
Group—had an education portfolio of US$ 770 million, of which approximately 70 percent was devoted to
tertiary education initiatives.

At the same time, one of the WBG’s priorities is to create a robust global knowledge base that informs
dialogue on how to improve the efficiency and equity of tertiary education around the globe. The
development of SABER-TE is a central component of this strategy. By creating detailed, comparable
analyses of the characteristics, strengths, and weaknesses of tertiary systems while recognizing their
unique characteristics, SABER-TE seeks to create a unique knowledge base to guide reform strategies and
programmatic priorities.

                THE IMPORTANCE OF TERTIARY EDUCATION FOR SOCIETY
Tertiary education is instrumental in fostering growth, development, and poverty reduction. Tertiary
systems play multiple roles beyond the teaching and research functions historically associated with
tertiary education institutions. These roles, however, vary by the type and mission of a tertiary education
institution.


Figure 4. Tertiary Education’s Diversified Roles




First, tertiary education systems play key roles in human capital development and capacity building. A
highly skilled workforce with tertiary education credentials is a prerequisite for economic growth because
workers’ skills are essential in technology development, transfer, and application (Lucas 1988; Romer 1986,
1990). Despite setbacks associated with the recent financial crisis and contrary to trends experienced in
the 1980s and 1990s, the economic returns on education for tertiary education graduates are, in general,
the highest in the entire educational system — a finding that holds across the world (Montenegro and
Patrinos 2013) (table 1).3 . Educated individuals are more employable, able to earn higher wages, cope
better with economic shocks, and raise healthier children (World Bank 2011).

 In certain countries, however, the rate of economic return, although high, shows signs of a slight decline as more
tertiary education graduates enter the labor market.

                                                                                                                14

 In addition to individual private economic returns, the broader social effects—including economic
 effects— of tertiary education institutions and their graduates in a given local and regional economy and
 society are significant, but more difficult to measure. This is mostly due to the difficulties associated with
 quantifying the “spillover effect” from tertiary education on such things as the level of technological
 innovation or human capital in a region as measured with respect to social and political stability and health
 (Leslie and Brinkman 1988). It is known that these effects increase worker productivity, which in turn is
 associated with increases in workers’ income levels—and thus greater economic activity. Whether and
 how to account for indirect factors that enhance productivity is critical to any study that seeks to estimate
 the impact of tertiary education on a regional economy. To this end, economists have developed two main
 assessment approaches: one measures the direct and indirect economic effects of direct expenditures of
 tertiary education institutions, and another measures the future wages of the skilled workers once they
 graduate (New England Public Policy Center 2006).

 In the case of U.S. cities, it is estimated that there is a positive causal relationship between the proportion
 of university graduates in a city’s labor force and average wages. An estimate suggests that a 1 percent
 increase in the supply of graduates at the ISCED 6 level raises the wages of high school dropouts by 1.9
 percent, those of high school graduates by 1.6 percent, and those of tertiary education graduates by 0.4
 percent (Moretti 2004). Significantly, while tertiary education systems make important contributions to
 increasing the economic development of the cities and regions that they serve, they also contribute to
 making the latter more responsive to local societal, environmental, and cultural needs (Marmolejo and
 Puuka 2006).

 At the same time, as economies become increasingly globalized, it is assumed that through their research
 and innovation capacity, tertiary education systems can and must play an important role in fostering
 greater local, regional, and national competitiveness. The knowledge economy has witnessed the
 emergence of a "Mode 2" research environment characterized by greater heterogeneity in both the types
 of knowledge required and the sites at which this knowledge is produced. Thus, research production has
 shifted from an emphasis on basic to more applied research, allowing for increased activity in fields
 traditionally been seen as non-research intensive, such as management, education, and other humanities
 and social science disciplines. Likewise, this phenomenon has allowed many new kinds of “knowledge’

                                                                                                             15
organizations,” such as think tanks, to join the research game. In the case of tertiary education, countries
like Canada have, for example, funneled public and private funding for community colleges into applied
research that can lead to commercialization of products, processes, and services.

A final significant change in this regard is the closer interaction between tertiary education actors and the
private sector. As the world economy transitions from an industry-based to a knowledge-based economy,
tertiary education institutions—especially those with established or aspirational research orientations—
are increasingly called to align their teaching and research activities with market imperatives, most notably
in disciplines related to technology, the sciences, and medicine (Jessop 2008). Nowadays, faculty members
of intensive research-oriented universities are asked to develop links with industry, and university policy
encourages patents, commercialization of know-how, technology transfer, research parks, commercial
spin-offs, science and technology parks, incubators, and consultancy services, among other market-driven
activities (Slaughter and Leslie 1997). This is more evident in tertiary institutions located in industrialized
countries, but increasingly present—at least as an aspiration—in low- and lower-middle-income countries
(LLMICs).

Studies suggest that the research output of universities in LLMICs is generally low and that there is limited
transfer of technology from these universities to local industries. However, the gradual emergence of a
local critical mass of individuals with tertiary education degrees increases the likelihood of technological
uptake and adaptation (Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014). An efficient, well-managed tertiary system
is uniquely positioned to supply graduates with necessary skills, provide specialized services and other
inputs, and strengthen local innovation networks (Thorn and Soo 2006).

Of course, tertiary education is not only about economic returns and economic impact. There are
significant non-market public externalities to both human and economic development associated with a
more educated population. Society at large benefits from tertiary education through increased tax
revenues, savings and investments from higher earnings; improved health and welfare (for both
individuals and their family members), greater longevity, improved cognitive development in children, and
reduced family size (Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014). Likewise, there is evidence that individuals
with at least some tertiary education are more civically responsible, as evidenced by voting rates,
charitable giving, and openness to diversity (World Bank 2011; Bloom, Hartley, and Rosovsky 2006; Farrel
et al. 2006). In short, tertiary education institutions prepare individuals not only by providing them with
adequate and relevant work-related skills, but also by educating them to be active members of the
communities and societies in which they live.

Based on the widespread evidence of the many public and private benefits of a tertiary education,
establishing sound policies and interventions that enable inclusive access, graduation and success for all
young people would open the door to increased earnings, intergenerational mobility, and a more just
society (Birdsall 1999), which in turn would translate into a more productive society (Piketty 2014). While
recognizing the crucial role of individual responsibility and effort in determining outcomes, public
interventions in tertiary education are justified and essential to eliminating “disadvantages from
circumstances that lie largely beyond the control of individual but that powerfully shape both the
outcomes and actions in pursuit of those outcomes” (World Bank 2006). Likewise, public regulations are
justified in order to establish a legal and operational framework that guarantees the quality of education
provided by both public and private tertiary education institutions. The challenge is to steer tertiary
education systems towards overcoming and reducing inequality, particularly in relation to students from
underserved populations.


                                                                                                            16
It is important to stress that economic development is both insecure and unsustainable unless
accompanied by measures designed to reduce poverty, social exclusion, and environmental problems
(OECD 2012). In this regard, tertiary institutions are uniquely positioned to help improve community
health and welfare, social cohesion, and a healthy and sustainable environment, each goal guided by their
respective missions. For example, universities are well positioned to conduct research on key topics such
as sustainable food production in rural areas, training specialized scientists and other knowledge workers
through academic and further education programs, and serving as a conduit between interested
stakeholders, such as community groups, NGOs, and governmental agencies. Institutions with a stronger
focus on education and training, such as community colleges and technical and vocational institutes, can
also contribute to social development by providing affordable quality tertiary education directly linked to
the skills required in the local economy, facilitating partnerships with the public and private sectors to
enhance the quality of life for economically challenged and other disadvantaged groups, and offering
lifelong learning and workforce re-training programs to improve the human capital of individuals who may
not otherwise have access to these opportunities. One potential benefit of systemic benchmarking
initiatives is to illuminate the extent to which government policies can counter inequitable effects
(Slaughter and Rhoades 2004) (Piketty 2014), and instead steer market mechanisms towards addressing
key social, economic, and political challenges.

Finally, in many parts of the world tertiary education institutions constitute are part and parcel of a nation’s
social and cultural fabric. Tertiary education can assist in forming a strong nation state and in deepening
democracy by producing a citizenry with the knowledge and critical thinking skills necessary to engage in
the civil, political, social, cultural, and economic activities of a society in a context of cultural pluralism and
diversity. The nation-building role of tertiary education thus includes the cultivation of civic virtues to
shape a democratic and civilized society, as well as to initiate and maintain critical discussion within
societies (Välimaa and Hoffman 2008; Tilak 2008). Again the question remains to what extent these nation-
building functions of tertiary education are fostered or hindered by policy environments driven primarily
by revenue generation and prestige.




                                                                                                                17
                     THE STATUS OF TERTIARY EDUCATION WORLDWIDE
As governments in LLMICs have focused investments on increasing educational attainment at the primary
and secondary education levels, the pool of students demanding opportunities in tertiary education has
increased (figure 4).4 This has led to a significant growth in tertiary provision in a relatively short period of
time. Today, there are around 200 million tertiary education students in the world, in comparison with
only 89 million in 1998. It is expected that massive growth will continue in this subsector in the future,
mostly in developing countries (World Bank 2016). In short, tertiary education worldwide has experienced
dramatic expansion, increased diversification, and a gradual change from peripheral to central priority in
the formulation of public policy.

Growth in tertiary education enrollment has been experienced worldwide. Nevertheless, LLMICs in
general lag behind highly industrialized nations. This is paradoxical, considering that the LLMICs are
experiencing a so-called “demographic bonus”—that is, a rapidly expanding youth population—while
some highly industrialized countries have falling birth rates—that is, they are witnessing a gradual
reduction in the pool of incoming tertiary education students. As can be seen in figure 5, although
improved relative to previous years, the gross enrollment ratio in tertiary education in some countries
remains extremely low in comparison with that of more industrialized countries.5 To a considerable extent
this pattern reflects the fact that currently predominant models of tertiary education have been far more
successful in benefiting upper-middle income, already advantaged students than in serving the growing
population of young people worldwide.

  This section does not intend to provide an exhaustive analysis of all relevant aspects of the current status of tertiary
education worldwide. Rather, it seeks describe those aspects of contemporary tertiary education considered most
significant for policy making, albeit at the risk of excluding issues that some readers believe should be included in
the discussion.
5
  Gross enrollment ratio is defined here as total enrollment in tertiary education (ISCED 5 to 8), regardless of age,
expressed as a percentage of the total population of the five-year age group that begins after secondary school.

                                                                                                                       18
Tertiary education systems also face major challenges tied to rapid socioeconomic change and
globalization. Technological advances and the shift towards a global service economy are changing job
profiles and skills. The stunning rise of middle-income countries, led by China, India, and Brazil, has
intensified the desire of many nations to increase their competitiveness by building more highly skilled
workforces. The result is an intense demand for expanded access to tertiary education, particularly
technical and vocational education and training (TVET) that can provide students with skills and knowledge
relevant to labor market needs.

In response to these converging trends, a number of countries have undertaken a major restructuring of
their tertiary education systems to enhance the reach and effectiveness of these systems. However,
progress has been uneven and sharp contrasts remain between and within tertiary education systems
worldwide. Although the economic returns to education for graduates of tertiary institutions are high, in
several countries these returns have been gradually declining as a larger number of graduates joins the
labor market; concerns about the relevance of their skills also persists (Montenegro and Patrinos 2013).
In some countries, including the United States, China, and India, young college graduates have also seen a
dramatic deterioration in their job prospects in the past decade (Shierholz, Wething and Sabadish 2012;
Bai 2006; Chan 2006; Gereffi et al. 2008; Mooney and Neelakantan 2006). In China, for example, the
ballooning supply of engineering graduates has led to increased rates of unemployment, especially for
those graduating from non–top-tier universities. While university graduates increased substantially by
2007, job openings for new graduates across all disciplines fell by 22 percent from the 2006 level to only
1.6 million, meaning that 60 percent of China’s 2006 university graduates would be unable to find work
(Gereffi et al. 2008; Chan 2006).

Another dramatic example can be seen in Middle Eastern and North African (MENA) countries, a region in
which more than half of the population is under 25 years old. Although tertiary education enrollment has
increased substantially in the region, youth unemployment rates are higher than in any other region of
the world, even for individuals holding tertiary education degrees. These trends suggest that growth in



                                                                                                                           19
tertiary education enrollment rates is not always paired with education of increased quality and relevance
to the labor market.

There is also evidence that tertiary education systems in many countries are plagued with high dropout
and noncompletion rates. In Italy only 64 percent of students entering the tertiary level complete a degree.
In the United States, out of 4.3 million freshmen students in 2004, 2.1 million did not officially graduate.
Data from the Student Pathways Study in South Africa indicate that 50 percent of students enrolled in
tertiary education institutions in that country drop out in their first three years. Significantly, many
departing students in the study were high-achievers at the secondary level, came from poverty-stricken
families, and were indebted to the relevant national student financial aid program and/or other education
funding agencies that supported their studies. The high dropout rates bode ill for efforts to break the
vicious cycle of poverty in the country (Letseka and Breier 2008).

Moreover, despite extensive efforts to improve tertiary education opportunities worldwide, access to and
success at this level of education is highly inequitable. Enrollment in tertiary institutions remains largely
restricted to students coming from the wealthier segments of society. One of the main challenges in the
subsector worldwide is thus to ensure equitable access, retention, and success of students from
underrepresented and traditionally excluded groups.6 The fact that tertiary education systems favor
students from higher income levels is evident in several regions of the world in both low- and middle-
income economies. In Malawi, only one percent of students enrolled in tertiary education are from the
lowest economic quintile and only 3 percent are from the second quintile. In contrast, over 80 percent of
tertiary education students come from the richest quintile (World Bank 2013a). Along similar lines, a
recent study shows that in many Latin American countries, students from the poorest decile generally
represent a very small percentage of total tertiary education enrollment. At the other extreme, students
from the highest income decile show an access rate similar to that of highly-industrialized countries (World
Bank 2015; see figure 7).

These data point to a regressive funding pattern in countries where heavily subsidized public tertiary
systems overwhelmingly benefit students from higher socioeconomic strata. This fiscally regressive
pattern is especially pronounced in countries with binary tertiary systems divided between a small, highly
selective set of public colleges and universities and a set of private institutions that cater to the bulk of the
college-going population. In the absence of well-developed need-based financial aid, government-backed
financing of the public sector essentially subsidizes the education of students of higher socioeconomic
status. Meanwhile, the options for students from disadvantaged backgrounds may be limited to fee-paying
institutions of questionable quality. This situation has led to legitimate policy discussion in several
countries about how to better structure tertiary education policies and practices to serve larger segments
of the population more effectively.

Chile, for example, has initiated a move towards a free “tuition-for-all” model. The political demand for
such a shift is grounded in the excessive debt of students at graduation, and the deep disparity in access
to tertiary education between students from low and high socioeconomic strata. In 2009, there were
approximately 850,000 tertiary education students in the country, only 18 percent of which were from the

  “Equity” is defined here as equal opportunities to access and succeed in tertiary education. Consequently,
“inequity” refers to the lack of equal opportunities to access and succeed at this educational level. “Inequality” refers
primarily to the condition of being unequal and tends to depict things that can be expressed in numbers. For
example, one might say that inequality in access to tertiary education results from inequity in society, or that
inequality in access to tertiary education is a great inequity.

                                                                                                                      20
lowest socioeconomic decile, compared to 77 percent from the wealthiest decile (Beyer and Cox 2011).
While some scholars provide arguments to the contrary (e.g., Atria y Sanhueza 2013), others express
concern that a free tuition-for-all model (rather than free tuition for students from the neediest sectors of
society) may further entrench inequality by essentially providing a public subsidy to students from very
rich and well-off middle classes that can afford to pay university tuition and associated costs (Badat 2011;
Beyer and Cox 2011).

In some countries, the socioeconomic gap in access to tertiary education can be exacerbated by
overlapping layers of inequality. For instance, in Guatemala, where 40 percent of the total population is
indigenous, only 2 percent of the total indigenous population (across all age groups), had attained a
tertiary education degree in 2006 (Bashir and Luque 2012). In other words, young people from
underprivileged groups (which in different contexts may be defined not only by income, but also by
ethnicity, gender, language, age, culture, religion, disability, or caste) may encounter additional barriers
stemming from inadequate academic preparation at lower educational levels, low motivation and
expectations regarding tertiary education, and lack of institutional capacity to properly address their
needs.

In response to this significant limitation on overall development, different countries have established a
variety of equity-promotion policies, programs, and procedures at both national and institutional levels.
Some countries have attempted to mitigate inequitable access by using a variety of directives or targeted
programs, including mandatory admission quotas for students from certain population groups,
performance-based funding for institutions meeting equity targets, and need-based grants for students
from less privileged socioeconomic backgrounds, among others. However, these initiatives are not exempt
from tensions, especially in relation to academic standards. For example, it has been argued that
compensatory mechanisms such as simple student quotas can worsen rather than eliminate social
inequality (Schwartzman 2009).

Previous studies conducted by the WBG show that inequality in tertiary education is, to a large extent, an
extension of inequality at lower levels of education, that is, it reflects system-wide structural barriers that
impact the economic and social opportunities of many talented and capable young people. The two main

                                                                                                            21
kinds of additional barriers found at the tertiary level are financial and non-financial; the latter include
inadequate information, motivation, academic preparation, and social capital (World Bank 2013b).

Financing (both at the individual and student level) remains one of main barriers to access and success in
tertiary education. Income poverty remains a pervasive barrier to school attendance and learning at all
educational levels, particularly for girls and minority groups. As mentioned above, in both industrialized
and developing countries, there is a strong historical correlation between family socioeconomic
background and tertiary educational attainment (OECD 2006; McPherson and Schapiro 2006). In several
regions access to tertiary education is severely restricted by the high cost of attendance, especially for
students from poorer socioeconomic backgrounds. For instance, whereas in OECD countries the total cost
of tertiary education (including tuition, fees and living expenses) averages 35 percent of per capita GDP,
the figures in Colombia (66 percent) and Peru (96 percent) are significantly higher (Cerdan-Infantes and
Blom 2007).

At the system level, the high cost of tertiary education is magnified by dramatically increased expansion
pressures. As the youth population continues to grow in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, MENA, and Latin
America, the task of publicly funding tertiary education institutions becomes increasingly difficult.
Countries with limited resources find it very difficult to rely exclusively on public funds to finance the large
expansions needed to meet increasing social demand for access without compromising the quality of
educational offerings (Johnstone 2004); Experton and Fevre 2010). In countries where tertiary education
is heavily subsidized by the state and tuition fees are low, for example, the growing cost of education at
this level takes a significant share of public budgets. In the end, this cost must be absorbed by taxpayers.
In several cases, governments have reduced budgetary support of tertiary education because it competes
with other social demands, resulting in a gradual reduction of institutional capacity and decreased
educational quality.

Likewise, there is a well-documented tendency of unit costs in tertiary education to grow faster than unit
costs in an economy overall. In the knowledge economy, this tendency is accelerated both by the rapidly
increasing cost of technology and a labor market in which the need for skills and knowledge is also subject
to rapid change (Cheslock 2006; Johnstone 1998). In the United States alone, the tuition cost to students
and families of a college degree has increased twelve-fold over the past 30 years as tertiary education
institutions compete to position themselves in global rankings. However, the Delta Cost Project has
clarified that the actual costs of educating students has not grown much; rather, there is a substitution
effect whereby reduced state support is shifting costs to the consumer (Desrochers and Hurlburt 2012).
Some of the associated phenomena include exponentially stringent selectivity standards, significant
investment in support infrastructure, and mounting competition to attract faculty and administrators with
high salaries. A similar phenomenon is observed in other countries. For instance, in China in 1998, public
support covered 91 percent of all tertiary education expenditures; just 12 years later public funds covered
only 43 percent of all tertiary education expenditures. Correspondingly, revenues from student fees grew
from 6 to 31 percent over the same period. Globally, the decrease in public funds for tertiary education
has resulted not only in higher tuition and fees for students, but also in a more aggressive pursuit of
revenue-generating activities and additional sources of financial resources on the part of tertiary
education institutions that are not always directly connected to their principal mission (Slaughter and
Rhoades 2004).

In terms of nonfinancial barriers to tertiary education, a lack of information about the costs of tertiary
education, financing options, and labor market prospects of various institutions and academic programs
have also been identified as enrollment barriers for disadvantaged populations in regions like Latin

                                                                                                             22
America (Murakami and Blom 2008). More generally, one of the most pervasive obstacles to improving
not just enrollment rates, but the overall quality of tertiary education, is the lack of dedicated information
systems to track student access, retention, completion, and outcomes after graduation. Targeted
interventions like ACCES (Acceso con Calidad a la Educacion Superior, in Spanish) in Colombia have
enhanced the transparency of tertiary education market as part of comprehensive reforms aimed at
improving equity. This initiative has increased the availability of information about tertiary institutions to
students, their families, employers, and the government. The project's “relatively small investment in
information systems, designed to provide students and their families with the information necessary to
guide their decisions regarding institution and careers, has greatly enhanced the outcome of the project’s
major investment in student assistance” (Cerdan-Infantes and Blom 2007, p.4).

In this regard, there is evidence that the most effective equity-promotion policies at the tertiary level are
those that combine financial aid with measures to overcome nonfinancial obstacles, that is, policies that
address the equity environment comprehensively rather than relying on piecemeal approaches to
individual barriers to entry. First, there is strong evidence that well-targeted and efficiently managed
financial aid can be instrumental in reducing financial barriers to tertiary education. A combination of
three methods is used to help students from disadvantaged groups: 1) no tuition or low tuition fees; 2)
need-based grants; and 3) student loans. Second, many countries have successfully implemented outreach
and bridging programs to secondary schools (i.e., building partnerships with K–12 institutions and reaching
out to students at a very young age to expose them to the path towards tertiary education), reformed
selection procedures and/or preferential admission programs, special institutions and programs that
target underprivileged groups, and retention programs to improve completion rates (World Bank 2013c).

Additionally, to meet increasing student demand, tertiary education systems around the world are
establishing a variety of new institutions alongside traditional universities— short-duration technical
institutes and community colleges (ISCED level 5), polytechnics, distance-education centers, and open
universities, among others. In some cases, institutional diversification has been accompanied by a carefully
planned process that includes provision for a more dynamic adaptation of the curriculum, employer
involvement, and prospective labor market studies. In other cases, the proliferation of institutions has
occurred with limited overall planning, oftentimes based on purely political decisions aimed at appeasing
requests from communities or economic sectors eager to have tertiary education institutions of their own
or to meet growing demand. This tendency is more prevalent in countries with weak licensing and quality
assurance frameworks.

At the same time, national policies and regulatory frameworks are shifting to allow private providers a
much more substantial role in the tertiary education sector, even in systems where public providers had
previously dominated, such as Eastern Europe, Latin America, Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Australia (Levy
2006; Salerno 2004; Shin and Harman 2009). In some countries, the increase in the number of private
institutions meets not only the needs of specific groups, but of entire societies (Reiko 2014). Such non-
university institutions (both public and private) can absorb a significant share of the expanding demand
for tertiary education. At the same time, because these institutions are typically more responsive to local
labor market needs, they can help improve the balance between skills supply and demand, as well as
provide sustainable training alternatives to students who are either not interested or sufficiently prepared
for a longer-term academic degree.

Nevertheless, while the for-profit sector of tertiary education has emerged predominantly in the United
States, but also globally, significant challenges remain due to increased levels of student debt, default on
student debt, and various forms of consumer abuse. As a result, in recent years, major players in the for-

                                                                                                           23
profit sector have either closed or experienced dramatic declines in enrollments and market share, to the
detriment of both students and overall tertiary education attainment. Certain events, including the failure
of large for-profit institutions like Corinthian Colleges and Universidad del Mar in the United States and
Chile, respectively, illustrate the potential for predatory practices among for-profit providers in an
insufficiently or inadequately regulated environment.

Institutional diversification is not exempt from challenges and limitations. In societies with a strong
university tradition, for example, the widening of non-university educational options at the tertiary level
tends to be seen with skepticism and caution by employers, parents, and students. There is a strong
tendency for these institutions and their academic programs to be portrayed as low quality and low
prestige. At the same time, adequate articulation provisions that enable students to easily transfer from
non-university institutions to the traditional universities frequently do not exist. This represents a potential
barrier for students who seek to continue their studies at the university level. Since many non-university
institutions tend to have less strict selectivity admission policies and offer less expensive academic
programs, they tend to attract students who may not meet university selectivity standards or be able to
afford the costs of attending a university. Together, these factors contribute to an unhealthy stratification
within the tertiary education system.

Several countries have tried to address these problems through such strategies as establishing and
strengthening articulation pathways to facilitate the transfer of students across institutions; promoting the
transfer of credits from university courses to non-university institutions and vice versa; developing joint
curricular offerings by faculty members from both types of institutions; mandatory recognition of credits
for college-level courses offered by non-university institutions; joint appointments of faculty members;
granting special intermediate-status to certain institutions in order to promote the gradual recognition of
their programs across institutions; creating pathways for selected non-university institutions to eventually
attain university status; and positively promoting the recognition of non-university credentials in society
at large.

The competition inherent in broadening the spectrum of tertiary education providers can make
institutions more efficient, increase educational quality, expand coverage, and lead to cost reduction—all
important considerations in progressing towards Education for All goals. However, these positive
outcomes can be achieved only when they are based on robust quality assurance systems that ensure
tertiary offerings are accessible, available, affordable, relevant to local educational and labor market
needs, and of acceptable quality (Daniel, Kanwar, and Uvalic-Trumbic 2005, 2006). A primary concern is
to protect students from low-quality and disreputable providers, as well as to encourage the development
of institutions and programs that help meet a country’s human, social, economic, and cultural needs.
Quality assurance is thus an effort that simultaneously involves governments, tertiary providers, academic
staff, student organizations, quality assurance agencies, and accreditation bodies, among other
stakeholders.

In the knowledge economy, tertiary education plays a crucial role in economic growth and social progress.
In addition to teaching and research, traditionally considered the key missions of higher education
institutions, so-called “third-mission” activities promote the engagement of tertiary institutions with
industry and society at large. Yet despite important world-class examples of good practice, the potential
of tertiary education institutions to address the considerable social, cultural, and environmental
challenges of the regions and constituencies that they serve often remains untapped. A strict focus on
teaching or research and a lack of incentives to conduct socially oriented activities may discourage service-
minded faculty and limit resources for third-mission activities. Ultimately, this focus may fail to generate

                                                                                                             24
the necessary critical mass to produce projects that could have potentially positive multiplier effects at
the local and regional level. This important dimension of tertiary education should be recognized by public
and private stakeholders as important to national development (OECD 2012).

Finally, developing adequate research and development (R&D) capacity at the tertiary level is imperative
to identify and adapt scientific and technological options, and eventually, create technologies that are
unique and relevant to a given country, region, or city (Fagerberg and Verspagen 2002; Thorn and Soo
2006; Ischinger and Puukka 2009). It is not only universities that contribute to this goal: technological
institutes, community colleges, and TVET institutions play an equally important part in building local
innovation networks and supplying a highly skilled labor force to strengthen R&D capacity (Thorn and Soo
2006).

The creation of partnerships among tertiary institutions and external partners are evidence of the barriers
to increasing the capacity for R&D at the tertiary level (STI Group 2010). In regions like Latin America,
linkages between universities and private companies are quite weak, even when there is strong evidence
that considerable benefits could be accrued from these partnerships (Mark, Thorn, and Blom 2006). The
reasons behind this phenomenon are complex. In countries like Argentina, Brazil, Colombia, and Mexico,
over 60 percent of all researchers are employed by universities (which in turn receive the bulk of public
subsidies for research). Lack of a tradition of public-private partnerships and incentives for translating
research capacity into commercial applications keeps educational institutions aloof to the needs of
industry. Many developing countries suffer, moreover, from a weak private sector, which limits that
sector’s ability to significantly partner with tertiary education institutions. The partnership model that is
so powerful in the West and North, particularly in the United States, is premised on a vibrant private sector
and on levels of corporate wealth not found in many developing countries and economies. That fact is a
challenge to consider other forms of partnerships and other partners in order to leverage economic, social,
and political development.

Finally, the low regard with which local entrepreneurs hold university education and research, along with
the limited capacity of private companies to absorb emerging knowledge, further compound the issue
(IMD 2005). Numerous employer surveys consistently reveal concerns about the misalignment between
graduates’ skills and employer expectations, especially in terms of soft or behavioral skills (see, for
example, di Gropello, Kruse and Tandon 2011; di Gropello, Tan, and Tandon 2010). Tertiary systems play
an important role in boosting economic productivity and innovation by equipping individuals with the
necessary knowledge and skills to prosper in the labor market. However, in some contexts this may require
strengthening communication with the private sector. Tertiary institutions with close links to the market
(such as TVET centers), benefit from the participation of the business sector in technical committees,
which helps ensure a closer fit between skills supply and demand.

                                   CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK
The previous section highlighted some of the formidable challenges faced by tertiary education systems.
As these systems grow in size and complexity, it is a challenging task to coordinate their various
components, functions, and objectives. This complexity calls for an effective normative operational
framework to ensure that a tertiary education system performs well and adequately responds to domestic
education and training needs.

A fundamental principle in the analysis of the tertiary education sector is to see it as part a continuum
comprised of the entire educational system. Understanding the role of tertiary education and its
intersection with primary and secondary education is crucial: the level of attainment and quality of
schooling at preceding levels of education directly affects growth, quality, and attainment at the tertiary
level. Consequently, it is in the best interest of tertiary education to design and implement policies and
programs that positively enhance the effectiveness of pre-tertiary education. And it is not only desirable,
but also necessary for tertiary education to play a more active role in connecting to preceding levels of
the educational system.

Any policy design should be properly attuned to the local context. Transplanting practices, even though
they may be successful in a given context, may not necessarily be sufficient if the transplantation ignores
the local environment and local needs. That is, simplistic adoption of practices hinders proper adaptation,
genuine and effective indigenous developments, and the long-term sustainability of improvements in a
country’s tertiary education system.

Last but not least, it is critical to recognize that tertiary education systems are dynamic and that fluidity
and recalibration are necessary elements in both their analysis and design.

Despite the complexity and uniqueness of each tertiary education system, several components are
common to all. These components can serve as a basis for analyzing policy readiness and implementation
in individual systems (figure8). These components include:
    y   Vision. Not always formally in place, a vision of a tertiary education system is typically an
        aspirational description of what a tertiary education system seeks to achieve or accomplish in
        the long term and is intended to serve as a guide for steering the system.
    y   Regulatory framework. A regulatory framework is the set of regulations that a government has
        in place to, at least in theory, protect the interests of all tertiary education stakeholders,
        especially students and the public. An overall regulatory framework includes the legislative and
        statutory context in which tertiary education institutions operate, which may be national,
        regional, local and, in some cases, international.
    y   Programmatic domains. These are the key components of different tertiary education
        institutions—regardless of their specific mission or specialty—and the overall tertiary education
        system as a whole. Programmatic domains are usually reviewed in terms of their contribution to
        the vision of the tertiary education system and include governance, quality and finance.
    y   Outcomes. The activities of tertiary education institutions and their corresponding effectiveness
        are seen in terms of their delivery capacity, which is usually measured in terms of equitable
        access, efficient retention, and adequate readiness of students for work upon graduation.
        Outcomes also include the relevance of a tertiary education institution not only with respect to
        teaching, but also with respect to its research and outreach work.



                                                                                                          26
   o   Tertiary Educational Management Information System (TEMIS). A TEMIS is the set of
       technological and institutional arrangements for collecting, processing, and disseminating data in
       a tertiary education system. A TEMIS is crucial for tracking changes, ensuring data quality, timely
       reporting of essential information for planning and management purposes, as well as for decision
       making by policy makers both at the institutional and central government levels.


Figure 8. Conceptual Framework for a Tertiary Education System




As indicated before, the SABER-TE has been developed to help countries benchmark the quality and
readiness of their tertiary education policies, as well as the quality of policy implementation (figure9).
Consequently, the following components are considered:
       y   Vision
       y   Regulatory framework
       y   Governance
       y   Financing
       y   Educational quality
       y   Equitable access, retention, and successful completion
       y   Relevance of tertiary education to economic development

Figure 9. Policy Domains in SABER-TE




The data collection instrument, review and consultation process, and specific rubrics of the SABER-TE
benchmarking tool are aimed at gathering and analyzing relevant evidence on a country level for each
policy domain. Cognizant of each country’s unique contextual characteristics, the resulting data generate
a benchmarking score. It is crucial here to stress some features of the benchmarking process. First, the
SABER-TE process is intended to be a very rigorous process involving not only professional judgment, but
also a review of evidence and consultation with key stakeholders and expert informants. The qualitative
and quantitative data gathered from the expert informant questionnaire is analyzed in combination with
a documentary review of primary and secondary sources (where available) to ensure that a given country’s
score is an accurate a snapshot of its policy reality. Second, while the indicators in the scoring rubric are
assigned numerical values, these values not intended to be used as ordinal, but rather, as categorical data.

Vision for tertiary education

 VISION FOR TERTIARY EDUCATION: The country or government has a vision and plan for the tertiary
 education sector, and a willingness to translate its vision into a concrete action plan.

A vision of a tertiary education system is an aspirational description of what a tertiary education system
seeks to achieve or accomplish in the long term. It is intended to serve as a guide for steering the system.

The level of specificity of a country’s vision for tertiary education appears to be strongly connected to the
degree of centralization of its government. Usually when a central government is significantly involved in
steering the tertiary education system, a formal vision with specific goals and even performance or



                                                                                                          28
progress indicators is in place. On the contrary, it is common to find that a vision for tertiary education is
not clearly stated in countries where the central government has limited involvement in the sector.

As noted by Fielden (2008), the articulation of a vision and strategy for the sector involves answering
questions about the purpose of tertiary education in a country, the principal goals and targets to be set in
terms of participation, and the process by which these targets will be achieved, including the types of
institutions to be supported, the time period for such support, and the definition of relevant stakeholders
in achieving these objectives.

Regulatory framework for tertiary education

 REGULATORY FRAMEWORK: The tertiary education system is based on an appropriate regulatory
 framework that supports the work of tertiary education providers for the benefit of the students and
 the public.

The regulatory framework is the set of legal norms and organizational arrangements that are in place to
ensure the adequate provision of tertiary education in the country, thus protecting the interests of all
tertiary education stakeholders, especially students and the public. The overall regulatory framework
defines the legislative and statutory context in which institutions of tertiary education operate.

An appropriate regulatory framework typically includes a statement on tertiary education in national law,
as well as a legal framework defining the eligibility of public and private providers for entrance into the
tertiary education sector, certification requirements for operations, and the specific regulatory
requirements that apply to all types of tertiary education institutions, including public and private (for-
profit and nonprofit) institutions.

The need to clarify roles and requirements in legislation is becoming increasingly important, given the
growing complexity of the tertiary education sector and the many different actors which may be involved.
An appropriate regulatory framework helps clarify how various stakeholders operate in the system,
allowing space for both state and private organizations without creating barriers to flexibility (Fielden
2008).

It is fundamental to understand the way in which the regulatory framework is set up in order to have a
better sense of a government’s capacity to steer the tertiary education system. Usually in “hard” steering
models, the steering of the tertiary education system is achieved via detailed legislation, line-item
financing, and detailed prescriptions for curriculum and other academic matters (even determining, in
some cases, the number of students that an institution can accept). In contrast, the increasingly prevalent
“soft” steering model is achieved through performance-based financing, quality assurance regulations,
and established reporting mechanisms. In some countries, the level of steering exercised by the
government varies depending on the type of institution(s).

In all cases, an adequate review of the regulatory framework is a necessary to better understand how a
tertiary education system works, including potential strengths and weaknesses that may directly impact
the operation of tertiary institutions.




                                                                                                           29
Governance

 GOVERNANCE: The tertiary education system has adequate structures, policies, and processes that
 enable tertiary education institutions to operate efficiently and effectively. At the central level, the
 tertiary education authority has staff and resources to implement reforms and to guide, support, and
 monitor tertiary education institutions.


Globally, the governance of tertiary systems has undergone major changes, with efforts to move away
from a top-down towards a bottom-up approach, from regulation to evaluation, and from strong
government regulation to a more open field ruled by market forces and competition among education
institutions. The extent to which these changes have been implemented and their outcomes vary greatly
from one country to another (Shin and Harman 2009).

The term “governance” broadly describes all the structures, processes, and activities involved in the
planning and direction of the institutions and people working in tertiary education (Fielden 2008). It is
important to emphasize that while a particular governance model is largely the result of cultural and
historical aspects of a given system, it is also an ongoing project that can be influenced by an intentional
regulatory framework. At the system level, governance is based on the laws established by the regulatory
framework, and results are the outcome of a series of structures, policies, and processes that enable
tertiary education institutions to operate —hopefully efficiently and effectively.

Two important clarifications are relevant at this point. First, while SABER-TE recognizes the importance
and unique dynamics of governance at the institutional level (such as the composition of governing boards
and the election of institutional authorities), the instrument is not designed to explore these dynamics in
detail, but rather, to focus on systemwide phenomena. Second, the SABER-TE framework is based on an
assumption that despite great variation in tertiary education systems from one country to another, it is
nonetheless possible to identify some key dimensions of governance policy. As mentioned above, a sound
governance structure is based on an adequate regulatory framework. Such a structure includes adequate
coordination among the various components of a diversified system, as well as adequate institutional
autonomy and accountability measures. Together, these components help a tertiary education system
more effectively meet national and local needs.

System coordination (articulation)
Tertiary education is an arrangement of different types of institutions that can be categorized according
to their different missions. The level of diversification of a tertiary education system can have a significant
impact on governance structures at the subsystem and institutional levels. Different subsystems and
institutions have different missions based on factors such as their stated function (for example, primarily
research-intensive, teaching-oriented institutions or focused on vocational and technical training),
institutional type (public or private), and the geographical contexts and constituencies they serve (Lester
2005; Hatakenaka 2008). One critical challenge of systemwide governance is the extent to which a tertiary
education system seeks to meet high level research goals as opposed to providing teaching and
educational access to a wide majority of people. This is of special importance in an initiative like SABER-
TE, given that many tertiary education institutions in LLMICs are not research intensive and may
historically be more oriented towards teaching and third-mission activities. A clear division of labor that
recognizes the unique role of different types of institutions in a tertiary education system is essential for
sound governance. Different institutional missions entail different goals and expected results. Funding,


                                                                                                            30
governance, and quality assurance mechanisms that take into account the unique structures and
imperatives of different types of institutions can help maximize their contribution to the system as a
whole.

A differentiated system also requires an enabling governance structure that facilitates articulation, or the
transition of students between different types of institutions. Articulation comprises mechanisms that
enable student mobility within the tertiary sector, such as academic credit accumulation and transfer,
recognition and equivalence of degrees, recognition of prior learning, and so forth. In policy and practice,
articulation has received far less attention than differentiation, even though almost all countries
acknowledge the need for articulation as necessary for both increasing the efficiency of the tertiary
education sector and enabling an array of a less fragmented labor force.

It is also essential to consider the tertiary education sector part of the continuum represented by the entire
educational system.

Because it involves multiple institutional actors, multiple subsets of the educational system, and
systemwide student information systems, engendering articulation is quite complicated. Ng’ethe,
Subotzky and Afeti (2008) identify a lack of cooperation and absence of dialogue between university and
nonuniversity institutional groups as two of the main deterrents to articulation. In contexts where
universities are under no obligation to articulate with nonuniversity institutions and there is no history of
inter-institutional cooperation, institutions may see articulation—even with their peers—as a threat to
their autonomy.

To promote the successful creation and implementation of articulation strategies, Ng’ethe, Subotzky, and
Afeti (2008) stress the need to promote and incentivize collaboration between universities and
nonuniversity institutions. Agencies charged with promoting quality standards and the accreditation of
tertiary education programs can likewise contribute significantly to improving articulation within the
tertiary education sector by implementing a National Qualifications Framework (NQF) or similar system.
Usually, a successful NQF specifies minimum credit requirements for different institutional levels, develops
generic descriptors, and implements instruments for measuring and classifying learning outcomes and
competences within a given framework. The implementation of an overarching national, regional (and
eventually, international) NQF does not imply the uniformization of courses, but rather, "the creation of
convergence in the recognition of achievement levels" (Ng’ethe, Subotzky, and Afeti 2008).

Articulation is a fundamental component of a sound integrated educational setting. Pathways fostering an
adequate flow of students from previous educational levels are the best way to foster more efficiency in
an entire educational system, and ultimately benefit tertiary education. Articulation with previous levels
of education can be achieved through a variety of activities ranging from a shared curriculum and faculty
to streamlining the admission process for secondary school graduates, just to mention a few.

Institutional autonomy
As tertiary education systems incorporate increasing numbers and types of public and private institutions
to accommodate a growing student population, old models of total control by a central ministry of
education or similar entity may prove unworkable with respect to academic freedom, human resource
policies, budget allocations, and public-private partnerships. Thus a major challenge of tertiary education
is supporting a governance framework that gives institutions a high degree of autonomy in managing their



                                                                                                           31
internal affairs, while remaining accountable to their constituencies, especially regarding the use of public
funds.

In many countries, tertiary education has been historically supported by public funding. However, fiscal
constraints of recent years have undermined many states’ financial capacity to further expand the public
tertiary education system while maintaining affordable access and satisfactory quality (Shin and Harman
2009). Other key roles of tertiary education, such as contributing to knowledge generation and innovation,
also suffer in a constrained fiscal environment because such functions are largely dependent on public
funds. In order to simultaneously increase participation rates and the quality of education, a more
diversified array of financial resources from both public and private resources is needed to support tertiary
education, including such arrangements as public-private partnerships (PPPs).

Just as there is no single ideal level tertiary education funding, there is no single ideal mix of public and
private funding sources. Different countries will need to find the most adequate balance for their particular
circumstances (Sondergaard et al. 2012). Among the range of possible strategies, in addition to allowing
institutions to charge tuition to students, are allowing public institutions to: 1) collect more revenue or
subsidy in return for enrolling more students; 2) generate funds through service-for-fee activities, such as
consulting; 3) retain any surplus from annual budgets and self-generated funds; 4) seek alumni or
corporate donations to constitute an endowment; and 5) purchase, own, and sell buildings, facilities, and
equipment.

Some of these strategies will be more feasible and productive in certain contexts than in others. In all
cases, it is critical that institutions be given sufficient autonomy to decide how best to allocate their own
funds. Facilitating or expanding the establishment of more private tertiary education institutions can also
be an important component of a diversification strategy. Where this is the case, it is crucial that an overall
quality assurance system be in place and that sufficient financial assistance funds (whether public or
private) made available to assist students in need.


Although the SABER-TE tool is designed to analyze a tertiary education system as a whole, rather than
individual tertiary education institutions, a related benchmarking tool developed by the World Bank
Group in conjunction with the Center for Mediterranean Integration is useful for evaluating the
governance of individual institutions. Known as the University Governance Score Card (UGSC), this
benchmarking tool has been successfully implemented in eight countries and more than 160 tertiary
education institutions in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, with plans for further
implementation in more countries within and beyond that region. Once data from different institutions
are gathered at the country level, it is possible to draw relevant conclusions at the national level that shed
light on the strengths and weaknesses of the governance of tertiary education as a whole. More
information about the UGSC is included in annex 2.

Finance

 FINANCE: Public financing is used to steer tertiary education toward envisioned systemwide goals.
 Private funding contributes to tertiary education as relevant and appropriate.


As highlighted in the section on governance, adequate financing mechanisms are essential to effectively
support the policy goals and objectives of a tertiary education system. For public universities especially,


                                                                                                           32
whose main source of funding is often the state, a national law may define the legal framework in which
these institutions operate. This law may go as far as determining institutional governance structures. For
private universities, the regulatory framework can govern entry into the system as well as accreditation
rules.

As the youth population continues to grow, the task of funding tertiary systems has become increasingly
difficult. Each country must search for financing approaches that enable it to meet the formidable
challenge of expanding access without sacrificing quality. In this environment, the way in which tertiary
education institutions are financed impacts their capacity to and incentives for achieving systemwide
goals, such as student access and completion rates, as well as the relevance of educational offerings for
development needs (Experton and Fevre 2010).

In addition to the diversification of revenue streams at the institutional level, incentive- or performance-
based funding and financial aid that offset the tertiary education costs of low-income populations have
been used to promote efficiency and equity as desirable tertiary outcomes. In the public sector, one of the
most effective policy instruments to steer institutions and improve their performance is the linking of
funding formulas to performance measures. Incentive-based funding involves the provision of funds to
institutions based on their success in meeting certain performance targets or their contribution to certain
systemwide goals.

In a comprehensive review of tertiary education funding allocation mechanisms, Salmi and Hauptman
(2006) find that linking institutional or student funding to performance measures can significantly help
tertiary education systems achieve the goals of improved equity, quality, and efficiency. First, the policy
allows governments to shift from line-item to outcome-based funding, thus giving institutions greater
autonomy in how they spend their budgets while increasing their accountability. Second, the flow of
information between institutions and central education authorities is improved, since government goals
must be clearly stated and accompanied by a list of indicators to be used as evidence of progress; the latter
are used to determine the extent to which different programs meet system goals. This greater emphasis
on planning and evaluation can help improve transparency at the system level; likewise, it can improve
efficiency in the management of institutions and individual programs, as these institutions periodically
assess what is and is not working (OECD 2007; Sondergaard et al. 2012).

It is important to stress that in order to achieve improved results, this type of policy must be carefully
designed, paying close attention to specific country circumstances and clearly stipulating a concrete
problem to target. The experience of several countries in introducing performance-based budgeting
suggests positive benefits when this condition is met. For example, as part of overall funding strategies,
Ontario’s Ministry of Training, Colleges, and Universities (MTCU) introduced the Multi-Year Accountability
Agreements (MYAAs). These agreements articulate the government goal for the system and the
responsibilities of individual institutions for meeting those goals. Recognizing that funding stability and
predictability enable public institutions to better meet government goals for the sector, the MYAAs provide
multiyear funding allocations for the three years covered by each agreement. Future funding for
participating institutions is partly based on the achievement of key performance indicators (KPIs), such as
student graduation, retention, and post-graduation employment rates; qualitative and quantitative
measures of participation on the part of target student populations (e.g. disabled, aboriginal, and First
Nations students); participation in the provincial Credit Transfer System; and registration in online
programs and work-integrated learning programs. Significantly, the KPIs are tailored to the circumstances
and mission of each institution and MYAA outcomes are reviewed on an annual basis, allowing for the
fine-tuning of targets and strategies for meeting postsecondary goals.

                                                                                                          33
With some exceptions private tertiary education institutions do not generally receive direct government
funding for core operations, although they can receive such support indirectly either through tax breaks
or having students who receive government-sponsored grants or loans. Although in many countries private
institutions can apply for and receive funding for scientific research, it is often the case that their research
facilities and success rates are inferior to those of public institutions. As a result, private institutions are
for the most part entirely self-funded via tuition fees. However, public resources can be used to influence
their behavior, such as by collecting and disseminating enrollment and graduation rates, as they may not
otherwise have formal reporting arrangements with the government (Sondergaard et al. 2012).

Given the high cost of education services at the tertiary level, sustainable financing, cost-effectiveness,
and returns to investments are all major concerns when expanding. In addition to using performance-
based allocation mechanisms and tapping diverse funding sources, cost-sharing schemes have been
introduced with varying degrees of success in China, Japan, Korea, the Philippines, Indonesia, Russia and
most of the other former Soviet republics, Brazil, Colombia, and many other countries in Latin America
(COREHEG 2010; World Bank 2011). In countries where free access to tertiary education has been
historically (and often constitutionally) a basic right, cost sharing can be a highly contested practice. For
example, in regions like Eastern Europe and Central Asia the introduction of fees while retaining the
principle of free tuition in public institutions has required a delicate political balance. In fact, cost sharing
often occurs via a “dual-track” method in which students deemed especially meritorious are not required
to pay, while a limited number of less meritorious applicants are allowed to enroll as fee-paying students
(Sondergaard et al. 2012; Johnstone 2004).

The relevant literature indicates that to be compatible with equity, cost sharing must be accompanied by
financial assistance policies and programs, implementation of programs to compensate for unequal
educational opportunities at the secondary level, and reforms in both curriculum and pedagogy
(Johnstone 2004). In Latin America, for example, high out-of-pocket costs and inadequate access to
financing are two leading factors responsible for low tertiary enrollment rates in the region (Murakami
and Blom 2008). While well-targeted loans are important to improve access to tertiary education, most
students from the poorest backgrounds require additional funding in the form of grants to be able to enroll
and, equally important, graduate from their chosen programs (Cerdan-Infantes and Blom 2007).

In addition to a series of qualitative questions, SABER-TE includes quantitative questions that assess the
level of investment of the public and private sector in tertiary education. These questions touch on
resource mobilization, resource allocation, resource utilization, equity, the incidence of public subsidies,
and the availability of financial aid.

The way in which tertiary education institutions are funded impacts the incentives of those institutions to
achieve certain systemwide goals. There is no one correct way to finance a tertiary education system.
Rather, the effectiveness of a financing strategy is measured by the degree to which financing and
monitoring align to promote national goals of completion, quality, relevance, and research generation.
When a financing strategy is misaligned, systemic issues such as lack of access by low-income groups,
excessive time to completion, low enrollment rates overall, and insufficient research generation may go
unresolved. Such a situation brings into question the cost efficiency of public investments in the system in
general.

It is difficult to conceptualize what an education finance system looks like and what its most important
parts are. Multiple actors are involved in financing education: national governments, state and/or local
governments, service delivery organizations (i.e., tertiary education institutions), students, banks, and

                                                                                                              34
private donors, among others. Despite this difficulty, financing systems are generally organized along three
main strands (box 2):
        1. Resource mobilization
        2. Resource allocation
        3. Resource utilization and equity

 Box 2. Dimensions of Tertiary Education Financing

 1        Resource mobilization
          Resource mobilization in the tertiary education context refers to the ability of the government to
          ensure adequate financial resources for institutional use. The key is not how funds are raised (i.e.,
          whether resources originate from public or private coffers), but that institutions have sufficient
          resources to reach systemwide goals regarding mass enrollment, quality programming, and research
          generation. SABER-TE Finance takes a baseline of the financial inputs into tertiary education from
          the perspective of national expenditure, student aid funding, per student expenditure, and
          expenditure targeted at research and development. By collecting data on these dimensions, it is
          possible to analyze the efficiency of a country’s tertiary system in comparison to those of other
          countries in achieving attainment, equity, and R&D outcomes.
 2        Resource allocation
          Every education finance system has informal and formal rules that determine the size of the budget
          for its tertiary sector?], the distribution of resources across levels of government and institutions,
          and in some cases, the level of spending among different inputs, such as capital and current needs.
          An important relationship measure is who defines performance (governments or tertiary
          institutions), what conditions are placed on receipt of public funds, and to what extent institutions
          must compete with other institutions for special funding for capital expenditures, research, or
          special programming.
          Many governments use a specific funding formula to determine the level of expenditure allocated
          to individual institutions, which generally balances the tension between fixed (block) and variable
          funding (per student/per credit). Block funds are allocated to institutions regardless of enrollment
          levels and ensure a stable source of funds year over year for institutional planning purposes. Per-
          student funds are allocated based on annual enrollment levels and typically vary depending on the
          type of student enrolled (i.e. whether a study is full- or part-time and the course of study he/she is
          pursuing—liberal arts are generally a low-cost course of study, whereas medical sciences are more
          expensive). The tension between fixed versus variable funding is important, as it has implications
          both for the degree to which governments can hold institutions accountable for performance and
          the degree of autonomy enjoyed by institutions.
 3        Resource utilization and equity
          Are available resources used in an efficient way within tertiary education institutions? In order to
          evaluate this question, indicators measuring the efficiency of the system in graduating students (in
          terms of time and cost) are taken into consideration. The way in which resources are utilized to

Quality of tertiary education

 QUALITY: Systematic, objective evidence demonstrates how well tertiary education systems meet
 specific and systemwide goals—especially whether they fulfill the value-added assumption that
 students graduate from tertiary education programs with more skills and knowledge than when they
 initially arrived.

Strong pressures to expand access prompt concerns about how to evaluate the quality of tertiary systems
that are growing in terms of both enrollments and the number and type of institutional offerings
(Alexander 2000; Brennan and Shah 2000; Jeliazkova and Westerheijden 2002). One important strategy
used towards this end is the creation of a government authority or independent agency charged with
overseeing institutional quality assurance (IQA) standards for postsecondary institutions and academic
programs. Compliance with IQA standards can play a significant role in determining the accreditation
status of an institution or, in the case of specialized accreditation, a program or unit within an institution.
In turn, accreditation is often a prerequisite to qualify for public and private funds, maintain legal
institutional status, as well as attract students and recruit qualified faculty.

In order to analyze the level of development of a tertiary education quality framework, a good approach
consists of reviewing its different components (table 2). As can be seen there, a traditional framework
emphasizes quality control, while a transitional one focuses on quality assurance. Ultimately, a sound
framework emphasizes quality enhancement.

The data collection instrument developed as part of SABER-TE is intended to collect relevant information
on the different elements summarized in table 2.

Another important aspect of quality assurance is the collection and dissemination of relevant data on
institutional outcomes and processes. However, this is one of the most difficult aspects of tertiary
education effectiveness to measure. Efforts to replicate internationally comparable metrics, such as those
of the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) or of the Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS), at the tertiary education level have been largely unsuccessful,
partly because it is incredibly difficult for a single instrument to account for the vast difference in skills,
competencies, and knowledge associated with different disciplines and fields of study in different contexts.

As tertiary education systems move towards greater decentralization and institutional autonomy,
monitoring progress towards institutional and systemwide goals is essential for quality assurance (Porta
and Arcia 2011). The implementation of a Tertiary Education Management Information System (TEMIS)
can be an important tool in this regard. Systematically gathering information about educational quality
proxies can help policy makers and other stakeholders evaluate progress and plan ahead. Such proxies
may include student enrollment, retention, and graduation rates; related entry and exit tests; insertion of
graduates into the labor market; and the value-added of attending a tertiary education institution.
Likewise, the systematic monitoring of graduates’ transition into the workforce is essential to evaluate the
relevance of tertiary education offerings to labor market needs. As noted earlier in this paper, without
measures such as exit surveys and tracer studies to establish the kinds of jobs that graduates find on the
labor market, institutions cannot accurately assess their own performance or respond to the changing
demand for skills (Sondergaard et al. 2012).

The availability of outcome data that reflect institutional performance and internal efficiency increase the
transparency of tertiary systems to the general public. In fact, such data often constitute the only
accountability mechanism that the central government has for informing society at large about the
performance of tertiary education institutions (Barrera et al. 2009). Providing public access to information
about specific programs (such as graduation rates, time to degree, average tuition and fees, and available
financial aid) can help students and parents make informed choices. Targeted programs such as ACCES
(Acceso con Calidad a la Educacion Superior, in Spanish) in Colombia show that even relatively small
investments in upgrading institutional information systems helps generate major benefits at the system
level. One of the goals of ACCES is to assist tertiary institutions in upgrading their information systems and
thereby provide students and their families with the information necessary to guide decisions on
institutions and career training. The program established standard indicators for reporting and helped
create a web-based system to facilitate collection of this information in a central database. These changes
led to more efficient, transparent, and effective institutions, as well as refined the allocation of student
assistance (Cerdan-Infantes and Blom 2007).

Data and analyses of such variables as access, retention, and achievement rates should be disaggregated
by gender, age, socioeconomic status, ethnicity, language, disability, and other characteristics relevant to
the context at hand. This information can enable institutions to design and implement targeted policies

                                                                                                            37
and programs to increase educational equity. In Costa Rica, for example, public universities are governed
by a Council of Rectors, which is responsible for system planning and development, including the collection
of information on student background and equity indicators. These data provide the basis for allocating
scholarships to underrepresented students (Bashir and Luque 2012).

Equitable access, retention, and success

 EQUITABLE ACCESS, RETENTION, AND SUCCESS: The tertiary education system is committed to
 contributing to a more just society by implementing concrete measures that promote equitable access
 by and the success of underserved and disadvantaged populations.


As mentioned in the section “Status of Tertiary Education,” young people from underprivileged groups
(defined by socioeconomic status, ethnicity, gender, language, age characteristics, culture, religion,
disability, or caste, depending on the context) in most countries face significant barriers to access and
successfully graduate from tertiary education. SABER-TE starts from the assumption that equity-
promotion policies, programs, and procedures (both at national and institutional level) are a sine qua non
of a strong efficient tertiary system. This assumption is reflected in the design of its data collection
instrument, which does not simply treat equity concerns as an isolated standalone category—an all too
common practice in research and policy worldwide. Rather, the equity component is embedded in the key
policy dimensions of student aid financing, the presence of a strong TEMIS, performance-based funding
to promote equity goals, and adequate articulation mechanisms.

The “Status of Tertiary Education” section noted that socioeconomic background is often the largest
determinant of whether a student has difficulty in completing tertiary education. Socioeconomic status,
along with additional factors such as ethnicity, gender, native language, and urban or rural residence, play
a significant role in tertiary attainment. An important equity goal, then, is to ensure that sufficient needs-
based financial aid is available to students from disadvantaged populations so as to facilitate their entry
and retention in tertiary education programs. The financial equity dimension of SABER-TE explores the
benefits incidence of public subsidies and the availability of financial aid for students.

A fully operational Tertiary Education Management Information System (TEMIS) is also essential for
monitoring a country’s progress towards access, retention, and graduation equity goals. For example, the
average tertiary dropout rates around the world oscillate between 30 and 60 percent, reflecting big
inefficiencies in the sector that have immense social and personal implications. Without a functioning
system to collect related data at the institutional and system levels, it is impossible to diagnose the extent
of the problem in a given context, much less decide on an appropriate course of action. In this regard,
questions regarding the collection of enrollment, dropout, and graduation rates; and the existence of
graduate tracer studies, “pathways” that facilitate the transfer of students from one type of institution to
another, and performance-based incentives that promote recruitment and retention of underserved
students are intended to provide a broad picture of a given country’s equity-related efforts.

To gain a useful, nuanced understanding of inequity patterns, indicators such as those included in SABER-
TE must be analyzed comprehensively and in relation to other policy domains, as well as to other sectors
of the educational system. For example, the academic readiness of high school students is closely
associated with both the successful access and retention of underprivileged students in tertiary education.
In fact, this criteria is as important to these two rates as the financial dimension mentioned above. The
gap between tertiary education eligibility and tertiary education readiness (most often measured through

                                                                                                           38
high school courses taken, grades, and standardized test scores) is a major impediment to increasing the
retention, graduation, and successful entry into the labor market of tertiary education students from
disadvantaged backgrounds. Substantial disconnects between P–12 and postsecondary education systems
in terms of curricula and learning expectations often mean that even those students who meet enrollment
proficiency standards may be underprepared to succeed in tertiary -level courses (SREB 2010).

Relevance of tertiary education for economic and social development

 RELEVANCE: The tertiary education policy environment supports research and development activities
 that respond to local conditions, resources, and needs, as well as an institutional orientation towards
 social development.

In addition to tracking educational and labor market outcomes, it is just as important to examine the
relevance of tertiary education to economic and social needs. For decades, the main focus of the
international development community, including much of the work of the World Bank Group, was primary
and secondary education. In the early 1970s, rates-of-return analyses legitimated the view that the bulk
of public investment should be allocated to primary and secondary education, the two sectors calculated
to generate the greatest societal benefits. In contrast, tertiary education (and university systems in
particular) was broadly considered as a luxury item offering primarily private returns to the individual, and
therefore a poor use of public resources (Robertson 2009).

However, since the 1990s a growing body of evidence has shown that returns to tertiary education have
been underestimated. In addition to contributing to economic development, tertiary institutions also
contribute substantial social, cultural, and environmental externalities. Such externalities include
nonmarket private benefits, such as improved health and welfare (for both individuals and their family
members), greater longevity, improved cognitive development in children, and reduced family size. More
broadly, evidence suggests that higher levels of learning contribute to nonmarket social benefits as varied
as poverty reduction, increased income equality, higher literacy rates, access to high-quality primary and
secondary education, civic participation, good governance, and the protection of human and
environmental rights (OECD 2012; McMahon and Oketch 2013; Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014;
McMahon 2009). While this type of contribution is rarely included in monitoring and evaluation exercises
it can be of great relevance in LLMICs (Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014).

By the same token, it is important to recognize the contribution of tertiary education to research and
development (R&D) activities that respond to local conditions, resources, and needs. In a knowledge-
based economy, research and technological innovation are important drivers of long-term economic
growth. In highly industrialized societies, industry and tertiary education institutions (TEIs) have long
developed complex relationships related to training, research, and high-technology innovation that are
now considered essential to economic development (Slaughter 1998; Torres and Schugurensky 2002). In
these contexts, the contribution of tertiary education to development is twofold. First, investment in
tertiary education–driven research can lead to profitable ventures, as knowledge developed in universities
and other tertiary institutions is translated into processes and products with practical value. Second, a
highly skilled workforce with tertiary credentials is a prerequisite for R&D because their skills are essential
in technology development, transfer, and application (Lucas 1988; Romer 1986, 1990).

One problem with this model of tertiary education and technological innovation is that successful
technology transfers only occur in a small portion of top research universities, in a few fields, and in a few
countries (Chakrabarti and Santoro 2004; Johnson 2007; Turk-Bicakci and Brint 2005). Because the model

                                                                                                            39
is largely based on observations of higher-income countries, it reflects a number of assumptions that may
not hold in most LLMICs. For example, some traditional ways to measure the R&D contribution of tertiary
institutions include the number of patents registered by universities and the volume of product licensing,
yet both practices require considerable financial investment from the institutions. Further, the type of
basic research associated with scientific breakthroughs relies on massive public investment with no
guarantee that the results will lead to marketable technological outputs. The OECD calculates that building
and sustaining a world-class university is roughly a 1.5 billion dollar business annually—a cost that few
national economies, let alone individual universities, can afford (Ischinger and Puukka 2009). The amount
of investment required presents a significant barrier to lower-income countries that may not have the
financial resources or institutional capacity either to fund adequate research programs or to
commercialize their outcomes (Oketch, McCowan, and Schendel 2014).

In other words, when mobilizing tertiary education to support innovation and technological
competitiveness, context is key. In some LLMICs, it may be unrealistic to expect all tertiary institutions to
be at the cutting-edge of R&D infrastructure, capabilities, and production. Moreover, innovation that is
based on imitation and adaptation (especially from research-intensive universities in highly industrialized
countries) is often inadequate to solve the very context-specific problems of LLMIC cities and regions. The
most relevant goals for many LLMICs, then, may not be getting TEIs to focus on creating new technology,
but rather to purposefully apply existing technologies to suit domestic needs.

Nusche (2008) identifies four systemwide factors that encourage institutions of higher learning to
contribute to regional economic development: an explicit orientation of public policy toward this goal;
adequate incentives for regional engagement; institutional autonomy and leadership; and improved
capacity of local and regional actors to determine the strategic direction of higher education institutions.
These findings suggest a need for the state to establish an appropriate governance framework that actively
promotes and supports this type of activity. Likewise, there is a need to systematically monitor and foster
this activity by using appropriate incentive mechanisms for institutions, communities, and individuals.

Tertiary education builds on secondary education by providing learning activities in specialized fields of
study.

It aims to impart learning at a high level of complexity and specialization. Tertiary education includes what
is commonly understood as academic education, but also includes advanced vocational or professional
education. It comprises ISCED levels 5, 6, 7 and 8, labelled respectively as short-cycle tertiary education,
bachelor’s or equivalent level, master’s or equivalent level, and doctoral or equivalent level. The content
of programs at the tertiary level is more complex and advanced than a lower ISCED levels.

     The Systems Approach for Better Education Results (SABER) initiative collects data on
     the policies and institutions of education systems around the world and benchmarks
     them against practices associated with student learning. SABER aims to give all parties
     with a stake in educational results—from students, administrators, teachers, and
     parents to policymakers, business people and political leaders—an accessible,
     detailed, objective snapshot of how well the policies of their country’s education
     system are oriented toward delivering learning for all children and youth.

     This report focuses specifically on policies for Equity and Inclusion in Education
     Systems.
