Executive Summary
This report has been completed to explore the use of output-based aid (OBA) as a financing
mechanism to support the development and operation of small-scale irrigation schemes in
developing countries. The specific objectives of the report were to:
   1. Evaluate the scope for OBA in financing small-scale irrigation schemes to support
      poor farmers in developing countries.
   2. Propose project design and implementation arrangements, based on real-world
      examples, to support sustainable small scale irrigation schemes benefiting from OBA,
      either under public or private management.
The aim is being to provide recommendations on the appropriate next steps for using OBA
subsidies to support the implementation of projects in the irrigation sector.

ES.1 Scope for OBA in financing small-scale irrigation schemes
Based on desk-based research of the irrigation sectors in a sample of five countries: Ghana,
Kenya and Zambia in Sub Saharan Africa (SSA); and Bangladesh and India (focused on the
lagging States of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa) in South Asia we have evaluated the scope to
use OBA to support irrigation schemes effectively.
Our overall assessment is that there is an important role for OBA to fill in helping to address
financing gaps in both South Asia and SSA. Effectively designed OBA projects could play a
role in addressing these investment needs; however there are some important general
concerns that will need to be considered in the design of any potential OBA project:
      Given the difficulties experienced in charging smallholders ISC at a level required to
       cover O&M costs, an important part of OBA project design in the sector will be the
       associated technical assistance program s that build demand amongst local farmers
       to the extent that they are willing to pay for the improved services provided by the
       project.
      Sustainable OBA projects in the sector will need to be located in areas which provide
       access to functional markets. There may be occasions in which trade-offs have to be
       made between projects which target the poorest smallholder farmers and those
       which target poor farmers based in areas which have access to markets to help
       ensure that the irrigation project is more sustainable.
      It will be important to gain firm commitment from potential host country/ state
       government’s given the political nature of irrigation, particularly in India.
      There are also notable risks in linking subsidy disbursements to farm productivity
       related outputs, as the private sector may not have appetite for such risks, even
       though such outputs may be a truer reflection of the OBA concept.



                                                                                            vii
      The design of OBA subsidies will need to take account of the potential difficulties
       involved in measuring the delivery of irrigation services to smallholders and of the
       technical difficulty of excluding non-participating farmers from accessing certain
       types of irrigation scheme.

ES.2 Project opportunities that could benefit from OBA support
In the second part of the report we carried out in-country consultations in both India and
Zambia to identify and evaluate projects that would have the potential to be supported by
OBA funds. We have summarised the project opportunities in the table on the following
page (more detail on indicative project structures can be found in the main report).
We reviewed the option of using market based approaches to supply farmers with micro-
irrigation technology and of supporting farmers to construct rainwater harvesting ponds (we
have classified these as small-scale opportunities). The analysis suggests that both of these
options would be good candidates for support using OBA funds. Both of these approaches:
      have been shown to be successful at targeting large numbers of poor smallholder
       farmers in the SSA and South Asia;
      are relatively efficient in terms of costs per beneficiary and have the scope to
       increase poor farmers’ incomes; and
      have limited/no involvement from government institutions so there is less
       complexity in seeking to implement projects.
We also looked at different options that make use of large-scale irrigation schemes to
provide irrigation to smallholder farmers; the IMIP approach that is currently specific to
India and the different commercial hub-outgrower models that are being developed in
Zambia and across SSA. While both of these projects provide an opportunity to increase
smallholder farmers’ access to irrigation in our view they are less well suited to the OBA
financing approach than the small-scale projects. In particular the indicative cost per
beneficiary is quite high and both projects would involve quite complicated implementation
arrangements. Based on the recent experience of the implementation of larger-scale
projects in either South Asia or SSA, it will take much longer than the five-year timeframe
typical for an OBA supported project to implement a sustainable project.
In summary our recommendations and next steps are as follows:
      We judge that the options of using OBA subsidies to support the market-based
       approaches and the rainwater harvesting schemes both provide the most promising
       opportunities to support the extension of irrigation services to smallholder farmers.
      Follow up is required with institutions such as IDEI and Kickstart to develop project
       proposals in more detail and then assess the potential for them to pre-finance the
       projects and take on the risks associated with tying the release of grant funds to the
       achievement of pre-defined outputs.

                                                                                          viii
   In addition these discussions should explore further the scope to link OBA subsidy
    disbursements to verification that the farmers accessing the irrigation technology
    have actually achieved productivity improvements. These discussions will need to
    explore the private sector firm’s appetite to take on these risks given that they do
    not necessarily have control over the effectiveness with which farmers use the
    irrigation equipment.
   Support for larger-scale project opportunities, in our view, will require GPOBA to be
    involved with the projects for a much longer time horizon than is typically covered
    by an OBA supported project.

Report Structure
This report provides a review of the scope to apply Output Based Aid (OBA) subsidies to
support the provision of irrigation to small scale farmers and then identifies specific project
opportunities in the sector and evaluates how OBA subsidies could be used in each instance.
The report is structured as follows:
      Part 1 Desk-based review of irrigation markets in selected countries.
           o Section 1 provides an introduction to the report. It describes the report’s
             objectives and the scope of the report.
           o Section 2 introduces the concept of OBA. It explains how the OBA financing
             concept works and describes the different types of subsidy that have been
             used in OBA financed projects.
           o Section 3 summarises the findings from our desk-based research on the
             different types of irrigation scheme and policy environment in selected
             countries and provides a qualitative assessment of the scope for applying
             OBA subsidies in the sector.
      Part 2 Market assessment
           o Sections 4 and 5 describes the type of project opportunities that could be
             supported by OBA funds identified during our in-country consultations in
             India and Zambia and provides a qualitative assessment of the benefits and
             risks involved.
      Part 3 Recommendations
           o Section 6 presents recommendations on how OBA could be used to support
             opportunities in the sector and our views on the next steps for the GPOBA.
The main report is accompanied by the following annexes:
      Annex A: PPP irrigation model user guide. Alongside the completion of this report,
       we have completed a model that can be used as an appraisal tool to evaluate the
       costs and benefits involved in applying OBA funds to support a project. The
       appraisal tool includes an example of a hypothetical PPP irrigation scheme, the
       annex provides an explanation of the assumptions included in the model and a step-
       by-step guide on how to use the appraisal tool.
      Annex B: OBA case studies. This annex provides an overview of how OBA subsidies
       have been used across different sectors together with some detailed case studies on
       projects that have applied OBA subsidies.

Introduction
The purpose of this report is to explore the use of Output Based Aid (OBA) as a financing
mechanism to support the development and operation of small-scale irrigation schemes in
developing countries.

Objective of the assignment
CEPA has been commissioned to complete an analysis designed to inform the World Bank’s
understanding of the scope to apply OBA grants to support the increased provision of
irrigation services to smallholder farmers. The specific objectives of the report are to:
      Evaluate the scope for OBA in financing small-scale irrigation schemes to support
       poor farmers in developing countries.
      Propose project design and implementation arrangements, based on real-world
       examples, to support sustainable small scale irrigation schemes benefiting from OBA,
       either under public or private management.
The aim is being to provide the GPOBA with recommendations on the appropriate strategy
for using OBA subsidies to support the implementation of irrigation projects.
The analysis also includes a tool that can be used to carry out a financial and economic
appraisal of the potential OBA subsidies.

Scope of the report and key definitions
We state up-front some important parameters that provide focus to the report.

Scale of irrigation schemes under consideration
The definition of a ‘small-scale’ irrigation scheme can vary from country to country;
therefore it is useful to define what is meant by a small-scale scheme for the purposes of
this study.
A review of the GPOBA portfolio of projects indicates that it has provided OBA subsidies in
the range of $1m - $13m, with a typical project receiving $5m - $10m. We have therefore
focused on irrigation projects that could utilise an OBA subsidy within this range that would
benefit smallholder farmers/ the poor with improved and/ or more affordable access to
irrigation services.
Given the potential size of the subsidy under consideration this suggests that we are not
only looking at small irrigation schemes, which particularly in the Sub Saharan African (SSA)
context would, individually, often be too small for support from an OBA grant, but at larger-
scale schemes that primarily serve the needs of small scale farmers. We are also looking at
the potential for OBA support for irrigation facilities operated by individual small-holder

farmers or by small groups of such small holders.1 Typically such a facility is a pump
extracting water from a well or river to serve a small patch of land. To be feasible for OBA,
such farmer facilities would need to be addressed in some numbers, possibly via equipment
dealers or a facilitating agency such as an NGO.

Regional/ country focus of the assignment
The assignment has focused on reviewing irrigation schemes in the SSA and South Asia
regions, in line with GPOBA’s funding priorities. Focusing on these two regions is i nteresting
because of the different policy and operating environments found in each, as well as the
fact that both are at quite different levels of development with respect to the irrigation
sector and so should enable the report to identify different types of project opportunities
that could be supported by OBA grants.2
In SSA irrigation does not currently play a significant role in the agricultural sector. Only
approximately 3.5% of agricultural land in the region is equipped for irrigation, covering only
seven million hectares (ha) out of a total cultivated area of 197 million ha. 3 Of this around
five million ha (75%) is actually irrigated.4 Overall, despite the variable and in many regions
insufficient nature of rainfall and the prevalence of droughts, food production in SSA
remains almost entirely rain-fed, therefore we expect that the opportunities in the region
need to focus on extending the coverage of irrigation schemes.
In contrast the South Asia5 region is one of the most heavily irrigated in the world with
around 93 million ha of land currently equipped for irrigation, representing 46% of the total
cultivated land.6 Against a landscape of growing water scarcity, volatile cereal prices and
limited potential for further irrigation expansion in the region, focus is now increasingly
shifting towards improving water management and control, increasing agricultural
productivity and facilitating diversification to higher-valued crops. As such there is less focus
on extending irrigation and more on the need to improve technology and management to
raise the efficiency of existing schemes and to manage water resources more equitably and
sustainably.
While the two regions are different in terms of the current level of coverage and efficiency
of irrigation schemes, they both suffer from issues surrounding the performance of the
government institutions responsible for irrigation supply services; and the willingness and

  According to the World Bank poverty rates (measured as the proportion of population on $1.25 or less a day)
in SSA were 48.5% in 2010 and 31% in South Asia. This compares to the next highest region, East Asia, which
had a poverty rate of 12.5%.

ability of smallholder farmers to pay for irrigation services given perceptions amongst some
farmers that they should not have to pay for irrigation combined with affordability
constraints. These issues are important when determining how OBA could be applied
effectively in the irrigation sector.




Introduction to OBA
This section provides an overview of what the OBA financing approach is; describes how it
has been used in different infrastructure sectors, supported with some case studies; and
highlights the key lessons that could help to shape the application of OBA subsidies in the
irrigation sector.

What is OBA?
OBA is a Results Based Financing approach used to increase access to basic infrastructure
services for the poor in developing countries. It was introduced by the World Bank in 2002
as part of its Private Sector Development Strategy, and more formally in January 2003, when
the GPOBA was launched: GPOBA’s objective is to mainstream the use of OBA within the
strategies of the IDA and other development partners.7
OBA subsidies seek to increase the level of transparency with which development funds are
used by explicitly linking the release of funds to the achievement of pre-determined
outputs. The application of OBA also aims to give service providers an enduring incentive to
deliver an acceptable level of service performance to poorer consumers. These are
customers they would otherwise not target due to the inability of those customers to afford
the service.
The key features of the OBA approach include:
          Explicit targeting of the subsidy to ensure that the funds for investment are directed
           towards the poor for ‘last mile’ access/connection to public utility services (OBA is
           not designed to fund term investments in on-farm capital purchases such as
           machinery, but connection to a water service through a pump and small network
           distribution (such as drip lines) can be included).
          Third-party contracting for service delivery. Service-providers are paid the subsidy to
           complement or replace user fees that the recipients of the services would otherwise
           be unable to afford. OBA subsidies are thus explicitly based on an estimate of the
           ability / willingness to pay.

       Linking the aid disbursement to the delivery of outputs that are associated with the
        use of basic services by the targeted poor consumers. Service-providers are meant
        to pre-finance the project until output delivery.
       Independent verification to ensure that funds are paid following service / output
        delivery to the specified group of beneficiaries.
The OBA financing approach sits within a range of Results Based Financing methods that
have been applied to improve the way in which development funds support infrastructure
development. Other approaches include: Performance Based Financing, the Programme for
Results Financing (PforR) and Conditional Cash Transfers. Section 3 of this annex provides
more detail on how OBA compares to other types of Results Based Financing; however it is
worth setting out the following characteristics that distinguish OBA as stated in GPOBA and
World Bank reports:8, 9
       The project outputs are defined as closely to the desired outcome or impact as
        contractually feasible.
       Disbursement of funding is linked to the achievement of clearly specified results
        which directly support access to basic services by targeted poor people.
       The subsidy seeks to complement private sector financing, or leverage such financing
        to enable infrastructure services to be extended to poor consumers in circumstances
        where they would otherwise be too poor to pay the full cost.

What types of OBA subsidy have been employed?
The main types of OBA subsidy provided to support projects include the following:
       One-off capital subsidies: the most common application of OBA schemes involving
        the provision of an one-off subsidy to help service providers buy-down the capital
        costs required to supply consumers; usually by buying down the cost of constructing
        infrastructure or the costs related to extending access to infrastructure thus helping
        to reduce the connection fees that users have to pay to access the service. In a
        model example, the service provider would pre-finance the up-front investment, and
        receive the subsidy after the targeted beneficiaries are able to access the service,
        with the access being independently verified. The approach has typically be used in
        network industries to fund projects that aim to increase the number of individuals
        with access to an utility service such as water and electricity.
       Ongoing subsidies: Another form of OBA subsidy provided is the ongoing subsidy. As
        the name suggests this subsidy is provided continuously and is used where there is

           judged to be an enduring gap between what poorer consumers can pay for a service
           and the tariff price required for the provider to recover its costs. Subsidies of this
           nature are often used to support the increased provision of basic infrastructure
           services such as roads, health and education. For example, continued access to care
           for the poor often requires OBA health schemes to provide ongoing subsidies to
           healthcare providers, as they continue to deliver agreed services over a defined
           period. Another example is when ongoing subsidies are provided to fund ongoing
           road maintenance over the life of a road.
          Transitional subsidies: are used to support tariff reforms, covering the difference
           between what the user is willing/ able to pay and the cost-recovery level of the
           tariff. The subsidy is transitioned out over a specified period of time, as the user
           contributions increase and/ or the tariff required to recover costs falls as the service
           provider achieves efficiency gains. This approach of providing OBA subsidies has
           been provided in only a few instances, potentially reflecting the associated risks such
           as the potential for the provider to become dependent on the funds and the
           transitional subsidy turn into an ongoing one. An example where this approach has
           been applied is the transitional subsidy that was used to improve access to high-
           quality solid waste management services in Nepal.10

Conclusions and summary
This Section has provided a brief introduction to the OBA concept, describing the principles
that guide the use of OBA and the different types of OBA subsidies that have been
disbursed.
In Annex B we have reviewed a number of case studies where OBA subsidies have been
employed to support project development, to help us identify the key lessons/ factors
required for the successful implementation of OBA projects to the irrigation sector. These
include:
          The existence / capacity of supporting institutions to facilitate the effective
           implementation of an OBA program.
          The practicality of targeting defined beneficiary groups with certain types of
           irrigation technology.
          The extent to which controllable performance risk can be specified and incorporated
           into a project.
          The ability of the project to manage demand-side risks, which in the context of the
           irrigation sector has been a particular issue given the inability/ reluctance of farmers
           in both SSA and South Asia to pay for irrigations services in certain contexts.

Desk-based review of irrigation markets in SSA and South
Asia
Introduction
This section summarises the outputs of desk-based reviews of the irrigation sectors in a
sample of countries in the SSA and South Asia regions. The objective is to provide an
overview of the different types of irrigation scheme and the policy environment for
irrigation in each of the sample of countries; and then to provide an assessment of the
suitability of the policy and operating environment for the provision of OBA subsidies.

Choice of countries for analysis
For the desk-based review, we have focused on the following five countries within the SSA
and South Asian regions. These countries were chosen because they give good coverage
across the two regions and to take advantage of the existing knowledge-base on relevant
sources of publicly-available information, given the difficulty in sourcing up-to-date
evidence on the irrigation sector.
        Ghana.
        Kenya.
        Zambia.
        Bangladesh.
        India (focused on the lagging States of Madhya Pradesh and Orissa).11

Overview of the irrigation schemes and policy environment
For each of the five countries we have tried to identify the following information:
        Categorise the different types of scheme that exist in the different markets
         (considering the involvement of smallholders, size, type of technology, crops
         supported etc.).
        Discuss the existing governance arrangements for the different types of scheme.
        Review the policy environment surrounding the irrigation sector, describing the
         policy with regard to Irrigation Service Charges (ISCs); the key institutions involved in
         implementing irrigation policy; and highlighting any interesting government/
         development partner funded developments in the sector.

   The ‘Lagging States’ are States in India that have been defined by DFID as being amongst the poorest States
in India (Madhya Pradesh, Orissa, Bihar and West Bengal). These States are the primary areas of focus for
DFID’s support to India.

Assessment of the policy and operational environment
Using desk-based research we provide a qualitative assessment of the suitability of the
policy and operating environment for the provision of OBA grants in the countries that we
have reviewed. The analysis is intended to help identify issues that need to be discussed
with policy makers/ potential investors before proceeding to give consideration as to how
the OBA approach may need to be adapted to fit the needs of the sector.
To help with this assessment we reviewed the GPOBA Diagnostic Tool report, which
provides guidance on the factors to be considered when determining whether a sector
could benefit from OBA support.12 The diagnostic tool sets out requirements, split into
institutional capacity and financial criteria, which should be met to satisfy the necessary
conditions for OBA. We focus on the following criteria:
          Sector fit. The government should support the use of OBA in the sector and it
           should be consistent with the sector’s priorities, e.g. is the govern ment committed
           to invest the time/ resources necessary to support implementation of the scheme; is
           there an institution/ individual within the government that is willing and able to help
           champion the use of OBA within the sector?
          Monitoring and evaluation. Does the government have the capacity to manage an
           OBA contract? It should be possible to establish an effective monitoring and
           evaluation process, including the potential to use an independent institution to
           verify the delivery of the pre-specified outputs.
          Sector financial sustainability. The sector should have some level of financial
           sustainability with tariffs in place that cover a significant proportion, if not all, of the
           operational and maintenance costs associated with the project.
          Subsidies and grants. It must be acceptable/ practical to provide subsidies in the
           given sector and it must be possible to provide explicit, targeted and performance
           based subsidies.
In addition to the above four criteria, the OBA diagnostic tool also includes the following
two criteria:
          Capacity of the service provider. The potential service providers must have the
           technical, managerial and financial skills necessary to manage the requirements
           associated with the potential OBA subsidy. Do service providers in the sector have
           an established track-record of delivering successful projects? Do they understand
           what is entailed within an OBA scheme?
          Pre-financing capacity. The service providers in the sector must have some capacity
           to pre-finance the required investments. This also includes the requirement that

       mechanisms should be available that enable the service provider to pre-finance
       investments before the disbursement of the OBA.
We have not considered these last two criteria at this stage of the assessment because they
are more suitable for consideration when looking at the specific project-level opportunities
set out in the market assessment part of the report.

Assessment against criteria
We consider the selected countries/ states against the selected criteria below.

Sector fit
As part of a limited scope desk-based assignment, we have not had a chance to discuss with
the respective governments their level of support for the use of OBA to increase the
provision of irrigation to smallholders. Instead we have taken a view based on the extent to
which we judge that the policy environment within the countries is in-line with the OBA
financing approach.
Overall, with the possible exception of India (though this varies by State) the governments in
each of the five countries that we have reviewed are, at least in terms of stated government
policies, supportive of/ actively implementing policies designed to attract more private
sector investment in the provision of irrigation services to smallholder farmers and are
implementing reforms that are consistent with OBA principles.
In India, while Central Government is supportive of making use of more innovative
approaches to secure the provision of irrigation to smallholder farmers, the individual State
governments have responsibility for implementing policies in the sector. At State level the
provision of irrigation to smallholders is a highly political issue and attention has focused on
the implementation of subsidy schemes rather than on the reforms to improve the
efficiency of the sector. In general, there are issues with the way in which the subsidies
have been implemented, particularly with the level of transparency around the allocation of
funds to support smallholder farmers. There are thus reasonable concerns about the ability
of State level institutions to commit to supporting the implementation of an OBA financed
project, which rely on the transparent release of funds based on the achievement of pre-
defined outputs.
This suggests that, in India, it would be particularly important to get firm commitment and
ownership from the State governments before trying to proceed with any OBA project in the
irrigation sector; or alternatively adopt project approaches which only need limited State
government involvement, such as providing suppliers with incentives to sell certain types of
irrigation equipment to specific target groups.
An additional concern, particularly with regards to the SSA countries, is the number of
government institutions that hold important policy responsibilities in the sector. This can
often lead to bureaucracy and inter-departmental disputes that cause delays in project

                                                                                             17
implementation. One potential way to address this concern is to work with government to
establish a project taskforce that is given delegated responsibilities for a particular project.
For instance, the progress of the Irrigation Development and Support Project (IDSP) in
Zambia has been helped by the formation of a project level taskforce that has the mandate
to take the project forward. This has created a centralised body with the clear mandate, and
responsibility to make progress with the implementation of the irrigation projects. This is
useful because stakeholders have a clear institutional point of reference to which they can
refer if any issues arise.
More generally as part of the sector assessment we have also considered the ease of doing
business in the agribusiness sectors of the countries that we have covered.
For Ghana, Kenya and Zambia countries the World Bank have completed a series of studies
that assess the ease of doing business in the agribusiness sectors, while these studies do not
cover specifically the irrigation sector they provide some useful overview of the availability
and cost of finance for agribusiness and the overall policy and regulatory environment for
the sector. We summarise the key points from the analysis in the table below.

Source: World Bank Agribusiness Indicators, Central Banks of Ghana, Kenya and Zambia
In all three SSA countries, while the policy and regulatory environment is broadly conducive,
the cost and availability of finance for agribusinesses is a significant constraint to private
sector development. For instance, in Zambia, although the agricultural sector gets a higher
proportion of bank lending than in Ghana or Kenya, most of that lending is restricted to
large commercial farms. As a result a large proportion of the agribusiness sector rely on
informal financing or retained earnings rather than banks. In Zambia banks also do not lend
in general to greenfield investments in the agricultural sector.
In the context of OBA this is potentially an issue because the lack of available and affordable
credit could limit the ability of potential service providers to pre-finance their investments.
The development of an OBA project in these regions would most probably need some
consideration to be given to how to support the private sector to pre-finance the project;
for instance on the Microfinance for Community Managed Water Projects OBA project in
Kenya, a local bank – K-Rep was directly involved in the implementation of the scheme to
help finance the project.
We have not been able to access detailed assessments of the business environment for
agribusinesses in either Bangladesh or India; however, the more general World Bank Doing
Business indictors for both countries suggest that the agribusiness business environment
will be challenging. India and Bangladesh are ranked 134th and 130th out of 189 nations,
which is worse than Ghana (ranked 67th), Zambia (ranked 83rd) and Kenya (ranked 129th).13
Particular issues raised for both India and Bangladesh include difficulties in the enforcement
of contracts and getting an electricity supply. Not discounting the importance of these
issues, in our view it emphasises the importance of designing an effective OBA project in the
irrigation sector, rather than suggesting that it is not possible to develop an OBA irrigation
project in the regions that we have reviewed in this report.

Monitoring and evaluation
An important requirement for OBA is the existence of institutions that have the capacity to
manage OBA contracts effectively. Based on our research there are concerns about the
capacity of some of the relevant government institutions to do so.
For instance the institutions responsible for managing irrigation in SSA such as the Ghana
Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA) and the National Irrigation Board (NIB) in Kenya
are reported to suffer from considerable capacity constraints. In the case of GIDA it is
reported that the institution is primarily staffed by engineers, and thus lacks the range of
individuals with the agronomic, financial and policy making skills necessary for the
sustainable and profitable operation and maintenance of the infrastructure.14 According to
Ministry of Food and Agriculture’s (MOFA) 2011 Irrigation Policy and Strategy document,

     MOFA (2011), Irrigation Policy and Strategy.

                                                                                            19
“GIDA's limited human and financial resources have severely compromised the extent and
quality of delivery while further constraining both the development and productivity of the
formal sub-sector”.
Similar to the case in SSA, South Asian institutions generally have limited financial resources
and weak institutional frameworks. There are some exceptions to this such as the Local
Government Engineering Department (LGED) in Bangladesh which is responsible for water
resources management, and developing “small-scale” water resource projects for areas
under 1,000 ha. The LGED has been quite successful in securing the services of technical
specialists, and has built a reputation as an efficient project implementation agency.
Overall, our desk-based research suggests that it will be necessary to provide technical
support to the government agencies responsible for irrigation to facilitate the establishment
of an effective monitoring and evaluation framework. Alternatively, OBA projects should
target projects where the partner institutions come from existing NGOs/ private companies.
Across all five countries that we have reviewed there are a number of NGOs/ private
companies that have been involved in implementing projects funded by development
partners.

Sector financial sustainability
Across all of the five countries there are significant concerns around the level of financial
sustainability of the provision of irrigation services to smallholders.
In each country that we have looked at, despite the existence of written government
policies that are seemingly consistent with the application of charges for irrigation services
that cover O&M costs, the ISC for public irrigation schemes does not cover a significant
proportion of O&M costs, let alone allow for the recovery of up-front capital costs. In
addition, all of the countries have encountered significant problems in collecting fees from
farmers. For instance, in India the ISC is estimated to cover barely 20% of O&M costs, while
in Ghana the collection rates are estimated to be in range of 45% - 65%, and in Bangladesh
collection rates were estimated to be in the range of just 3 to 10%.15
The end result of this is that schemes are effectively reliant on ongoing subsidies from
government to fund O&M, which is not a sustainable source of funds for the irrigation
schemes. Governments have typically been unable to continue to subsidize the costs
required to maintain the quality of the infrastructure for irrigation services, causing
publically operated schemes to get into, what has been characterized in a number of reports
as, the ‘build-neglect-repair-neglect’ cycle.16
In combination with the issues with the implementation of the ISC there are underlying
concerns about smallholders’ willingness and ability to pay for irrigation services. From the
farmers’ perspective, using their limited spare capital to pay for irrigation is quite a risky

investment, unless they have the capacity to both apply the farming techniques and invest
in complimentary inputs (such as fertilizer and improved seeds) necessary to generate yield
improvements; and also have the access to markets necessary to realize an increased level
of income from their additional production.
The policy environment can also contribute to an unwillingness to pay for irrigation
provided by public schemes. Once government has invested its own resources in a scheme,
farmers think that maintenance of the scheme is also the responsibility of government. This
attitude can be reinforced by politicians who identify farmers as a vote bank and talk of
access to irrigation as being a social necessity. Local authorities responsible for scheme
operation and maintenance can also be discouraged from seeking to recover cost from
farmers if central government or overseas donors are willing to fund periodic rehabilitation -
which may not only cover arrears in maintenance, but in addition provide resources for
major up-grading and expansion.
These issues imply that an important part of any OBA program will be an effective technical
assistance program that can build demand amongst local farmers for the irrigation services
and come to some arrangement to ensure the sustainability of these services. This would
need to provide farmers with the technical support necessary to enable them to make
effective use of the irrigation services; on the farming practices that would help them to
increase their yields; and on the skills necessary to enable them to market their produce
effectively.
Irrigation projects are self-contained investments which are linked solely to the local off-
take, i.e. the viability of agricultural activities using the water. Hence the technical
assistance programs will need to ensure that the farmers targeted by the OBA project have
the capacity to increase the productivity of their farming practices to the extent that they
have the potential to gain a return on their investment in irrigation services.
In addition sustainable OBA projects in the sector will need to be located in areas which
provide access to functional markets. The Africa Infrastructure Country Diagnostic (AICD)
(2008) carried out an assessment of the scope for financially viable investments in irrigation
in SSA and found that a key criterion for viable investment is that the irrigation scheme be
located within five hours trucking time to a major city, to ensure that the farmers have a
reasonably nearby market in which their goods can be sold. The choice of potential OBA
projects will need to take this into account, as a result, there may be occasions in which
trade-offs have to be made between projects which target the poorest smallholder farmers
and those which target poor farmers based in area, which have access to markets.
Without appropriate access to markets there is limited potential to implement a sustainable
OBA project in the irrigation sector – the specific project designs presented in the market
assessment part of the work provide examples of how this component of the projects would
need to operate. The approach would differ, amongst other things, depending on the scale
of the scheme, technology employed and the location of the project.

                                                                                           21
Subsidies and grants
We have found nothing from our desk-based research that suggests that it is not possible to
apply grants and subsidies in the countries respective irrigation sectors. However, given the
technical nature of the sector it will be a challenge to design grants that are explicit,
targeted and performance based given the difficulties in measuring the performance of
irrigation schemes. Provision of irrigation facilities are of little use unless they actually
provide water and that water is then used to increase crop production on a sustainable
basis. Unlike a system that supplies domestic water to homes, it is costly and time
consuming to try to measure the amount of water that has been used by individual
smallholder farmers served by a formal irrigation scheme. Moreover delivery of a certain
volume of water is not the only indicator of system performance, as the need for water will
vary with seasons and the type of crops grown.
Furthermore the ability to apply targeted subsidies is dependent on the nature of the
technology employed on the irrigation scheme. It is possible to assign defined property
rights for specific types of micro-irrigation technology such as tubewells and pumps (hence a
market has developed to serve individual farmer’s needs in the five count ries covered). It is
much more difficult and expensive to exclude potential users on large-scale schemes, such
as flow irrigation schemes, as it is usually necessary to develop projects that cover all of a
specific geographic area, with everyone who owns land in this area having access to water.

Summary assessment
In the table below we present an assessment of the suitability of the irrigation for OBA
against the four criteria considered. We have used the Red, Amber, Green (RAG)
assessment approach that is used in the Diagnostic Tool, and set out potential mitigations.
Overall, our assessment is that there is scope to apply OBA to support the provision of
irrigation to smallholders, but our desk-based analysis has identified some important
concerns that will have to be addressed appropriately when designing potential projects. In
particular, it is imperative that any project is designed alongside an effective technical
assistance programme that builds farmers demand/ willingness to pay for irrigation services
by ensuring that the farmers have the capacity to recover the full economic benefits from
the investment.

Summary of the desk-based review
This section has presented a review of the irrigation sectors in a sample of countries in SSA
and South Asia, to provide an overview of the different types of irrigation scheme available
in each country and to get an initial understanding of the suitability policy and operating
environment for OBA support.

Summary on the types of irrigation scheme
        There are significant differences in the scale and technologies employed in different
         irrigation schemes across all the five countries. The provision of irrigation to
         smallholders is primarily through small informal schemes that are funded, owned
         and operated by individual farmers/ small groups of farmers themselves. The
         growth in the use of informal small-scale schemes has occurred as farmers have
         opted out of formal public schemes, and the technology for small-scale irrigation
         (e.g. small pumps, sprinklers) has become accessible by smallholders. The growth in
         the use of informal small-scale schemes has occurred as farmers have opted out of
         formal public schemes, and the technology for small-scale irrigation (e.g. small
         pumps, sprinklers) has become accessible by smallholders through agro-dealers,
         such as Netafim, operating in the sector.
        In the SSA countries informal schemes typically involve basic technologies and
         temporary structures such as hand-dug wells and temporary river diversions, with
         land insecurity an important factor driving the lack of investment in more permanent
         structures. In addition the relative high cost of drilling/ energizing pumps in SSA
         relative to South Asia is another factor that has stimulated the growth of informal
         schemes. Overall the nature of the irrigation market in SSA is more fragmented with
         more limited opportunities for grouping together large number of farmers onto a
         single scheme.
        In India and Bangladesh millions of farmers have made use of groundwater to
         irrigate their land. In the case of India this is supported by the provision of subsidies
         for irrigation equipment and for pumping electricity by State governments.17.
        The provision of irrigation to smallholders through publically-owned and operated
         schemes (both large-scale and small-scale) has generally not proved to be a
         sustainable approach. This is for a variety of reasons, but the underlying problem is
         that the publically run schemes have typically not been developed for commercial
         reasons but instead in an attempt to satisfy food security concerns or political
         priorities. In an attempt to move beyond the unsustainable publicly owned and
         operated model all five countries have, to differing extents, tried to make use of

17
  Rural users of electricity in Bangladesh may pay less than the full cost of their supply, but there are not the
special subsidies for electricity for water pumping, which in some states in India, is provide to farmers
completely free of cost.

                                                                                                                24
           Participatory Irrigation Management (PIM) programs that use farmer groups to
           manage irrigation schemes and (primarily in SSA) PPP models in which a commercial
           farmer is responsible for managing the provision of irrigation to smallholder farmers.
          There are a number of medium/ large-scale commercial schemes in operation in the
           SSA countries, which are owned and operated by commercial farmers themselves.
           Given that the focus of the report is on the provision of irrigation to smallholders, we
           have considered this type of scheme to the extent to which there is scope to extend
           large-scale irrigation schemes to smallholders through the use of PPP arrangements.

Summary on policy and operating environment
Our overall assessment of the policy environment is that there is scope to utilize the OBA
financing approach to support increased provision of irrigation to smallholder farmers. In
particular, there is an important role for OBA to fill in helping to address the financing gaps
in both SSA and South Asia. The fact that smallholder farmers have turned towards the use
of informal irrigation schemes demonstrates that there is demand for irrigation services in
the region.
Effectively designed OBA projects could play a role in addressing these investment needs;
however the desk-based research has highlighted some important concerns with the sector
that will need to be considered in the design of any potential OBA project:
          Given the difficulties experienced in charging smallholders ISC at a level required to
           cover O&M costs, an important part of OBA project design in the sector will be the
           associated technical assistance programs that build demand amongst local farmers
           to the extent that they are willing to pay for the improved services provided by the
           project.
          Sustainable OBA projects in the sector will need to be located in areas which provide
           access to functional markets. There may be occasions in which trade-offs have to be
           made between projects which target the poorest smallholder farmers and those
           which target poor farmers based in areas which have access to markets.
          The business environment for agribusinesses in the countries that we have reviewed
           is difficult, and a sustainable OBA irrigation project will need to be designed to
           reflect context specific issues. For instance in the SSA context the costs and
           availability of finance for businesses in the agricultural sector suggests that potential
           service providers would find it difficult to pre-finance investments. This issue has
           been considered across GPOBA’s portfolio of projects, see for instance Kumar,
           Lieberman and Mumssen (2010)18, which highlights the range of options that are
           available to help service providers to pre-finance investments such as the provision
           of partial risk guarantees and equity investments by regional funds.

      It will be important to gain firm commitment from potential host country
       government’s given the political nature of irrigation.
      There are also notable risks in linking subsidy disbursements to farm productivity
       related outputs, as the private sector may not have appetite for such risks, even
       though such outputs may be a truer reflection of the OBA concept.
      The design of OBA subsidies will need to take account of the potential difficulties
       involved in measuring the delivery of irrigation services to smallholders and of the
       technical difficulty of excluding non-participating farmers from accessing certain
       types of irrigation scheme.
The next section presents some examples of different types of project that the OBA
financing approach could support, while the market assessment part of the work identifies
and reviews the suitability of specific project opportunities.



Assessment of project opportunities for OBA support in India
This section presents an assessment and evaluation of the potential to provide OBA
subsidies to support project-level opportunities in India (focused on the lagging States of
Madhya Pradesh and Orissa). To complete the analysis we have carried out in-country
consultations with stakeholders in both States, which has been complemented with
additional desk-based research.

Nature of project opportunities in India
The projects that we have identified through our consultations in India provide different
approaches to support the extension of technologies that can increase water use efficiency
while also providing farmers with an input that can increase their incomes on a sustainable
basis.
This is because in India there are growing concerns around the problem of water scarcity
and as such policies around irrigation have increasingly focused on how to improve water
conservation and water use efficiency in the country. It is generally understood that the
most effective policy approaches to achieve this would be to increase the prices for surface
water irrigation schemes and establish a market for groundwater resources that enables
farmers to be charged more appropriately for the use of the resources. These reforms
would enable policy makers to set the price of water for irrigation at a level that reflects its
increasing scarcity and gives farmers a greater incentive to be more efficient in their use of
water.
In practice, the existing policy environment makes it difficult to implement the required
reforms. In particular the ability of government to allocate and enforce effectively property
rights over groundwater resources is doubtful; and more generally the implementation of
the reforms would lead to a significant increase in the price farmers paid for water which,
                                                                                             26
given political considerations, would be a difficult option for policy makers. As such efforts
to improve water use efficiency in India have focused on technological solutions.
This includes micro-irrigation technologies such as drip and sprinkler irrigation and water
conservation technologies such as rainwater harvesting ponds. These technologies have the
scope to deliver significant water efficiency benefits. For instance drip technology has been
shown to achieve up to 95% and sprinklers 80% water use efficiency rates, compared to the
rates for surface water of around 35 to 40%.19 In addition to the improved water efficiency,
micro-irrigation technology also increases the productivity of farmers’ land, giving them
scope to generate higher yields and thus incomes where sufficient links to markets are in
place.
The cost of micro-irrigation technology is, however, typically too expensive for a smallholder
farmer. For instance conventional drip irrigation costs around $2,000 per ha. To try to
address these affordability issues a number of States have implemented subsidy schemes.
For instance, the Madhya Pradesh scheme subsidises around 70% to 80% of the capital cost
of drip-irrigation technology for farmers, in an attempt to reduce the costs of the
technology to a level that enables smallholder farmers to afford it. In practice, the way in
which the subsidy operates is actually restricting more smallholders from accessing drip-
irrigation technology. The scheme is reported to have distorted the market in the favour of
the few drip manufacturers that are licenced to supply drip-technology under the
programme leading to increased prices for the technology (AWS estimates that if the
subsidy were to be withdrawn the price of drip technology could fall by over 40%). In
addition, the level of bureaucracy involved in allocating the subsidy to farmers has led to
significant delays and concerns about the level of transparency involved in distribution of
funds amongst competing applications from farmers. The overall result is that the take up
of drip technology amongst smallholders has been low.
In the subsequent sub-sections we look at the following opportunities that we identified
through our consultations and research:
        The scope to apply market-based interventions to extend supply of micro-irrigation
         technology to smallholder farmers.
        The use of Integrated Micro-Irrigation Projects to extend irrigation to smallholders.
        The use of rainwater harvesting structures to improve water use efficiency.
For each example we give some background/ context before describing how the project
operates, the potential beneficial impacts and conclude by considering the suitability of
applying OBA subsidies to support the project.

Market-based interventions in micro-irrigation technology
There are a number of private companies in India that are involved in the production and
manufacture of micro-irrigation technology.         One such organisation, International
Development Enterprises India (IDEI) (a not-for-profit company registered in India), has
played a role in implementing a number of donor-funded projects that have focused on
extending affordable micro-irrigation technologies to smallholder farmers in India.
The IDEI employ a market based approach to supply farmers with micro-irrigation
technology that involves:20
        carrying out activities to develop the product by working directly with farmers to
         understand their needs and the specific design solutions that are most appropriate
         given their circumstances; and then
        working to establish a sustainable supply-chain for the product within a target
         market, which includes finding manufacturers for the products, recruiting retailers to
         sell the products, and training mechanics to install the products. IDEI does not pay
         manufacturers or dealers, instead it provides training, sets prices, and conducts
         quality inspections. In addition IDEI can provide/ manage the provision of additional
         training and capacity building to farmers to ensure that they can utilise the
         technology effectively.
Their model requires farmers to pay directly for the costs of the micro-technology, the grant
funds that they receive are used to support the development of the irrigation equipment
and market establishment activities. For instance, the treadle pumps provided by IDEI retail
at around $36 - $42, which the farmer pays; however it costs IDEI approximately an
additional $75 per smallholder farmer for all the additional costs related to the
development of demand and of the supply chain for the micro-irrigation equipment.
While it would be possible to charge smallholders the full cost-recovery price doing so
would limit the affordability of the micro-irrigation equipment. Hence the provision of the
micro-irrigation technology to a targeted group of smallholders effectively requires a
subsidy to help ensure the up-take of the technology amongst the targeted smallholders.
Through funding provided by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF) IDEI completed
the $27m Micro-irrigation for Indian Smallholders project, which ran from 2007 – 2011. The
project aimed to provide micro-irrigation to 250,000 smallholders (160,000 foot powered
treadle pumps and 90,000 drip irrigation systems), in order to increase their incomes by
approx. $400 per year. IDEI were successful in promoting these products successfully
amongst 244,404 smallholder farmers.


20
  IDEI have been involved in promoting the extension of water accessing technologies, such as low cost
boreholes; water lifting technologies such treadle pumps; water application technologies such as drip and
sprinkler equipment and water storage bags. All of their technologies are promoted under the Krishak Bandhu
(KB) brand.

                                                                                                         28
The impact of this project was assessed by a study completed by IMRB (a research firm
based in India), which conducted a survey of farmers in Maharashtra and Tamil Nadu, Bihar
and Orissa.21 The survey found that the project was successful in reaching the poorer
farmers and increasing their incomes – of the farmers purchasing treadle pumps in Bihar
and Orissa 96% and 97% respectively were on incomes of less than $2 per day prior to
purchasing the pumps and 90% and 83% of the farmers reported achieving an increase in
their incomes as a result of purchasing the pumps, compared to just 8% of farmers reporting
increased incomes in the control group that didn’t purchase the treadle pumps. As the
programme was implemented only a few years ago the durability of the pumps was not
verified as part of the survey; however IDEI expect that their pumps will last for eight to ten
years before they need to be replaced.22
We consider how an OBA subsidy could support the further extension of micro-irrigation
technology through the IDEI model.

Role for OBA financing
To date IDEI’s activities have been funded largely by traditional grant -financing approaches.
However following our discussions with them they would be interested in financing their
activities using the OBA subsidy approach. They have already demonstrated the capacity to
deliver projects in the lagging States and they consider that there is scope to extend further
the provision of affordable micro-irrigation technology in both Madhya Pradesh and Orissa.
In this case the OBA funds would be provided to cover the difference in costs faced by IDEI
in extending micro-irrigation technology of around $75 which is in addition to the costs that
farmers pay which varies with the technology but can average around $50. Theoretically
IDEI could charge the farmers the full cost recovery price, but by supporting their
intervention with OBA grants the micro-irrigation technology would potentially be more
affordable to a wider range of smallholder farmers.
This type of opportunity could potentially be supported with the disbursement of OBA funds
upon independent verification that each stage of IDEI’s market development activities have
been carried out; i.e. when they have successfully developed the product for the region
targeted by the intervention, and when they have developed the supply chain for the
product. A final tranche of the OBA funds could be released upon independent verification
that one of the targeted smallholder farmers has purchased one of their pieces of micro-
irrigation technology and are using it successfully.
This type of intervention would require quite simple institutional arrangements. IDEI would
be the main contract partner for GPOBA and be responsible for managing the
implementation of the project including working with smallholders to understand the
specific types of irrigation equipment that would be most suitable to their needs and

take it to market. An independent third-party would be appointed to validate that the
smallholders had been able to access the different technology and would then report back

Potential impact of an OBA grant
We have described the impact of the Micro-irrigation for Indian Smallholders project above.
If for illustrative purposes, we assume that a $10m OBA subsidy was provided to support a
similar project, the potential benefits could include the following:
        Provision of micro-irrigation technologies to around 90,000 smallholder farmers
         (depending on assumptions on the household sizes this could benefit 450,000
         individuals).23 Furthermore, their project could be targeted specifically towards a
         poorer district of Madhya Pradesh/ Orissa to achieve similar levels of uptake from
         poor farmers that was achieved on the BMGF funded project.
        Based on the information provided by IDEI, the marginal cost per smallholder is
         around $75, which implies that the marginal cost per beneficiary could be as low as
         $15. Though based on their previous project with the BMGF the cost per beneficiary
         might be slightly over $20.
        Smallholder farmer income could increase by up to $400 per year.24


23
  We have assumed five individuals per household for the purposes of this report.
24
  Based around the estimated per farmer impact of the BMGF funded Micro-irrigation for Smallholder farmers
programme. In practice the impact on increasing farmer incomes will vary considerably based on the specific

                                                                                                        30
       Significant benefits in the form of water use efficiencies could also be generated by
        extending access to micro-irrigation technology.
Even taking account of the potential risks of such a project; for instance, the level of uptake
from poor smallholder farmers might not be as high, or the estimated $400 increase in each
farmers’ income might be an overestimate, the project offers a relatively cost effective and
proven option to deliver micro-irrigation technology to smallholder farmers in India. When
one also considers the simple institutional arrangements this would seem to be a good
opportunity to apply OBA in the irrigation sector.

Suitability for OBA financing?
Utilising the OBA diagnostic tool criteria, there are a number of features of IDEI’s market
based approach that could make them suitable for OBA financing:
       Sector Fit: There is no reason why State governments in the lagging States would not
        be in support of IDEI extending their existing smallholder irrigation schemes,
        particularly as it has already implemented similar projects in Orissa.
       Monitoring and Evaluation: The implementation arrangements for this opportunity
        are relatively simple and would not need to involve government directly. Further, it
        should be relatively simple to verify that a smallholder has purchased the micro-
        irrigation technology and are using it effectively to increase their yields. It has also
        been demonstrated that it is possible to evaluate directly the impact of their
        interventions; IDEI have completed audits to verify that their equipment ends up in
        the hands of the smallholder farmers that have been reported as their customers
        and that these farmers have experienced an increase in their yields.25
       Capability of service providers: IDEI has implemented successfully similar projects
        for the BMGF and for IFAD in the past and has worked with a wide range of
        development partners such as DFID, the Ford Foundation, USAID and IWMI.
       Financial sustainability: The issue of the financial sustainability of the intervention
        should be less of a concern in this case. The farmers purchase the micro-irrigation
        technology themselves and would be expected to fund any costs of operating the
        machinery themselves - IDEI suggest that the O&M costs are very low and based on
        their previous projects farmers are able to cover the costs of maintaining the
        equipment using the increased income gained from using the micro-irrigation
        equipment. For instance the O&M costs for IDEI’s drip irrigation kit were estimated
        to be $6 per annum, which compares to the up to $400 per year increase in income




micro-irrigation technology purchased by the farmers, the crops they produce and the farmers’ ability to
access markets.

         that the farmers would receive.26 IDEI’s approach also includes an element of
         training and support to farmers to ensure that they realise the increased incomes
         available from the purchase of the micro-irrigation kit.
        Subsidies and grants: It would be possible to link directly the disbursement of a
         portion of the subsidies to specific independently verifiable outputs:
            o potentially when IDEI has achieved each stage of the market development
              activities required to take to facilitate farmers’ access to the technology; and
            o when a smallholder has purchased the micro-irrigation technology and upon
              verification that the farmers have realised a target increase in the
              productivity of their agricultural production. Though this would need
              additional discussion with IDEI, as they are not directly responsible for the
              effectiveness with which farmers use the micro-irrigation technology and so
              this would involve them taking on risks which they do not have direct control
              over.
Pre-financing capacity: IDEI is a not-for-profit organisation that is reliant primarily on
receiving funds from development partners to implement their projects. As such it may
have limited capacity to cover the up-front costs required to implement their projects and
would probably need some assistance to help initiate a new project. The precise form of
this assistance would need to be determined following follow-up discussions with them, but
it is unlikely that they would be in a position to take on debt given their operating structure.
Further, given the analysis that we have presented on the lagging States in India it may
prove to be difficult to rely on government funding. It may be that assistance from
development partners will be the most appropriate way to help IDEI cover the up-front
costs associated with project implementation.
Overall, the project opportunity is one that could potentially benefit significantly from OBA
funding. As demonstrated by the Micro-irrigation for Indian Smallholders IDEI’s approach
has the potential to target a significant number of poor beneficiaries and has supported
smallholders to increase their incomes.
The costs of reaching additional farmers is low at $75, and the sustainability of the
intervention is in-built: the farmers purchase the micro-irrigation equipment themselves
and they are given training to use it; and the IDIE interventions can be targeted around
areas where farmers have some scope to access markets; hence the farmers have strong
incentives to make effective use of the technology and achieve higher incomes making it a
potentially sustainable approach to providing smallholders with irrigation equipment.
In addition to IDEI there are various NGOs that are adopting a similar approach to extending
micro-irrigation in India, these include Driptech and the Development Alternatives

Group.27,28 There are also various organisations that are actively applying the same approach
across different countries in both South Asia and SSA. For instance, IDEI now operates as an
independent company but used to be part of the wider international IDE group that has
completed projects across South Asia, Latin America and SSA. There is also an organisation
called Kick-start, which is a not-for-profit social enterprise that uses a similar approach as
IDE to sell low-cost human-powered irrigation pumps to farmers in Africa.29 If it were
decided to use OBA funds to support this opportunity it is therefore possible that it could be
applied across a wide-range of developing countries.
The main concerns around this opportunity relate to the ability of organisations such as IDEI
to manage the risks implied by an OBA financing arrangement. To date they have typically
been funded by more traditional grant financing, where they receive money up-front to
cover the costs of developing the market and product design etc. In the OBA model that we
have outlined they would bear the risks related to their ability to generate sufficient
demand for their products. From an incentive point of view this may be desirable, but it
would be important to work closely with them to ensure that they understand fully the
nature of the risks involved.

Integrated Micro-Irrigation Projects
As discussed in Section 3, in India the medium and large-scale irrigation schemes (typically
surface irrigation schemes under furrow irrigation) are the responsibility of the State
governments, with the State managing irrigation infrastructure up to the farm gate, farmers
responsible for on-farm irrigation infrastructure and WUAs responsible collecting ISCs from
farmers. In these arrangements the inability of WUAs to collect ISCs at a level necessary to
cover O&M costs has meant that many of these schemes have fallen into a state of disrepair
and has led to the growth of informal groundwater irrigation schemes as farmers have
sought alternate sources of irrigation.
The Integrated Micro-Irrigation Projects (IMIP) approach includes the implementation of
interventions designed to rehabilitate these failing public sector schemes. In the IMIP a
private sector firm operates under contract to complete projects that have been originated
by the State governments. In a typical arrangement the private partner is responsible for:
        Planning and then implementation of improvements to the irrigation infrastructure
         at the scheme. This can include organising rehabilitation of the minor canals, but
         these can remain under the control of the State; and includes the distribution
         channels between the minor canals and the farm gate and any necessary pump and
         storage facilities.

       The provision of micro-irrigation technologies to the farmers and of capacity building
        for the WUAs to enable them to manage the farmers more effectively and to collect
        water use charges.
       The provision of both technical training and farming practices to farmers to enable
        them to use the micro-irrigation effectively and to support them to realise increased
        incomes.
       The operation and maintenance of the scheme for a contracted period of time, with
        the objective of passing over control to the WUAs in the longer-term.
The layout generic IMIP is illustrated in Figure 4.2 below.

The financing arrangements for IMIPs differ depending on the specific aspects design of the
project, but typically:
       The private company pre-finances a proportion of the infrastructure construction
        costs (minor canals if included, and the feeder pipelines, storage, pumps etc.) with
        the money being reimbursed by government.
       The micro-irrigation technology is financed by a combination of government
        subsidies and contributions from the farmers.
       O&M charges for the irrigation infrastructure as well as a service fee are recovered
        by the private company from government.
       The private company is responsible for recovering both water and electricity charges
        from the farmers and passing it on to the relevant water and electricity utility
        companies.
The institutional arrangements of a generic IMIP are set out in Figure 4.3 below.

                                                                                           34
Jain Irrigation Systems Ltd has experience of implementing the IMIP approach in India. It is
currently in the process of implementing a project in Karnataka State, which seeks to
provide micro-irrigation technologies to 7,000 smallholder farmers. The capital cost of
project is estimated to be $63m, 70% of which will be recovered in the form of up-front
capital from the State with the remaining 30% of capital costs recoverable once pre-
specified performance targets are achieved (90% of the targeted area under irrigation, or at
least 90% of the outlets operational). Hence the arrangement includes an aspect of
payment based upon achievement of pre-specified results. Under the contract Jain Irrigation
will be responsible for the operation and maintenance of the scheme for a five-year period.

Role for OBA financing?
As described above, in principle the financing arrangements for IMIP projects should be
managed between the private partner, government and the farmers. In practice, State
governments lack access to the finances necessary to support the implementation of
projects, creating a financing gap between the funds available to complete projects and the
pipeline of projects that could yield significant development benefits to the smallholder
farmers.
Through our consultations with Jain Irrigation we understand that there are potential IMIPs
in both Orissa and Madhya Pradesh that could benefit from OBA funding to support
implementation. Both projects aim to provide smallholders with improved micro-irrigation
technologies that will enable them to produce higher-income crops and vegetables and
improve the quality of their farming practices, while at the same time improving the
efficiency of water use on the existing surface irrigation schemes. The specific details of
both projects are confidential at this stage, but we can give an outline of the overall costs
and number expected beneficiaries of both:


                                                                                          35
     The capital cost of the first project is expected to be in the region of $30m and will
       provide micro-irrigation technologies to around 6,000 farmers on 7,000 ha of land.
       The required investment will include works on minor canals, pumping machinery
       and pipes. O&M costs are estimated to be around $30 per ha per annum,
       recoverable from the State. The farmers are expected to pay water charges of up to
       $10 per ha per annum and electricity charges which will vary depending on the final
       design of the project but could be in the region of $10 - $15 per ha per annum.
     The second project is expected to cost $70m and benefit 15,000 farmers on 20,000
       ha of land. Farmers would be expected to pay the similar electricity and water
       charges on this project as set out above.
In the case of both projects Jain Irrigation would require a 20% – 25% return on investment,
and they stated to us that the key barrier to both projects being implemented is the limited
availability of funding from the respective State governments. Their experience of
implementing similar projects is that the government typically runs into funding constraints
during the project cycle that leads to delays and cost overruns in project implementation.
There is a role for OBA financing to play to support the implementation of IMIPs by either
providing capital subsidies to help bridge the financing gap caused by the limited availability
of State funds that could prevent the implementation of the projects.
OBA subsidies could be provided in the form of capital subsidies, using a similar output-
based structure as used on the Karnataka project; where a significant proportion of the
funds provided by the State governments was triggered following independent verification
of the achievement of pre-specified output targets such as the provision of irrigation on a
targeted amount of land for a set period of time, and potentially verification of the farmers
increasing the productivity of their farming activity.
In terms of institutional arrangements, the project implementation model would resemble
Figure 4.3 above. GPOBA would make a joint agreement with the selected private partner
and the State institution and would need to appoint a third-party institution to monitor and
verify the achievement of pre-specified targets by the private partner.

Potential impact of providing OBA financing
The impact of OBA support for an IMIP will vary depending on the specific design of the
project and the level of performance of the existing irrigation infrastructure. Using the first
example outlined above, if we assume that a $5m to $10m OBA grant in the form of capital
subsidies was required to support the implementation of a project (for illustrative purposes,
the amount of OBA grant would need to be determined when more specific project details
are available following discussions with both the State and the prospective private partner),
the potential beneficial impact of the OBA support would be as follows:
      6,000 smallholder farmers (and depending on assumptions about farmers’
       household size) and 30,000 individuals would benefit from the investment. This

                                                                                            36
           suggests that the cost per beneficiary from the OBA funds would be in the range of
           $165 - $330.
          The provision of micro-irrigation technology and farmer training could be expected
           to increase farmers’ incomes by over $550 per ha per annum, this is based on AWS
           estimates of the average marginal increase of farmer incomes by applying drip vs.
           the surface-based furrow irrigation schemes.30
          The project would also deliver significant improvements to productivity of the
           irrigation scheme. This would depend on the micro-irrigation technology employed;
           drip irrigation could deliver improved water use efficiencies of around 60%, while
           sprinkler based schemes could deliver around 45% improvement in water use
           efficiencies. The opportunity to link some of the output related subsidy to the
           achievement of improved water use efficiencies could also be considered, but would
           need to be discussed in more detail with Jain/ the potential private service provider
           in advance.

Suitability for OBA financing?
Utilising the OBA diagnostic tool criteria, there are a number of features of IMIP that could
make them suitable for OBA financing:
          Sector Fit: The IMIPs are a key priority for the State governments and given the
           typical capital costs of the projects, government will be required to make a firm
           financial commitment to support project implementation.
          Monitoring and Evaluation: Previous IMIPs have required the use of third-party
           monitoring and verification of pre-determined outputs.
          Capability of service providers: Private investors such as Jain irrigation and Netafim
           are available that have a track-record of completing similar investments.31
          Financial sustainability: The financial sustainability of the project would be the key
           area of concern. Even with the provision of the OBA grant the private company
           would be dependent on recovering a significant portion of its capital costs and also
           the O&M costs of the scheme from government. There is some uncertainty about
           the ability of the government to cover these costs – and around the ability of the
           private company to recover the necessary contributions from farmers. These are
           risks that the prospective private investor would have to bear, but if the State does
           not make timely payments it could delay the implementation of the project
           potentially reducing the beneficial impact of the project. Thus, depending on the
           nature of the project it may be necessary to bring in other development partners to

           help finance the project and/ or seek explicit financial guarantees from the State and
           potentially Central government prior to initiating the project.
          In the longer-term the assumption for IMIPs is that the provision of micro-irrigation
           technology together with training will enable the farmers to build their capacity and
           incomes to a level that enables them to make a bigger contribution to the scheme
           over time to make the IMIP a more sustainable proposition.
          Subsidies and grants: Previous projects have made use of explicit and performance-
           based grants. Given the technical layout of typical IMIPs it would be possible to
           measure the provision of irrigation services and the farmers included in the scheme
           would need to be registered with the WUA.
          Pre-financing capacity: Private investors such as Jain Irrigation are available that
           have experience of pre-financing similar investments.
Overall, the IMIP approach presents an interesting opportunity that is consistent with OBA’s
core principles. The big risk is that the implementation of the projects will in part rely on
the involvement of State governments. From our consultations it is clear that there is a risk
that the State government is unwilling/ unable to release funds on a timely and consistent
basis to support the implementation of irrigation projects. If this type of opportunity were
to be pursued it would be critical that effective mitigations were put in place to help
manage effectively the involvement of the respective State government.
Despite the difficulties involved in working with State governments, an important benefit
from using OBA to support the implementation of a successful IMIP is that it could act as a
model to rehabilitate other failing State run irrigation schemes in India. However, given the
probably complexities involved in such a model it is unlikely that it represents an
opportunity that could be implemented successfully in the short term; significant work
would have to be done with the targeted State institutions to take the project opportunity
forward.

Rainwater harvesting structures
A further example of applying micro-irrigation technologies to improve the efficiency with
which water is used was identified in the AWS analysis. In the work done on that project in
Madhya Pradesh, an intervention was piloted that involved decentralized rainwater
harvesting in which farmers were persuaded to dig ponds on their land to collect and store
water. These ponds can also, if properly sited, provide water to either provide protective
irrigation to supplement rainfall in the main monsoon cropping season (kharif), and so
reduce risk, or to irrigate a smaller area of winter dry season (rabi) crops. 32
The impact of this intervention was found to be positive; the portion of the area cultivated
in the region during the dry season increased from 23% to 95%. When farmers used their

own funds to carry out the investment the pay-back period was estimated to be 2 – 3 years.
There is also a government subsidy program in place in Madhya Pradesh that covers 50% of
the costs; however the funds available from this subsidy are limited so it can often take
some time for farmers to access the funds.
The project report recommends making loans available for ponds and irrigation equipment
to enable more farmers in the region to apply the rain water harvesting techniques.

Role of OBA subsidies and outline of a potential OBA pilot project
In this model the disbursement of OBA subsidies increase the number of farmers able to
invest in rainwater harvesting infrastructure. The release of the majority of the OBA funds
could be triggered by the completion of the civil works and enable farmers to invest in
irrigation equipment.
The rainwater harvesting ponds that were constructed in the AWS pilot programme were
relatively large - ranging from 0.2 to 4ha, and also expensive to construct – the average cost
was around $6,500 for a 0.8ha pond. This makes the construction of ponds a less accessible
option for poorer farmers – who not only lack the ability to fund such investments but also
the land on which to construct them. Therefore the role of OBA financing in this option
would be to support smallholders to afford to construct the rainwater harvesting ponds.
Based on our consultations in India and research, an outline of rainwater harvesting project
supported by OBA in Madhya Pradesh could be as follows:
      A pond of 30 x 30 x 3 m could provide one season irrigation to two hectares of kharif
       crops such as cotton, sorghum or maize, or provide sufficient water to grow about
       0.5 hectares of wheat in the rabi season.
      Growing 0.5 acre of wheat using irrigation, would produce about 2.2 tons, worth
       $600, which, after deducting production costs, leaves a gross margin of about $400.
      Total investment in pond of 30 x 30 x 3 meters and irrigation equipment
       (diesel/electric pumps, pipes and sprinklers) would be US$1,600.
      The costs of constructing the pond and the irrigation equipment could be part
       financed by an OBA subsidy of $650 per smallholder, a bank loan of $650 and a
       farmer contribution for the remaining costs. It is assumed that no government
       subsidies would be available. If they were, the OBA subsidy could be reduced and a
       larger number of ponds constructed.
      The bank loan would be repayable over 4 years at 12% annual interest, with equal
       half-yearly instalments of around $130. Without the OBA subsidy, the loan would be
       twice this amount, and could not be serviced unless water was used to grow higher
       value crops – and the availability of a market for such crops cannot be assured in all
       locations in Madhya Pradesh. In addition the local banks would be more likely to
       provide loans to the farmers if OBA funds were included as part of the project.

                                                                                           39
      An additional $130 per pond would be required for technical site selection,
       mobilization of farmers and technical supervision. Scheme overheads, including
       independent verification for OBA payment, are assumed to add a further 10%.
       Based on these assumptions, the total cost of a project to construct 10,000 ponds
       would be US$8.9m.
      In practice such a project is unlikely to wish to build 10,000 ponds of identical size,
       and a range of water harvesting structures may be used according to the needs of
       the location – including recharge pits, recharge of dug wells and small check dams.
       However for this outline proposal ponds have been used to illustrate how such a
       scheme might work.
There are a number of government agencies that implement schemes involving such
rainwater harvesting ponds and other structures. These include, in particular watershed
agencies and agricultural departments. In addition the National Bank for Agricultural and
Rural Development (NABARD) which, apart from being the apex bank for agricultural
lending, implements a range of agricultural development programs using funds from GoI,
including watershed development. However a project of the scale envisaged for this pilot
scheme is unlikely to warrant interest from a government agency – unless it could be sold as
an action research project, or be implemented as a component of a larger program – with
the risk that the implementing agency would not give it the attention that is required.
It may be more feasible for such a project to be implemented by an NGO, and a number of
such NGOs (e.g. include Pradan, the Watershed Organisation Trust (WOTR) and the
Bharatiya Agro Industries Foundation (BAIF)) have considerable experience and expertise in
such work, and are active in Madhya Pradesh and Orissa. The NGO (which might form a
consortium with other NGOs) would be responsible for identification of suitable areas,
design of water harvesting structures, engagement with farmers, site selection, supervision
of construction and quality control, and support for irrigated agriculture. A verification
agency (possibly an engineering firm) would verify completion of construction to enable the
release of OBA subsidies.

Potential impact of providing OBA financing
The potential benefits could include the following:
      Provision of irrigation facilities to around 10,000 smallholder farmers (benefitting
       50,000 individuals). Furthermore, the small size of ponds compared with those in the
       AWP project means they are of interest to smaller farmers. The project could be
       targeted specifically towards poorer districts of Madhya Pradesh/ Orissa.
      Based on the calculations above, the cost per smallholder is around $890, which
       implies that the marginal cost per beneficiary could be $178.




                                                                                           40
      Smallholder farmer incomes could increase by an average of $222 per year (net of
       loan repayment – after loans are repaid after four years, income would increase to
       almost $400).
      Seepage from ponds will recharge wells nearby – generating further benefits for
       farmers and possibly their neighbors. These have not been included in the
       calculations.

Suitability for OBA financing?
Utilizing the OBA diagnostic tool criteria, there are a number of features of rainwater
harvesting structures that could make them suitable for OBA financing:
      Sector Fit: with increasing scarcity of water for irrigation (and also for other
       purposes), governments at state and central levels are actively promoting rainwater
       harvesting as part of watershed development. This is supported by the National
       Groundwater Recharge Master Plan. The centrally sponsored Integrated Watershed
       Management Project (IWMP) is being implemented in a number of states, but
       resources are limited to by ceiling of the maximum cost per hectare, so scope for
       water harvesting interventions such as farm ponds is limited. In a number of states
       watershed development is being undertaken by projects funded by state, national
       and donor resources, but coverage by these projects is limited.
      Monitoring and Evaluation: monitoring and verification of completed farm ponds
       would be relatively straight forward, but should include a technical assessment to
       evaluate of the meet the required design criteria and are fit for purpose. An NGO
       could also be engaged to carry out follow up work to evaluate the longer-term
       economic impact of such an initiative.
      Capability of service providers: A number of local NGOs such as Pradan, WOTR and
       the BAIF have considerable experience and capacity in the implementation of
       projects that include water harvesting structures. Pradan has implemented projects
       funded by agencies such as BMGF and IWMI. BAIF has enormous experience of
       working alongside government agencies and often implements projects on behalf of
       state governments.
      Financial sustainability: there should be no real issue of financial sustainability –
       once ponds and other water harvesting structures are built farmers will wish to
       continue to use them for irrigation, and as basically private infrastructure, will need
       to maintain them in order to continue to receive irrigation water.
      Subsidies and grants: issues regarding subsidies and grants may be the area of most
       uncertainty for this proposal. A number of government programs provide these
       farm ponds free of cost – although numbers constructed are quite limited.
       Nevertheless the existence of such programs may persuade farmers not to build
       their own ponds but rather wait in the hope of a free pond from the government.

                                                                                           41
       That said, the experience reported by AWS in MP shows that farmers are willing to
       invest in their own ponds, although these were larger farmers building much larger
       ponds.
      Pre-financing capacity: NGOs, such as Pradan, will have limited resources for pre-
       financing, so will need some sort of up front support to implement the programme.
       However, as certain individual farmers have been pre-financing the construction of
       the ponds themselves, a significant portion of the OBA subsidies could be released
       following the verification of the completion of the ponds.
In addition, by targeting smallholder farmers located in the lagging states of Orissa and
Madhya Pradesh, the OBA support could be said to be targeting explicitly the poor. These
farmers will not be served by existing irrigation schemes and so will represent farmers who
are relatively more vulnerable to the effects of climate change.
With this type of approach there would also be scope to develop rainwater harvesting
projects in other countries across South Asia and SSA. Projects have been implemented by
NGOs such as Practical Action in Sri Lanka and WaterAid.
Overall, the rainwater harvesting approach presents an interesting opportunity that is
consistent with OBA’s core principles. The big risk is whether or not farmers will be willing
to invest in constructing their own ponds, particularly given the need to give up some of
their farming land – even with a 50% OBA subsidy. Thus the main issue to explore with a
potential implementing partner is the strategy to build farmers’ demand for constructing
the ponds.

Assessment of project opportunities for OBA support in
Zambia
This section presents the market assessment and evaluation of potential options to apply
OBA subsidies to support specific project opportunities that our team has identified in
Zambia. To complete the analysis we have carried out in-country consultations with
stakeholders during a visit to the country where we discussed the OBA concept with
stakeholders attending an agribusiness investors’ forum.       The findings from the
consultations have been complemented with additional desk-based research.

Nature of the opportunities in Zambia
In Zambia, similar to other countries in SSA, irrigation plays a marginal role in the
agricultural sector for smallholder farmers. According to government estimates only around
3% of the country’s cultivated area is currently irrigated and in total only 155,000ha of land is
under irrigation out of a potential 2.7m ha which could be irrigated.
In the past, the public sector has tried to take the lead role in the provision of irrigation to
smallholder farmers. A number of smallholder schemes were implemented such as such as
Buleya Malima (275ha vegetable/fruit), Mununshi Bananas (100ha), Mukonchi (500ha
tobacco, cotton), Kawambwa Tea (500ha), Kateshi Coffee (348ha). Over time these schemes
have largely fallen into disrepair due to a lack of availability of funds to cover O&M costs –
farmers have not paid sufficient charges to cover costs and public funds have not been
available to cover the financing gap.
As a result of the limited success of public sector intervention in stimulating sufficient
provision of irrigation services to smallholders government has sought to increase the role
of the private sector. In particular government has sought to promote the development of
models that involve commercial farmer and outgrower/contract-farming farming
arrangements to provide irrigation services to smallholders.
Under the model a large-scale commercial farmer enters into an arrangement to operate
and manage bulk water irrigation services and, as part of that agreement, either constructs
and operates or constructs and contracts out management of the irrigation services
provided to emergent and/ or smallholder farmers. Often these arrangements are managed
through a PPP contract between the commercial farmer and government, but it is also
possible for a private firm to initiate an investment itself.
An example of the commercial hub-outgrower farmer model is depicted in Figure 5.1 below.
The figure illustrates a three tier model that involves a commercial hub farmer, an emergent
farmer group and smallholders. This is one example out of a variety of ways in which
arrangement could be structured.




                                                                                              45
Figure 5.1: An example a commercial hub-outgrower farmer model




As can be seen from the above figure, the model seeks to combine both commercial and
small-scale farmers within a single scheme. The potential benefit of this type of model is to
facilitate the development of more commercial irrigation schemes big enough to operate on
a financially sustainable basis (and potentially without the commercial farmer having to go
through the difficulties associated with trying to acquire sufficient land, as typically the
Government will already have identified and titled land for the irrigation scheme), while at
the same time extending irrigation services and crucially other services such as capacity
building and access to improved inputs to smallholders, without involving government
directly in the implementation/ operation & maintenance of the scheme.
The key to the sustainability of this model is the strength of the incentives on the
commercial farmer to provide these services to the smallholders on an on-going basis. A
successful example of this type of model is the scheme that is operated by the Kaleya
Smallholders Company (KASCOL) that was established in 1981 with finance from Zambia
Sugar, Barclays Bank, CDC, the African Development Bank (ADB) and the Development bank
of Zambia. In this arrangement KASCOL provides irrigation services, technical support and
inputs to 161 smallholders that have been selected for the scheme. In return KASCOL
receives 53% of the value of the farmers’ sugarcane produce.
The success of this arrangement is based on the fact that KASCOL has an ongoing incentive
to ensure that the smallholders attached to the scheme continue to generate sufficient
yields of sugar. This is because there is a significant profit margin on offer from processing
the sugar produced by the farmers - the company has an off-take agreement with Zambia


                                                                                           46
Sugar plc’s Nakambala sugar factory, thus it has a guaranteed market for the sugar that it
receives from the smallholders. Hence KASCOL has a strong ongoing rationale to ensure
that the smallholders continue to access the irrigation services as well as technical
assistance/ inputs when needed.
Overall, these commercial hub-outgrower farmer models work best when there is a financial
incentive for the commercial firm to continue to provide irrigation services to the
smallholders. In the following sub-section we consider the merits of applying OBA to
support a project proposed by KEDE Ltd, which has a similar set up to Kaleya.
There are a number of other commercial hub-outgrower models where there is less of a
financial incentive for the commercial farm to continue providing services to the
smallholder. We therefore also consider how OBA could be used in this context using an
economic and financial model that is based on projects that we know of in Zambia.

Market-based approaches
In Zambia, as with other countries in SSA, there is also scope to apply both the market based
approaches. For instance iDE have been operating in Zambia since 1997. In 2008 they
successfully formed a partnership with a micro-finance company to develop an agricultural
product that was designed to support smallholder farmers to access micro-irrigation
technologies and other agricultural inputs. Between 2008-2011 this project has provided
loans of over $1.5m to around 2,800 smallholders, supporting them to increase their
agricultural yields and incomes.33
We have not carried out detailed analysis of the scope to use OBA to fund market-based
approaches in Zambia because it would, at a high-level involve a similar model to that
discussed in India. While there are clearly country-specific supply chain/ market issues; for
instance, Willem and Koppen (2013) have reviewed the supply chain for motor pumps in
Zambia and found that the supply chain is underdeveloped particularly for farmers that live
away from the country’s urban centres.34 The approaches developed by organisations such
as iDE and Kickstart are tailored to address these country-specific issues, and thus we judge
that there is also scope to consider these market-based opportunities in Zambia and other
countries in SSA.
The subsections below therefore focus on reviewing the scope to use OBA subsidies to
support the commercial hub-outgrower models, rather than repeating the market-based
model.

KEDE project
KEDE is a joint venture of three commercial farmers, established to enable the farmers to
jointly arrange and manage the financing, construction and operation of a bulk water
system to supply irrigation services to their farms. They are located in the Mazabuka,
Southern Province of Zambia, and combined will irrigate an area of 2,500 ha.
The development of the infrastructure required to serve the commercial farms is estimated
to cost $10m. They have already managed to arrange the finance for this through a
combination of equity and commercial bank loans and the project is currently under
construction. The bank loans are for a seven year term and include a combination of USD
debt at an interest rate of around 12% and Zambian Kwacha at around 18%.
The bulk water irrigation system which is under development passes through and around
500 ha of land that is used by around 200 smallholder farmers. KEDE believe that it would
be technically possible to connect the smallholders to the emerging scheme.
The expected development cost of this is as follows:
      $3,500 per ha for the development of a pivot irrigation system to serve the
       smallholders. An alternative option of using a dragline sprinkler option at cost of
       $2,000 per ha is also under consideration.
      The land-clearing and land levelling required to connect the schemes would cost
       around $2,400 per ha. In addition around $300 per ha is required to establish an
       electricity supply and $250 per ha for the development of roads and construction of
       fences.
      It is estimated that it would cost an additional $1,200 per ha to establish a sugarcane
       crop on the land should this opportunity be made available.
In total the costs of extending the scheme, excluding the bulk water irrigation infrastructure
is expected to range from around $6,000 to $7,000 per ha. In addition if the costs of the
bulk water irrigation are spread equally across the total 3,000 ha of the scheme at cost of
$3,500 per ha the total development costs are estimated to be around $10,000 to $11,000
per ha. Given that around 500 ha of land is covered the total up-front cost of connecting
the smallholders could be around $5m. The construction to operation timeframe is
expected to be around one to two years.
Under the arrangement, and subject to available quota, it is feasible to assume that costs by
contributors can be recovered through mill proceeds with a pre-arranged agreement.

Role for OBA financing?
KEDE are currently seeking additional finance to fund the expansion of the scheme to the
smallholders and could use an OBA financing agreement to help achieve this. In the
absence of access to concessional finance, they indicated that they would be unable to carry
out the investment themselves as the opportunity would not yield the returns necessary to

                                                                                           48
justify taking out loans from commercial banks to fund the investment. They believe that
gaining agreement to access OBA funds could be used to help them secure the additional
finance necessary to carry out the expansion of the scheme. Hence the use of OBA funds
could help to address the financing gap that is preventing the extension of irrigation to
smallholders.
In this instance the OBA funds would be provided in the form of capital subsidies, with the
proportion of the funds disbursed based on independent verification of the smallholders
being connected to functional irrigation services. In addition a proportion of the OBA funds
could be released based on verification that the irrigation services had continued to be
provided for a pre-specified length of time to strengthen the financial incentives for the
commercial hub to provide services to the smallholders.
The indicative institutional arrangements for the model are shown in Figure 5.2 below. In
this model KEDE would play the key role in:
       Arranging the implementation of the construction of the irrigation infrastructure to
        smallholders.
       Managing the provision of capacity building to smallholders - but with the expansion
        of sugarcane growing in the Mazabuka region, knowledge of the crop is becoming
        widespread and many of the farmers would have worked on commercial cane farms.
       Managing the provision of sugarcane to the sugar factory.

Potential impact of OBA
The estimated total cost of providing irrigation to smallholders is estimated by KEDE to be
$5m, for illustrative purposes we assume that a potential OBA funds would cover all of this
cost – in practice, in this case we expect that the provision of OBA funds could be limited to
cover the costs of constructing the irrigation infrastructure dedicated to supply the
smallholders ($1m to $1.75m for the dragline sprinkler or pivot schemes), rather that the
costs related to setting up the farmers as sugar producers, but this would depend on a more
detailed assessment of the finances of the project and further discussion with the project
developers.
     The project expects to connect around 200 smallholders to the irrigation services,
       potentially benefiting 1,000 individuals. The cost per beneficiary of the using the
       PPP model would be in the range of $1,000 to $5,000, which is very high compared
       to the other opportunities that we have reviewed in this report and more generally
       compared to other projects that have been supported by OBA funds, which often
       have a cost per beneficiary of below $100.
     However, the project could generate quite significant increases in revenue for the
      smallholders. Their incomes could increase from around $650 per ha per annum,
      which they receive from producing maize under rain-fed conditions, to over $2,000
      per ha per annum producing sugarcane under irrigation (based on the assumption
      that the farmers yield 100 tons per hectare and can sell the sugarcane at $40 per
      ton with operating margins of 45%).
The project cost and number of beneficiaries would vary depending on the nature of the
project/ assumptions (for instance, it is possible that there could be additional beneficiaries
such as the commercial hub employing labourers). However, the above example gives a
reasonable guide to the costs and number of smallholders that could be covered by a typical
commercial hub-outgrower farmer irrigation scheme model. Large-scale pivot-based
irrigation schemes in SSA cost around $10,000 per hectare when all the associated costs of
developing the schemes are taken into account, while the average plot size for a smallholder
can vary from around the 4 ha assumed in this example depending on the specific crop.
Therefore, the indicative cost per beneficiary shown in the KEDE example gives a reasonable
estimate; with the range likely to be around $1,000 to $5,000.
There is obviously an element of judgement around the merits of using OBA finance to
support this type of opportunity, but it does not necessarily seem consistent with OBA
principles of targeting resources at the poorest farmers, and there is a more fundamental
question about whether grant-finance would be necessary to support this type of
opportunity given that a commercial farmer could potentially exploit opportunities of this
nature on a stand-alone basis.-. It is possible that alternative types of concessional finance
such as patient capital could provide a more cost effective alternative way to support the



                                                                                            50
implementation of this type of project.35 It is therefore worth exploring whether the OBA
subsidies could apply to concessional loans instead of grants.
For instance, the OBA funds could be provided to an agricultural developer such as
AgDevCo36 with the intention of subsidising the interest rate that the private partner would
have to pay to finance the extension of the irrigation scheme.; i.e. at the beginning of the
agreement the private partner would be liable to repay the loans required to finance the
extension of the scheme at market rates of for example 12%, but the effective interest rate
would fall to say 6% if specific smallholder targets were achieved. Ideally, an arrangement
such as this would include provisions which would allow interest rates to rise again if the
delivery of irrigation services to smallholders was not maintained. This could require the
OBA programme to remain in place for longer than the usual five to seven year window, but
by providing longer term support to the projects the OBA funds could have more influence
in supporting the implementation of sustainable projects.

Suitability for OBA financing?
Overall, while this opportunity is broadly consistent with the requirements set out in the
OBA diagnostic tool, in particular it fits in with the objectives of the government of Zambia,
KEDE could pre-finance the investment; and critically for irrigation schemes there is a strong
financial incentive for KEDE to ensure that the smallholders continue to have access to the
irrigation services and employ the improved farming practices and generate more sugar for
the factory.
The issues with this opportunity revolve around the costs involved and the number of
beneficiaries compared to alternative potential uses of OBA funds. More fundamentally,
given that the private company, such as KEDE Ltd, has a clear financial incentive to ensure
the continued provision of irrigation services, the main role for OBA in this project would be
to help bridge the financing gap that is reportedly preventing them from funding the
extension of irrigation to the smallholders. Potentially the most cost effective way to
achieve this would be to explore whether it is possible to use OBA funds to support the
private partner to access finance at concessional rates, rather than the provision of grant-
based finance.
There may be a question, which will need to be explored with the investors, as to whether
the concessional lending on the expansion project alone will sufficiently incentivise the


35
   For instance, InfraCo (2010) explains how the concept of patient capital can be a more suitable form of
financing to support the implementation of irrigation projects. Patient capital is long-term, subordinated
capital invested at a sub-commercial cost, which is used to fund the one-off start-up costs and part of the cost
of the very long-life assets.

36
  AgDevCo is a social impact investor and agribusiness project developer, incorporated as a non-for-profit
distribution, limited company in the UK. It invests patient capital in the form of debt and equity into early
stage agribusinesses and acts as promoter or co-promoter of greenfield agriculture opportunities.

commercial farmers to extend and operate the scheme. If necessary, incentives could be
extended to cover the entire irrigation scheme.

Alternative commercial hub-outgrower models
The Kaleya/ KEDE model works, in terms of scheme sustainability, because the commercial
hub farmer benefits directly from the smallholder accessing the irrigation services to
produce higher yields of sugar given that there is an agreement to supply the local sugar
producing factory.
As discussed in Section 5.1 there are various project examples in Zambia and across SSA
where the strength of the financial incentive of the commercial hub to provide ongoing
services to smallholders does not exist because the hub has no commercial interest in the
smallholder’s output. This is usually because the commercial hub is growing different crops
than the smallholders using different irrigation technologies. Based on project examples
about which we have some experience, we have developed a financial model to explore
how OBA could be used to support the more generic commercial hub-outgrower farmer
model. This model is explained in detail in Annex A.
The key point to take from the modelling analysis is that the costs and benefits (in terms of
number of beneficiaries and expected increase in smallholder farmer income) of developing
such a project are broadly similar to those set out in Section 5.2. However, as opposed to
the KEDE model there is less certainty about the potential to use concessional finance to
fund the more generic commercial hub-outgrower models. It is unlikely that private
investors would be willing to take on debt to fund the extension of the schemes to
smallholders, given the absence of a financial return. As such there is a question mark
about whether grants should be used to support this sort of opportunity given the potential
costs of the scheme and the more limited number of individuals that would benefit
compared to the other potential project opportunities, unless of course justified by
economic cost benefit analysis.

Summary assessment of the market opportunities for OBA in Zambia
In this section we have explored the potential to apply OBA financing to support the
extension of commercial large-scale irrigation schemes to smallholder farmers using variants
of the commercial hub-outgrower model.

Key risks/      Nature of the financial incentives of the commercial farmers to provide services on
unknowns        a sustainable basis to smallholders
Mitigations        For projects where there is a clear financial incentive for the commercial hub to
                    maintain the provision of irrigation and technical assistance services to the
                    smallholders, such as the KEDE example discussed in Section 5.2, it would be
                    worth exploring the potential of using OBA funds to support the private
                    company to access finance at concessional rates, rather than simply providing
                    grant-based finance.
                   For the more generic commercial hub-outgrower models, where the
                    commercial farmers have no real financial interest in the smallholders’ output
                    there is likely to be less opportunity to use concessional finance to support the
                    implementation of projects. While there is an option of using grant-based
                    finance to support this type of opportunity the costs would in most cases be
                    too high compared to alternative uses of the funds.
Scope to        Similar hub-outgrower projects are under development across SSA, opportunity to

Conclusions & recommendations
The objective of this report was to:
      Evaluate the scope for using OBA funds to finance small-scale irrigation schemes to
       support poor farmers in developing countries.
      Propose project design and implementation arrangements, based on real-world
       examples, to support sustainable small scale irrigation schemes benefiting from OBA,
       either under public or private management.
The aim being to use the analysis to provide GPOBA with recommendations on the way
forward for using OBA subsidies to support the implementation of small scale irrigation
projects.

Scope to apply OBA in small-scale irrigation sector
In Section 3 of this report we presented an assessment of the scope to apply OBA to support
the extension of irrigation schemes to smallholder farmers, based on desk-based research of
the irrigation sectors in a sample of five countries in SSA and South Asia.
Our overall assessment is that there is scope to utilize the OBA financing approach to
support increased provision of irrigation to smallholder farmers. In particular, there is an
important role for OBA to fill in helping to address financing gaps in both South Asia and
SSA. Effectively designed OBA projects could play a role in addressing these investment
needs; however the desk-based research presented in this report has highlighted some
important concerns with the sector that will need to be considered in the design of any
potential OBA project:
      Given the difficulties experienced in charging smallholders ISC at a level required to
       cover O&M costs, an important part of OBA project design in the sector will be the
       associated technical assistance programs that build demand amongst local farmers
       to the extent that they are willing to pay for the improved services provided by the
       project.
      Sustainable OBA projects in the sector will need to be located in areas which provide
       access to functional markets. There may be occasions in which trade-offs have to be
       made between projects which target the poorest smallholder farmers and those
       which target poor farmers based in areas which have access to markets to help
       ensure that the irrigation project is more sustainable.
      It will be important to gain firm commitment from potential host country/ state
       government’s given the political nature of irrigation, particularly in India.
      There are also notable risks in linking subsidy disbursements to farm productivity
       related outputs, as the private sector may not have appetite for such risks, even
       though such outputs may be a truer reflection of the OBA concept.

                                                                                          54
      The design of OBA subsidies will need to take account of the potential difficulties
       involved in measuring the delivery of irrigation services to smallholders and of the
       technical difficulty of excluding non-participating farmers from accessing certain
       types of irrigation scheme.

Potential project opportunities for OBA in small-scale irrigation sector
In the second part of the report we have identified specific project opportunities that could
be supported by OBA funds in India and Zambia.
We reviewed the option of using market based approaches to supply farmers with micro-
irrigation technology and of supporting farmers to construct rainwater harvesting ponds.
The analysis suggests that both of these options would be good candidates for support using
OBA funds. Both of these approaches:
      have been shown to be successful at targeting large numbers of poor smallholder
       farmers;
      the potential cost per beneficiary could be as low as $75 per smallholder farmer (or
       $15 per individual), with smallholders’ incomes increasing by as much as $400 per
       annum depending on the type of micro-irrigation technology provided;
      have limited/ no involvement from government institutions so there is less
       complexity in seeking to implement projects;
      could be adopted across a range of countries in both SSA (for instance organisations
       such as Kickstart and iDE have been successful in supplying large numbers of
       smallholder farmers with micro-irrigation technology in a number of African
       countries) and South Asia; and
      is a potentially sustainable approach given that the micro-irrigation equipment is
       developed to meet the needs of the targeted smallholders farmers, both in terms of
       affordability and suitability given the geographic conditions.
We also looked at different options that make use of large-scale irrigation schemes to
provide irrigation to smallholder farmers; the IMIP approach that is currently specific to
India and the different commercial hub-outgrower models that are being developed in
Zambia and across SSA.
These two models are quite reflective of government’s attempts to bring in more private
sector participation to improve the performance of large-scale schemes in the two regions.
A number of governments in SSA are currently in the process of trying to develop
commercial hub-outgrower models. While in India, where government retains responsibility
for up-stream irrigation infrastructure, efforts to rehabilitate large-scale schemes have
focused on bringing in private sector participation to improve down-stream irrigation
facilities. The two models thus present interesting examples of the type of opportunities
that might be available for supporting large-scale irrigation schemes in the two regions.

                                                                                          55
The IMIP approach looks like an innovative way to rehabilitate existing irrigation schemes in
India, while at the same time improving water use efficiency. However, given the policy
environment for irrigation in India, and the costs involved in implementing a project it
would be necessary to work directly with the State governments to implement such a
project. Previous experience suggests that it can be complicated to work with State
governments to implement irrigation projects, particularly if there is a dependence on the
State for the release of funds. If this type of opportunity were to be pursued further, it
would be imperative to get firm commitment, in the form of financial guarantees, from
State governments before proceeding.
The commercial hub-outgrower model also has the potential to be used to support
smallholders to access irrigation. We have consulted with potential investors and
developed a financial model to explore the costs and benefits involved with this approach.
Overall, our analysis suggests that the use of OBA subsidies for this type of opportunity be
restricted to supporting investors to access finance at concessional rates to fund the
extension of irrigation to smallholder farmers. This implies that OBA funds should focus on
supporting projects where there is a clear ongoing financial incentive for the commercial
hub to provide services to the smallholder farmers, which will help to ensure that the OBA
funds support financially sustainable irrigation schemes.

Recommendations & way forward
Based on the information gained from desk-based research and consultations, the option of
using OBA to support the extension of small-scale irrigation technologies, particularly
through the use of the market-based approaches used by institutions such as IDEI and
Kickstart, offer the most potential. This potential is in terms of cost efficiency, the scope to
scale up the approach across countries in both SSA and South Asia and the ease of
implementation given the limited role that government institutions would play in the
project outlines that we have described.
We would caution that all the project opportunities identified in this report were not
initially designed with OBA subsidies in mind, but were suggested to us by private sector
stakeholders as being projects that could potentially be adapted to fit with the OBA
approach. We have discussed the nature of OBA projects with stakeholders and they have
indicated an initial willingness to take the projects forward, but the natural next phase of
the work will be to hold more detailed discussions with them.
Therefore, in terms of follow up, GPOBA should hold discussions with the institutions such
as IDEI and Kickstart that have implemented successfully development partner funded
projects (and are thus likely to be experienced in dealing with any necessary World Bank
monitoring and evaluation etc. requirements) that have extended micro-irrigation
technologies to smallholder farmers, to assess in more detail the scope to use OBA funds to
develop interventions targeted at poor smallholder farmers. In particular GPOBA should
evaluate in more detail the scope for these institutions to pre-finance their projects and to

                                                                                             56
take on the risks of having the release of funds tied to the achievement of pre-specified
outputs.
The option of using OBA funds to support the extension of irrigation through large-scale
schemes also provides some interesting possibilities, but in practice will be difficult to
implement given the probable complexity involved in both working with government
institutions and seeking to organise large groups of farmers. However, there is a question
mark about whether GPOBA should be using their funds to try and address implementation
blockages such as these that are restricting Private Sector Participation (PSP) in the
provision of infrastructure services to the poor. While the option of using OBA funds to
support the extension of small-scale irrigation equipment certainly has potential to improve
outcomes for smallholder farmers, it is unclear what it does to address structural problems
within the business environment that prevent private investors from fulfilling their role. If
the GPOBA’s objective for using OBA funds in the irrigation sector is to address these
constraints, then perhaps the larger-scale project opportunities will need to be targeted
over a longer timeframe.
Of the projects opportunities that we have reviewed, the potential of using OBA funds to
support commercial hub-outgrower models where it is possible to use OBA funds to enable
investors to access funds at concessional rates is the best option. Otherwise the costs
involved in supporting large-scale projects are potentially too large for OBA funds to
support. As a next step GPOBA should discuss specific investment opportunities with
institutions that are currently working on trying to find ways to support the development of
irrigation schemes in SSA. In our view, given the nature of the irrigation sector, if GPOBA
were to get involved with larger-scale schemes it should also consider whether it is possible
to provide longer-term assistance to projects than the quoted five to seven years or explore
the possibility of linking the project to larger World Bank/ development partner
interventions. This would enable the provision of OBA funds to have an on-going influence
on ensuring that smallholder continue to be provided with the required standard of
irrigation services.
In summary:
      We judge that the options of using OBA subsidies to support the market-based
       approaches and the rainwater harvesting schemes both provide the most promising
       opportunities to support the extension of irrigation services to smallholder farmers.
      Follow up is required with institutions such as IDEI and Kickstart to develop their
       project proposals in more detail and then assess the potential for them to pre-
       finance the projects and take on the risks associated with tying the release of grant
       funds to the achievement of pre-defined outputs.
      In addition these discussions should explore further the scope to link OBA subsidy
       disbursements to verification that the farmers accessing the irrigation technology
       have actually achieved productivity improvements. These discussions will need to

                                                                                          57
    explore the private sector firm’s appetite to take on these risks given that they do
    not necessarily have control over the effectiveness with which farmers use the
    irrigation equipment.
   Support for larger-scale project opportunities, in our view, will require GPOBA to be
    involved with the projects for a much longer time horizon than is typically covered
    by an OBA supported project.
