smart investment opportunities for businesses, including electric vehicles,
BRT, light rail, and multimodal transport and logistics. The global waste
market is already worth $154 billion and is expected to double by 2020,
while water supply and sanitation services require more than $13 trillion in
investment between 2016 and 2030. Companies are partnering with local
governments to offer low-carbon water savings and recycling services, as
well as waste-to-energy systems. Climate-smart agriculture is also a rapidly
expanding market, as food producers strive to meet growing demand for
modern, sustainable diets. Between 2004 and 2013, global investment in
the agribusiness sector tripled to more than $100 billion. Climate-smart
agricultural practices are gaining ground as businesses seek to address the
combined challenges of food security and climate change.

Government action is accelerating market development. Addressing
climate change requires large-scale economic transformation, with
major changes in the energy system, industrial processes, heating and
cooling, transport systems, urban infrastructure, land use and consumer
behavior. Countries have adopted more than 1,200 climate change laws,
up from 60 two decades ago. Renewables now receive direct policy
support in nearly 150 countries.22

The implementation of the Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)
submitted as part of the Paris Agreement will only accelerate the market
for climate-friendly solutions. Several countries are starting to implement
these targets, with a focus on creating a positive climate for private
investment that results in a pipeline of bankable projects for investors
(Figure 1).



  “The top priority for governments and business should be to
  convert the targets agreed and the pledges made at Paris into
  vibrant markets for climate business. This is the growth story of
  the future, and is the only way to deliver lasting and inclusive
  prosperity.”

2.3	 Creating markets for off-grid solar and
storage
Off-grid solar and storage markets have tremendous promise, but
investors and companies still face risks and barriers. These include a lack
of clarity on the role of off-grid storage in overall national and local
energy plans, a failure to capture the value of off-grid solar and storage
in regulations, challenges with permitting, and low access to finance
on suitable terms.117 Governments can address these risks by taking a
holistic approach that includes target setting, planning for expansion,
smart policies and incentives (including different tariff structures) and
other policies (Figure 5).

In addition to implementing supportive policies, innovative financing
models can help unlock private investment in solar power. Traditionally,
most solar home system business models were based on equity
financing. But as off-grid solar business grows, their capital needs are
changing, and they are increasingly seeking international grants and
equity financing to address the high costs of local debt. One solution
being advanced is US-India Clean Energy Finance, a project preparation
facility that aims to provide access to energy in underserved regions of

A growing number of companies are concerned that the effects of
climate change will disrupt their supply chains and their ability to grow
sustainably and profitably. In addition, more companies are making
commitments to reduce their impact on the environment by, for example,
integrating climate-smart agriculture into their business models, or
pledging to use only renewable energy. Agriculture input providers are
developing innovative technologies to increase production efficiency,
resilience, and yield. These technologies include precision agriculture
(such as use of drones, soil testing, sensors, efficient irrigation, and GPS-
enabled machinery) as well as improved animal nutrition and breeding
methods. Companies are also becoming more fully integrated with local           IFC’s approach to climate-smart

Governments often maintain prices through subsidies for inputs
such as fertilizer, energy, water, and seeds. The Food and Agriculture
Organization recommends that price support and energy subsidies
recognize and reward climate-smart practices, and enable value addition,
commercialization, and trade. For example, input subsidies designed
to support a more efficient and timely use of fertilizers.166 Fertilizer
subsidies can be climate-smart if they increase yield and enhance
plant growth and the storing of carbon in the soil. However, to ensure

The energy efficiency of buildings could be improved by up to nearly 70
percent by enhancing building envelopes and using high-performance
equipment.196 This requires coordination between national and local
policies and across the entire value chain in the building sector. Policy
measures will need to be complemented by investment in research and
development and innovative business models.

ESCOs have emerged as a key business model for improving energy
efficiency in buildings. ESCOs improve energy efficiency in buildings
through energy-savings projects. They typically invest in energy-efficient
technologies for commercial buildings and earn royalties on the energy
savings without owning the building. Generally, the energy savings that
their interventions generate are used to pay back their investment, with
the ESCO bearing the risk if energy savings do not materialize. Royalties    EDGE certification in Ghana:

Direct technical assistance can help build expertise in policy
development, legal and governance frameworks, and implementation
and evaluation of projects. Accreditation systems of building
professionals, accredited training institutions for the construction labor
force, licensing and verifying the credentials of building professionals,
quality control processes for building materials, professional codes of
practice, and other locally meaningful regulatory packages can help
ensure compliance with building codes. For example, the National
University of Singapore provides formal training in energy management
through its Singapore Certified Energy Manager Program. Singapore
also has an accreditation scheme for ESCOs to enhance services.

Governments can use public sector construction to develop experience
in green building through direct technical assistance and workforce
training. Projects to construct green buildings help increase the skills
of people involved in the project and, once complete, the buildings can
be used to showcase green technologies to architects and the public.
Governments can also use these building projects to dispel financial
concerns by making the capital and operating costs publicly available.

As the green debt market matures, green mortgage securities are
emerging. The underlying assets are mortgages, loans, and other debt
instruments. In 2016, Obvion, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rabobank
in the Netherlands, issued the first green residential mortgage-backed
securities, backed by residential loans on new and retrofitted energy-
efficient houses.226

Financial innovations are also targeting green refurbishment and
affordable housing. For example, the Low Carbon Workplace
Fund finances the refurbishment of existing buildings. The fund is
a partnership between the Carbon Trust, fund manager Columbia
Threadneedle Investments and property developer Stanhope. The
business model revolves around acquiring of commercial office buildings
and refurbishing them to high energy-efficiency standards, before leasing
them to commercial tenants. Further, Carbon Trust encourages the
occupiers to minimize their energy consumption and carbon emissions
by ensuring support for day-to-day performance. The fund has invested
in eight properties valued at over £200 million.227 Another innovative
financial solution targets impact investors for affordable housing. IFC
client International Housing Solutions has successfully blended catalytic
and commercial capital to build demand for low-cost green homes in
South Africa. By including such technologies as solar PV and smart
meters, it has achieved EDGE certification for thousands of its new
properties, enabling the real estate investment management company to
measure and market the benefits of its green residential portfolio.228

Outreach initiatives are also helping accelerate the development of a
global asset class for energy-efficiency investment in buildings. The
Investor Confidence Project, developed by the Environmental Defense
Fund is helping to accelerate the development of a global market
by standardizing the way in which energy-efficiency projects and
energy savings are calculated and measured. The project develops
consensus frameworks in the United States and in Europe to provide
a foundation for consistent, predictable, and reliable energy-savings
outcomes. Standardization is expected to increase deal flow and reduce
transaction costs.229

But bringing this technology to emerging markets could be hindered by
infrastructural and regulatory constraints.

The sharing economy is now being used to improve the fleet efficiency
of freight transport. Uber started a freight business recently and is
already drawing competitor start-ups like Doft and Convoy. In emerging
markets, where freight efficiency improvement has huge potential,
start-ups like Huochebang in China and BlackBuck in India are leading
the way in streamlining and maximizing fleet efficiency (see Box 27).
As fewer vehicles are needed with these smart shared mobility systems,
investment opportunities are likely to shift to smaller-scale, specialized
vehicle manufacturing and services and enabling infrastructure.255

Focus on system efficiency and reduce the need for urban commuting
through smart urban planning, land-use efficiency, and transport
demand management. Transport investments and metropolitan land-use
management that lead to concentrated development around mass transit
corridors is not easy to accomplish but is very much in the interest of
cities. City planners and designers in newer, evolving cities in emerging
markets can develop compact, transit-oriented cities that encourage people
to walk (see Box 29). Other measures could include enabling increased
access to information and communications technology for teleworking.

In the context of freight, the avoid strategy can take the form of urban
consolidation centers, which are logistics facilities relatively close to
the geographical area of consumption. Governments can incentivize
the creation of these centers through tax rebates or by subsidizing their
operational costs. Urban consolidation centers have had mixed results

To promote the electric vehicle market, governments have developed
mandates and supporting regulations and increased research and
development spending.261 Research and development efforts have prioritized
improving lithium-ion battery performance, decreasing battery costs, and
enabling large-scale battery manufacturing. Stronger ambition in the electric
vehicle market needs to be complemented by national and subnational
government mandates. For example, California’s 2016 Zero Emissions
Vehicles Action Plan aims to have 1.5 million such vehicles on the road
by 2025.262 Regulations like CAFÉ standards in the United States tighten
maximum emissions from fleets, encouraging the use of electric vehicles.
Mandates around charging infrastructure also play a crucial role in enabling
large-scale use of electric vehicles. For example, according to a China Daily
article, China intends to deploy 100,000 charging stations in 2017.263

Support electric vehicle markets through consumer incentives. These
can take the form of rebates, tax breaks, or exemptions, based on the
technology used or emission levels. Other instruments, typically offered
by municipalities, include exemptions from city-center congestion
charges, free parking, or access to priority lanes.

water infrastructure as a low-return, high-risk investment. To address
this, governments have successfully developed a predictable and reliable
regulatory environment and ensure that regulators are not susceptible
to political interference.302 It is also important that regulators are
properly funded and can attract and retain high-quality staff. Enhancing
governance and legislation, including property and contractual rights,
adequate competition law, and dispute settlement mechanisms, is
essential to attracting the private sector.303 Access to capital markets is
also important.

Avoid public funding crowding out commercial finance. Effective
mobilization and allocation of public finance, through taxes, tariffs,
and subsidies, is crucial for the sector. But this funding should be used
prudently in a manner that does not crowd out opportunities for
commercial finance.304

Ensure financial sustainability and cost recovery. Given the significant
investment required for water and wastewater provision, adequate
cost-recovery mechanisms need to be in place to ensure financial
sustainability. Cost-reflective water pricing is critical to recover costs and

REFUSE-DERIVED FUEL

Refuse-derived fuels are increasingly being used for commercial
purposes. These solid fuels made from processed waste are used as an
alternative fuel in industrial plants (including the cement industry and
coal plants), or directly in a waste-to-energy facility. Co-processing of
waste in cement kilns is already widely employed across the European
Union, but there is large potential for further uptake in other regions.341
For example, in Poland, the cement industry consumes about one-third
of refuse-derived fuels produced.342 Companies are also exploring ways
to convert refuse-derived fuels into aviation fuel, offering the sector a
low-carbon fuel option.343

Electronic waste recycling and reuse is a growing market. “E-waste” is
discarded electronic waste. The global market for e-waste recycling and
reuse was nearly $10 billion in 2012 and is expected to exceed $40 billion
in 2019.350 This growth is driven by increasing e-waste streams and reuse
and recycling rates in emerging markets, particularly China.

STEP 1: ACHIEVE ECONOMIES OF SCALE.

Ensuring adequate waste volume is crucial to justify investment in
infrastructure and technology. Economies of scale and well-managed
reverse supply chains are needed. Aggregating waste flows into high
volumes will ensure more value can be recovered. Developing regional
solid waste management plans and working in partnership with
neighboring cities and regional governments helps to share costs and
risks, and makes the investment more attractive to the private sector.

The Waste Electrical and Electronic Equipment
Centre shows how social education can help ensure
business profitability. In Kenya, an average of 3,000
tons of e-waste is generated each year with little
capacity for proper management. In response, in
2002 the center was established. It is run by local
entrepreneurs and supported by various national
and international sponsors. It sources e-waste
through local campaigns aimed at households and
then separates waste into two streams: repair
and refurbishment and recycling and dismantling.
Worldloop provided seed capital, which is tied to
meeting the center’s collection targets. The center is
now 73 percent self-sustaining.369

The market is innovating. Dutch Bank ING recently launched a new
type of green loan for general corporate expenditures. The loan does
not have conditions for the green use of proceeds; instead, a company’s
overall sustainability performance and rating determine the interest to
be paid on the loan. If the rating goes up, the interest rate goes down—
and vice versa. For example, in April 2017, electronics giant Philips
entered a revolving credit facility of €1 billion with ING using this
approach. The deal is the first in the syndicated loan market where the
pricing is linked to the lender’s sustainability rating. It is supported by a
consortium of 16 banks, including Goldman Sachs, HSBC, and Morgan
Stanley. This innovation recognizes that sustainable companies are
better credit risks and provides an additional incentive for companies
to improve their sustainability performance. ING funded more than

projects are structured in a manner to attract green bond financing
which should in time increase project pipelines.

The growth in green bonds and investor demand indicates that the
market could significantly help increase green capital flows. The size of
the global green bond market stands at $221 billion in 2017, and saw a
six fold rise between 2013 and 2016.390 While this is impressive, there is
ample room for growth.

Initially, the market was driven by multilateral institutions, but now
there is a range of issuers, with an increasing number of corporations,
banks, municipalities, and governments issuing green bonds. The
European Investment Bank, German development bank KfW and the
World Bank are still the largest issuers, but Chinese SPD Bank is in
fourth place, and among corporates, Iberdrola, TenneT Holding, and
French energy companies EDF and Engie round out the top 10.391 The
geographic base is also expanding. Since 2016, about 35 percent of
green bonds were issued in emerging markets.392 The first sovereign
green bond was issued by Poland in December 2016, followed by France
in January 2017. Sovereign issuance is expected to grow; in October
2017, Fiji became the first emerging market to issue a sovereign green
bond, raising 100 million Fijian dollars, or $50 million, to support
climate change mitigation and adaptation.393

Green sovereign bonds allow governments to raise capital to implement
infrastructure plans in line with their NDCs. A sovereign green bond
can provide liquidity and scale to a market, attracting other corporate
issuers and new investors. It can also improve collaboration between
ministries and improve policy certainty in the country. Green bonds
are playing an increasing role in helping cities to finance climate-smart
urban infrastructure. Green bonds issued to fund climate-smart cities
grew to $10 billion in the first half of 2017, up by 61 percent from
the previous year.394 However, few cities in emerging markets have
issued green bonds, largely as a result of their low credit standing.
Johannesburg in South Africa issued a 1.5 billion rand green bond in
2014 and Cape Town issued a 1 billion rand green bond in 2017. These
bonds fund renewable energy, water, and sanitation projects.

Carbon pricing is attractive to business because it generates new revenue
streams that can be used to enhance and support the creation of new
low-carbon markets. In addition to supporting low-income households,
the Carbon Pricing Leadership Coalition reports that revenues have
been used to support low-carbon energy, energy efficiency, research
and innovation, climate-friendly infrastructure, and international
commitments.412 For example, between 2009 and 2012, the states in the
Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in the Northeastern United States
directed more than 70 percent of revenues from their cap-and-trade
program to energy efficiency and renewable energy projects that are
estimated to save consumers more than $2 billion in energy use and
deliver 8 million tons of carbon reductions.413



  “Carbon pricing is a key instrument to anchor addressing climate
  change into our economic system. Putting a price on carbon
  will create an economic incentive to speed up the transition to a
  low-carbon economy and will unlock the private innovation—
  and capital—needed to make the transition from fossil fuels to
  the renewable century. In anticipation of this inevitable policy
  opportunity, over 1,200 businesses—including Royal DSM—are
  already working to ‘future proof’ their companies, by applying an
  internal carbon price, for example to their investment decisions.”

A variety of platforms and initiatives are working to address the
growing need for public-private collaboration that achieves NDC
targets by scaling up private sector investment in climate business. These
include the NDC Partnership (See Box 62), the NDC Invest initiative
led by the Inter-American Development bank,416 the Low-Emissions
Development Strategies Global Partnership, which recently launched the
NDC Investment Accelerator,417 as well as NDCi Global, a community

  “There’s plenty of private investment money potentially available
  for sustainable investing. But investors need clear market signals,
  and a confidence that governments are serious. This is where NDCs
  can help hugely, in setting the direction of travel for the coming
  decades. We now need to develop private-sector friendly policies,
  finance and partnerships that will make these goals a reality.”
