Executive Summary


Background
Rwanda has experienced a remarkable recovery since the civil war, with high growth
since the mid-1990s; gross domestic product (GDP) has grown 10 percent per year on
average. Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy, contributing a third of the
country’s GDP and about half of Rwanda’s export earnings. Because about 80 ­     percent
of the population lives in rural areas and is engaged in agriculture to some extent,
increasing agricultural productivity is key to improving incomes and decreasing pov-
erty. The government of Rwanda (GoR) has therefore made agricultural development
a priority and allocated significant resources to improving productivity, expanding
the livestock sector, promoting sustainable land management, and developing supply
chains and value-added activities. As a result, the sector grew an average 5 percent per
year over 2002–12, which is rather high although it fell short of both the government’s
own objective of 8–9 percent annual growth for the period (revised to 8.5 percent
for the next years in the new Strategic Plan for the Transformation of Agriculture in
Rwanda, PSTA III) and of the Comprehensive Africa Agriculture Development Pro-
gramme (CAADP) commitment of 6 percent growth in the agriculture sector.

At the same time, Rwanda’s agriculture sector faces a series of challenges. Agricultural
land plots are very small (80 percent of land holdings are less than 1 hectare [ha],
often divided into three to four plots), and over 70 percent of agricultural land is either
on hills or on the side of hills. Agriculture is dominated by small-scale, subsistence
farming under traditional agricultural practices and rain-fed agriculture. As a result,
average crop yields are low compared with potential yields, and crops are exposed to
risks such as weather-related shocks and pest and disease outbreaks. Current agricul-
tural policies are geared to increasing productivity in the sector by achieving scale in
agricultural production.

Risks can potentially have significant implications on stakeholders, investments, and
development in the agriculture sector. Adverse movements in agricultural commod-
ity and input prices, together with production-related shocks (for example, from
weather, pests, and diseases), not only affect farmers and firms active in particular

Table ES.3. Proposed Solutions Areas for Agricultural Risk Management in
            Rwanda
 1. Improve water management for crop production
 Water management in the crop sector, in particular to improve practices in preparation for dry periods and scattered rainfall, but
    also to better manage rainfall in the valleys to minimize flooding. Solutions areas may include:
 •  Expansion of on-farm water-harvesting systems
 •  Viable mechanisms for financing small-scale irrigation
 •  Expansion and rehabilitation of drainage infrastructures in valleys
 •  Agricultural practices to improve soil moisture and reduce flooding, including minimum tillage agriculture
 2. Improve water and feed access in the livestock sector
 Weather-risk management in the livestock sector, particularly as it relates to water and feed access. Solutions may include:
 •  Improving rural water infrastructure
 •  Developing existing feed supply chains to temporarily substitute for the lack of pastures in provinces where grazing is allowed
 •  Training of farmers in livestock management in water-scarce situations, and in good hygiene practices with special focus on
    practices in dry periods
 3. Strengthen pest and disease management in crop production
 Pest and disease management for crops, in particular as it relates to potential future risks caused by land consolidation and
    increased monocropping. Similarly, potential changes in pest and disease risks caused by climate change integrated in such
    assessment. Solutions may include:
 •  Improving agricultural practices and pest management, including further developing integrated pest management
 •  Strengthening the crop research system on pest and disease management and resilient crops
 •  Strengthening access to inputs, including developing a network of input dealers
 •  Developing information system on pests and diseases
 4. Develop livestock disease management infrastructure
 Developing livestock disease management infrastructure to mitigate and manage disease outbreaks to decrease the economic
    impact on the sector. Solutions may include:
 •  Developing livestock information systems, including animal registers and disease warning systems
 •  Developing veterinary services and vaccination programs
 •  Strengthening animal reference laboratory capacity
 •  Strengthening regional cooperation in livestock disease management
 5. Strengthen sanitary institutions and practices throughout the livestock supply chain
 Sanitary institutions and practices in the livestock sector, throughout the supply chain and involving both public and private actors.
    As incomes increase, this sector is likely to grow, so the necessary institutional infrastructure must be in place to mitigate risks
    and minimize losses. Solutions may include:
 •  Strengthening animal disease management in relevant institutions
 •  Introducing farm-level livestock management
 •  Increasing capacity of food safety institutions
 •  Improving hygiene practices throughout the supply chain
 •  Mitigating aflatoxin contamination in the feed supply chain

 6. Support improved price risk management in the export crop sector
 Assessing possible price management mechanisms for actors in the export crop supply chain. Given the exposure to international
     prices for actors in the coffee and tea supply chains, scope exists to strengthen price management mechanisms in the sector. By
     analyzing the physical and financial flows on current transaction arrangements for exports, a set of options on how to reduce
     exposure to risk can be identified. Potential solutions areas may include:
 •  Strengthening existing price information systems that allow for transparent price setting throughout the supply chain, and
    training actors throughout the chain to optimize given available information
 •  Providing price risk management training to actors in the supply chain, for example in forwarding Price To Be Fixed (PTBF)
    contracting
 •  Assessing available policy mechanisms for supporting actors in the sector against price risks
 •  Assessing possible production and marketing investments for producers and processors that can lessen relevant actors’ exposure
    to risk
 7. Address milk price volatility
 Analyze milk price volatility to better understand the reasons behind the fluctuations in milk prices. This would include proposing
   appropriate price risk management mechanisms depending on the identified causes behind existing price volatilities.

CHAPTER ONE
INTRODUCTION
Rwanda is a small, landlocked, agriculture-based country of 26,338 km2. With
12 million inhabitants, Rwanda is one of the 10 most densely populated countries in
the world (MINAGRI 2010). Although Rwanda has made remarkable progress over
the past two decades and is well under way to achieve its objective of becoming a
middle-income country by 2020, 45 percent of the population still lives in poverty,
mainly in the rural areas.2

Agriculture is the dominant sector of the economy, contributing a third of the country’s
gross domestic product (GDP) and about half of Rwanda’s export earnings. Because
about 80 percent of the population lives in rural areas and is engaged in agricul-
ture to some extent, increasing agricultural productivity is key to improving incomes
and decreasing poverty. The government of Rwanda has therefore made agricultural
development a priority and allocated significant resources to improving productivity,
expanding the livestock sector, promoting sustainable land management, and develop-
ing supply chains and value-added activities. As a result, the sector grew an average 5
percent per year over 2002–12, which is rather high although it fell short of both the
government’s own objective of 8–9 percent annual growth for the period (revised to
8.5 percent for the next years in the new, PSTA III) and of the CAADP commitment
of 6 percent growth in the agriculture sector.

At the same time, Rwanda’s agriculture sector faces a series of challenges. Agricultural
land plots are very small (80 percent of land holdings are less than 1 ha, often divided
into three to four plots) and over 70 percent of agricultural land is either on hills or on
the side of hills. Agriculture is dominated by small-scale, subsistence farming under
traditional agricultural practices and rain-fed agriculture. As a result, average crop
yields are low compared with potential yields, and exposed to risks such as weather-
related shocks and pest and disease outbreaks.

AGRICULTURE IN THE ECONOMY

Rwanda in the 21st Century
Emerging from the 1994 civil war, Rwanda’s economy has seen a rapid expansion over
the past two decades. Overall growth has averaged 8 percent, exceeding average SSA
growth rates, and Rwanda’s total GDP now amounts to US$7.1 billion (2012 figure).
Inflation is relatively low and the government has maintained general macroeconomic
stability. In the World Bank/IFC Doing Business 2010 report, Rwanda was the world’s
top reformer and now ranks 32 out of 189 countries worldwide in the “ease of doing
business” (World Bank 2009). The government’s vision is for Rwanda to become a
middle-income country with an annual per capita GDP of US$900 by 2020. This will
require annual growth of at least 7 percent.

Nevertheless, Rwanda is still relatively poor, ranking 36 out of 48 SSA countries in
2012 in terms of per capita GDP.3 Real per capita GDP was US$390 in 2012, com-
pared with the SSA average per capita GDP of US$1,522.4 As shown in figure 2.1,
large annual fluctuations in GDP growth rates have occurred over time.

With low per capita GDP, poverty persists in Rwanda. About 63 percent of the popu-
lation lives on less than US$1.25 per day and 82 percent on less than US$2 per day.
Inequality is high: the Gini coefficient is 50.8 percent and 43 percent of the income
share is held by 10 percent of the population.5,6

The composition of GDP is 2013 was 33 percent agriculture, 14 percent industry, and
53 percent services (figure 2.2). Over time, the share of agriculture has declined and
the share of services has increased. Rwanda is a relatively open economy and trade
constitutes almost half of Rwanda’s GDP. The value of imports is close to twice the
size of exports and account for 33 percent of GDP, compared with 13  percent for
exports.

CHAPTER THREE
AGRICULTURE SECTOR RISKS
The identification, analysis, and prioritization of agricultural risks cover three separate
categories of agricultural commodities grown in Rwanda: (1) food crops, (2) export
crops, and (3) livestock. As discussed in chapter 1, the assessment looks at the largest
commodities that jointly account for 80 percent of Rwanda’s agricultural production
value as well as the two largest agricultural export commodities. The selected com-
modities are:

   Food crops: cassava, maize, Irish potatoes, sweet potatoes, plantains, beans, and
      rice
   Export/cash crops: tea and coffee
   Livestock: cattle—meat and dairy

This chapter looks at production risks, market risks, and enabling environment risks
for the commodities in these three categories.

Food Crops
Food crops for domestic consumption dominate primary agriculture and are therefore
the main focus of Rwanda’s Crop Intensification Program. Cassava, Irish potatoes,
sweet potatoes, maize, and bananas are the largest commodities in terms of produc-
tion value and account for 56 percent of total production value (2009–11 average).
Bean production accounts for just over 5 percent of total production but is important
because of its wide application across Rwanda, as 92 percent of rural households
cultivate various varieties of beans (NISR 2012a). Beans are also an important source
of protein.

Largely a result of targeted agricultural policies and expansion of production areas,
maize, cassava, potato, and plantain production increased rapidly in the early to mid-
2000s. As explained earlier (box 2.1), the CIP supports maize, cassava, rice, Irish potato,
bean, and wheat producers with improved inputs; finances research for improved seeds
for these crops; and encourages production on consolidated land through cooperative

CHAPTER FOUR
ADVERSE IMPACTS OF AGRICULTURAL RISK
The existence of agricultural risk has negative consequences for the productivity and
production of agricultural commodities as well as the level of profits and investments
in agribusiness for various supply chains. This can be measured in the form of losses
resulting from the prevalence of various agricultural risks. The purpose of this chapter
is to quantify the production losses for individual food and export crops in different
provinces of the country, as well as the aggregate losses. This is important to under-
stand how frequently risks occur, the volume and monetary value lost in each risk event
or for each crop, and the geographic distribution of these losses. Ultimately, this will
help in identifying and targeting risk management interventions in a way that has the
greatest ability to minimize risk-related losses.

The Methodology Used to Estimate
Production Losses
Losses that occur because of agricultural risks refer primarily to production losses
caused by weather-related events such as droughts, floods, erratic rains, landslides,
hailstorms, and diseases and/or pest outbreaks. The following method was applied to
calculate production losses in a particular year: (1) a historical linear trend line for the
yield of each crop was constructed; (2) a second linear trend line was drawn, represent-
ing one-third of the standard deviation of the crop yields; (3) loss years were identified
as those in which actual yields were lower than the linear trend line; (4) production
losses were calculated using the difference between the predicted value (the original
trend line) and actual yield; and (5) losses were totaled and divided by the total number
of years examined to determine the average annual loss rate for a particular crop; (6)
the annual quantity lost was converted into value terms by using the producer price
for each crop; and (7) because producer prices are in local currency, the value was con-
verted to U.S. dollars using the average exchange rate. Figure 4.1 shows the outcome
of steps (1)–(5) for a hypothetical crop.

Information about the production loss for a particular crop and in a particular year
can also be used to (1) calculate the loss as a share of agricultural GDP for that crop
in a particular year; (2) add production losses for different crops to estimate aggregate

CHAPTER FIVE
RISK PRIORITIZATION AND MANAGEMENT
A variety of risks exist across Rwanda’s agriculture sector. Previous chapters described
the major risks affecting Rwanda’s agriculture sector and specific commodity groups
(food crops, export crops, and livestock), attempted to quantify losses associated with
these major risks, and assessed their impacts on actors in the agriculture sector. Special
attention was given to impacts on Rwanda’s most vulnerable groups and how those
impacts affect men and women differently.

The analysis undertaken during the risk assessment allows for prioritization of risks
in relation to the probability of events and their degree of impact, followed by the
relevant measures to manage these risks. In Rwanda, many programs and activities
funded by government and donors are already in place to make the agriculture sector
more resilient. Furthermore, businesses, individual farmers, and consumers may adopt
other measures, such as managing higher prices and limited availability of certain
commodities by substituting for others. This leads to questions about the effectiveness
of existing activities and the sufficiency of their coverage. Options for better man-
agement, taking into account the capacity to implement and fund them in Rwanda,
should also be considered.

This chapter prioritizes existing risks and provides recommendations for how Rwanda
can more effectively manage risks, based on a consultative stakeholder exercise. It
identifies priority areas for risk management interventions that will be explored in
depth in the Phase II Solutions Assessment.

Risk Prioritization
Identifying and prioritizing risks is an important first step in designing a set of compre-
hensive and effective measures to manage risks. With scarce budgetary resources, it is
crucial that some sort of prioritization takes place to understand the key risks in terms
of frequency of occurrence and degree of impact. Given the data constraints, it is
important to note that this list is not exhaustive and the ranking of risks is based on the
World Bank team’s evaluation from both data analysis and on-the-ground research.
The differing significance of these risks to different stakeholders in society can be

Appendix A
Stakeholder Feedback

Decision Filters
Rwanda, like most countries, is resource constrained and so decision makers are com-
pelled to find the quickest, cheapest, and most effective measures among the options
presented. A detailed cost-benefit analysis can help in selecting the most appropriate
intervention; however, this exercise itself would be costly and time consuming. Fur-
thermore, many elements in making these decisions are not easily quantifiable and
not easy to factor in. Using decision filters to evaluate and prioritize the list could aid
in making rational resource allocation decisions in place of a detailed cost-benefit
analysis.

The following criteria were presented by the World Bank team for this purpose.
A number of complex analytic screening tools are available to assess the various differ-
ent filters and this report does not claim methodological rigor in assessing the filters.
These filters were applied to provide a rapid assessment to obtain some form of priori-
tization based on feedback from key stakeholders.

   Applicability: Whether a government department or a private sector firm,
   there are current policy/programming or business objectives. In an aim to make
   the interventions enter seamlessly into existing practices/plans, it is important
   that the applicability of specific interventions is taken into account.
   Feasibility: Whether it would be/is easy for a government/firm to imple-
   ment this intervention in the short/medium term is an important factor to take
   into consideration; often “quick-wins” will come across as more attractive and
   ­implementable.
   Affordability: One of the most important considerations for anyone getting
   involved in implementing an intervention is whether or not that intervention is
   affordable with regard to current and future budgets.
   Scalability: Whereas an intervention may have positive results in a small pilot,
   it is important for actors to take into consideration whether or not they will be
   able to roll out the intervention to a wider group of affected people.

 Sustainability: Whereas some interventions, such                                                  For Rwanda, three matrixes were drawn up, one each for

 for affected people, for larger and more expensive                                                The results after the application of these decision filters are

 tainable the intervention will be in the long run or                                              ative and imperfect. However, they do provide a first step
 once government funding runs out or resources are                                                 toward development of a more comprehensive and strategic
 directed elsewhere.                                                                               approach for managing risks in Rwanda’s agriculture sector.

Climate Change in Rwanda

Current Conditions
Situated on mountainous terrain in the East African Rift Valley, Rwanda has a tropi-
cal temperate climate (REMA 2009, 97). The hilly terrain produces a diverse range
of agro-ecological conditions in the country, allowing for a wide variety of crops to be
grown but also adding to climate forecasting challenges.

Temperatures in the country vary with altitude, but average annual temperatures
hover between 16°C and 20°C (REMA 2009, 97.).

Rainfall in the country is also shaped by multiple factors. On average, the country
receives 1,250 mm of rainfall annually (Stockholm Environment Institute 2009, 4).
Primary influence of rainfall patterns falls on the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone
where the weather systems of the Northern and Southern Hemispheres meet. The
progression of the ITCZ results in two types of seasons: dry and rainy.

El Niño and La Niña, opposite phases of the El Niño-Southern Oscillation36 (ENSO),
also affect Rwanda, creating heavy rainfall and severe dry conditions, respectively,
when they occur every three to five years (Smith School of Enterprise and the Envi-
ronment 2011a, 4). Furthermore, the Congo air mass, a moist air appendage of the
ITCZ, as well as the Mascarene, Azores, St. Helena, and Arabian high-pressure sys-
tems, and subtropical anticyclones also influence rainfall (Smith School of Enterprise
and the Environment 2011a, 4).

Four seasons divide a calendar year in Rwanda: two rainy seasons, from September to
November and from March to May (figure B.1); and two dry seasons, from December
to February and June to August.

  The El Nino–Southern Oscillation makes up the cyclical temperature fluctuations between the ocean and atmo-
sphere in the East-Central Equatorial Pacific, which occur every 3–5 years. For more information, see NOAA, http://
oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/ninonina.html.

Vulnerability Assessment
Over the past decade, Rwanda has made significant progress in reducing poverty, from
57 percent in 2005/06 to 45 percent in 2010/11. Extreme poverty decreased from
36  percent to 24 percent in the same period. The increase in agricultural productiv-
ity is partly attributable to this achievement. Nevertheless, many groups remain vul-
nerable, not the least in rural areas, where 49 percent of the population lives below
the poverty line compared with 22 percent in urban areas. Overall, 40 percent of
households in Rwanda can be classified as “low-income” agriculturalists; 14 percent
of households rely on both agriculture and unskilled daily labor; and 13 percent rely
solely on agriculture. Further, poverty is higher in female- and widow-headed house-
holds compared with the national average (see table C.1).

Food Crop Supply Chain Analysis

INTRODUCTION
The environment for staple crop production benefits from relatively consistent rainfall,
occurring in two clear seasons, Season A (November to January) and Season B (April
to June), although rainfall may also occur between these periods. Rainfall statistics
indicate that within the rainy seasons, few periods of severe drought have occurred
in the last 30 years, although seasonal variations may be as large as +/−15 percent,
occurring approximately every 10–15 years. At the same time, Rwanda’s elevation at
1,500–4,500 meters above sea level promotes a cooler climate that permits the produc-
tion of a wider range of crops than elsewhere in Sub-Saharan Africa. Potatoes in par-
ticular grow well under the cooler conditions prevailing at higher altitudes; conversely,
at lower altitudes crops such as bananas and rice grow well. Nevertheless, overall the
temperature range is generally below the harsher high temperatures that can curtail
crop growth.

The moist conditions that prevail during the rainy seasons promote the spread of
fungal diseases, whereas the consistent temperatures favor the development of insect
pests. High levels of rainfall contribute to the leaching of soil nutrients and acidifica-
tion of the soil. Moreover, the steep slopes that dominate much of the country render
soils liable to erosion, especially once cultivated. Rwanda’s meteorological conditions
are thus a two-edged sword that favors the growth of crops and their pests and diseases
whereas also promoting soil degradation.

Almost all staple crops (with the exception of rice) are grown by a large proportion of
smallholders, many of whom produce only on a subsistence basis. The average farm
size in 2006 was 0.72 ha. This is insufficient to provide sustainable food security and
in rural areas, agricultural income (including the value of home consumption) aver-
ages RF 120,697 (US$180) and represents only approximately 52 percent of aver-
age household income of RF 235,000 (US$350). Of this amount, home consumption
amounts to approximately 87 percent (NISR 2012b). Given the emphasis on subsis-
tence production, markets have developed based on the commercial surplus that is
sporadically generated and that can vary from season to season. In most cases, prices
