                                                                                           foreword

As the impact of climate change on food production for both developed and emerging economies shapes a
new set of demands worldwide, there is a need to look at how water resources and irrigation can be optimized
to meet the requirements of coming generations. This handbook explores one possible route: the use of
public private partnerships (PPPs). PPPs have the potential to facilitate an expanded role for the private sector
in irrigation, mobilize expertise in the sector, and ensure medium- to long- term sustainability. This handbook
compiles some of the most useful international experiences in irrigation PPPs while offering suggestions to
practitioners on strategies and approaches to better harness public and private resources.

It is worth noting that the irrigation sector has not changed its basic developmental paradigm for over 60 years.
This model relies on public funding for capital investment combined with public management and supply of
water resources to farmers at highly subsidized rates. Yet the last few decades have witnessed a significant
decline in investment in irrigation projects in the developing world. One reason may be that the traditional
public model does not serve either governments or citizens as it was first intended to. I believe strongly that
we should consider combining public and private enterprise and expertise to better face changes that are
inevitable.

Governments, public authorities, and others interested in designing and tendering sustainable PPPs in the
irrigation sector will benefit from this handbook. It has been designed first and foremost as a practical guide,
including a checklist at the conclusion of each chapter so that project managers can track progress on necessary
tasks related to policy and implementation of PPPs. It’s important to point out that this guide was written by
experts with significant experience in irrigation PPPs around the world, and because they are familiar with
different agricultural and geopolitical scenarios, they lay out likely obstacles alongside pragmatic solutions.

Climate change, constraints on water resources, the looming food security crisis, and accelerating urbanization
compel us to come up with original solutions to challenges faced by people across the globe. When it comes
to irrigation PPPs, “business as usual” is no longer an option. This toolkit is the first step toward implementing
policies and practices that can strengthen the irrigation sector for generations to come.

Ability to pay. It is a maximum amount a representative farmer can be expected to be able to contribute
toward financing the costs of specific plan to develop operate, maintain and/or rehabilitate irrigation
infrastructure under assumed or forecasted technology, policy and market conditions.1

Agricultural Value Chain. A “value chain” in agriculture identifies the set of actors and activities that bring
a basic agricultural product from production in the field to final consumption, where at each stage value is
added to the product. Value can be added vertically through the linkages or steps between cultivation and
final consumption or horizontally through the network of independent, though interdependent business
organizations and can involve processing, packaging, storage, transport and distribution.2

Bankability. A measure of a project’s suitability for commercial financing that typically includes factors related
to the service charges that can be levied by the irrigation service provider on users of the irrigation service and
whether project risk allocation protects the irrigation service provider sufficiently.

	Bid Bond: A written guarantee provided by the private party to the procuring authority. The bid bond is
intended to ensure that if selected, the bidder will proceed with the contract. It is also known as a “bid
submission guarantee”. The bid bond is generally returned to the successful bidder on effectiveness of the
relevant contract or on financial close.

Build-Own-Operate (BOO). PPP Contracts in which the private company is responsible for constructing the
assets. The private company is then responsible for owning, operating and maintaining the assets during the
life of the contract. BOO contracts are similar to BOT contracts except that the assets developed by the private
sector as part of its contractual responsibilities are not transferred to the government.

Build-Own-Transfer (BOT). PPP Contracts in which the private company is responsible for constructing the
assets. The private company is then responsible for owning, operating and maintaining the assets during the life
of the contract, but at the end of the contract period the assets are transferred back to government.

Commercial viability. The commercial viability of a PPP project defines the extent to which it has the potential
to offer a private firm a sufficient financial return to enable it to recover any capital and operational costs as well
as a suitable financial return on any investment given the opportunity cost involved.

	Commercial viability. The commercial viability of a PPP project defines the extent to which it has the potential
to offer a private firm a sufficient financial return to enable it to recover any capital and operational costs as well
as a suitable financial return on any investment given the opportunity cost involved.

Competitive procurement. A competitive bidding procedure in the PPP context begins with the government’s
description of its requirements and an invitation to the private firms to indicate their interest in the contract
and their professional capacity to fulfil it. The government (i.e., contracting authority) then identifies potential
suppliers and invites them to submit bids.3

Concession. A grant of economic rights of a public asset in an administrative law jurisdiction to a private party
by the government, including the legal title to possess the site of the land. It may also refer to a PPP contract
that is generally reserved for contracts where the majority of revenue comes from users.

Construction risk. Risk involved in constructing and as appropriate rehabilitate the bulk irrigation assets of the
scheme.

Contracting authority. Synonymous with “government,” either national, regional or local, in the context of PPP
irrigation projects described in this handbook. The public counterparty to a PPP (most often a signatory to the
contract). Contracting authorities may have some or all of the roles and responsibilities set out below:

     •	 Formulating sector policy
     •	 Procuring assets
     •	 Regulating contracts
     •	 Monitoring and evaluating project performance
     •	 Operation of selected assets
     •	 Ownership of the assets

The role and responsibilities assigned to authorities may differ depending on individually specific mandates or
charters.

Demand risk. Risk of in insufficient user volumes compared to base case assumptions.4

Design-build-finance-operate-transfer (DBFOT). PPP Contracts in which the responsibility for design and
	
financing is explicitly transferred the private company. The private company is also responsible for constructing,
operating and maintaining the assets during the life of the contract, but at the end of the contract period the
assets are transferred back to government

Design-Build-Operate (DBO). Contracts in which the private sector designs, builds and operates the assets to
meet certain agreed outputs, while the public sector typically owns and finances the construction of the assets.

Developer. In most cases, the private sector partner in a PPP contract. See Private Partner.

Divestiture. Form of private sector participation whereby the government sells all publically owned irrigation
assets to the private sector. In this situation, the private firm takes on indefinite ownership and responsibility for
all aspects of the scheme including construction, rehabilitation, operations and maintenance.

Due diligence. A process of examining and analyzing every aspect of a project (financial, technical, legal,
market, and so on) to fully understand its risks, cash flows, and overall sustainability.

Expression of Interest (EOI). First stage of the competitive procurement procedure which enables the
government to gauge the level of interest in the project from private companies.

Financial close. The point in time when all financial arrangements become contractually binding and thus the
private firm is, subject to satisfaction of any outstanding conditions, ready to draw on the funding available for
the project.

“First-demand” bonds. A means of protection against non-performance of a contractual obligation by the
private partner. These bonds are callable without the government having to show that the private partner has
defaulted

Force majeure. An event beyond the control of any project party that significantly (and often adversely) affects a
project. Examples of force majeure events include natural disasters or political unrest, shortage of water due to a
natural disaster etc.

Free-riding. In the context of an irrigation scheme refers to a situation in which individual farmers seek to
benefit from the irrigation services without contributing to the costs of providing such services.

Gearing. The relative proportion of debt to equity in the capital structure of a project company. Highly geared
companies have a greater amount of debt relative to the portion of equity that is provided by the sponsor of the
project company. See also definition for leverage.

Grantor. In most cases, the public sector, or government partner in a PPP. See also Contracting Authority.

Greenfield irrigation scheme. Such schemes refer to the development of irrigation infrastructure on a new site
where there is no need to rehabilitate or modernize existing structures.

Guarantee. One party’s agreement to endure the consequences of risks otherwise born by some other party,
typically involving a commitment to provide a minimum amount of remuneration, in the event that revenues are
insufficient.

Hydrology/ scarcity risk. The risk that the source of the water supply on which the irrigation scheme will rely
will not be sufficient to provide the contracted service, for instance due to drought or flood damage, or
allocation of water to other users.




World Bank Group | PPIAF | How to Achieve Sustainability in Irrigation with Private Sector Participation 	               xi
Irrigation and drainage services. Better delivery of water to, and drainage of water from, arable land, including
better timing, quantity, quality, and cost-effectiveness for the water users.5

Improved irrigation and drainage services. Upgrading, rehabilitation, and/or modernization of irrigation and
drainage services in an area with existing irrigation and drainage services.6

Informal irrigation schemes. Sections of the irrigation sector, which have established themselves without
public funding and official recognition, that is outside of government-initiated “formal irrigation schemes”.7

In-kind payment. Payment made with goods and/or services, typically agricultural produce and/or labor, rather
than cash.

Irrigation potential. Area of land, which is potentially irrigable.8

Lease/affermage contract. A lease or affermage contract is similar to a concession contract, but with
government typically remaining responsible for providing the capital expenditure funding which may be partially
or totally executed by the private party. 9

Leverage. An alternative term for gearing and the degree of debt a project involves. Highly-leveraged projects
involve greater amounts of debt relative to equity.

Management contract. A contractual arrangement in which a private party is paid a fee for managing a
part or all of the existing irrigation assets. Such contracts do not transfer responsibility for capital investment
mobilization to the private party. The fee that is payable to the private party typically consists of a fixed and
variable portion, with the variable portion being linked to the achievement of pre-specified performance targets.

New irrigation and drainage services. Provision of irrigation and drainage services in an area that has not had
these services before. The area is not necessarily newly cropped or newly productive land, but is newly provided
with irrigation and drainage services, and may have been rain-fed before.10

Non-recourse or limited recourse finance. This form of financing a project is also referred to as project
finance in which the lenders to the scheme can only take security (also referred to as collateral) on the basis of
the project in question and have no recourse or ability to return to the project sponsors in the event that the
project fails or requires more funding. In limited recourse structures sometimes project sponsors are required to
provide some form of corporate guarantee that promises to mobilize more financial resources should they be
needed to repay the lenders, but the notion of non-recourse implies that the project itself – and the revenues it

generates—are the main form of security that lenders will take. This implies that the contract itself can be used
as security by the lenders and therefore the lenders have the right to substitute one or all parties to the contract
subject to the prior authorization of the contracting entity, authority or government.

On-farm management. On-farm irrigation equipment owned (or sometimes leased) by the farmer (includes
sprinkler irrigation, drip irrigation, treadle pumps etc.) and the associated water management practices.11

Operation, maintenance and management (OMM). Function of the irrigation scheme which includes the
management of water allocation, general system maintenance, and possibly provision of support services (e.g.
farmer training) and collecting fees from irrigation scheme users.

Operational water user association. Number of water user associations that regularly meet; collect and retain
membership fees; use their resources to carry out, or have carried out, operation and maintenance works; and
have a decisive voice in water allocations.12

Patient capital. Long-term subordinated capital invested at sub-commercial costs.

Performance-based payments. Payments conditional on a private firm fulfilling pre-determined outputs or targets.

Performance bonds. A performance bond is an amount of money lodged with a neutral third party, such as a
bank or financial institution, which the Government may claim in the event the private partner breaches pre-
specified obligations detailed in the PPP contract.

Post-bid negotiation. Stage in the competitive procurement process, in which the government and the winning
bidder enter into additional dialogue which enables them to agree upon the final contract

PPP13. A long-term contractual arrangement between a public entity or authority and a private entity
for providing a public asset or service in which the private party bears significant risk and management
responsibility.

PPP contract. This is the document (or collection of documents) that governs the relationships between the
various parties involved directly and indirectly with the provision of services under the contract, defining the
allocation of responsibilities and rights, and which provides mechanisms that can be used to enable the parties
to deal with unforeseen changes to meet the ultimate objectives of the contract.

PPP contract manager. In the context of irrigation schemes, this term refers generally to the public entity within
a defined government institution, which represents the public interests set out in the PPP contract and is the
main point of contact within the government on all matters relating to the PPP project.

PPP project steering group. Part of the management team overlooking the completion of the competitive
	
procurement process. This would include representatives from the key government agencies that are relevant to
the project and individuals with the necessary technical expertise to review and evaluate the bids.

Private partner. The counter party of the contracting authority in the PPP contract. A private entity which has
been granted the contract to construct and operate a government asset, and which is usually created under
the form of a Special Purpose Vehicle or SPV (see Special Purpose Vehicle). It may also refer to the shareholder
members of the SPV, however these are more accurately defined as “equity investors” or “shareholders”.

	
Project definition. Refers to the early stage concept design work that examines various alternatives for the PPP
and is carried out before the full feasibility phase to define the service need, identify desired outputs as well as
the possible project partners.

Project feasibility analysis. Refers to a series of feasibility or appraisal criteria against which the project is
tested to assess its suitability as a PPP and which includes the notion of sustainability both in terms of the
scheme itself, its benefits to the ultimate users and its bankability. Such feasibility analysis is typically undertaken
once the business case has been made for the proposed project to proceed as a PPP and the project has been
designed to a preliminary level.

Project structuring. Process to ensure that the proposed project involves an appropriate mix of public and
private participation in the project; i.e. that there is an efficient transfer of risk between the key stakeholders
involved, which is then formalized in the PPP contract.

Public service delegation (PSD) contracts. Contracts in which the private firm is paid according to its
operational performance and where the private sector usually has to collect fees directly from the end user
(farmers, in the case of irrigation projects) and is not paid directly by a single party, which is typically the public
sector client. Alternatively PPP deals can be structured to include payments directly from the government to the
private firm, which may augment existing collections by such private firms.

Request for Proposals (RFP). Second stage of the competitive procurement process, involving submission of
technical and financial proposals.

Service contracts. Arrangements in which a private sector firm is contracted to carry out a support service for
the irrigation scheme, such as issuing the bills to the farmers using the irrigation services. These are different to
management contracts, which usually include a more comprehensive set of activities, and are generally agreed
for a longer time period.

Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). Specific company formed for the purpose of the PPP project by the private firm
taking on the financing responsibilities associated with the scheme.

Sustainability of an irrigation scheme. This refers to the long-term abilities of all parties to the contract (i.e.,
the public authority which has granted the PPP, the private firm(s) that provide the services, and the beneficiaries
of the services) to benefit in a sustained way from the project. For the private sector in particular this implies
being able to operate and maintain the scheme profitability14. Revenue from water user fees (both connection
fees and consumption fees) is sufficient to enable the recovery of operations and maintenance (O&M) and
any capital investment. Sustainability is thus linked to a viable agricultural value chain, as the level of fees that
farmers will be able to pay will ultimately be dependent on the increased income that they will achieve as a
result of the irrigation services.

Tariff. Monetary compensation due per amount of water made available by the relevant irrigation service
provider. Generally the price per unit of water changes according to the monthly consumption based on a water
pricing scheme.15

Transaction phase. This phase of a PPP arrangement is concerned with moving a project from the planning
stages to implementation. Detailed work is undertaken to translate plans into tangible financial agreements and
to procure the necessary goods and services.

Unsolicited bids. An unsolicited proposal refers to any proposal received by a government agency that was not
requested by the government, and that usually originates within the private sector.16

User equity and safeguarding. The principle whereby the PPP project should favor public interest, safeguard any
particularly vulnerable groups and set charging and tariff structures so as to be both affordable and equitable.

Viable business opportunity. A business opportunity that has ability to generate profit over a long-period of
time and remain operational.

Viability Gap Funding (VGF). These funds use resources sourced from the national budget to provide up-front
subsidies for infrastructure projects

Water conveyance. The system (including the physical primary system, associated equipment and any
regulations) used to carry water from mobilization to distribution (e.g., main canals, natural river, pipelines).

Water distribution. Stage in the irrigation value-chain which involves the delivery of the water through
secondary or tertiary canals or through pipelines

Water mobilization. Initial stage in the irrigation system value chain which involves exploiting the water
resource (diversion weirs, wells), storing it (dams, tanks) and managing it under a regulatory framework.

Water users. Recipients of irrigation and drainage services, i.e., the owners or, in case the land is leased, the
lessees of the land provided with irrigation and drainage services.

Water-user association. Groups of water users receiving irrigation and drainage services. The associations may
have different names according to local practice or national legislation.

Water-user charge. The contracted charge for beneficiaries of the water service, often expressed in cost per
hectare served or cost per cubic meter used.

Water Use Efficiency. It is a measure of yield per unit water applied.

Willingness to pay. It is the largest amount of money an individual can pay for a service, or good, without being
made worse of. Willingness to pay is conditioned on ability to pay.

HOW TO
use this book

This is a handbook designed to guide governments, public authorities and other interested stakeholders in the
process of designing and tendering sustainable Public-Private Partnership (PPP) arrangements in the irrigation
sector. It takes a practical, step-by-step approach in describing what a government needs to do in preparing
and implementing a PPP irrigation scheme from inception. The handbook takes account of the various stages of
the irrigation value chain and how to handle private sector participation in irrigation schemes of different sizes
and types. It assumes that governments have already made the underlying policy decision to embark on a PPP
in irrigation, and therefore does not dwell on the rationale for undertaking a PPP.

The handbook’s practical aspects are contained in four, stand-alone chapters that follow an over-arching
Executive Summary and an Introduction. The chapters are deliberately numbered to coincide with the four
steps that a government should take in establishing an irrigation PPP: Preparation, Structuring, Procurement
Management, and Implementation. In addition, each chapter concludes with a practical Checklist to help
executives keep track of the necessary tasks in each step on the way to establishing a sustainable PPP operation.


The chapters

The chapters are designed to be read as stand-alone guides, out of an understanding that institutions using
the book may already have completed prior steps. Nevertheless, it would be prudent for users to acquaint
themselves with the entire handbook so as to develop a holistic view of the requirements for a full PPP project.
For, although the handbook is replete with PPP case studies and examples, as well as likely obstacles and
pragmatic solutions, every project is unique and should be structured according to its own circumstances
and conditions; there is no one-size-fits-all PPP structure. Nevertheless, the handbook is particularly useful,
even unique, in providing a financial model by which users can gain a quick understanding of the revenue
implications of an irrigation PPP and link these to capital needs do as to assess the viability of that undertaking.

Chapter One: Preparation is divided into two parts, A and B (each with its own concluding Checklist). Part
A reviews the scope for introducing PPPs into the irrigation sector, identifying the issues that policymakers
should consider from the outset in order to make the private sector’s involvement feasible with a specific
irrigation project. It touches briefly on the rationale for PPPs in irrigation before focusing on aspects such as
feasibility and risk assessments, determining financial viability and stakeholders’ roles and responsibilities. Part B
discusses the irrigation as a business. It contains a variety of case studies—the first time such studies have been
documented—with discussion of lessons learned, PPP types, transfer of investment functions in developing
countries, competitive bidding, and third party involvement among the subjects covered.

Chapter Two: Structuring a PPP sets out the various tasks that must be completed to structure a sustainable
PPP contract. It looks at establishing commercial viability, contractual structure, risk allocation, defining key
performance indicators, approaches to financing, finance sourcing and related topics.

Chapter Three: Managing Procurement examines how to select a private contractor, which involves such
factors as the fiscal commitments to the PPP, to what extent the process should be competitive and how that
might be conducted and managed, and what issues are peculiar to PPPs in irrigation.

Chapter Four: Implementation highlights management of the contract and establishment of those
management structures, monitoring, penalties and grantor’s rights, use of performance bonds, enforcement of
customer payments, dealing with changes to the contract, and contract expiry and asset handover.

The overall structure of the handbook is illustrated below. The handbook is supported by three annexes: Annex
1 explains how to use the Excel Options Assessment Tool, , and Annex 2 provides case studies of 29 existing or
emerging irrigation PPPs.

This handbook is intended as a practical guide for governments, public authorities, and other interested
stakeholders to design and tender sustainable public-private partnership (PPP) arrangements in the irrigation
sector. The report should be relevant to all governments seeking to stimulate increased private sector participation
(PSP) across different stages of the irrigation value chain and in irrigation schemes of different sizes and
characteristics.

Governments, increasingly, are seeking to address the complex issue of targeting investments and improving
the use of scarce water resources in irrigation for agriculture to achieve growth and rural development. It is
noteworthy that the irrigation sector has not changed its basic developmental paradigm for over 60 years — i.e.,
public funding for capital investment combined with public management and supply of water resources to farmers
at highly subsidized rates. But this archetype is beginning to change with the exigencies of climate change,
constraints on water resources, and the need for increased agricultural yields to resolve food security. Governments
are conceding that public resources are limited and they need to prioritize and achieve better value for money
in their agricultural sectors. The challenge is made more compelling by the fact that water is just one of several
inputs in the overall agricultural-sector value chain, and the irrigation sub-sector itself faces many challenges. One
possible solution that is gaining acceptance is the concept of combining public and private expertise in order to
improve sector management and delivery of irrigation services.

Over the past 60 years the increasing emphasis on irrigation has been one of the major trends in agricultural
development globally. As a result of massive investments in water development schemes, irrigation today provides
water to one-fifth of the world’s cultivated land, from which one-third of food crops are harvested. Much of this
investment has taken place in developing countries, and many of the world’s poorest people are dependent on
food produced on irrigated land.

There are several reasons for this decline in investment at both construction and operation phases:

Lower levels of investment in irrigation schemes. While some irrigation systems have operated successfully
for long periods of time, high and increasing construction costs of the schemes, poor production performance of
many irrigation systems, falling real prices of crops, and concerns about negative environmental impacts of projects,
have slowed the rate of irrigation investment. This also has significantly reduced the willingness of donors and
international financial institutions to invest in irrigation activities. At the same time the increasingly tight financial
position of many governments, the various competing demands notably from urban development17, has hampered
their ability to raise funds for irrigation projects from local budgets.


17	The urban population of the world has grown rapidly since 1950, from 746 million to 3.9 billion in 2014. Globally, more people live in urban areas (54 percent
   in 2014) than in rural areas. The number of mega-cities has nearly tripled since 1990; and by 2030, 41 urban agglomerations are projected to house at least 10
   million inhabitants each. Today’s large cities are concentrated in the global South, and the fastest-growing agglomerations are medium sized cities and cities
   with 500,000 to 1 million inhabitants located in Asia and Africa (Adapted from United Nations (2014), World Urbanization Prospects: The 2014 Revision)

Lack of financing for operations and maintenance. In addition, the dramatic expansion of irrigated areas around
the world has not been matched by a similar expansion in the mobilizing of financial resources for the management
of irrigation systems after construction. Consequently, in many systems water is wasted in the upper parts and
unavailable in the lower-end sections, while water deliveries are often untimely and unreliable. Pumping stations,
canals, sluice gates, and metering systems, have been allowed to fall into disrepair. In general, only about 25–30
percent of water diverted into large canal systems in developing countries reaches the crops needing it.

Insufficient cost recovery. Low water user fees and poor recovery rates risk the efficient maintenance of existing
water infrastructure as well as the additional investments in future water-development projects. In many developing
countries irrigation user fees are extremely low. Attempts to collect them have been equally inadequate resulting in
cost recovery levels that fall short of even modest targets, such as recovery of operational and maintenance costs.
User fees often do not adequately cover the cost of production. Moreover, this pattern of financing creates a vicious
cycle: financial difficulties cause irrigation departments to defer maintenance to the detriment of the water system,
leading farmers to complain about poor service for which they have little incentive to pay. Meanwhile, the politically-
rooted system of public provision and subsidized water charges separates the water economy from the influence of
actual market forces.

Lack of a consistent and comprehensive irrigation policy. Finally, government efforts to improve the management
of irrigation have focused mostly on building hydraulic infrastructure and on the creation of physical capital in the
form of dams, aqueducts, diversion weirs, and canals, and less on institutional and implementation arrangements.
However, persistent problems with the design, construction, operation, management, and use of irrigation projects
have led donors and national governments to re-evaluate the emphasis on engineering and technical design in
irrigation planning and management. Lack of appropriate government oversight and technical expertise to implement
the projects has taken its toll over the years. The inherent issues at contractual level remain and, in the longer term, as
political regimes change, the arrangements are often left in decline.


Response to the challenges

A major response to these pressures has been for governments to delegate management responsibility to other
entities, notably third parties such as water user associations or private companies. However, along with the
pressures to decentralize and transfer the management of irrigation systems comes a need to understand the
factors that contribute to the success of irrigation schemes over the long term. Understanding how to design and
manage this sub-sector optimally is necessary if market forces are to succeed in improving the performance and
sustainability of irrigation systems.

Bringing private participation into this sector is complicated. It is necessary to develop a better understanding of
whether and how the private sector can deliver better service. The system needs to be designed in a sustainable
manner, not only from an engineering and environmental perspective, but also in terms of operations and
maintenance, including linkages (if any) between production and capital investment. Appropriate institutional
arrangements and contractual frameworks need to be put in place which would transfer seamlessly from one

implementation arrangement to the next. Most importantly, the right incentives need to be created for the private
sector, farmers, public agencies, and others to perform together to achieve a sustainable scheme for everyone.
Critical to the design of irrigation PPPs is the way construction is made, how investment is recovered throughout
the life of the scheme, and the manner by which agricultural offtake is linked to the scheme. In addition, the
challenge of the co-existence between agricultural businesses and subsistence farmers needs careful consideration
to ensure long term viability but also to protect those most vulnerable and provide the right conditions for long
term sustainability and economic development with equal opportunities for all.


PPPs in irrigation are still evolving

There are few examples of PPPs in irrigation in the developing world, and where they do exist results are mixed
and success limited. Given the complexity and nascent track record of PPPs in irrigation, concessional financing
in one form or another has been the primary modus operandi to enable private sector involvement. This fact
underlines the recognition that - in most cases - a measure of public support is needed to make the schemes
sustainable. This is because typically the required level of investment is far greater than what can reasonably be
recovered through user fees alone.18 The following table lists selected cases and their main characteristics:

18	Under PPP schemes the revenue that the project generates is used to service debt for construction, pay O&M and ensure a reasonable return on investment
   to the private party. Strictly speaking user charges are set to meet all these factors within the prescribed contract period. Given that contract periods cannot
   be too long given the uncertainty this generates to the private party (it would be unreasonable to expect a private party to recover its money over too greater
   a period of time), user fees end up being quite high. This results in affordability challenges which force authorities to set such fees to a “reasonable” level. In
   many instances in the irrigation sector, such affordability constraints together with the reality of not being able to have too long a contract period, mean that
   project revenues need to be augmented by public funds. The forms in which the public sector can support are discussed in later chapters but may include
   capital grants or revenue payments amongst others.

Conclusion: Is there a role for the private sector in delivery of water in irrigation?

As this incipient market evolves, the need to create the necessary linkages between the private and public
sectors is becoming increasingly apparent. Regardless of the level of private sector involvement—whether in
the construction, financing, agricultural production, or all phases—it is evident that some form of active public
sector collaboration is needed to help projects succeed. This revolves around the fact that irrigation PPPs
need a “market” to encourage investment in assets which have a long-term life, yet provide the necessary
incentives to both public and private parties to ensure sustainability. Innovation is needed in structuring projects
and applying imaginative and pragmatic mechanisms, whether in contract design, financing structures, or
procurement process.

A number of other factors, too, will determine success. It is important to recognize that the novelty of private
participation in the sector, insufficiency of long-term capital markets, and the balancing of subsistence farming’s
needs with those of agri-business in some emerging economies will strongly influence the design and type of
PPP structure that is to be developed. Accordingly, strategies and projects must be adapted to new market
conditions; these should include an early focus on viability of the proposed scheme, a clear delineation of
roles between the construction of assets, their maintenance, and operation, and the production of agricultural
goods. Flexibility in bidding to allow financial close and, most importantly, rethinking the manner of government
support—both financial and regulatory—will be key to foster the development of PPPs in irrigation

Background to the irrigation sector

The use of irrigation in the agricultural sector, when combined appropriately with other inputs, has been key to
increasing the productivity of agricultural production around the world—a vital factor in helping governments
to manage the growing demand for food caused by demographic pressures and changing dietary habits. For
instance, when used in conjunction with high-quality inputs, irrigation can raise cereal production to 7,500 kg per
hectare, compared to around 2,000 kg per ha under rain-fed conditions.19

Upward demographic pressures are expected to continue to about 2050 when the world population is expected
to level out at about 9 billion, from 7.2 billion currently. Moreover, as people become wealthier their dietary
habits change to include more meat, fruit, and vegetables and less staple food items. The challenge for the
irrigation sector is how to grow more food in the face of a range of environmental concerns such as water
shortages, poor water quality, soil-land degradation, climate uncertainty, land take for commercial and other
developments, as well as political interests. Agricultural commodity prices have shown a sustained upward
trend since 2008 with several sharp peaks, and many countries are increasingly vulnerable. There is thus a
renewed need for investment to develop new irrigation schemes and improve performance of existing schemes.
The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO), the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), and
International Water Management Institute (IWMI) together estimate that irrigation will need to provide at least
half the required increase in food production to meet demand over the next 30 years.

However, despite the continued importance of irrigation, the pace of expansion in the coverage of irrigation
schemes has slowed in recent years. The FAO estimates that the growth of irrigation development was around
2 percent per annum in the 1960s and 1970s, but fell back to around 1 percent in the 1990s. In addition, there
is a question about where the funds for investment in irrigation schemes will come from. Commitments from
development partners have decreased significantly, to around $2 billion from the peak of $2.5-$3 billion in the
mid-1980s, and government resources are often constrained. As a result, there is growing interest in finding ways
for the private sector to play in helping to raise investment in irrigation.

Coverage of irrigation schemes around the world

Statistics suggest that of the total global potential of about 500 million ha irrigable land, roughly 230 million ha is
currently under irrigation,20 covering some 20 percent of all cultivated land.21 Figure A.2 illustrates the overall level
of agricultural land under irrigation as a share of the total irrigation potential across the developing regions.22

As the Figure above shows, the South-East Asian (SEA) region accounts for most of the world’s irrigated area. It is
also worth noting that in regions such as Europe and Central Asia (ECA), Latin America and Caribbean (LAC), and
Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), significant amounts of land that could be irrigated are currently undeveloped.

The World Bank 2007 report summarizes the most common types of irrigation schemes present across different
regions. An adaptation of this summary is presented in a table on the next page, indicating that publically managed,
large-scale schemes are most prominent in the world’s developing regions, in particular SSA, SEA, Middle East and
North Africa (MENA), and ECA. Many of the publically managed schemes in these regions were initially developed
to support the production of subsistence food crops rather than for commercial reasons. However, in recent years
there has been rapid growth, especially in SEA, in small individual schemes. Collective, large-scale public schemes
no longer predominate in this region, although they remain an important provider of irrigation water.

What makes a PPP scheme sustainable?

For a PPP scheme in irrigation to be sustainable, it would need to generate sufficient revenues over time
from either water use fees or subsidies to enable the private firm to recover any capital investments, as well
O&M costs. As the handbook shows, sustainability is linked to a viable agricultural value chain, as the level of
charges that farmers will be able to pay will ultimately depend on the increased income that they will achieve
from the irrigation services. Long-term sustainability of a project depends on several factors, ranging from
balanced bid and contract design to allocating risks fairly between the government and its private partner(s),
to gaining commitment from the various stakeholders to improved service delivery. It is also critical to ensure
sustained change so as to facilitate delivery of long-term benefits for a long time after the transaction has been
completed.23


How and why this handbook was developed?

This discussion draws on published research by organizations such as the World Bank Group, the Public-
Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), the
Asian Development Bank (ADB), Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) and a variety of individual authors.
However, although it draws extensively on some of these reports, this handbook is original in presentation.

The value-add of this report is in its systematic, project-based focus on how to prepare, structure, and implement
a PPP project specific to irrigation. The handbook is not confined to any geographical region, but seeks to
highlight common solutions to downstream issues normally encountered when setting up and conducting
financial and legal due diligence for any irrigation PPP project. It is exclusively focused on PPPs in irrigation
worldwide, while the reports and references listed in the Reference chapter are mostly focused on (i) the
irrigation sector in general with emphasis on technical aspects relating to a specific country, (ii) water supply &
sanitation in general, or (iii) upstream issues only that attract the private sector to irrigation schemes with limited
geographical coverage.

While this book (and each of its four process-related chapters) is designed to be stand alone, readers will benefit
by reading it in conjunction with four studies in particular:

     •	 “Approaches to Private Participation in Water Services: a Toolkit.” 2006. Funded by the PPIAF, this report
        outlines PPP models, the planning process for introducing private participation, setting of standards, and
        common risks in water-sector partnerships. This paper (also funded by the PPIAF) includes some of the
        same processes in its focus on the emerging irrigation PPP sector.

     •	 “Emerging PPPs in Irrigation Development and Management.” 2007. This PPIAF discussion paper classifies
        irrigation schemes and maps case studies that are included in Chapter One of this handbook.

        “Public-Private Partnerships Certification Guide”, 2016 for the “CP3P”24. This is a comprehensive reference
     •	 	
        manual on a good PPP practice exhaustive in scope, coverage, application and detail. The Guide is
        organized around the stages of a PPP project and is supported by case studies and examples around the
        world.

     •	 “PPP Reference Guide, Version 2.0.” 2014. This is a PPIAF report that examines the details of a PPP project
        cycle, from the basics of PPPs, establishing PPP frameworks, and implementing PPP projects. While
        the Reference Guide provides in-depth knowledge about PPPs in general, this handbook applies that
        knowledge specifically to irrigation-sector PPPs.

The purpose of this handbook is to highlight the best practices noted in previous reports, selected case studies,
and discussions about the irrigation sector; further refine them, and present a roadmap by which to structure a
PPP irrigation scheme just about anywhere in the world (see Figure below) . The roadmap outlines the specific
tasks to be undertaken during each phase of project preparation and execution. Each phase concludes with a
distinctive result as shown on the next page:

    Chapter 1 sets the foundation on which an irrigation scheme should be developed. Given
    the amount of detail in Chapter One, it has been divided into Part A and B. The Part A
    focuses project definition and feasibility assessment; the end product should be a clear
    business case demonstrating why the proposed project is a good investment decision.
    Part B explores whether an irrigation scheme can be a business opportunity to the private
    sector and examines various PPP arrangements currently functional in the market. Case
    studies of emerging and existing irrigation PPPs are explored in detail to support the
    principles of a sustainable irrigation PPP scheme throughout the Handbook.

PREPARATION: PART A

                      As illustrated in Figure 1.1, the first stage of a PPP irrigation scheme preparation is centered on appraising
                      the project to ensure a sound business case. Whether public or private, the foremost objective should be to
                      set up a system that maintains its own viability by using techniques that allow for continual reuse. There are
                      two broad elements to this assessment: (i) developing and assessing the feasibility of the project scope, and (ii)
                      appraising whether the project is a good public investment decision; typically based on some form of
                      economic viability analysis.

1.1.	 involving the Private Sector in irrigation schemes

Given the experience with public schemes to date and the general lack of government funds to support
additional investment, increasing consideration has been given to how PPPs can be used to help improve the
provision of irrigation services to farmers.

A PPP25 can be defined in a number of ways, but typically includes the following characteristics:

    •	 At the core, PPPs involve a significant degree of risk sharing between the government and the private firm,
        such that both parties would suffer financially if the contract fails.

       All PPPs have a contractual agreement between government and a private firm in which the private party
    •	 	
        will provide or help to provide a service for a given level of time.

       The contractual agreement should define the service standards that the firm should meet.
    •	 	

       The private firm should generate its revenues off the back of providing the service. This revenue can be
    •	 	
        recovered directly from the government or from fees levied on users of the service (in this case the farmers
        using the water to irrigate their crops).

       At the end of the contract, the government should typically own the service. It may be that the
    •	 	
        government owns the infrastructure during the contract and the private firm simply operates it or that the
        private firm owns the infrastructure during the contract and is responsible for maintaining it. In either case,
        at the end of the project ownership returns to government.

                        BOX 1.1: Development of the Megech-Seraba Irrigation Scheme in Ethiopia
PREPARATION: PART A

                        In 2004, the Eastern Nile Council of Ministers took action to fast-track an irrigation and drainage project
                        piloting the involvement of the private sector in the planning, implementation and operation of irrigation
                        schemes in Ethiopia, with the objective of using public resources to leverage private funding. By
                        introducing improved agricultural water management technologies to mitigate food shortage, the project
                        was designed to reduce risks associated with investments in irrigation and facilitate increased production
                        and productivity for farmers.

                        The Megech-Seraba scheme for small-scale farmers in Ethiopia was the first irrigation PPP to be funded by
                        the International Development Association (IDA), the World Bank’s arm dedicated to helping the poorest
                        countries with concessional loans and grants. In this project, transaction advisory support was funded by
                        both IDA credit and the Public-Private Infrastructure Advisory Facility (PPIAF), with a study commissioned to
                        prepare an Action Plan for implementing the recommended PPP options for the development of irrigation
                        schemes in the Megech, Ribb River, and Anger Valley. Consultations held with government officials as
                        part of the study, indicated that the principle objective underlying the three schemes was to provide a
                        more reliable irrigation service for smallholders, particularly compared to past approaches. The key issues
                        identified in the sector centered on inefficient and unsustainable irrigation systems, with technical and
                        non-technical losses of up to 75 percent or more, and inadequate O&M leading to system breakdowns and
                        requiring significant rehabilitations.

                        The Ministry of Water Resources objectives included encouraging the involvement of the private sector in
                        a) implementation or construction of medium/ large scale schemes and O&M and management phases
                        of the schemes, b) introduce best practices, which had been lacking in the past in schemes developed for
                        smallholder farmers and c) provide a combination of non-irrigation services to farmers such as input supply;
                        training on crop selection and use of irrigation; and post-harvesting services including storage, processing,
                        marketing and transportation. This is consistent with the government’s Plan for Accelerated and Sustained
                        Development to End Poverty (PASDEP), which advocates for the commercialization of agriculture and the
                        promotion of non-farm private sector growth.

                        An enhanced management contract was structured developed by linking O&M to the actual improvements
                        in farmers’ livelihoods, with provisions for

                            1.	 incorporating oversight by the operator on the construction designs;
                            2.	 placing responsibility for construction supervision on the operator; and
                            3.	 remunerating the operator on a key performance indicator basis
                            4.	 building capacity and training the farmers and public officials


                        In April 2012, the government of Ethiopia entered into an eight-year contract with the French operator
                        BRL Ingénierie for the O&M of the Megech-Seraba irrigation project. The operator will also be in charge of
                        construction supervision, and establishing and building the capacity of WUAs. It is anticipated that the PPP
                        will increase water availability to over 6,000 landholdings over a 4,040 hectare irrigated area.

 Critically the agricultural production activity is the only activity that directly creates economic value. Therefor the financial
 viability of an irrigation scheme is dependent on the value of agricultural produce that it helps to simulate. Unlike most other
 economic infrastructure sectors, irrigation schemes are self-contained investments that are dependent on the viability of the
 off-take (i.e. the agricultural activities that they support)—a sustainable irrigation scheme needs to be linked to a viable
 agricultural value chain.

PREPARATION: PART A

                      The governance, investment and operation, maintenance, and management (OMM) of a scheme are all crucial
                      to the efficient design and operation of the scheme. However, as Figure 1.3 highlights, the decision to invest in
                      an irrigation scheme depends largely on the financial value of the agricultural produce that it helps to stimulate.
                      Ultimately, the amount that farmers will be willing to pay for irrigation services will depend on the additional
                      value that they can generate from their agricultural produce by using the services. Thus, an irrigation scheme
                      has to be linked to a viable agricultural value chain to be sustainable.

                      For a privately owned and operated scheme, financial value of output will be the foremost consideration in
                      deciding whether to go ahead with the investment. This contrasts with a public scheme, where the government
                      will consider also any wider benefits that may be associated with the investment. However, even if the public
                      scheme generates wider economic benefits, if it fails to generate enough value to enable the recovery of the
                      upfront capital costs and O&M costs, and make a suitable return on capital, the government will have to find a
                      source of funds to effectively subsidize the scheme (either from public funds or development partners) to ensure
                      that it remains financially sustainable.

                      A review of the various PPP arrangements, based on the case studies that have been developed in the sector
                      (see Part B below), suggests that the main reasons cited for developing PPP schemes are to:

                            •	 Improve quality of irrigation services. One of the most important purposes of PPPs is to improve
                              service efficiency and improve direct accountability for service provision. In nearly half of the case studies
                              assessed—including Morocco’s Guerdane scheme, the Compagnie Sucriere Senegalaise, and the
                              Eastern Uttar Pradesh groundwater project in India—collectively-organized farmers have been strong
                              advocates for PPP irrigation schemes. There objectives were improved water service quality, more-
                              regular and abundant supplies, and also more equitable delivery for tail-enders. In these instances, the
                              farmers realized that improving the quality of irrigation services would be of financial benefit to them,
                              by facilitating an increase in their yields and therefore incomes. Farmers have also demanded access to
                              technical assistance/agronomic advice from the private partners.

                            •	 Separate governance and operation of schemes. PPP contracts enable governments to separate
                              OMM from the policy and regulatory functions. This often reduces political interference and encourages
                              more effective management from private-sector experts, leading to more timely repairs and proper
                              maintenance of irrigation assets. For instance, in Ethiopia, the Ministry of Agriculture and the Oromia
                              Irrigation Development Agency indicated that they expected private-sector involvement to introduce
                              best practices, thereby reducing (water) losses, estimated to be between 50-70 percent, in the irrigation
                              systems built to serve smallholders.26 Apart from enhancing performance, the case studies reviewed show
                              that typically contracting out OMM to third-party service providers raises standards across all functions,
                              and creates institutional capacity. It is interesting to note that system maintenance is found to be the most
                              common OMM function that is outsourced to the private sector; however only a small proportion of PPPs
                              have handed over responsibilities for water allocation management to the private partner.

    •	 Reduce fiscal constraints to fund high upfront costs. A major purpose of PPPs is to reduce
        governments’ fiscal and administrative burdens in the operation of existing schemes, and to attract private
        investment to help finance the costs (construction, rehabilitation, and modernization) of schemes.27 This
        was the case in about half of the case studies reviewed. Typically, PPPs were seen as solutions to either
        to fill or to complement the availability of funding from the government. As shown in the agricultural
        value chain, collective irrigation schemes typically require high-cost, upfront investments in infrastructure
        to mobilize, convey, and distribute the water to farmers. These high upfront costs can include the bulk
        irrigation infrastructure assets as well as the support and rural infrastructure (roads, electricity, support,
        social services, etc.) required to enable the scheme to function and provide adequate access to
        markets. Particularly in developing regions, farmers lack access to the resources necessary to finance the
        construction of the required infrastructure.

    •	 Set tariffs and improving collection rates. Public schemes have found it difficult to recover costs from
        farmers at a level sufficient to cover the O&M costs associated with the scheme, let alone make a return
        on the investment. This is due to a number of inter-related reasons, notably a difficulty in getting farmers
        to accept that they should pay for irrigation services, farmers’ basic inability to afford the required level
        of tariffs, the ineffectiveness of public institutions in collecting and remitting irrigation service fees, and
        political unwillingness either to raise fees to a level that will cover O&M costs or enforce the collection
        of fees. In fact, some states in India, including Punjab, do not levy any fees on the consumers of public
        schemes using surface water. This has led to continued reliance on government subsidies to operate.
        Given the limited government funds available to cover O&M costs, these large-scale public schemes have
        in many cases been trapped in a cycle that has been characterized in a number of reports focused on the
        irrigation sector as, the “build-neglect-repair-neglect” cycle.28

    •	 Mitigate lack of asset management planning. The limited long-term planning and availability of funds
        to maintain public irrigation schemes has inevitably led to a decline in the quality of performance and loss
        of faith among farmers. The increase in the use of informal small-scale schemes in regions such as South
        Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa has occurred largely because farmers have opted out of formal, publically-
        owned and operated schemes, and instead chosen to access small-scale irrigation technology (e.g.,
        motorized pumps, drawing water directly from open water sources). In South Asia, millions of farmers
        now make use of small groundwater irrigation schemes instead of existing public surface irrigation
        schemes. The rapid growth of these schemes has led to concerns about excessive groundwater depletion,
        particularly in India.




27	 For the purposes of this report, when we refer to investment costs of an irrigation scheme this could involve the costs of constructing a new irrigation
   scheme, rehabilitating an existing scheme (simply returning a scheme to its original design condition), or modernizing an existing scheme.

PREPARATION: PART A

                       BOX 1.2: Setting the Tariffs—Willingness to Pay

                        Even if the farmers are generating sufficient income to pay the water use charges, it does not necessarily
                        mean that they will pay them. The experience of public irrigation schemes has shown that in a number of
                        regions of the world government institutions have found it very difficult to both charge and collect annual
                        tariffs from farmers.

                        In Ethiopia, the Megech-Seraba scheme provides an interesting example of an approach to developing
                        farmers’ willingness and ability to pay for an irrigation scheme, to a point at which it can potentially cover
                        the O&M costs and enable some recovery of the up-front development costs. The findings of a survey of
                        farmers in Megech revealed that farmers who already used irrigation had an average willingness-to-pay of
                        Ethiopian Birr (ETB) 495 (an approx. annual charge per hectare of $25), compared to ETB 310 for farmers
                        without irrigation. It was thus recommended that the tariff in the Megech-Seraba scheme be set initially at
                        $15/ha/year (ETB 310) based on farmers’ willingness to pay, with a view to increasing tariffs over a seven-year
                        transition period toward $100/ha/year (ETB 2,000)—the cost paid by others in similar schemes in the country.
                        Larger increases in the tariff will be implemented towards the end of the period to account for the non-linear
                        increase in farmers’ incomes, with the expectation that farmers’ willingness-to-pay will increase as farmers
                        begin to see the benefits of irrigation. The analysis indicates that the difference between the willingness-to-
                        pay of farmers with and without access to irrigation schemes respectively can provide valuable information
                        that can be used to develop a sustainable tariff policy.

                        Even if an optimal tariff is set, an operator needs to be effective in collecting water use fees. Traditional or
                        older large irrigation systems do not have the necessary engineering infrastructure to facilitate fee collection.
                        For instance, in Ghana the collection rates are estimated to be in range of 45-65 percent, and in Bangladesh
                        collection rates were estimated to be in the range of just 3-10 percent.30 For new and modernized
                        systems, the following innovations may be considered: (i) “wiring” the irrigation system for improved flow
                        measurement and accounting, (ii) irrigation delivery to individuals and small farmer groups by pipeline to
                        ensure more direct “source to user” supply, (iii) and adoption of “pay as you go” irrigation meters and
                        systems, etc. The Muhuri project will involve a pre-paid water metering system, which allows farmers’ direct
                        control of their water-usage, as water will only flow upon insertion of a farmer’s smartcard into the meter. It
                        is expected that with this more flexible and transparent system, there will be water use efficiency gains of
                        about 30 percent, a flexible and on-demand supply of water, 100 percent cost recovery from farmers, and an
                        increase in the numbers reached by irrigation. By eliminating cash payments, the system is also expected to
                        eliminate exploitation and financial mismanagement by pump owners and operators.

                        Farmers need to be incentivized to pay for the service or penalized if they do not pay the necessary tariffs for
                        the services. Conversely, in Peru’s Olmos scheme, farmers are given a “take-or-pay” contract, meaning that if
                        they do not take the water supply from the concessionaire, they are liable to pay a penalty. This should help
                        ensure that the concessionaire will be able to collect the flat service tariff of $0.07/m3 for the water which is
                        used. With an average usage of 10,000m3/ha/year, this could equal $26.6m each year.

1.3.	      Preparing a feasible irrigation scheme

Investment as part of the irrigation value chain will only be sustainable if the investment by itself is sound. Most
governments should subject any proposed investment whether existing or a new irrigation scheme, to rigorous
appraisal processes as any other public investment project. There are two broad elements to this assessment: (i)
developing and assessing the feasibility of the project scope, and (ii) appraising whether the project is a good
public investment decision; typically based on some form of economic viability analysis.

The proposed project should undergo detailed due diligence by commissioning and reviewing studies related
to the legal and regulatory environment, engineering and technical aspects of the project, environmental, and
social impact of the project (i.e., an economic and social impact assessment should be commissioned at this
stage) and any resettlement requirements. The benefits of the project should outweigh the costs. The detailed
due diligence should also outline any risks or issues relating to such things as competition, environment, labor,
land, procurement process, institutional capacity and taxes. Changes to the project may result from the outcome
of due diligence. The key questions for governments will be:

    •	 Is the proposal technically viable? Can the project actually be implemented as planned, using proven
        technologies, and without unreasonable technical risks? Have these risks been identified and measured?
        For instance in the case of an irrigation project, technical viability will assess technical design and
        specification of proposed structures, adequacy of soil and hydrological surveys, topographical estimates
        of irrigable area.

    •	 Is the proposal environmentally viable? Does the project design (forthcoming amendments) comply
        with national and local environmental and planning standards? Have these risks been identified and
        measured? For instance, in the case of an irrigation scheme, an environmental assessment will not only
        provide prediction, evaluation and mitigation of environmental impact of a new development, but address
        issues specific to irrigation and drainage projects. Specific to an irrigation project is over-exploitation of
        ground water and accessibility of surface water.

    •	 Is the proposal socially viable? Does the project present clear social benefits for the farmers, community,
        and the society? Have the social risks been clearly identified, measured and a management plan
        proposed? In the case of an irrigation project, social evaluation will determine whether a project is socially
        acceptable, and what negative impacts may be associated with the project implementation.

    •	 Is the proposal economically beneficial to the users? Is there a clear economic rationale for the project
        where the needs bring larger benefit to the farmers? For instance, in the case of an irrigation scheme, the
        economic valuation would examine not only the net income effect of an irrigation scheme for farmers, but
        also the economic benefits associated with improved livelihoods and nutrition.

PREPARATION: PART A

                            •	 Is the proposal legally possible? Are there any legal barriers to the project? For a PPP this includes
                              considering whether there are any legal constraints on the government’s ability to enter into a PPP contract.
                              Have these risks been identified and measured?

                            •	 Is there sufficient institutional capacity and capability to undertake the project? Does the granting
                              authority need to complement the existing institutions with external technical, legal and financial advisers?
                              Have these risks been identified and measured?

                      In order for a project to be sustainable, whether public or PPP, the above assessments should be conducted.
                      Reasonable assessment of project-related risks and achieving efficiency in the use of public resources in an
                      environmentally and socially responsible manner over the long term are critical. If each of the steps involved
                      in project definition and feasibility assessment are followed, the end product should be a clear business case
                      demonstrating why the proposed project is a good investment decision.

                      In practice, the process of completing the definition and feasibility phase can be quite expensive and time-
                      consuming. Box 1.3 below provides an overview of the work that is still ongoing to complete the feasibility work
                      for PPP irrigation projects in Zambia. The experience of this project highlights the importance of managing the
                      feasibility work effectively, which in particular involves strengthening the relevant government institutions to ensure
                      that they have the capacity to organize the complicated process of taking PPP projects through the various phases.



                       BOX 1.3: Assessing the feasibility of the Irrigation Development & Support Project (IDSP)

                        Overview
                        The Irrigation Development & Support Project (IDSP) is a World Bank-funded irrigation project being
                        implemented by Zambia’s Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock (MAL). The IDSP aims to increase yields
                        per hectare and the value of various products marketed by smallholders benefitting from investments in
                        irrigation in selected sites served by the project. The project will be implemented in the form of PPPs, with
                        a private sector farming company or agribusiness (FarmCo) operating a hub operation. The bulk water
                        infrastructure will be financed by the public sector, while the private sector operates the system, develops
                        the land and in-field irrigation, and pays water user fees.

                        Project feasibility assessment
                        The IDSP is currently nearing the end of the project feasibility assessment phase of project development.
                        Consultants have been hired to advise on the full financial, institutional and legal, socio-economic, and
                        technical feasibility of the project.

                        For this work, the financial consultants assessed the range of financially feasible outcomes for each PPP
                        entity at each site under the IDSP and made specific recommendations on tariff levels and other scheme
                        financial flows. The aim of this work was to answer the following questions:

 BOX 1.3: Assessing the feasibility of the Irrigation Development & Support Project (IDSP) (cont.)

       •	 What degree of public subsidy for capital investment is required, and what is the potential for
          including private investment alongside this?
       •	 What should be the level of water usage fees (and other financial flows) for each user group, taking
          into consideration risks faced, incentives, and affordability?
       •	 Are the proposed investment opportunities financially feasible for investors? Is this consistent
          with achieving financial feasibility at the scheme level such that self-sufficiency is reached and no
          ongoing subsidy is required?

  The outputs of this work were a full financial feasibility study and detailed multi-scenario financial feasibility
  model. The legal consultants have advised on the legal and institutional implications of the proposed PPP
  entities and scheme financial flows.

  Meanwhile, technical consultants have conducted a number of topographic and soil surveys, as well as
  rural sociology analysis, to advice on the agronomics of the IDSP. They also have assessed the various
  irrigation system design options for each of the sites under the IDSP by first conceptualizing the design of
  an irrigation system, then performing comparative assessments to determine optimal irrigation design. With
  this, the consultants developed a detailed presentation of the IDSP’s proposed water distribution network
  and conveyance systems and then estimated a bill of quantities and costs for the construction and O&M of
  the project.

  Socio-economic consultants have been tasked with preparing and facilitating implementation of
  Resettlement Action Plans (RAPs) for each site and facilitating negotiation of leases on irrigable
  land developed under the project. They have also been tasked with carrying out Environmental and
  Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), as well as preparing Environmental Impact Statements (EISs) and
  Environmental Management Plans (EMPs) for each of the sites.

  Practical experience
  The IDSP’s project feasibility assessment phase has experienced time over-runs, with the process taking
  significantly more than the forecast one year to complete. The time over-runs can be attributed to a number
  of things, including:

       •	 Procurement delays in hiring consultants to complete components of the feasibility work;
       •	 Changes in Government architecture, including revisions to the role of the dedicated PPP Unit; and
       •	 Large size of the IDSP project development team, which includes government officials from a
          handful of ministries, representatives from the World Bank, and many consultants.

  A key “take-away” lesson from the IDSP has been that it is important to apply correct sequencing of
  consultancy contracts and to use realistic timelines. The World Bank has disbursed slightly more than $4
  million in consultancy fees under the IDSP between 2010 and 2013.31

1.4.	    Assessing risks

The key factor that determines the structure of an irrigation scheme is the way in which the various risks related
to the project are identified, allocated, and managed. Table 1.1 below identifies common risks associated with
irrigation schemes.

Table 1.1: Risks Related to Irrigation Schemes
 Risk            Description
                 •	 Design risk. The scheme could be over- or under-designed, that could hamper its ability to achieve
                     sustainability and reliance in terms of engineering, technology, and usability.

                 •	 Land acquisition. The risk that the project site (or sites) will be unavailable within the required time, or
                     in the manner or cost anticipated, or that the site will generate unanticipated liabilities due to existing
                     encumbrances and native claims to the land. Some countries limit land ownership to locals or may not allow
 Construction        private ownership, while there may also be difficulties with establishing land titles, particularly in countries
                     with significant customary land rights. Further, there may be restrictions on land use and type of irrigation,
                     which can be implemented.

                 •	 Site risk. Relates primarily to the risks involved in constructing the bulk irrigation assets of the scheme;
                     primarily the ability to construct the assets required to mobilize, convey, and distribute the water for an
                     economically feasible budget and within expected timeframes.
                 •	 Hydrology or scarcity risk. The risk that the source of the water supply on which the irrigation scheme
                     will rely will not be available or sufficient to provide the contracted service—for instance due to drought or
 Water               flood damage, allocation of water to other users (such as urban water utilities), or increased abstraction for
 Abstraction         irrigation upstream of the scheme.

                 •	 Enforcement of water abstraction. The risk that regulation is weak or the public agency does not have the
                     capacity to enforce water abstraction rights.
                 •	 Water. The risk that there is insufficient demand for water to sustain the business opportunity—e.g., in the
                     case of the West Nile Delta, the government opted for a closed-conduit scheme instead of an open canal,
                     despite the added cost, in order to reduce demand and commercial risks for the private operator.

                 •	 Agricultural offtake. Where, despite the increase in productivity, farmers are not able to sell the agricultural
 Demand
                     produce in the markets—for instance, the government of Senegal guaranteed full tariff protection to
                     CSS against sugar imports from the rest of the world, ensuring that the domestic sugar price in Senegal
                     remained 10-20 percent higher than world market prices; or in Saudi Arabia where agribusinesses received a
                     guaranteed purchase price of $1,000/ton of wheat, which was 50-120 percent higher than world prices.
                 •	 Payment and collection risk. The risks around the ability to charge farmers for accessing the irrigation
                     services at the level required to recover O&M and capital costs. In developing markets, in particular, there
                     is significant uncertainty about the ability and willingness of farmers to pay to access water. This lack of
                     certainty about the extent to which irrigation scheme operators will be able to charge and collect fees for the
 Payment             provision of services is a key risk that needs to be addressed to support the implementation of a PPP.

                 •	 Counterparty risk. This is the risk related to the government party to the PPP contract—for instance, if the
                     granting authority (i.e., government) does not fulfill its contractual obligations, such as timely enforcement of
                     tariff adjustments, laws, government payments such as capital grants, and availability payments.

                      Table 1.1: Risks Related to Irrigation Schemes (cont.)
                       Risk            Description
                                       •	 Integration risk. There are several issues with this risk, depending on the scheme, based on a lack of
                                          coordination in the service. These schemes are multi-regional, or multi-jurisdictional and multi-use—e.g.,
                                          water supply and sanitation services vs. irrigation water to the population in the farming vicinity. Often, the
                                          granting authority does not have the power to act over authorities in other sectors and bring all stakeholders
                                          to one table. In Brazil, for example, the granting authority, CODEVASF, is a federal agency and lacks
                                          authority over local and other sectoral stakeholders in a particular scheme. Integration risk can also be when
                                          construction of the major capital program is done by the public sector but the operations and maintenance
                                          is done by the private sector, where there may be aspects of integrating the service with the commissioning
                       Planning
                                          of the capital works.

                                       •	 Value chain. There is risk that the full value chain is not thoroughly planned, from irrigation to agricultural
                                          value. Unless connections are built, the irrigation scheme itself is likely to have marginal value add.

                                       •	 Asset Management Planning (AMP). Risks around the lack of long-term planning in irrigation assets include
                                          life-cycle costing and asset management. AMP is more common in water supply and sanitation services.




                                       •	 Pre-contract risk. The risk that the procurement of the PPP project is carried out ineffectively or runs into
                                          difficulties. For instance, failure to attract sufficient bidders or the development of a poorly structured deal.

                                       •	 Contract design. Risk that the PPP contract is short term and limited in scope—e.g., the one-year contract
                                          with no performance measures between DINC (Nilo Coelho Irrigation District) and CODEVASF in Brazil’s Nilo
                                          Coelho. Realistically, there is very little risk transfer in short-term contracts.

                                       •	 Financial risk. Risk that investors and/or lenders will not provide or continue to provide sufficient funding
                                          (or funding at the right terms and conditions) for the project. In addition, there is the potential that financial

1.5.	     Linkages to the agriculture value chain

While the provision of irrigation services to farmers will enable them to increase production, it is only one
of a number of agricultural inputs that must be available as part of the development of a viable agricultural
value chain. In addition, subsistence production aside, farmers need to have access to both post-production
value addition infrastructure and storage facilities and, critically, markets in which they can sell their produce.
For instance, the government of Senegal provided full tariff protection to CSS against sugar imports globally,
ensuring that the domestic sugar price in Senegal remained 10-20 percent higher than work market prices, while
agribusinesses in Saudi Arabia received a guaranteed purchase price of $1,000/ton of wheat, 50-120 percent
higher than global prices. In Megech-Seraba, the management contractor is to provide customer relations
services, including advice on water management issues, farm irrigation, and related agricultural issues.

There are a number of important factors that will impact the ability of farmers to generate sufficient revenue
from their land.

   •	 Price risk. The farmers are exposed to significant risks relating to the volatility of agricultural prices.

   •	 Other agricultural inputs. A proportion of this increased revenue would have to be used to pay for
        improved inputs such as seeds, fertilizer, labor mechanization, etc.

   •	 Access to technical expertise. Farmers will typically take a number of years to build up their experience
        in using the irrigation services effectively, and possibly require technical support and capacity building
        to do so. To this end, an important additional cost for sustainable irrigation schemes is the provision of
        technical support to the farmers where necessary. This assistance can take many forms and can include the
        provision of advice on farming practices, support to identify the best seeds and fertilizer
        for a given set of agronomic conditions, and advice on how to use the irrigation
        equipment. The responsibility for this activity can be taken by the private firm
        that is constructing and/or operating the scheme, or a specialist technical
        advisory firm can be employed.

   •	 Access to markets. In addition, in some countries farmers might
        not be in a position to receive all of the additional income because
        they lack the necessary information on market prices and/or are
        exploited by traders or market intermediaries.

                       BOX 1.4: Bringing Sustainability to an Irrigation Scheme

                        Whether public or private, the foremost objective should be to set up a system that maintains its own
                        viability by using techniques that allow for continual reuse. There are a variety of different irrigation schemes
                        used by farmers to help increase their agricultural production. This includes schemes that cover areas in
                        excess of 100,000 hectares that have been financed by private investors to support commercial agricultural
                        production; large-scale schemes that are owned and operated by government to support thousands of
                        smallholder farmers; and the proliferation of informal irrigation schemes in regions such as Sub-Saharan
                        Africa and South Asia, where an individual farmer may have purchased some rudimentary irrigation
                        technology, such as a pump, to extract water from a water well or pond and apply it to their crop.

                        In the absence of these other elements of the agricultural value chain (illustrated herewith) it would be
                        difficult to develop an irrigation scheme that is sustainable. Ultimately, without access to markets farmers
                        will not be able to realize the increase in income required to enable them to afford paying the tariffs for
                        receiving irrigation services at the levels necessary to facilitate recovery of capital and O&M costs, and
                        therefore to sustain a PPP scheme.

                      The key factor in determining the scope to introduce a PPP into the irrigation sector is the extent to which
                      the requirements of the key stakeholders—the private sector firm, government, and farmers or WUA—can be
                      addressed. The public sector comprises government ministries or departments, regulatory bodies32, granting


                      32	 In some instances there may be more than one regulatory body for example, one that deals with abstraction of water rights, and a separate entity/regulator
                         that overseas irrigation and agricultural activities. This will depend on the particular institutional and legal set up in a given country.

authorities; the private sector comprises commercial companies. WUAs and farmers, in the third category, are
the users and potentially could participate in the scheme in various roles as well.

Fundamentally, a PPP requires:

   •	 One or more private sector firm(s) to be willing and able to take on the responsibilities defined in the
      PPP contract. They will only do so if they judge that they can recover any costs incurred in providing the
      services and at the same time obtain a reasonable rate of return taking account of the main risks that relate
      to the implementation of the scheme.

   •	 A government department or institution willing to sign off on the PPP contract with the private firm.
      Government will only enter into the arrangement if it is confident that the private firm can meet the
      requirements set out in the contract—e.g., if interests of the farmers are protected, the firm has the
      necessary credentials and expertise to perform the services etc. From a political perspective, government
      will also consider if farmers and the broader constituency support their intention to hand over
      responsibility for providing irrigation services to the private sector.

   •	 Farmers and WUAs willing and able to contribute necessary service fees and are more generally willing
      to accept the private sector taking over responsibility for the provision of irrigation services. Farmers will
      only be willing or able to pay the service fees if the irrigation services (together with other improved inputs
      where needed) help them to increase yields and thereby incomes to a level that enables them to afford the
      fees and make a suitable profit. Farmers’ support for government handing over responsibility for irrigation
      services to the private sector will be influenced by a number of factors; chiefly the extent to which they are
      confident that the private firm will maintain appropriate levels of service provision at reasonable cost.

The allocation of these roles and responsibilities will vary according to context, such as the priorities of the
government and the capacities of the private sector and farmers. An example (Table 1.2) shows a scenario in
which the government is responsible for both the regulatory system and providing the investment required to
develop the scheme assets up to the farm gate, but has left the O&M and management of the schemes to the
WUAs.

PREPARATION: PART A

                      The main theme that runs through the concerns of each group and thus the scope to establish PPPs is whether
                      the scheme has the potential to operate on a financially sustainable basis. We examine this issue in Part B.


                      1.7.	 Farmers’ participation in the PPP contract

                      While there are two main parties in a PPP arrangement, the user or the farmers form an intricate part of the
                      value chain. In most cases, farmers are the service recipients, and in some the farmers have formed WUAs to
                      support OMM services (for more, see subchapter 1.13 of Part B). In order to attain sustainability, farmer’s active
                      involvement can generate the links which are missing between the public and private partners.

                      In some cases, farmers have become part of the agricultural off-take bringing certainty to the demand for
                      irrigation services. For example, in Ghana’s Integrated Tamale Fruit Company (ITFC) irrigation scheme, in order to
                      participate, smallholders have to provide an 85kg bag of mango upfront (equivalent to around $25). From the fifth
                      year onwards the out-grower will repay 30 percent of their sales to the ITFC until the debt is repaid. Until then, all
                      mangoes must be sold through the ITFC, though after the debt is repaid they may switch to another buyer.

                      Peru’s pioneering Olmos irrigation PPP scheme has implemented a “take-or-pay” policy, by which farmers acquire
                      title to the land and the right to the irrigation services, with an obligation to pay the service fee of $0.07 per m3
                      for water used to irrigate their farm. It is called a “take-or-pay” policy because if the farmers do not take the water
                      supply from the concessionaire they are still liable to pay.

                      Farmers can be involved in the structuring, financing, and implementation of the schemes. For example in Egypt’s
                      West Nile Delta project. Although the irrigation scheme was stalled in 2012 and is yet to be implemented, the
                      early preparation work involved setting up a representative advisory group of farmers—a water user council—
                      to engage in project preparation on behalf of all the beneficiaries. During implementation, the council would
                      monitor the relationships and potential conflicts in the farmer community in matters such as water entitlements,
                      water use, and alternating hours of irrigation.


                      1.7.1.	   Affordability for farmers

                            Setting cost-reflective fees for water can be a difficult and politicized issue, especially in emerging countries
                            where farmers may have long viewed access to water as a free resource. Several approaches have been used
                            to enable firms to set and collect adequate water user fees. These include:

                            Understanding farmers’ willingness to pay. The Megech-Seraba irrigation scheme in Ethiopia has shown
                            the importance of carrying out detailed analysis of the amount that farmers are willing to pay to receive
                            irrigation services. Following the completion of a willingness to pay survey it was determined that it would
                            only be viable to introduce private sector involvement if government subsidized, at least in part, the irrigation
                            service fees. It is expected that as farmers gain the benefits from the irrigation services their willingness to pay
                            will increase and the subsidy required by government will lessen. It is thus assumed that the proportion of the
                            tariff paid by farmers will gradually increase proportionally.

    Securing upfront payments. The Muhuri irrigation project in Bangladesh has taken on the lessons from
    the Barind system which makes use of a system of pre-pay coupons to reduce the collection risks around
    irrigation service fees from farmers. Key to this approach is the ability to control adequately the supply of
    water to farmers, so that they actually get the amount of water for which they have paid up-front. This was
    done in Guerdane and has been planned for West Delta as well.

    Contract farming arrangements. In the case of the Integrated Tamale Fruit Company (ITFC) irrigation
    scheme in Ghana, the farmers enter into a contract with the private firm for the provision of irrigation
    services in exchange for a proportion of the farmers’ produce. Smallholders have to provide an 85kg bag of
    maize upfront (equivalent to around $25). From the fifth year onwards the out-grower will repay 30 percent
    of their sales to the ITFC until the debt is repaid. Until then, all mangoes must be sold through the ITFC,
    though after the debt is repaid they may switch to another buyer. These arrangements typically work best
    for commercial crops where the commercial off-taker has an ongoing financial incentive to ensure that the
    farmers receive the irrigation services. In addition it is important to have an enabling environment within
    which stakeholders have some confidences that contractual provisions can be enforced adequately. The
    Kaleya irrigation scheme in Zambia provides a good example of this approach.

Box 1.5 below provides an additional example of this approach from India, where it has been difficult to apply
water user fees to farmers.

 BOX 1.5: Contract Farming of Onion and Fresh Fruit in Maharashtra

  Jain Irrigation System Limited (JISL) has established an onion dehydration and fruit processing plant in
  Jalgaon, Maharashtra. It is a 100 percent export-oriented unit. JISL has entered into a contract farming
  arrangement with the farmers within a radius of 200 km of Jalgaon to buy good quality onion bulbs
  and fresh fruits at an assured price. JISL helps the farmers produce more and better quality produce by
  providing genetically superior High Yielding Varieties (HYV) planting materials, an efficient water and
  fertilizer management system and agronomical guidance. Farmers have to ensure optimal utilization of the
  available water resources. The involvement of the state government is minimal.

   JISL volunteers provide first-hand knowledge of how to grow onions, technical know-how, and other
  extension services to the farmers, and are a pivotal link between the company and the farmers. Senior
  scientists of the company also visit the farms and exchange views on the latest developments. JISL has
  helped the local farmers to bring more than 80 percent of the onion crops under efficient micro-irrigation
  systems like drip irrigation and sprinklers. Farmers benefit since they receive good quality seeds at
  reasonable prices and the company gains from buying the fruits and vegetables from the growers and
  processing them at modern processing facilities to produce high quality dehydrated onion and vegetable
  products, aseptic fruit purees, pulps and concentrates, and exporting these throughout the world. The
  company has also put into place a dispute resolution mechanism which has been working well so far. The
  JISL experiment, which combines for-profit contract farming with focused assistance to improve water use
  efficiency, has proved beneficial and could potentially be replicated in other parts of India as well.

A business opportunity means that the scheme is linked to an agriculture value chain offering financial value,
revenue and social benefits for the users and the private sector with the government maintaining its social and
fiscal responsibility. The Chapter One Part B discusses how to further refine a business case which includes
determining financial viability while testing optimal risk allocation leading to the type of PPP arrangement.
Starting with a sound business case, policymakers should carry out simple analysis to determine if it is viable to
bring private partner into the scheme, as shown in the Figure 1.4. below.

                      1.10.	 Determining the viability of a PPP

                      The key requirement for a scheme to be financially self-sustaining, absent any significant government funding,
                      is that the project needs to be able to pay water user fees at a level that enables the private firm to recover
                      capital and O&M costs. In most cases the PPP arrangement will involve some use of public funds to support the
                      implementation of a PPP scheme. Therefore, we have also discussed how government can assess the economic
                      case for the use of public funds.


                      1.10.1.	 How to make a decision about a PPP using an Options Assessment Tool?

                      When considering the scope to introduce a PPP into the irrigation sector, policymakers should first carry out a
                      simple analysis to determine if it is viable to bring private partner into the scheme. An “Options Assessment Tool”
                      (see next paragraph) can be developed to determine which functions need to be carried out, how to structure the
                      PPP so as to create opportunity of interest to both the farmers and potential private firms, and also achieve value
                      for money for the government. For example, in Megech, Ethiopia, the financial assessment techniques helped
                      design a scheme in which the initial funds were sufficient to cover construction of the main and secondary canals,
                      but placed responsibility for funding of the tertiary canals to the farmers.

                      An Options Assessment Tool is a flexible worksheet based on MS Excel that can be used to complete a PPP
                      options analysis. It enables the user to review the impact the potential PPP from the perspective of the key
                      stakeholders in the scheme. If the requirements of the private firm, farmers, and government are not satisfied,
                      the scheme will not be able to operate on a sustainable basis. Overall, the outputs of the model can help the user
                      to identify the following:

                            •	 Farmers—if the farmers’ level of income post-implementation of the PPP scheme is higher than pre-
                              implementation, taking account of any required increase in water user fees.

                            •	 Government—if government can afford the level of expenditure required to support the implementation
                              of the scheme on a sustainable basis.

                            •	 Private firm—whether the water user fees that the firm can sustainably levy on the farmers is large enough
                              to help them recover any capital and O&M costs that they expect to face as part of the proposed PPP
                              arrangements. The tool also estimates the returns available to the private firm, which can be used to
                              assess if the PPP has the potential to offer the firm a high enough return given the alternative investment
                              opportunities available.

                      If any one of the above conditions do not show positively, policymakers will need to vary the design of the potential
                      PPP scheme—for instance, by changing the proposed allocation of responsibilities to the private firm and thus
                      changing the required level of capital investment by the private firm, or increasing the level of government
                      expenditure.

The users have the flexibility to input the main costs and revenues relevant to the scheme and the PPP arrangement
under consideration. The objective of the tool is to let the user review whether, given the technical design of the
scheme and the nature of PPP arrangement (e.g., a management contract implies a different allocation of costs
than a concession arrangement), the proposed PPP has the potential to be a financially attractive proposition for
each of the three key stakeholder groups to a potential PPP arrangement.


1.10.2.	 Input and output of the tool

The inputs of the tool cover all the needed variables for the calculations required to assess the viability of PPP
schemes and importantly to assess the level of funding that may be mobilized by the private sector within a
specific project’s constraints. Understanding the revenue estimates and cost allocation under different schemes
will have a large impact on the final output of the tool. The main input categories are:

   •	 Farm characteristics variables—Farm size, farmer’s plots, and number of full time employees on the
      commercial farm;

   •	 Capital expenditures, and operational, maintenance, and management variables—Shared irrigation
      infrastructure cost, on-farm irrigation infrastructure cost, on-farm non-irrigation infrastructure cost and
      supporting infrastructure cost, farm overheads, water user fees, and the gross margins of the farm.

   •	 Financing aspects variables—Financing from farmers, grant finance, available public finance for the
      project, which is the expected subsidy that government are willing to offer under the fiscal constraints, and
      the minimum required private sector return on agriculture projects

   •	 Cost allocation variables—All the capital and O&M cost allocation percentages between commercial
      farms and public sectors

The output of the model provides users the financial variability results under different PPP schemes.

   •	 For the public sector, the model provides an estimate of the subsidy requirement for government
      which, depending on the country’s fiscal position, the user can determine whether the implied subsidy
      requirement is at a level that the government could sustainably pay.

   •	 For the private sector, the model calculates the internal rate of return for the private sector and enables
      the user to see if the expected return is high enough relative to the potential range of alternative
      investment options available in the market. For instance, as part of the decision to invest in the PPP
      arrangement, the private sector might consider if it could get a higher return by just operating a
      commercial farm without entering into a PPP arrangement.

   •	 For farmers, the model calculates the beneficiaries that the farmers gained from the project and the
      cost-reflective water user fees. This water usage charge is aimed to find out how much water user
      fees would need to be in the absence of public sector finance. The cost-reflective water usage charge

                            reflects a scenario where only private sector capital is available, and thus where farmers are charged by
                            the commercial farm on a for-profit basis for the provision of irrigation infrastructure, its operation and
                            maintenance, and any additional support services and infrastructure.

                      The flow chart (Figure 1.5) below illustrates the key questions and decision points that are relevant in determining
                      the viability of establishing a PPP arrangement. It shows the main requirements of the private firm, farmers and
                      the government and how the technical design of the proposed PPP arrangement will need to be changed if the
                      scheme is not a viable proposition for any of the three key stakeholders.

1.10.3.	 Is the scheme financially viable?

The question of whether an existing irrigation scheme—one that needs to be rehabilitated or modernized, or a
new, greenfield irrigation scheme—could be financially viable, is central to determining whether a PPP can be
implemented.

For any potential irrigation scheme development, government can decide to provide significant subsidies to
make it financially viable. This is sometimes called viability gap funding—i.e., providing public support to close the
revenue streams required to afford commercial financing. However, as discussed elsewhere in this handbook, the
experience with large-scale irrigation schemes in developing countries shows that relying on on-going subsidies
from government is not sustainable particularly if government runs into fiscal constraints. Therefore, an important
way to consider the financial sustainability of a scheme is to determine if the O&M costs and the investment
costs can be recovered from the service fees that can be levied on users and/or farmers (including any
upfront or connection fees, or recurrent or annual water fees, etc.)—i.e., the extent to which the scheme
is potentially self-sustaining and thus presents a viable business opportunity for the private sector. The key
issue that government needs to determine upfront is whether a scheme has the potential to operate on a self-
sustaining basis.

Figure 1.6 below depicts the simple relationship between farmers and the private firm that should sit at heart of
any functional irrigation scheme: the firm provides irrigation services at an agreed level of quality and price; in
return for that service the farmers pay an agreed service charge on a consistent and timely basis.

                                   Income                                             Income
                                                      Service charge


For a scheme to be financially viable and sustainable, the following needs to hold:

   •	 For private firm—Investment and O&M costs of the scheme (in addition, an acceptable rate of return
      compared to other potential opportunities for the firm) have to be recoverable from the service fees.

   •	 For farmers—The increase in income that farmers expect to get from utilizing the irrigation services has to
      be greater than their expectation of the service fees that they will face for using the irrigation services.

                       the irrigation scheme (that are part of the PPP               to produce in the area served by the scheme? What is
                       arrangement)? These will depend on a range of                 the plot size for each farmer?
                       technical factors related to the proposed design
                       of the new scheme, the state of existing irrigation
                       scheme assets (in the case of a rehabilitation or
                       modernization), geographical considerations and
                       the state of the surrounding infrastructure (roads,
                       electricity, etc.).
                       What costs are borne by the private sector? Any          What is the farmers’ level of productivity—i.e., yield
                       financing costs associated with raising capital to cover per ha and cropping intensity, before and after
                       upfront costs.                                           receiving the irrigation services?
                       What are the O&M and management costs related                 What is the price that farmers are able to realize for
                       to the scheme? In addition, any costs related to the          their produce? These are determined by both the
                       provision of technical/agronomic assistance to the            market price and the farmers’ ability to access markets
                       farmers should this service be included as part of the        and produce according to market requirements.
                       PPP arrangement.
                       The expectation of the financial capacity and                 Expectation on the fees that the private firm will levy
                       willingness of the farmers to pay the service fees.           for providing the irrigation services.

                                                                                     Costs of alternative sources of water, if these are
                                                                                     available or feasible to develop.

                                                                                     Expected other production costs that will be borne by
                                                                                     farmers.

                      The extent to which an irrigation scheme presents a self-contained business opportunity is thus determined by
                      the costs faced by the private firm and the water use fees that they can expect farmers to pay on a sustainable
                      basis. What the farmers need to pay can be adapted as to which costs are passed on to them, as seen in the
                      case studies.


                      1.11.	 Types of PPP models in irrigation

                      There are a variety of ways in which the private sector can be brought into a PPP arrangement, depending on
                      levels of risk and responsibilities transferred (Table 1.5) and/or retained by the parties to the contract.

                      Case studies of recent PPP irrigation schemes indicate that most arrangements involve concession contracts.
                      These schemes include Chiansi, ITFC, Olmos, potentially Pontal and Accra Plains as well. Only, Megech-Seraba
                      and Muhuri are limited mainly to OMM responsibilities.

                      It is therefore useful to think about the responsibilities associated with different PPP structures in conjunction with
                      the risks. In practice, when the responsibilities of the scheme are allocated to the various PPP parties, they are at
                      the same time taking on the associated risks.


                      1.12.	 Case study analysis: Examples of PPPs in the irrigation sector

                      This handbook considers 29 case studies drawn from the World Bank 2007 report and other sources (listed in
                      Tables 1.7 and 1.8). Some are ongoing and others still in planning stages. It is important to note the authors would
                      welcome inclusion of any additional examples of PPP schemes that could be brought to our attention. These
                      would only enhance the purpose of this handbook; so we welcome any feedback to this end. Table 1.7 below lists
                      the various irrigation schemes that have been identified in the World Bank 2007 report.

Review of the 29 existing/ developing PPP irrigation schemes suggests that four basic types of PPP contractual
arrangement have been used to date in the irrigation sector:

            •	 Four of the arrangements involve only basic management contracts, in which the private firm carried out a
                      basic service, such as collecting the water use fees or providing technical advice.

            •	 Nine of the arrangements are structured so that the private sector is required to take responsibility for the
                      OMM of the scheme only, under a PPP contract.

                            •	 Thirteen of the schemes involve both the investment and OMM responsibilities, under a PPP contract.

                            •	 Two of the schemes involve private sector involvement in the investment activities only.

                           •	 OMM: All but two of the 29 contractual arrangements, Eastern Uttar Pradesh and GAP, involve the transfer
                                    of the OMM functions to the private sector. While more common in sub-Saharan Africa, OMM contracts
                                    are widespread all over the regions.

                                    private sector. For instance, the irrigation component in the Olmos scheme in Peru, is being entirely
                                    funded through private investment, with 38,000 hectares of land to be auctioned to private investors, who
                                    will produce high-value crops.

                      1.12.2.	 How viable is transfer of investment functions in PPP contracts in emerging economies?

                      Case studies suggest that private investment in irrigation schemes is difficult. This is because irrigation projects
                      typically are capital intensive which are mostly upfront. Usually projects which support commercial farming activities
                      can aim to recuperate expenses through user-pay arrangement. Therefore, while the number of irrigation PPPs
                      that have transferred, or aim to transfer, the investment function (and contribution to the associated financing
                      costs) to the private sector looks high, in practice, most of the examples of this approach are special cases. Overall,
                      particularly in an emerging economy context, it has been much more common to transfer the OMM functions to
                      the private sector. Arrangements of this nature typically do not have any significant financing requirements from
                      the private partner as seen in the following examples:

                            •	 While Olmos in Peru is a successful example of the transfer of investment functions to the private sector,
                              there is some uncertainty as to whether the same will occur in some of the schemes that are still in the
                              process of being implemented.

                            •	 A number of other examples where the investment functions were transferred were special cases: three
                              of the arrangements were almost completely private initiatives with minimal involvement from the public
                              sector (CSS project, Dina Farm and Saudi agribusinesses); and two of the arrangements were exceptional
                              cases of PPPs rather than a genuine transfer of risk to the private sector (Eastern Uttar Pradesh and the
                              Southeast Anatolia Project in Turkey (GAP)).

                            •	 The SCP project in France came about as a government decision to develop the irrigation sector in a
                              specific region that was carried out over forty years ago.

                            •	 While the Guerdane irrigation scheme in Morocco had genuine transfer of investment responsibilities, in
                              order to make the arrangement financially viable, the government was required to provide a significant
                              contribution to the financing costs in the form of subsidies and soft loans. Furthermore, steps were taken
                              to mitigate some of the key risks around irrigation schemes related to farmers paying for fees associated
                              with the scheme, by requiring some up-front payments to cover the connection costs. Another key feature
                              of the arrangement is that the farmers were producing relatively high-value citrus crops and had access
                              to well-organized arrangements to take products to market. Thus, there was some confidence that the
                              farmers would be both willing and able to pay the service fees over time.

 BOX 1.6: The Guerdane Scheme

  Around half of Morocco’s citrus crop is produced in a 10,000ha area in Guerdane in the Taroudant region.
  Before the project, in 2004, hundreds of farms in the region were largely dependent on underground
  sources of water which were being heavily depleted each year.

  The Guerdane Irrigation Project was designed to deliver 45 million cubic meters from a series of dams 40
  miles away and was structured as a PPP. A private partner was contracted to build and operate a 300km
  network to deliver water to the area from the dams and well as secondary and tertiary (distribution)
  infrastructure to each farm.

  A 30-year concession was structured. The government provided $50m in grant and concessional loan
  finance, while the private bidder would provide $35m and assume some financial risk in addition to
  operational, commercial, collection, and construction risk. Demand and collection risk were partly mitigated
  through an initial farmer subscription where farmers paid an initial fee to cover individual connection costs.
  The concessionaire’s construction obligation is to be triggered only if subscriptions for 80 percent of the
  water is received. The concessionaire is also insulated from water availability (drought) risk by virtue of a cap
  on revenue losses of 15 percent in the event of drought (with the government covering losses beyond this),
  and a tariff surcharge for farmers of 10 percent.

  The large subsidy component was designed to keep tariffs low. The single bidding criterion for the private
  sector was the lowest water tariff, such that the government subsidy was passed on to users. The policy aim
  was to ensure services were as affordable to users as possible (i.e., that consumption was maximized). As a
  result, following implementation of the PPP arrangement, tariffs were at a similar level to the pumping costs
  before the project, but the quality of service provided to the farmers was much improved.



1.12.3.	 A look at significant risks

In terms of major risks which influenced the project structure and PPP arrangements in case studies, we note the
following:

Political risk
   •	 For the Alaotra case, in light of the past 20 years of Madagascar’s history, political risks are quite large.
      Political risk is considered high to medium. A continuous, double-digit annual inflation is causing regular
      depreciations in the FMG (Malagasy Franc). Moreover, the opening of the domestic rice import market has
      been pulling down the rice price (no tariff protection for locally produced rice).

Financial risk
   •	 In the Pequin Kavaje case, although the fee paid for water allocation service is substantive as a percentage
      of farmer income, it does not fully cover the production and supply costs. Farmer would want to see

                              evidence of real progress in O&M efficiency before accepting the fee increases. This is the case where
                              public support may be needed to fill the gap.

                      Agricultural off-take risk
                            •	 In the Sonora case, the major risk for the farmers is the possible reduction of the agricultural produce cost
                              given external factors such as the open market of the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA)
                              and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules. These factors oblige them to compete with North American
                              farmers, particularly with corn, wheat, and sorghum. Crop diversification toward high-value-added crops is
                              the main challenge.

                      Technical risk
                            •	 In the Tieshan case, the lack of volumetric water measurement limits the real and effective partnership
                              between the Tieshan Water Supply Corporation (WSC) and WUAs. The next step would be to scale up the
                              WSC’s accountability. Volumetric measurement at the farm level would enable documentation of water
                              cost and water value and perhaps also explain the reasons for the very low water use.

                      Land acquisition risk
                            •	 Although the Senegal Sugar Company, Dina Farm and agribusinesses in Saudi Arabia are purely private
                              investments, they have been supported by counterparts from their respective governments, such as
                              the provision of free land, free credit (Saudi agribusinesses) and a free water supply (CSS and Saudi
                              agribusinesses).

                            •	 In Megech-Seraba, Ethiopia, in order to accommodate the new irrigation scheme configuration and
                              infrastructure, it was necessary to re-allocate farmers’ land, and to reconfigure and restructure plots at
                              the quaternary level to accommodate the in-field irrigation system. This work is being carried out by
                              the regional land administration (EPLAUA) and the survey and re-allocation process is ongoing. The
                              reconfiguration and restructuring of plots will take place during the construction period, as defined in the
                              Resettlement Action Plan (RAP).The management contractor is assisting the authorities in land reallocation
                              and development.

                      Water supply risk
                            •	 During dry years, in Adasiyeh scheme most of the flow of the King Abdullah Canal is pumped for the
                              city of Amman, while high-quality groundwater on the highlands is diverted for politically protected
                              private irrigation. Recurrent droughts over the years (2000-04) have severely reduced water supply, while
                              preserving citrus farms. High gross productivity has enabled the use of unconventional (for example,
                              desalinized water). Urban wastewater from Amman’s sewage treatment plant goes through a downstream
                              water reservoir and is being reused for agriculture in part of the Jordan Valley.

                            •	 Water supply risk is very high for the Business Farms in Saudi Arabia. Because most pumping is done
                              from non-renewable (fossil) aquifers, this is causing a crucial debate about the future of Saudi Arabia’s
                              agriculture.

Collection risk
   •	 ITFC in Ghana (where national collection rates in irrigation schemes range from 45-65 percent) provides
      access to irrigation, necessary inputs and technical assistance to smallholders, who are charged an
      interest-free loan. Smallholders have to make an in-kind payment, 85 kg of mango valued at $25, to join
      the scheme, and are required to sell their mangoes through the ITFC. From the fifth year of the scheme,
      2016 onwards, the farmer association (OMOA) will repay 30 percent of their sales to the ITFC until the debt
      is repaid.

Demand Risk
   •	 In the case of Maniçoba, Brazil, a private concessionaire might face risks related with the evolution of
      the demand from alternative uses of water. According to the water regulatory framework, the allocation
      of water to irrigation and other uses is decided in Basin Committees, and irrigation is not a priority. In a
      concession period of 30 years, new and alternative demand may affect the availability of water.


1.12.4.	 Major sponsors

Most of the developers or sponsors in the case studies are large commercial companies looking to export local
products. There are very few companies in the market which are willing to expand their businesses in irrigation
services especially in emerging economies. Some of the companies mentioned in the case studies are as follows:

   •	 Commercial agricultural companies, such as WIENCO of Netherlands, Solar Harvest Ltd, Prairie Volta
      Limited, Premium Foods Limited, Veg Pro International Inc., and GADCO.

   •	 Engineering companies that have extended services to develop and implement irrigation schemes, such
      as BRL of France in the Megech scheme.

   •	 In the Saudi Arabian case, about eight commercial agriculture products companies are sponsoring the
      farm. These include HADCO, TADCO, GADCO, JADCO, and NADEC for wheat, alfalfa, and vegetables;
      AL MARAI and AL SAFI for dairy farming; AL RAJHI for sheep and other livestock breeding. Most business
      farms have connections with national equipment suppliers.


1.12.5.	 Competitive Bidding

The most common bidding variable, in those cases for which information is available, is that of the lowest tariff.
Even with competitive bidding, PPPs in irrigation is still an emerging sub-sector where number of interested
sponsors and lenders willing to finance such schemes are very few. As a result even scenarios where was competitive
bidding, there very few bids. For instance, in the proposed West Nile Delta project in Egypt, only two bidders—
from China and an Egyptian/European consortium—participated in the pre-qualification process and were invited
to prepare financial proposals. The Moroccan Guerdane project received two bids and the financing was largely
subsidized. In the Pontal irrigation project, only one bid was received in the first round.

                      1.13.	 The other ‘P’: Involving third parties in public Irrigation schemes

                      Traditional schemes are usually dependent on government to provide all aspects of agricultural services to the
                      farmers. The case studies show that in general the inclusion of any kind of third party improves both the quality
                      and the reliability of service. Handbook explores several types of third parties, drawn from the case studies.

                            •	 The private sector can manifest itself in many forms, for instance, as:

                                    ⋅⋅ Project developer. In Chiansi, Zambia, a private company, InfraCo, injected patient capital to a
                                      commercial irrigation project in order to increase attractiveness of this greenfield project. InfraCo
                                      sought to divest itself of its equity position at a later date when the project was fully operational
                                      and risks better understood.

                                    ⋅⋅ Entrepreneur, such as a commercial agriculture company or equipment manufacturer. Such parties
                                      are important in a variety of roles—for instance, as service providers by contracting with WUAs,
                                      offering credit loans to farmers, supplying seeds, fertilizers, irrigation equipment, and buying
                                      produce, as demonstrated in the ITFC (Ghana), Nakhlet (Mauritania), and Anatolia (Turkey) cases.
                                      A prerequisite for making an irrigation service a successful business opportunity for entrepreneurs
                                      is have it operate in a community large enough to make the venture viable. In each of the cases
                                      mentioned, community (i.e., market) size has helped to reduce fixed costs for farmers, improved
                                      credit terms, and enhanced quality and responsiveness of irrigation O&M. In India’s Eastern Uttar
                                      Pradesh, a diesel-pump dealer acted as a representative for small-scale and poor farmers in
                                      dealing with bureaucracies and obtaining loans. In Ghana’s ITFC, the local subsidiary of a Dutch
                                      company, WEINCO, has become the service provider to farmer associations (OMOA). WEINCO
                                      has evolved from an agricultural product company to a service provider. This trend is seen in
                                      traditional infrastructure sectors where a construction company or equipment manufacturer can
                                      become a service provider—e.g., SERCO, an international service company that is focused on
                                      improving efficiency and quality of public services.

                                    ⋅⋅ Investor. This is the traditional mode where a private investor will finance and operate the irrigation
                                      scheme as a business.

                            •	 State-owned enterprises as service providers. In Victoria, Australia, for instance, a “corporative” state-
                              owned authority, the Goulburn-Murray Water Authority (GMWA), was created in 1994 to provide services
                              in irrigation districts. Farmers can feel confident that they have reliable OMM and that the cost they pay is
                              their fair share.

                            •	 Water Technology Institutes. These can provide technical support to government or WUA in managing an
                              irrigation scheme. For instance, a WUA in the case of Sonora in Mexico turned to the Mexican Institute on
                              Water Technology (IMTA).

   •	 Water User Associations. WUAs are water user-based, resource-driven water management organizations
      that work with farmers and service providers to ensure quality and efficient services and irrigation scheme
      performance. They are mainly set up by public authorities to provide local management to an irrigation
      scheme. A WUA can operate on a small scale, represented by a village farmer cooperative (Nakhlet,
      Mauritania), or on a larger scale of a federation, with more extensive and complex responsibilities and
      larger area of coverage (e.g., Pequin Kavaje, Albania, where all WUAs fall under a federation of Water User
      Associations). The WUAs generate their revenues through water user fees and farmer subscription fees,
      financial assistance from development banks, such as AFD, or financial assistance from government. For
      example, in SAED, Senegal, seven WUAs and government created a mixed-government WUA fund in
      which government makes contributions in proportion to the recovered maintenance fees collected by the
      WUAs.

                        efficient water service to farmers. Additionally, as legal entities, WUAs are able to raise financing on behalf
                        of farmers. WUAs offer collaborative decision-making and problem-solving strategies through collective
                        management. Finally, WUAs collect the user fees in a transparent way and allocate them for O&M services.
                        The case studies show that the most common function for WUAs is through O&M.

 BOX 1.7: WUAs are becoming an integral part of irrigation schemes

  These functions vary depending on the regional location and the degree of autonomy and empowerment
  delegated to WUAs from public parties. Price regulation and setting of O&M fees is performed by WUAs in
  Alaotra, Madagascar, and Sonora, Mexico, while contract renegotiation is carried out by WUAs in ORMVA,
  Morocco. Some of the lessons learned are that:

      •	 Government will continue to play a critical role in WUA operations. It provide financial assistance
         and retain its regulatory and oversight functions, as in the case of the SAED in Senegal where seven
         diverse WUA-government-financed maintenance funds were created to sustain irrigation schemes.
         Government’s contribution to them is in proportion to the recovered maintenance fees collected by
         the WUAs.

      •	 Technical and institutional capacities are prerequisites to WUA sustainability and successful operation.
         Additionally, as observed in the Southern Anatolia project in Turkey, WUAs require long-term business
         plans and asset management, research opportunities, technical assistance, farmer training, and
         farmer involvement in project design and implementation. WUAs do not have the institutional and
         professional capacity to manage complex O&M.

      •	 WUAs improve farmers’ resiliency to risks such as weather or credit servicing. The individual farmer’s
         capacity to solve problems is increased through collective sharing, support, and management offered
         by WUAs. Furthermore, farmers enjoy reduced water tariffs, as in the case of Megech in Ethiopia,
         where WUAs manage secondary and tertiary canals, thus decreasing the O&M costs.

      •	 WUAs need to have clearly-defined legal rights, empowerment, and autonomy in order to become
         efficient and contribute to sustainability of their irrigation schemes. As the case studies show, WUAs
         lack important powers that could enhance their functions in irrigation schemes. It is important to
         improve the WUAs’ legal organization, thereby enabling them to charge and collect water service fees
         and WUA service fees. Additionally, many of the WUAs identified in the case studies are not legally
         allowed to employ personnel, select service providers, handle issues related to the irrigation scheme
         management and rehabilitation, work directly with financial institutions, or sign contracts.




1.14.	 Impact of PPP schemes in the irrigation sector

As many of the PPPs reviewed have been implemented only recently, or are still in the process of being developed,
the impact of the arrangements are less well-established and are yet to be seen. In terms of benefits to farmers,
however, the general finding is that water services have improved, though at a higher price with an improvement
in net savings with expectations of reduced life cycle costs and fiscal burden to governments. In the process,
government has clarified its role from retaining the ‘social good’ aspect from a traditional ‘public good’ provider.

                      Most cases have had measureable impact on the sustainability of the schemes.

                            •	 In a number of the recent PPP initiatives that are reviewed, PSP in irrigation is expected to enhance
                              efficiency of operation, and help farmers increase their agricultural productivity and develop value chains
                              that generate commercial surpluses. For example, the management contract in the Megech-Seraba
                              scheme is expected to provide value for money by ensuring efficient construction supervision, specific
                              coverage and service standards to users, rapid customer response times, adequate training and education
                              to small landholders, and enhanced O&M of the irrigation system.33

                            •	 The experience of the development of the Nakhlet irrigation scheme in Mauritania has shown that
                              involving a third-party in irrigation service provision, in this case through the Water Users Association
                              (WUA), can contribute to reducing fixed costs for farmers, improving credit terms and the quality and
                              responsiveness of irrigation O&M.

                            •	 In schemes such as the ITFC irrigation scheme in Ghana, smallholder farmers are expected to benefit from
                              access to inputs (such as seeds, manure and other fertilizers), markets and technical assistance. Extension
                              of the ITFC’s scheme to smallholders is expected to increase farmers’ yields by 5 percent annually for 500
                              farmers, while in the planned Pontal scheme, economic analysis predicted that the integrated smallholder
                              farms connected could expect a monthly income of $865–$910 depending on the crop grown. In the
                              latter case, smallholders will also benefit from a guaranteed purchase of their agricultural produce by the
                              agribusiness users.

                            In most cases, water service fees increased and was not immediately offset by a corresponding rise in farmers’
                            income. While, this was not directly due to increase in cost of inputs but because the government subsidies
                            were eliminated as the service provider entered the irrigation scheme. It still has had an initial negative impact
                            on the willingness of farmers to pay water use fees. Many schemes have sought to address this issue by
                            managing the way in which the increases in water use fees are implemented.

                            •	 For instance, Ethiopia’s Megech-Seraba scheme involves a tariff transition period, in order to allow a
                              gradual increase in tariffs as farmers realize increased incomes from the use of irrigation. WUAs helped
                              reduce the tariffs to sustain the main PPP portion.

                            •	 Similarly, in Albania’s Pequin Kavaje and France’s CACG/Neste, user fees were raised only after evidence
                              of real progress in OMM efficiency, while the government’s authority to enforce collection laws were
                              strengthened in Mauritania’s Alaotra and Jordan’s Adasiyeh. Furthermore, the experience of the SAED
                              (Senegal), Tieshan (China), and Sonora (Mexico) schemes suggests that farmers’ concerns can be
                              managed if the farmer groups are given an influential role in setting and collecting the fees, and also in
                              verifying that the funds are used to improve the quality of the water service.

      In terms of fiscal burden it is difficult to say what life cycle costs would have been if the scheme had
      continued to function under the previous conditions or even with renewed public financing.


1.14.1.	 Lessons learned from case studies

    •	 Well-defined legal and regulatory frameworks create favorable investor climates. Established rules
        and procedures, in parallel with a well-defined PPP policy, would enable contracts and interaction between
        the parties to be established with certainty, and would also provide assurance to the private partner for the
        protection of its investment. In Brazil, there is a mention of PPPs in Irrigation policy. In Ethiopia, there is a
        regulation on setting up WUAs and their role in irrigation schemes.

    •	 Regulation of groundwater extraction, soil, and water conservation measures. In the absence of
        government control over groundwater use, the shift from surface-based irrigation to an increasing reliance
        on groundwater pumping, as experienced in regions such as South Asia, can result in a loss of expected
        revenues for a private partner supplying water to farmers with the right to recover O&M fees. While many
        countries have taken steps towards setting up a regulatory framework to govern groundwater extraction,
        in most cases, a more comprehensive legislation is required to prioritize uses.

    •	 Irrigation is a part of other agricultural and rural sectors, and is interrelated with trade and overall
        microeconomic policies.34 Early evidence suggests that PPPs in irrigation are more likely to succeed if
        they are implemented within relatively dynamic agrarian sectors. In this context, policy developments
        surrounding irrigation PPPs should be framed as part of a broader reform process.

    •	 Institutional capacity and process coupled with political are essential in preparing and carrying
        out an effective PPP project. In general, there tends to be multiple government agencies sharing
        responsibilities across the broader water sector in developing economies. Governments need to introduce
        capacity building programs in irrigation sector and specifically, developing irrigation PPP, a streamlined
        decision-making and efficient organization, which includes standardizing tender documents and
        introducing a single granting authority.

    •	 Third-party interventions and involvement will create a positive outcome of efficient and quality
        service minimizing government’s risks. Irrigation schemes need professional third-party providers to
        ensure external support when governments do not perceive them as viable. The private sector offers
        financing, efficiency, technological, institutional advancement and innovation, quality service, and
        lower transaction costs—as presented in the case of Eastern Uttar Pradesh, India. With private-sector
        involvement, transaction costs declined and the process of acquiring pump pipes has improved.

                            •	 Creating the right incentives to encourage transparency and service. As seen in Megech-Seraba,
                              Ethiopia, the right incentives need to be put in place to enhance service reliability, availability, and quality.
                              The private operator was paid in three ways: (i) lump sum for system design review, (ii) time-based rate for
                              construction works supervision, and (iii) performance based on OMM.

                            •	 Performance monitoring and evaluation are key elements in assuring success of the project in
                              the post-award phase. Granting authority should apply due diligence in monitoring private operator
                              performance. Capacity to manage, monitoring and evaluation system, although critical in contract
                              management, are often downplayed and even ignored by the granting authorities. Ensuring managerial
                              capacity, securing appropriate monitoring mechanisms and applying due diligence should be undertaken
                              and reinforced by the government in the implementation phase of the project. All this starts with
                              government reconsidering its role and seriousness of this task.

                            •	 Government involvement attracts private investors. This should include not only regulation but also
                              financial support. A government commitment to providing a minimum amount of remuneration, in
                              the event that revenues are insufficient, would reduce costs associated with demand risks and limited
                              willingness of users to pay the irrigation fees. In the Murray project in Australia, government participation
                              assured stakeholders of viability and success of this business opportunity.

                            •	 Availability of data and information attracts bidders. Data on the state of existing assets and sites, as
                              well as on inter-basin or international treaties and agreements for the transfer of water and the utilization
                              of the available surface storage, would be essential for investors to assess water availability and ensure
                              effective surface water management.

                            •	 Quality of service, a client-oriented approach is important for efficient and sustainable irrigation
                              scheme. Farmers are willing to pay for quality and reliable service, as shown in the example of Morocco’s
                              Guerdane. Meeting the needs of clients who are free to subscribe or unsubscribe on the basis of
                              performance quality and service cost is therefore vital. System sustainability depends solely on local
                              economic dynamics and loyalty on the part of clients.

    2.1.	 Setting up a commercially viable irrigation scheme

    The Public-Private Partnerships unit of the World Bank Group defines PPP as “A long-
    term contractual arrangement between a public entity or authority and a private entity
    for providing a public asset or service in which the private party bears significant risk and
    management responsibility” (WBG PPP website , 2016)

    Based on the definition, in order to create a long-term partnership, it is important to set up
    a project structure that involves the identification of the efficient allocation of responsibilities
    between the public and private sectors. Ultimately it involves determining which PPP model
    will fit the specific opportunity that is under consideration. Determining the appropriate
    structure for the arrangement—which is then formalized in the contract—plays a critical
    role in enabling the project stakeholders to attract the finance necessary to support
    implementation.

    This chapter considers the main issues involved in structuring a commercially viable scheme.
    It discusses the basic structure of a PPP contract and allocation of responsibilities, service
    obligation, and risks that should be included in the contract. The chapter provides an
    overview of various types of PPP models and associated transfer of functions between the
    private and public parties. The chapter presents a practical application of the key principles
    of risk allocation in various PPP irrigation scheme contracts.

    The chapter is concluded with a discussion of the financing structure for the contract and the
    various approaches that can be used to finance the project, including the potential role for
    government and development partners such as the World Bank Group.

2.2.	 Integrating PPP arrangements

It is more difficult to establish irrigation PPPs that involve the transfer of investments. It is due to the fact that
private firms can find it complicated to finance irrigation projects efficiently due to the pressures of large upfront
costs and risks in securing adequate repayment.


2.2.1.	   Contractual structure of PPPs

The basic contractual structure of a PPP arrangement is set out in Figure 2.2 below. The private firm taking on
the financing responsibilities associated with the scheme typically forms a specific company for the purposes
of the project; which is known as a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV). The SPV is then responsible for securing the
financing for the project on a non-recourse or limited-recourse basis. For instance, in the Chiansi Irrigation
Scheme, an Infrastructure Service Company (Infra Co) will be formed as a special purpose service company,
responsible for building, operating, and financing irrigation assets.

Financing can be raised through a combination of debt and equity. The debt can come from lenders in
a variety of forms (bank loans, bonds, etc.); the equity is capital that is injected through the company’s
shareholders. Equity is generally more expensive than debt because equity holders require a higher return on
their investment; this is because in the event of any losses by the SPV the debt holders are repaid first. Interest
payments are generally tax deductible. As a result of this, projects often seek to use a higher proportion of debt
than equity to finance the project, although lenders typically are the ones that specify the minimum level of
equity they require from sponsors in order for them to provide debt.

Within a PPP arrangement, the SPV usually also arranges contracts with other private firms to actually carry
out the design and construction and O&M work, though these firms are often affiliated with the SPV or are
shareholders of the SPV.

                   2.2.2.	        Principles for allocating the risks

                   The underlying objective when determining how the different risks should be allocated between the private
                   sector and government in any PPP arrangement is to ensure that risks are transferred to the party that is best
                   able to manage it by either mitigating or absorbing the risk. More specifically, the key principles for allocating
                   the risks are to allocate them to the party:

                         •	 Best able to control the likelihood of the risk occurring;
                         •	 Best placed to control the impact of the risk on the targeted project outcomes; and
                         •	 Positioned to absorb the risk at lowest cost.

                   This is explained in more detail in Table 2.1:

Checklist for Allocating Risk and Responsibilities

When considering how to allocate the various risks associated with the PPP, the government should develop
a risk allocation matrix (or risk register). The matrix identifies the key risks associated with the PPP and defines
which of the PPP parties is responsible for bearing the risk. The risk matrix is put into practice through the PPP
contract. To this end, the World Bank devised a checklist35 for allocating risk and responsibilities between the
parties to the PPP contract. The following checklist is based on that matrix:

     ü	Define the major areas of responsibility (design, build, operate, maintain, and finance).
     ü	
      Define specific responsibilities for each area.

     ü	
      Identify the risks associated with each responsibility.

     ü	Note the direct and indirect relationships between risk and responsibilities.
     ü	Establish how the risks are interrelated.
     ü	For each risk, identify which party is best able to bear the risk, and in particular, who can:
              ü	Predict the risk.

                             ü	Control the impact of the risk.
                             ü	Diversify and absorb the risk.
                         ü	
                          Decide whether the risk should be fully allocated to one party or shared.

                         ü	Check for any constraints on the ability of the parties to bear risk (such as information problems
                            or unwillingness to bear risks that a party may appear best able to manage).

                         ü	Based on the risk analysis, assign a party to:
                             ü	Assume each responsibility.
                             ü	Bear each risk.
                   As part of the process of strengthening the PPP policy framework a number of governments have also
                   developed a standard or preferred approach to allocating risk for PPP projects. This standard approach
                   can either be generic across sectors or designed to reflect specific sectors, and is used as the starting point
                   for allocating risks for an infrastructure project. For instance, South Africa has a PPP Manual that includes a
                   standardized risk allocation matrix. This matrix includes a list of the risks relevant to the project, the typical risk
                   mitigation mechanism and defines the PPP party to which the risk has been allocated.

                   The following subchapter describes how the irrigation PPPs that have been developed have allocated the
                   responsibilities and risks associated with each contract.

                   The proportion of governments’ risks can vary according to what is needed to make the project viable. In
                   general, the various case studies point to varying levels of government involvement across PPP schemes in
                   the irrigation sector. In Chiansi, for instance, government involvement appears to be limited to regulating the
                   irrigation project, whereas in Pontal, the government will be responsible for setting the initial price of water and
                   land, and financing the construction of the scheme’s basic road and energy infrastructure, in addition to ceding
                   the land and infrastructure, and providing capacity payments to the SPC.


                   2.3.	 The PPP Contract

                   The PPP contract is the document (or collection of documents) that govern the relationship between the various
                   PPP parties. The contract defines the allocation of responsibilities and rights for the PPP arrangement and
                   provides mechanisms that can be used to enable the PPP parties to deal with any unforeseen changes.

                   Given the importance of the contract to the functioning of the PPP arrangement, the design of the contract
                   takes a significant amount of time and resources to complete; usually the government makes use of expert
                   financial, economic, irrigation engineering and legal advisers when developing the contract.

                   The objective when developing the contract is to design a contract that is clear, comprehensive, and provides

certainty for the contracting parties. Though, additionally, given the nature of the irrigation (and other
infrastructure) PPPs—i.e., they are agreed over the long-term and involve significant uncertainty—there is also
a need for the contract to have some flexibility built in. This enables the PPP parties to, as far as possible, deal
with any material change in circumstances within the contract without having to re-negotiate contract terms
or terminate the contract. An effective PPP contract therefore manages to balance the objectives of providing
certainty and clarity for the parties, while also giving room for some flexibility.

This subchapter discusses the main areas that are typically covered in PPP contracts and presents some case
studies of PPP contracts that have been developed for irrigation PPP projects.

The content of a PPP contract necessarily varies across different countries and depending on the type of PPP
arrangements that has been agreed. However, the main content of a PPP contract together with an explanation
of what each term means is set out in the table below.

 Sections in Heads
 of Agreement      Explanation of what is typically covered
 Definitions          This is usually a brief section providing definitions of the key terms included in the contract.

                      This should include definition of the relevant parties to the PPP arrangement and that the contract
                      includes each party’s “successors and assigns” in case one of the parties is merged or acquired. If this is
                      not clear if disputes arise there can be an issue as to whether the contract still binds the successor entity.
 General              The general provisions cover the legal basis upon which the PPP will be established and other key
 provisions           issues related to the structure of the deal such as:
                      •	 The rights and obligations of the private firm, farmers and government;

                      •	 The start date of the contract; and

                      •	 Any specific agreements made by the private firm to enable it to enter into the contract.

 Conditions           This presents a summary of the issues that need to be completed prior to the PPP start date for the
 precedent            contract to come into force. In some cases if the actions are not completed prior to contract signature
                      then the contract bit might be signed. The most typical conditions precedent are:
                      •	 Provision of land, which is usually the responsibility of the government;

                      •	 Securing any necessary permits, such as the right to abstract water;

                      •	 Developing and agreeing an asset register; and

                      •	 Securing the finance necessary to fund the project.

 Grant of PPP         This section specifies that the private firm has been granted the rights to provide the irrigation services
                      under the PPP arrangement for the specified location.

STRUCTURING PPPs

                    Sections in Heads
                    of Agreement      Explanation of what is typically covered
                    Duration of PPP     This sets out the length of time for which the PPP arrangement will be in place, including a clear
                                        indication of:
                                        •	 When the contract commences and expires;
                                        •	 When the obligations that have been set out in the contract become effective; and
                                        •	 Whether the contract can be renewed, and if so the length of time for which it can be renewed.

                                        The duration of the project will depend on the nature of the PPP arrangement that has been developed
                                        and the level of risk that has been passed on to the private firm; for instance for a management contract
                                        there is a more limited risk, therefore projects tend to be shorter while for a BOT arrangement the
                                        contract needs to be longer to enable the operator to recover its investment.
                    Early Termination   In case of early termination of the contract and project assets revert back to the public sector, contract
                    Payments            should set out the compensation payment depending on the cause of the early termination. There are
                                        three broad reasons for early termination: default by the private party, termination by the public party,
                                        whether due to default of for reasons of public interest, and early termination due to some external
                                        reason (force majeure).
                    Handover            Specifics include the contract close date, and processes in place to manage the on-time termination
                    arrangements        and handover of any assets at the end of the PPP contract or in the event of an early termination.
                    Representations     This defines any warranties in place related to for example the quality of the assets included as part of
                    and warranties      the PPP arrangement, or the minimum levels of water to be provided to the scheme.
                    Key Performance     This section of the contract specifies the required level of quality, quantity of performance for the
                    Indicators (KPIs)   responsibilities taken on board by the private parties to the agreement. The performance requirements
                                        should also specify the monitoring and enforcement mechanisms and the penalties that will apply for
                                        failure to achieve performance at the pre-defined level.

                                        The main types of service obligations that will typically be specified for an irrigation project include:
                                        •	 Billing procedures and the nature of the contract between the private firm and the customers;

                                        •	 How any new connections should be managed;

                                        •	 A requirement to provide irrigation services at a specified level of standard, e.g. availability of service and
                                           pressure of water;

                                        •	 The rights for the private firm to disconnect customers that are not paying for the services on a timely
                                           basis; and

                                        •	 The development of a mechanism that enables customers to complain about poor service provision by
                                           the private firm.

 Other obligations This part of the contract should describe any other obligations of the private firm, but also sets out the
                      obligations of the relevant government authority. This will include obligations such as the obligation:
                      •	 To provide land and specified assets;

                      •	 To obtain permits for the private firms;

                      •	 To provide agreed payments to the private firms where relevant; and

                      •	 To carry out required capital investment, repair, and renewals where relevant.

 Tariffs and          The contract will also specify the arrangements that will be put in place for the private firm to receive
 indexation           payment for its services. This should include a clear specification of the tariff setting methodology and
                      the institutions that are responsible for setting the tariff and how the process of indexation and tariff
                      review and adjustment will work.
 Periodic and         This section should describe the processes or mechanisms for managing changes to the tariff
 extraordinary        agreements should also be specified. This will include making changes to the tariff in response to
 tariff adjustments inflation through agreed indexation mechanisms and the development of tariff “re-openers” that allow
                      for changes to the tariff in the event of significant and unexpected changes to the conditions faced by
                      the private firm that might arise over a longer-term contract.
 Reporting            This part of the contract will detail any reporting and data requirements for the private firm and other
 and data             parties to the PPP arrangement where relevant. When developing the requirements the following issues
 requirements         should be considered:
                      •	 The information or data that need to be included in each of the reports and the likely availability of this
                         information or data;

                      •	 The frequency with which the reports need to be produced;

                      •	 The government agency responsible for reviewing and acting upon the information or data being
                         produced, and the capacity of the agency to review the information adequately; and

                      •	 The need for third-party verification or auditing of the information that is being produced.

 Monitoring           The contract usually identifies the party responsible for monitoring the performance of the private firm.
                      This can be carried out by the communities, WUAs, or Ministries/Agencies, or a combination of all of
                      them. The private firm is required to provide financial and operational performance data to facilitate
                      the verification of contract compliance. Results of the monitoring evaluation are reported to the
                      granting authority who provides an oversight of the project development and enforces private sector
                      compliance.

                    Dispute                   The contract should identify the mechanisms designed to enable resolution of disputes between the
                    Resolution                parties to the contract, before they become litigated. While traditional mechanisms involve the courts,
                    Mechanisms                these may be more or less effective, independent and efficient depending on the country context.
                                              Alternative mechanisms may move disputes to a third party forum better suited to handling contractual
                                              disputes, and would typically provide for:
                                              •	 Negotiated settlement between the parties;
                                              •	 Conciliation or mediation;

                   2.3.2.	    Defining the Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

                   Key performance indicators are metrics to track the progress and/or performance of a project during project
                   implementation in terms of its service objectives. They should describe the desired output or performance levels
                   and not the means or methods of achieving such outputs.36 Indicators organize information in a way that clarifies
                   the relationships between a project’s impacts, outcomes, outputs, and inputs and help to identify problems
                   along the way that can impede the achievement of project objectives.37 KPIs are subject to further process of
                   refinement, particularly in the long-term contracts as the business environment is more likely to change over
                   time.


                   2.3.3.	    Core Performance Indicators used by the World Bank

                   For internal tracking purposes the World Bank collects and reports data on the following core performance
                   indicators listed below for Irrigation and Drainage projects financed by the World Bank. Project team leaders
                   receive the data on the core indicators from estimates based on project monitoring data on outputs. The data
                   can be supplemented with data available from the irrigation agency responsible for providing irrigation and
                   drainage services in the respective project, and by survey data administered to the irrigation agencies.38

2.3.4.	   KPIs in Ethiopia’s Megech-Seraba project

This project is an example of a progressive use of KPIs. The notion of KPIs is that they should monitor
performance but they should also be reflective of the actual realities of the contract as it evolves over time. In
this project, the Incentive Remuneration is payable against the successful completion of Areas of Performance.
Five areas of performance have been established. Each area has a set of performance indicators that will be
monitored and evaluated during the life of the contract at various project stages and with different frequency
depending on its relative importance at a given time. This reflects the evolving nature of the management
services contract. For example, capacity building is given more weight at the beginning of the contract while
maintenance is not part of performance measurement in the first three years but becomes progressively more
important towards the end of the contract.

                         2.4.	   Approaches to financing irrigation schemes

                   In general, it is not feasible for private companies to finance irrigation projects completely on their own,
                   especially in emerging economies—the level of risk associated with relying on farmers to pay the service charge
                   for irrigation schemes is too high. For instance, the World Bank Appraisal Report on the Accra Plains project
                   in Ghana concluded that given the tariff levels and payment risk from the farmers, the scheme would not be
                   financially viable for a private investor to carry out the scheme investment activities on its own, thereby providing
                   the rationale for the use of public funds to support the development of the scheme.

                   While the private sector can walk away from projects with poor projected financial returns, a public authority is
                   usually obliged to take on such investments based on public policy requirements and project economics. This
                   is reflected in the key differences in the principles underlying private and public project finance evaluations. The
                   private sector approach is centered on the financial aspects of the project, focusing on the returns generated,
                   particularly in the early years of a project, for debt repayment obligations, and on ensuring that the project life is
                   long enough to reach profitability. In contrast, the public sector requirements would include economic criteria in
                   its assessments, with a focus on benefits rather than revenues.

The above discussion does not mean that it is not possible for irrigation schemes to be financed by the private
sector. Instead, the implication is that government and development partners have a role to play in using public
finance to help make private sector participation in the financing of irrigation projects viable. While initial lender
due diligence and subsequent monitoring can enhance project transparency and quality, it is also important to
ensure that there is a focus from project inception, on developing a bankable project structure which reflects the
requirements of lenders such as in terms of risk allocation. In this regard, there is significant benefit in involving
transaction and financial advisers with experience in structuring PPP projects and taking them to the market.

Key financing risks are the following:

      •	 Credit-worthiness of the project. Private contractor will conduct a full financial and legal due diligence
         on the project to make sure that the project cash-flow and legal structure are robust enough to withstand
         certain likely stresses (listed below).

      •	 Counterparty: Risk that the public sector grantor (government) will not or partially fulfill its obligations
         under a concession, lease or other agreement on PPP financing for public infrastructure assets.40

      •	 Offtake. Water volume consumed is directly related to the agricultural offtake. Whether it is to the public
         authority or to the farmers, it needs to be certain so as to ensure the private operator’s ability to assess the
         project’s ability to generate revenue over the contract’s term.

      •	 Weather effects. Hydrology can affect the supply of water to the farmers, which in turn would affect the
         contract’s performance.

      •	 Bankability. Lenders would generally require some collateral to raise debt in order to ensure that they will
         be paid back in case the project is unsuccessful.

One option that can be followed by government is to provide the potential private-sector firms with guarantees
against certain risks associated with the project. These guarantees effectively provide a backstop against
downside risks, making the project a more attractive opportunity for the private sector. In some instances,
depending on the credit history of the governing authority of the project, the provision of a sovereign guarantee
might not provide sufficient comfort to prospective investors. In these instances, the involvement of IFIs, such
as the World Bank Group as in Megech-Seraba or Asian Development Bank as in Muhuri, can provide more
confidence to investors.


       2.5.	    Sources of financing in irrigation PPP Projects

There are very few instances of irrigation PPP schemes that are funded purely by the private sector. Most of the
case studies that we have reviewed involve some form of financing from the public sector and/or involve support
from development partners.

STRUCTURING PPPs

                   2.5.1.	     Public funding and support

                   Public funds can be used to finance the entire project. However, not counting the obvious fiscal concerns, there
                   is also the issue that by reducing the amount of private capital committed to the project, the use of public funds
                   could reduce the incentives that the private parties have to improve the efficiency of the scheme, making it
                   easier for the company to walk away from the project if things go wrong. Therefore, governments would need to
                   strike a balance between providing support to enable the private firm to finance the project, without dampening
                   the incentives.

                   Based on the case studies and other desk-based research, we identify the following options for public financing:

                         •	 The provision of upfront loans or grants directly to the SPV. In the Guerdane project (see Box 2.3), the
                             private firm benefited from a sizeable grant from government as part of the PPP arrangement. In this
                             case, the public funds covered 45 percent of the total project costs of €195million, and were split equally
                             between a subsidy and a concessional loan with an interest rate of 1 percent and a deferred repayment of
                             20 years.

                         •	 The use of performance-based availability payments, such as those received by the private contractor in
                             Megech-Seraba, Ethiopia (see Box 2.4) placed the main responsibilities for the private sector contractor in
                             five areas:

                                   ⋅⋅ Overall management and operation of the scheme
                                   ⋅⋅ Irrigation operational aspects
                                   ⋅⋅ Service aspects
                                   ⋅⋅ Maintenance of the scheme
                                   ⋅⋅ Capacity building of WUAs, training, land allocation support, and establishing a long-term
                                      operation & maintenance entity

                         •	 A number of governments have established viability gap funds. These funds use resources sourced from
                             the national budget to provide up-front capital subsidies for infrastructure projects. Examples include the
                             Pakistan and India Viability Gap Funds. Viability gap funding has also been used in development finance,
                             as is discussed below.

                         •	 The provision of tax exemptions and a tax stability agreement, such as that granted by the government
                             of Peru to the concessionaire, Odebrecht, in the initial water diversion stage of the Olmos scheme. Further
                             detail on the financing structure of this project is provided in Box 2.2 below.

                         •	 Governments can also provide support in the form of guarantees, such that government takes on the
                             responsibility of guaranteeing the repayment of the debts associated with the project in the event of
                             default by the private company. For instance, the Federal PPP Guarantee Fund in Brazil has provided the
                             collateral to reduce the concessional funding from IFIs.

         2.5.1.1.	   Optimal conditions for public sector involvement

While the government could fund a PPP project entirely with public resources, doing so could reduce the
incentive for the private party (or parties) to improve the efficiency of the scheme, and it could make it easier for
the company to walk away from the project if things go wrong. Therefore, the government should be careful to
strike a balance in providing sufficient support to enable the private firm to finance the project, but not so much
that it would dampen the private-sector incentives. In summary, here are optimal conditions for public sector
involvement:

   •	 The contract is long-term

   •	 Scheme delivers value for money for service users and the government

   •	 Risks are allocated to the party best able to manage them

   •	 Public sector can hold the private party accountable for meeting its (private sector) obligations

   •	 Private sector provides an innovating and effective service delivery

   •	 Private sector brings technical expertise


2.5.2.	 Concessional funding and support from IFIs

Development partners are increasingly finding new ways to provide development finance (different forms of
finance on concessional terms) to support the ability of private companies to finance infrastructure investments
in emerging economy context. Box 2.1 below describes how development funds are being used to support the
implementation of a PPP arrangement for the Chiansi irrigation scheme through patient capital to help make
the project bankable.

STRUCTURING PPPs

                   BOX 2.1: The Chiansi Irrigation Scheme Model

                     The Chiansi irrigation project, located in the Kafue region of Zambia, has the objective of increasing
                     significantly food production and smallholder farmer incomes through the creation of a shared,
                     commercially managed irrigation system, which will include commercially managed plots and smallholder
                     farmer managed market gardens.

                     The project is under development. The intention is that an Infrastructure Service Company will be formed as
                     a special purpose service company and be responsible for building, operating and financing the irrigation
                     assets. The company will supply the bulk water and the long-term lease of irrigation equipment and farm
                     equipment to the FarmCo(s) and will also provide irrigation services to the smallholders, in exchange for
                     these services the farmers grant the company the right to extract water from the Kafue river for the duration
                     of the project.

                     Project structure

                     The project will involve the provision of irrigation services on up to 2,500 ha of undeveloped land. The
                     engineering works will include pump stations, canals, pipes and storage facilities that will provide water to
                     infield pivots. The project will involve commercial farmers (formed into FarmCo(s)) that will grow wheat, soya
                     and potentially rice and sugar, while smallholders will have access to farming equipment and some technical
                     assistance in addition to the irrigated water.

                     Project financing

                     The total finance requirement is estimated to be $30.5 million, which includes the following:

                         •	 Capital costs of $25 million, including $13.6 million for one-off start-up costs to build canals,
                           clear land, pay for resettlement of farmers. Remainder will pay for the irrigation facilities.

                         •	 Working capital requirement from the commercial farm of $5.5 million.

 BOX 2.1: The Chiansi Irrigation Scheme Model

   According to a report by InfraCo,41 raising the full financing on commercial terms would have been unviable
   due to high revenue risk. The project will rely on relatively poor smallholder farmers for revenues making
   the investment quite risky for investors and lenders. As a result, lenders would expect a higher risk premium
   raising the cost of debt. For investors such as the commercial farmers, an expected returns of around 10
   percent on equity would be insufficient to justify risking their capital in an uncertain demand scenario.

   The project became viable after development partners injected $15 million in patient capital to fund
   the one-off, start-up costs (patient capital is long-term, subordinated capital invested at sub-commercial
   costs). By reducing the amount of capital needed to be raised on commercial terms, raised the estimated
   returns on equity to approximately 16-18 percent—a much more attractive proposition commercially.
   Involving development partners reduced the risk profile of the project as well showing greater government
   commitment towards its contractual obligations and transparency. The key point, from a financing point
   of view, is that the expected returns prior to start-up were commercially unattractive, but became more so
   once the additional investments offset most of the start-up costs.

   This case study shows how a potentially beneficial investment in irrigation, initially unviable because of
   high upfront financing costs and level of associated risk, was made viable by the injection of patient capital,
   thereby enabling the project to come to fruition. The economic return is now estimated to be 17 percent,
   and the income of the 600 smallholders is expected to triple.




The World Bank Group (reference includes IBRD, IDA, IFC and MIGA) has also provided various forms of
financing for irrigation PPP projects, such as:

     •	 Grants. For instance, the World Bank has contributed 50 percent of the seedling cost to out-growers as a
        grant under the ITFC scheme in Ghana.

     •	 Viability gap funding. The IDA will cover 100 percent of the total cost of $45.5 million for the Accra Plains
        Project, including viability gap funding of $40 million, potentially in the form of an upfront payment to the
        project developer.

     •	 Loans. The IDA will provide a concessionary loan, with credit for $30 million to cover the total construction
        costs for the Megech-Seraba scheme, as well as credit for $8 million for the management contract, to
        cover all associated costs for the O&M operator (including incentives). The IBRD has been planning
        a market-based loan of $145 million, to cover 85 percent of the total investment and operating cost
        requirement for the West Delta Irrigation Project in Egypt.

                   In addition, the World Bank Group has been instrumental in providing a range of transaction advisory support
                   services to facilitate the implementation of the PPP schemes, such as:

                         •	 Technical, financial, and legal due diligence. PPIAF funded a project preparatory support for the
                           Megech-Seraba scheme which included: (i) policy, institutional, and legal reforms needed for private
                           participation; (ii) an estimate of investments necessary to attract private capital; and (iii) the identification
                           of measures to reduce project-related risks, including (partial) bank guarantees, insurance, and other
                           measures. The support enabled the government of Ethiopia and key stakeholders to analyze options and
                           select the most appropriate structure for the project based on the range of PPP models presented.42

                         •	 Technical assistance. The IDA is responsible for providing consistent implementation support to the
                           government of Ghana throughout the Accra Plains project, as well as funding the costs of the feasibility
                           study for the PPP and transaction advice ($3 million), technical assistance in support of the PPP transaction
                           ($1.9 million), and organization of small-holder participation in the PPP ($0.5 million).

                         •	 Support for the development of a transaction advisory. The PPIAF provided a grant of $75,000 in
                           2006 to help the Egyptian government develop a conceptual framework and transaction model for
                           implementing the West Delta Irrigation Project (PPIAF 2010). The IFC has also advised the government of
                           Morocco on the structure and implementation of the PPP for the Guerdane irrigation scheme.

                         •	 Support for the transaction process. The IFC conducted the bidding process for Guerdane. In particular,
                           it led the marketing, prequalified potential investors, drafted bidding documents, and oversaw the bidding
                           process to ensure that it was appropriately competitive and transparent, selecting the winning bidder.

                   International financial institutions, such as the World Bank Group and other development partners, are finding
                   increasingly innovative ways to provide development finance to encourage private companies to finance
                   infrastructure investments in emerging economies. The following optimal conditions facilitate IFI involvement:

                         •	 Project is aligned with the overall goals of an IFI

                         •	 IFIs’ involvement will catalyze additional interest from other sectors and will facilitate project development

                         •	 IFI is able to provide innovative financing mechanisms

                         •	 The project is a good investment, highly beneficial to the society and economically sustainability

                         •	 IFI involvement will enable the process of partnership between the public and private sectors

2.5.3.	   Private financing

The private partner is typically responsible for bearing the costs of the irrigation projects not covered by the
government. In Guerdane, for instance, the private partner financed 50 percent of the total project costs,
covering the investment, design, and construction of the irrigation system, while in Muhuri, the Irrigation
Management Operator (IMO) is expected to finance the O&M costs, estimated at around $4.2 million. Both
of these schemes have also required farmers to make some upfront contribution to help finance the irrigation
scheme. For example, farmers are required to contribute €1600/ha (or equivalent to $1800/ha in October 2015
rates), funding up to 5 percent of the total investment in the engineering assets in Guerdane, while in the Muhuri
project, farmers are expected to make a 3 percent contribution towards the rehabilitation or modernization of
the tertiary level irrigation system where open channels are being replaced with buried pipes.

In these case studies, we have found very few instances of PPP schemes that are funded purely by the private
sector. These include schemes such as the Senegal Sugar Company (CSS), Dina Farm, and the Saudi agri-
businesses, which are identified to be almost completely private arrangements, with minimal government
involvement. More recently, the irrigation component of the Olmos scheme in Peru, totaling $280 million, is
being funded solely through private investment from agribusiness firms and Odebrecht. Further detail on how
the different stages of this project are being financed, is presented in Box 2.2 on the next page.

                    BOX 2.2: The Olmos Irrigation Scheme

                     The Olmos project in Peru involves the auction of 38,000 hectares of previously uncultivated land to private
                     investors, who will produce high-value crops. It comprises three main stages:

                           •	 Water diversion stage. The project diverts the Huancabamba River from the eastern side of the
                             Andes to the western side, so that it will flow to the Olmos plains to provide the 406hm3 required for
                             irrigation. This diversion involves the construction of a 44 million m3 dam and 20 km tunnel, funded
                             through a public-private partnership with a total investment of $247 million. This stage was awarded in
                             2004 to Concesionaria Trasvase Olmos S.A, a subsidiary of Odebrecht, through a 20-year contract for
                             $19 million, and was completed in July 2012. The public sector involvement in this stage is through the
                             government of Peru granting tax exemptions and a tax stability agreement to Odebrecht.

                           •	 Irrigation stage. The grantor and trustor of the land, Gobierno Regionalde Lambayeque (GRL), has
                             transferred the land to be auctioned into a trust to make the process easier. The stage was fully
                             awarded in June 2010 to the concessionaire H2Olmos S.A., a subsidiary of Odebrecht, which was
                             formed solely for this project. The construction of the irrigation infrastructure was completed in
                             October 2014, with this component funded solely through private investment from agribusiness firms
                             and Odebrecht. Approximately 50 percent of financing has been raised from bonds issued on Lima’s
                             stock exchange backed by a partial credit guarantee of $50m from the Latin American bank CAF. So
                             far, 35,000 hectares of land have already been successfully auctioned, which should have raised at
                             least $150 million. These funds will be held in a Land Trust, and split between GRL (to pay for the land)
                             and the concessionaire, with the latter’s share of 72 percent used to finance part of the infrastructure
                             investment.

                           •	 Energy generation stage. This stage involves the construction of a hydropower generation turbine,
                             with the objective of generating renewable energy to sell to Peru’s National Interconnected Electric
                             Grid to enable a reduction in CO2 of up to 200 kt per year. This stage was awarded to concessionaire
                             Union Energy SA (SINERSA) in October 2010, which will be responsible for fully financing the costs of
                             this stage.


                              2.5.3.1.	    Optimal conditions for private sector involvement

                   Private-sector partners are typically responsible for bearing the costs of the irrigation projects not covered by
                   the government. However, a few PPP schemes exist with funding purely from the private sector and minimal
                   government involvement (e.g., Senegal Sugar Company, Dina Farm, the Saudi agri-businesses, and Peru’s
                   Olmos scheme). Optimal conditions for private sector involvement in a PPP include:

                         •	 The country has favorable business environment and good investment climate that will facilitate private
                           sector participation in bidding and in the implementation of the project

2.6.	 Further discussion of irrigation PPP contracts

Here we examine the following PPP contracts to consider how some of the issues discussed above have been
addressed in the irrigation sector:

   •	 The contract for the Guerdane PPP arrangement (Box 2.3), which includes a clear and transparent
      explanation of the requirements that are placed on any farmers that want to have access to the irrigation
      services as part of the arrangement.

   •	 The risk allocation in Megech-Seraba (Box 2.4), between public and private stakeholders, including
      performance-based KPIs.

   •	 The provisions of the planned Pontal concession arrangement (Box 2.5), which provide a good example of
      the way in which risk allocation can be specified within a PPP contract.

   •	 The West Delta DBO contract (Box 2.6) that provides an example of the way in which project obligations
      can be specified within a contract.

                    BOX 2.3: Guerdane and the Requirements Placed on Farmers

                     The Guerdane concession arrangement includes a number of clauses that seek to place obligations on the
                     farmers that seek to benefit from the provision of irrigation services from the private company.

                     The contract specifies the following fees that the farmers are required to pay to participate in the scheme:

                         •	 An upfront subscription charge of 1,000 dirhams per hectare of land, which all the farmers were
                           required to pay to join the scheme;

                         •	 A connection fee of 7,000 dirhams per hectare of land, which farmers had to pay when their land was
                           connected to the scheme; and

                         •	 The ongoing service fees that the farmers were required to pay which was based on the amount of
                           water that they consume.

                     While the inclusion of specific requirements on the farmers does not completely mitigate the demand
                     risk, the inclusion of the farmers within the contract arrangement gives the private firm a more transparent
                     framework that it can use to stop providing irrigation services to farmers that do not fulfil their contractual
                     obligations. For instance the contract also specifies:

                         •	 the time period that the farmers have to settle their fees; and

                         •	 the process that the private company can follow in instances where the farmers do not pay on
                           time—the company can issue a warning, if after an additional thirty days the farmer has not paid the
                           company can choose to exclude him/her from the scheme.

 BOX 2.5: Provisions from the Planned Pontal Concession Arrangement

  The Pontal concession arrangement contains clear specifications on a number of issues that we have
  discussed in this section. We discuss some of the key clauses below.

  Duration of the Sponsored Concession
  Section 3 of the contract defines the duration of the sponsored concession to be 25 years from the
  assumption date, with no provision for the extension of this time frame.

  Risk allocation
  For instance Section 20 of the contract provides a clear allocation of the risks associated with the
  agreement.

  The contract states that the private party is responsible for the following types of risks:

      •	 Refusal of users to pay the irrigation service fees,

      •	 Exceeding costs related to the works and services that the private firm is responsible for;

      •	 Technology used in the works and services of the sponsored concession;

      •	 Extinction, destruction, theft, or loss of the infrastructure assets related to the project; and

      •	 Increased cost of capital, including those resulting from increases in interest rates.

  The contract also specifies some risks for which the private company is not responsible. This includes
  features such as:

      •	 Acts of God;

      •	 Social and/or public manifestations that affect the ability of the private firm to provide the irrigation
         services for greater than a specified length of time; and

      •	 Breaches in the exercise of its powers (related to the contract and/ or its relevant regulatory powers)
         by the government institution responsible for the project.

  The contract also has some clear specifications related to the financing requirements for the project. It
  states that the firm is responsible on its own for obtaining the finance necessary to deliver the services that
  are set out in the contract, with BDNES responsible for providing 75 percent of the financing.

  It also requires the private party to provide the relevant government institution with a certified copy of
  the financing and guarantee agreements within five days of the issuance of the execution of the contract.
  Governments often include these requirements in an attempt to mitigate the risks that arise from the fact
  that the contract is normally issued before the project reaches financial close.

                   BOX 2.5: Provisions from the Planned Pontal Concession Arrangement

                     As we discuss in the following section, a project usually cannot reach financial close before the contract is
                     issued because the lenders want to review the contract as part of their due diligence. This creates the risk
                     that upon their review of the contract lenders will want to change the terms on which they will lend to the
                     private firm and hence create additional delays/a need for government and the private party to renegotiate
                     the terms of the contract.

                     Tariffs

                     According to Section 16 of the contract, collection of the tariff can commence upon occupancy of the
                     irrigable area and verification by ANA of the fulfillment of the pre-specified obligations and services of
                     the concessionaire. The tariffs to be charged from each user of the irrigation service shall correspond to
                     a fixed tariff (charged per hectare of land used by the user) and a variable tariff (charged in relation to
                     actual consumption of water by the user). The methodology for determining the tariff is clearly set out in
                     attachment 16.2.1 of the contract.

                     The contract also provides for tariff adjustment on a pro-rata basis each year, from the date of appraisal of
                     the proposal in the bidding.

                     Key performance indicators

                     Under the contract, contraprestação (capacity payments) paid by government will be performance-based,
                     and structured as follows:
                         •	 Availability instalment: 10 percent is payable in one single instalment on the date that the
                           concessionaire completes the common infrastructure works

                         •	 Occupation instalment: 40 percent will be payable monthly within five years to the extent that the
                           irrigated area is occupied.

                         •	 Performance instalment: The remaining 50 percent will be payable monthly as of the date that the
                           irrigated area is fully occupied and throughout the contract.

                     Monitoring

                     Section 14 of the contract tasks ANA with the responsibility of exercising inspection powers of performance
                     of the agreement, with access at all times to data relating to management, accounting, and technical,
                     economic and financial resources of the concessionaire as well as the assets of the sponsored concession.

                     Dispute resolution mechanisms

                     Section 36 of the contract specifies that any and all disputes and/or questions arising out of, or related

 BOX 2.6: West Delta DBO contract

  The West Delta contract sets out the specific obligations that are common in irrigation PPP contracts:

      •	 It specifies the scope of the design-and-build activities that the private firm is required to complete
         together with the technical specification of the standards that have to be achieved and the timeframe
         within which the work has to be completed.

      •	 The standards that the firm has to achieve for the operation of the scheme are also set out in a
         separate Operational Standards Annex.

      •	 The technical process that the firm has to follow for setting the tariff is also clearly defined. The
         tariff includes a fixed fee that is based on the amount of land that the farmer has and a variable fee
         that is based on consumption of water (volumetric tariff)—the volumetric fee set on the contract is
         dependent on both electricity and fuel costs faced by the firm together with the general level of
         inflation experienced in the country.

      •	 The contract also sets out the specific set of circumstances that will lead to a reassessment of the tariff.
         These include: changes to the operational standards that the firm has to achieve; changes in the size
         of the scheme; and the occurrence of force majeure events that are not covered by insurance required
         by this contract to be obtained and maintained by operator.

        3.1.	 Selecting a private contractor

        This chapter focuses on how to select the private partner to build a sustainable irrigation scheme.
        A PPP is a long-term commitment and many livelihoods depend on its success, so the operational
        partner must be financially and technically competent to hold up its part of the bargain
        throughout the life of the project—just as the government, as owner and regulator (or grantor),
        has to fulfill its side of the bargain. In establishing an irrigation PPP, therefore, it is important to
        look carefully at the components of partner selection. The contracting authority should weigh up
        the relative advantages of using competition to drive down project costs, enhance transparency,
        and encourage innovation against the speed of avoiding a competitive process. The end
        result of a successful procurement process is contract award leading to financial closure and
        commencement of the contract.

3.1.1.	    Fiscal commitments to the PPP project

A government usually opts for a PPP in irrigation because it faces fiscal constraints in the building, operating,
and maintaining of that scheme. In doing so it will delegate certain functions and responsibilities to the private
sector in the PPP. But, as the case studies show, this does not amount to a sloughing off of responsibility;
government will continue to be involved both legally and financially in the provision of the irrigation services.
Depending on the type of PPP arrangements, the government may pay a small or substantial part of the life-
cycle costs of an irrigation scheme.

In a public scheme, despite the moral obligation to the farmers, there is no legal contract between the
beneficiaries of the scheme and the public sector. In a PPP contract, the public obligations—including capital
grants, availability payments, contingent payments such as guarantees, etc.—are expected to be fully funded
by government; just as the government will expect the private operator to meet its contractual obligations.
Any public obligations taken on in a PPP arrangement will create direct and indirect liabilities, which should be
accounted for. The fiscal implications of PPP schemes demand special consideration by governments because
the undertaking contains a disparity: PPP contracts involve long-term fiscal commitments, yet most countries’
budget cycles are just 2-5 years long. One way of resolving this issue of providing long-term funding is to build
a fiscal risk management framework applicable to all PPPs that would allow for public sector commitments
beyond the public budget cycle. Ideally, in countries where a common PPP legal framework already exists, a
supporting fiscal risk management framework should be in place (see discussion of risk allocation and checklist
in Chapter Two, sections 2.2.2 and 2.2.3.).


3.2.	 Suitable procurement process

The objective of the procurement process is to establish an effective method for selecting a private partner that
is financially, technically, and operationally capable of the development and long-term operation (or at least
managing a third-party capable of operating the scheme) of an effective and sustainable irrigation system under
the PPP contract.

Typically, a competitive procurement process is the most appropriate approach. This is because managing such
a process can incentivize bidders to compete both in terms of trying to identify the least cost way of delivering
the project and/or developing innovative approaches both technically, operationally and in terms of financing
solutions. These improved approaches may not have been possible in the absence of competitive tension.
For instance, given the government’s objectives of making surface water accessible to the largest number of
farmers possible, the selection criterion in the Guerdane scheme was based on the lowest water tariff offered by
bidders. The competitive bid process resulted in the winning bidder proposing a tariff significantly lower than
the price that citrus farmers in the area had typically paid for irrigated groundwater supplies.43

MANAGING PROCUREMENT

                       However, it is not always clear that a competitive procurement process is the most suitable. Table 3.1 below sets
                       out the key questions that a government should consider before determining the choice of the procurement
                       process.

                       TABLE 3.1: Issues to Consider when choosing the Most Suitable Procurement Process

                                          Public authorities may receive “unsolicited proposals” or proposals from private sector consortia made
                                          without the issue of any formal tender request. While the government has no obligation to accept or even
                        Should            look at these proposals, they can sometimes offer benefits.
                        unsolicited       For example, the private sector may make unsolicited proposals involving innovative plans for feasible
                        bids be           projects that fit into the country’s plans for developing additional irrigation schemes for a group of farmers.
                        accepted?         Authorities need a clear framework in place to deal with the ad hoc nature of unsolicited proposals—
                                          possible approaches include a total ban, proposal cost reimbursement, or providing an advantage in an
                                          open bidding process.

                       In general, particularly for large complicated projects such as irrigation schemes, the use of the competitive
                       procurement model is preferred. The first stage of the process is to determine the appropriate procurement
                       strategy/process.


                       3.3.	 Choice of the competitive procurement process

                       Typically governments have existing legislation or practices that govern the instances in which the processes
                       that need to be applied when applying a competitive procurement process or when unsolicited proposals can
                       be considered and the way in which either need to be managed.

If the government does not have an established set of procedures in place to help govern a potential PPP
deal, it could consider utilizing an existing set of processes, as developed by a country that has a similar
administrative or legislative set-up, and publicizing this at the beginning of the process to aid transparency.

projects across a selection of countries.

                       The various stages of a competitive PPP procurement process typically involve:

                             •	 Marketing and publication of the PPP opportunity;
                             •	 Expression of Interest (EoI);
                             •	 Pre-qualification;

                       The process of marketing the PPP is crucial to ensure that sufficient interest is generated for the project so that
                       there are enough potential bidders involved. This can also help government to see which firms might bid for the
                       opportunity so that it designs the qualification criteria to reflect the market of potential bidders—i.e., if all the
                       firms willing to bid for an irrigation PPP have no more than five years’ experience in the country, the qualification
                       criteria should not require bidding firms to have ten years of experience.

                       To market the PPP opportunity, the government can simply advertise the launch of the process. Going beyond
                       this, the government can conduct investor presentations or road shows to present the project opportunity, or
                       carry out a more concerted effort to advertise the project by releasing information about the opportunity over
                       time to generate sufficient interest.

MANAGING PROCUREMENT

                       3.4.1.	     Post-bid negotiation

                       In addition to the competitive processes described above, for a complex project such as an irrigation PPP there
                       will also probably be a significant amount of post-bid negotiation following the selection of a winning bidder.
                       Although some governments (e.g., India) do not allow post-bid negotiations, nor does the World Bank Group.

                       At the post-bid negotiation phase, the government and the winning bidder enter into additional dialogue
                       which enables them to agree upon the final PPP contract. Government should try to limit the extent of the
                       negotiations to clarifications and fine-tuning of the proposals, rather than substantive discussions around
                       the requirements and/or the price of the project. This is because at this stage of the process there is limited
                       competitive pressure on the private bidder and thus the private firm might try to incorporate changes that do
                       not meet the government’s requirements or increase the price beyond an acceptable level.


                       3.4.2.	     Managing a competitive bid process

                       Navigating the various stages that we have outlined above can be a challenging task for government. It needs
                       to be able to manage the various technical and financial elements of the bids as well as managing relations
                       with private sector firms as well as other stakeholders relevant to the project to keep everything on track. In the
                       subchapters below we discuss some of the different approaches to managing the different elements of the bid
                       process.

                                   3.4.2.1.	   Establishing a steering group or technical team

                       One of the key first steps in the procurement process is for the government to develop a management team
                       that has the capacity to manage the completion of the process. This is likely to include some form of steering
                       group that includes representatives from the key government agencies that are relevant to the project and
                       individuals with the necessary technical expertise to review and evaluate the bids. The individuals included
                       in the technical team will (in the case of an irrigation PPP) need to include at least experts with experience
                       of managing a PPP deal, irrigation engineers, financial experts, economists and lawyers. It is typical for the
                       government to make use of external advisers with the necessary skills to support the completion of the process.

                                   3.4.2.2.	   Provision of information

                       The team managing the procurement process will need to be careful with the way in which it manages the
                       provision of information to both prospective private sector bidders and other relevant stakeholders. The
                       provision of clear and complete information throughout the process will help to ensure that bidders:

                             •	 Will be able to prepare bids that meet the contracting authority’s requirements;

                             •	 Have a common understanding of requirements enabling them to provide bids that are broadly
                                 comparable with each other; and

   •	 Limit the scope for bidders to think that the process has been carried out in an unfair or politically-driven
      manner, which reduces the chances of challenges to the validity of the process.

The procurement management team will need to provide information, to the best extent possible, on the status
of the existing irrigation scheme assets (in the case of a rehabilitation or modernization project), or on the land,
water, and construction requirements (for a new greenfield investment). This will include information on:

   •	 The proposed site for the project—e.g., size, type, condition, and use of land, water resources, current
      ownership of land and land surrounding the project area, farming practices, etc.

   •	 In the case of a rehabilitation or modernization, an inventory of the main existing irrigation system assets
      and information on the current financial performance and service standards provided by the scheme.

To make this type of information available to prequalified bidders, the procurement team can include information
in the bidding documents and/or set up a data room which can be used to store commercially sensitive securely.
In addition the team can arrange meetings between the bidders and relevant institutions (e.g., in the case of a
rehabilitation or modernization, the senior management team of the existing irrigation scheme).

         3.4.2.3.	   Managing bid costs

For a large irrigation PPP, the various stages outlined in the previous subchapter can be time-consuming,
expensive, and risky for both the private bidders and the government. One of the key issues for government to
manage during a procurement process is the bid costs, to prevent firms from withdrawing from the process.

There are various approaches to dealing with the issue of the bid costs. These include:

   •	 Requiring bidders to submit a bid bond to ensure commitment to the process and to prevent the firm
      that wins the bid from withdrawing from the process without any good reason. For example, in the
      Philippines the government requires private firms to provide a bond of between 1 percent and 2 percent
      of the estimated project costs for any BOT project. While this is an option that can be effective in securing
      adequate engagement from the bidding firms, the additional costs involved can limit the number of
      bidders that are willing to submit a bid in the first place.

   •	 In contrast to the approach suggested above, in some countries such as Australia, the government has the
      option of sharing bid costs with the bidders in order to encourage more firms to participate. The Australian
      PPP Guide states that bid costs can be reimbursed, but only in limited circumstances.

Overall, to ensure that the PPP procurement process is managed effectively, government should commit to
carrying out the process in a transparent and efficient manner. This requires the government to set out the rules
of the process upfront, establish time-lines for the completion of the procurement stages that it sticks to, and
keep open lines of communication with the private bidders—where appropriate—to provide clarifications on the
process and requirements (making sure that responses are provided to all bidders at the same time so that each
has the full information set required to make an effective bid).

                       3.5.	 International examples of procurement for irrigation PPPs

                       Whether it is a simple management contract or a concession, a PPP arrangement in the irrigation sector is
                       likely to involve quite a complicated procurement process that has to be managed carefully—not least because
                       irrigation projects can often have quite complicated technical requirements and because of the multiple
                       stakeholders that are usually involved in them. There are various examples of irrigation PPP projects that have
                       failed to reach implementation stage because they have not gone through the tender process. We examine
                       three projects that were bid competitively. Pontal in Brazil and Guerdane in Morocco, that involved IFC as the
                       transaction advisor, and Megech-Seraba in Ethiopia, that involved the World Bank (through IDA credit) with a
                       grant from the PPIAF, that served as both the main financier and strategic transaction advisor.

                       Guerdane in Morocco: The success of the government of Morocco in completing the Guerdane PPP is often
                       cited as an example of an efficient procurement process. Even in Guerdane, though, the scheme had to be
                       rebid as there was insufficient subscription from farmers in the first round. Working with support from the
                       IFC as transaction advisor, the government managed a process described as being “highly competitive and
                       transparent”.44

                       Key details in the procurement process used for the Guerdane scheme were as follows:

                             •	 The tender evaluation was done in one-phase, with no formal pre-qualification stage. The government
                               made a call for tenders that was open to all investors wishing to participate. The technical and financial
                               criteria were checked immediately, with only bids from qualified firms being opened.

                             •	 In an attempt to ensure transparency, the bids were evaluated on the basis of a single criterion: the
                               projected surface-water charge or fee to farmers.

                             •	 Using the water fees as the single evaluation criteria was also a way to make use of competition to
                               minimize the fee that farmers would face.

                       Eventually, just two firms (both part of wider consortia) submitted bids for the project: Omnium Nord Africain
                       (ONA), which submitted a bid of $1.48/m3 (before the 7 percent value tax) and Holding-YNNA (HY), which
                       submitted a bid of $1.88/m3 (also pre-value tax). ONA was selected as the winning bidder.

                       Pontal in Brazil: The procurement process for Pontal scheme was spread over five years without reaching a
                       successful conclusion. This is despite the fact that the project is proposed for a relatively small area (for an
                       irrigation project) of 5,000 ha and was situated near to a well-established irrigation network and commercial
                       agricultural hub with direct access to a local airport used for exporting. There was only one bidder for the
                       project, who withdrew because of the level of political interference in the procurement process and uncertainty
                       among the prospective private bidders about the true costs involved in meeting the government’s requirements

and construction costs. In addition, the government’s desire to retain responsibility for setting the price of water
user fees, given the sensitivity of handing over responsibility to a private firm, proved to be a difficult stumbling
block for the process. These issues are fundamental to the design of a successful PPP arrangement. The lesson
from the Pontal scheme is that such issues should have been addressed upfront before trying to complete the
procurement process.

Megech-Seraba in Ethiopia: This is the first IDA-funded irrigation PPP contract. Based on the risk assessment
and market sounding the procurement was done separately for civil works construction and for the enhanced
management PPP contract. Both contracts were procured using the World Bank procurement system including
its procedures and documents. For the PPP contract, international two-stage bidding was conducted. Some of
the key features of the procurement process were as follows:

   •	 The contract was developed by linking O&M to the actual improvements in farmers’ livelihoods. As a
      result, procurement was done on both technical (quality) and financial (price) proposals. Payment will be
      done three ways:

             ⋅⋅ Lump sum payment for incorporating review of the construction designs;
             ⋅⋅ Time-based payment for construction supervision; and
             ⋅⋅ Periodic payments during O&M phase as a function of base remuneration for availability plus
                incentive remuneration for performance

   •	 Evaluation was done first on mandatory criteria as a pass or fail and then on a) technical criteria (general
      qualification, approach, methodology, work plan and staffing plan) as a minimum score and b) financial
      (total of all three payments).

   •	 Methodology in technical proposals included approach to build capacity, operationalizing the newly
      formed WUAs, training programs, operation and maintenance procedures.

   •	 Five bids were received. One bid did not meet the minimum criteria. Remaining four were evaluated by a
      panel based on criteria stated above.

In April 2012, the government of Ethiopia entered into an eight-year contract with the French operator
BRL Ingénierie for the O&M of the Megech-Seraba irrigation project. The operator will also be in charge of
construction supervision, and establishing and building the capacity of WUAs. It is anticipated that the PPP will
increase water availability to over 6,000 landholdings over a 4,040 hectare irrigated area.

    4.1.	 Managing the PPP contract

    Ultimately, the success of a PPP for an irrigation development is determined not by the fact that it has
    achieved financial closure, but by the extent to which it has enabled farmers to access a satisfactory
    and affordable irrigation service. For this to occur, the PPP contract has to be designed effectively, and
    also has to be managed throughout the life of the project. This is because a PPP is effectively regulated
    by the enforcement of the terms of the contract, which should specify the arrangements for the
    management of the PPP—e.g., the responsible institution(s), the budget for the post-implementation
    phase, and the processes used to govern the contract.

    This chapter considers the main aspects for the development of an effective regime to manage the
    post-implementation phase of a contract. It covers:

        •	 The approach to establishing the PPP contract management institutions;

        •	 The monitoring of the PPP contract including some suggestions on how to use performance
           bonds and avoidance of persistent minor breaches;

        •	 How the government should deal with changes to the contract terms; and

        •	 The approach to managing contract expiry.

IMPLEMENTATION

                 The government needs to set out clearly the roles and responsibilities of the different institutions that will be
                 involved in managing the PPP contract. This should include at least:

                     •	 Ministry of Finance. The financial fiduciary role will be with the Ministry of Finance (MoF), which should
                        be consulted at project preparation, structuring and implementation phases. In PPP contracts, the MoF
                        undertakes the fiscal risk assessment and oversees public money support for capital grants, loans, and
                        availability payments etc. to the scheme over the life of the contract.

                     •	 Ministry of Water. Since the MoW is entrusted with provision and management of water and water-
                        related services, setting water policies, and tariffs, the Ministry of Water (MoW) must be involved.
                        Its primary role in contract management is that of a policy maker and setting strategic priorities for
                        development. The MoW supports the implementation of policy proposed under the road map of a PPP
                        project, and approves procurement of works.46

                     •	 Regulatory agency and relevant policymaking institutions in the sector. This regulatory agency should
                        be independent and free to act and take decision without influence. Generally, these agencies are public
                        institutions (as in the example of Brazil, where the regulatory agency, ANA, advises the government of
                        Brazil regarding when to make capacity payments to the irrigation schemes, and is also responsible for the
                        water grant). An agency in this capacity fulfils enforcement of regulation and policies, monitoring to ensure
                        to contract compliance, advisory and arbitrary functions. It may also be involved in helping to manage or
                        assess the validity of proposed changes to the tariffs set by the private company providing the service.

                     •	 Contracting authority. This could be subnational or a local government or a public entity such as a
                        Local Water Board, and would be in charge of the procurement—effectively the public counterpart to
                        the private company in the PPP contract. It will be in charge of the daily management of the contract.
                        This entity could be an owner of the land and/or fixed assets or has been delegated to exploit the assets
                        owned by the government.

                     •	 Project steering committee. The project steering committee represents a committee of members
                        from various relevant governmental agencies (Ministry of Water, Environment, Finance, Agriculture,
                        local jurisdictions, and possibly a PPP unit), chaired by the granting authority. The committee’s primary
                        responsibility is to ensure inter-governmental coordination.

                     •	 PPP contract manager. This role is performed by a specific individual or an entity, and is appointed and
                        assigned as the main point of contact within the government on all matters relating to the PPP project.
                        For instance, the Accra Plains project will be implemented by Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the
                        responsibility of the Ministry of Food and Agriculture in Ghana. The government needs to ensure that the
                        manager has sufficient technical skills, resources, relevant contacts, and credibility to manage the contract
                        and fulfil his responsibilities. The PPP contract manager will draw on technical support related to the PPP
                        from a centralized PPP unit (if the contract has one).

   •	 Public development bank. This entity will be involved in contract monitoring from the perspective of its
     fiduciary role as the lender to the project company or the concessionaire.


4.3.	 Monitoring the PPP contract

The effective monitoring and evaluation of the contract is a key task to help ensure that the PPP arrangement
delivers value for money for the service users. Throughout the life of the contract, the PPP contract manager
needs to ensure that the service standards specified in the contract are monitored and that any performance-
based bonuses or penalties are applied in a transparent and consistent manner.

The detailed monitoring of performance standards is a task that can be typically delegated to a regulator or
government department that has sufficient sector expertise. To monitor the contract’s performance standards
the authorities will need access to data from the private party—the PPP contract should include requirements for
the private party to provide the necessary data in a regular format. The government can also choose to make use
of independent experts to carry out checks on the service standards provided and may also consult the service
users to get feedback on the performance of the private company. For instance, in Ethiopia’s Megech-Seraba,
two independent entities have been set up: a Consultative Committee and an Independent Expert (Box 4.1).




BOX 4.1: Establishing Independent Monitoring & Management Entities in Megech-Seraba

  Consultative Committee. This joint committee comprises representatives from both the Ministry of
  Water & Energy (MoWE) and the private sector participant (PSP) contractor to monitor and facilitate
  continuous consultation on the implementation of the contract. The objective will be to optimize contract
  implementation and the provision of services to customers. Key issues on which MoWE and the PSP
  contractor will consult at the level of the committee will include planning, implementation or changes to
  Irrigation Service Fee (ISF), regulation or statutory issues, social issues, including customer service, and
  issues requiring arbitration.

  Independent Expert. The MoWE has appointed an Independent Expert to advise them on issues related
  to the contract. The Independent Expert will carry out audits and reviews on project progress, including
  technical and financial aspects. The PSP contractor will support the Independent Expert in obtaining the
  necessary data and providing information as required.

IMPLEMENTATION

                 The PPP contract manager will also need to ensure that any government responsibilities that have been
                 specified in the contract are being fulfilled effectively. A tool that government can use to do this is a risk
                 management plan.

                 A risk management plan lists the main risks and associated responsibilities that are either wholly or partly the
                 responsibility of government together with the main risks that might undermine the sustainability of the PPP
                 contract. For each of the risks included in the plan, the information or data required to monitor the risk should
                 be specified, together with the responsibilities for gathering the information or data and assessing it. Again,
                 these information or data requirements should be specified in the contract. Ultimately the PPP contract manager
                 is responsible for monitoring the different risk indicators and assessing the extent to which action needs to be
                 taken to address any emerging risks.

                 Contract management structures and monitoring procedures have been well defined at the outset for the
                 Muhuri irrigation project in Bangladesh. Box 4.2 provides further details on how these responsibilities have been
                 allocated across the relevant government institutions.




                 BOX 4.2: Roles and Responsibilities set out in the Muhuri Irrigation Scheme

                   The Muhuri Irrigation project will involve the rehabilitation of the current irrigated sections of the Muhuri
                   scheme, estimated at 11,800 ha, and the phased increase of the irrigated area to 17,000 ha. To ensure that
                   the scheme is developed into an efficient and sustainable system, the project will undertake a range of
                   activities—from repairing the flood embankments and existing flow control structures to excavating 460 km
                   of channels to increase drainage and water access, upgrading or replacing pumps, replacing open tertiary/
                   field canals with buried pipes and providing prepaid card meters and control systems. Under the scheme,
                   the Irrigation Management Operator (IMO) will be responsible for the design, construction supervision of
                   the modernization works, provision of agriculture extension services, operation and maintenance of the
                   pump systems, canals and other infrastructure, and for collecting the irrigation service charge.

                   The contract management structure under the PPP contract has been established as follows:

                        •	 Bangladesh Water Development Board (BWDB). The BWDB is the contracting authority and
                          executing agency for the project, and will be responsible for monitoring the IMO, for making
                          payments to contractors based on the progress certificates and at certain contract-defined stages,
                          and for agreeing on the water charge with the Implementation Coordination Committee (ICC). The
                          BWDB will also be expected to make its skilled staff available to provide services to the IMO when
                          required, though the IMO will be required to pay for these services. While the BWDB will retain its
                          O&M responsibilities in the role of main regulator, the IMO will take over responsibility of canals,
                          drains, and minor structures.

4.4.	 Penalties and government’s ability to intervene for persistent minor breaches47

Given the long-term nature of irrigation PPP contracts, it is necessary to allow for situations where persistent
breaches by the sponsor occur but that by themselves do not justify termination of the contract. The
introduction of a persistent minor clause within the PPP contract allows for a specific mechanism for remedy by
the “grantor,” or government partner. It allows for deductions or financial penalties, but in the event these are
insufficient consideration should be given to the use of warning notices with pre-defined resolutions procedures
with the ultimate sanction to a right to early termination.48 Clearly, such arrangement needs to go hand-in-hand
with specific penalties if the service standards are not met.

It is accepted good practice to specify penalties for all breaches of the contract, with the penalty proportionate
to the harm done by the breach.49 Care must be taken to ensure that the inclusion of such penalties is allowable.
For example, in common law countries it may not be possible to including penalties within the PPP contract
itself. Penalties may have to be introduced as for example liquidated damages, or including penalties in
specific regulations. Research also shows that it is advisable to cap the level of penalties the developer (private
sector partner) would be liable for as a result of any specific incident or over any given period and to allow for



47	 Throughout the rest of this chapter focusing on the contractual side of PPP contracts, the term “grantor” is used to denote the government (or granting)
   partner and “developer” to denote the private-sector partner, since the latter is usually charged with development of a scheme. This is for the sake of
   conformity with contractual terminology generally found in PPP contracts.
48	 This is not a remedy normally used in this sector. However, there are positive experiences of this in other infrastructure sectors, e.g., public transport services
   in the UK and the UK’s Private Finance Initiative procedures (HM Treasury, 2008).
49	 A good example is the provisions of the Port Vila, Vanuatu concession contract. This involves a monetary penalty for the developer for any instance where it
   fails to fulfil its obligations. The monetary penalty for any failure is then found by taking the prevailing volumetric tariff multiplied by the appropriate multiplier.
   For a particular failure for example interrupted supply or insufficient water pressure, a specific number of cubic meters is pre-specified as a multiplier.
   As service standards will be clearly defined in the contract, it was envisioned that this approach will enable penalties to be easily determined when such
   standards are breached.

IMPLEMENTATION

                 a procedure for expedited resolution in the event of disagreement about the application of a penalty.50 The cap
                 should be set at a level which is high enough to provide the developer with a strong incentive to perform, but
                 low enough to protect the developer from financial distress caused by penalties (Operators Roundtable, World
                 Bank 2004). Additionally, and in the interest of equitable treatment of parties to the PPP contract - sanctions also
                 need to be provided against contracting authority non-performance.51 The form of such penalties may be a direct
                 penalties or set-off rights as discussed below.


                 4.5.	 Performance Bonds and Set-off rights

                 Research suggests that the use of performance bonds is a widely used technique for PPP schemes in infrastructure
                 development projects.52 The reason is due to the “limited recourse” nature of project finance. The water and
                 wastewater sector is no exception. Many contracts have included performance bonds posted by the developer.

                 A performance bond is an amount of money lodged with a neutral third party, such as a bank or financial
                 institution, which the grantor may claim in the event the developer breaches pre-specified obligations detailed
                 in the PPP contract. The bond ensures the developer faces a penalty for non-performance, and that a sanction
                 can be imposed. Without a performance bond, the public authority might need to sue the developer for non-
                 performance, which can be costly and time-consuming, and even if the court finds in the public authority’s favor, it
                 might be difficult to actually make the developer pay.

                 It is good practice to include performance bonds in contracts. However, problems have arisen where the
                 conditions under which the bond may be called have not been well defined, thus creating risk. A related problem
                 has been “first-demand” bonds—those which are callable without the public authority having to show that the
                 developer has defaulted. The idea of “first-demand” bonds is to protect the public authority by avoiding delays
                 and litigation when the public authority believes the developer has defaulted. However, they have in some cases
                 unbalanced relationships by putting in the public authority’s hand a substantial sanction which it can exercise at
                 will. Emerging options to improve practice include:

                     •	 Avoiding “first demand” bonds, and instead including a provision that the bond may be called when the
                         independent monitoring unit certifies that relevant breach has occurred

                     •	 Making lodging of performance bonds reciprocal. In many cases the developer is required to post a bond to
                         protect the government from risky behavior, but not vice versa. Where the developer is required to lodge a
                         bond to ensure it meets its obligations, the government should also lodge a bond for its obligations.


                 50	 Where there is a dispute as to whether or not a service standard has been breached, the penalty would not be applied until a final legal determination on the
                    matter had been reached. Although a provision like this may be advisable, care must be exercised to avoid nullifying the effect of the penalty provision. What
                    is meant by this is that the provisions of the PPP contract must not allow the developer to shield itself and unduly delay the application of a given penalty until
                    there is a legal determination on the matter. That is why it is recommended that the PPP contract includes procedure(s) that allows for an expeditious resolution
                    on this. If the parties cannot agree then the other dispute resolution procedures contained within the PPP contract would apply.
                 51	 Arguably a provision like this may have helped in the case of Guayaquil, where the Regulator ECAPAG had too much discretion. This is a personal opinion
                    based on my assessment of the situation when I was employed as a mediator for a dispute between the Interagua and ECAPAG between 2004 and 2005.
                 52	 Performance bonds have been used extensively in the water and wastewater sector. For example, of the contracts analyzed for this research Guayaquil, Manila,
                    Sofia, Estonia, Trinidad and Tobago, Port Vila, amongst others, had performance bonds linked to their respective PPP contracts.

                                                                                                                            4

    •	 Using set-off rights which would allow the developer to unilaterally adjust cash payments, service
        obligations and any investment roll-out if the grantor breaches the PPP contract in ways which increase the
        developer’s cost or reduce its revenue. Similarly, the government should be able to withhold payment of
        any fees payable to the developer to set-off any money owed by the developer. If either party is unhappy
        with such an adjustment, the process of dispute resolution (outlined below) should be followed.


4.6.	 Enforcement of customer payments

A developer cannot be financially viable if it cannot collect payment for customers. This means it needs a way
to sanction non-payers. Disconnection or disruption of service is the most effective tool. It is accepted practice
that developers should have available all the normal sanctions against customers who do not pay, including
the ability to disconnect after a specified period. Developers may be required to report on the number of
disconnections, but should not be required to report in advance of disconnection, or to seek approval to
disconnect. However, this needs to be balanced with mechanisms to protect consumers. These may include,
for example, a requirement that in cases where a farmer disputes the bill, he has the right to take the issue to
an independent body, and service must not be disconnected until the dispute has been settled, or that the
developer is obliged to offer reasonable terms for settlement of payment arrears. Another possible suggestion
is that the grantor set up a fund with the discretion to pay bills on behalf of families in genuine hardship, and
which can work with them to provide budgeting and other assistance. Such a fund and agency would recognize
the role of the government in social assistance, allowing the developer to focus on commercial performance.


4.7.	 Dealing with changes to the PPP contract

A PPP contract for an irrigation development can last 25-30 years, during which there are likely to be material
changes in the operating environment for the PPP company that were not (and could not have been) predicted
when the contract was originally signed.

It is possible that if and when these changes occur the private company and the contracting authority will get
into a dispute about how the changes should be interpreted and managed. In some circumstances this can lead
to a renegotiation of the contract or even an early termination.

A well-designed PPP contract will have flexibility built into it to enable the government and private firm to
manage a degree of uncertainty. This will include provisions that facilitate a regular review of the tariffs that
the private firm can set and of the O&M costs that it faces to make sure that things remain broadly in line with
market conditions. For instance, the Megech-Seraba scheme53 will involve a tariff transition period to take into
account the expected increased capacity and willingness of farmers to pay the irrigation service charge over
time. Depending on the type of adjustments these can be broadly classified as periodic, extraordinary and
emergency adjustments (HM Treasury, 2007).

IMPLEMENTATION

                      •	 Periodic Adjustments54 are applied at regular intervals to bring tariffs back in line with costs. These
                         essentially correct for errors in the indexation mechanism. The main objective of these adjustments is to
                         allow a reasonable rate of return for an efficient developer.

                      •	 Extraordinary Adjustments,55 which alter tariffs in response to specific, unexpected but manageable
                         changes in cost resulting for example from changes in laws; new environmental standards; or demand
                         movements over a specific level. The main objective of these adjustments is to restore the financial
                         position that the developer would have been in had the event not occurred.

                      •	 Emergency Adjustments56 are designed to keep the contract working in the face of unexpected changes.
                         These changes are considered so significant that they would otherwise bankrupt, have a major negative
                         financial effect on the developer or lead to a renegotiation of the terms of the PPP contract. The main
                         objective of this adjustment is to ensure continuity of the service and enable the developer to return to
                         normality after a reasonable period of time.

                 Irrigation projects, as with many PPP projects, rely on the availability of cash flows. These cash flows derive
                 fundamentally from the tariffs that the developer is allowed to charge for the services it provides. As discussed
                 in Chapter Two, the rules by which tariffs are set and by which variations are allowed are fundamental to the
                 sustainability of the PPP contract. Depending on the type of PPP contract, opening tariffs will be specified either
                 in the initial bids or in the contract, and indexation provides a mechanism for keeping opening tariffs in line with
                 costs and allowing the developer to pass on cost increases to customers through its tariffs. Essentially, any tariff
                 adjustment mechanism will have to allow for (a) cost pass-throughs and (b) tariff indexation.

                      •	 Cost pass-throughs effectively allow for changes in the costs of certain inputs that are immediately passed
                         on through the tariff to the customers. Cost pass-throughs are typically allowed for major cost items over
                         which the developer will have no control. These include, for example, changes in taxation regime, price of
                         bulk water arrangements etc. In the case of cost pass-throughs, one must be careful not to allow for costs
                         for which a normal and diligent developer should be responsible. For example, if a grantor is considering
                         allowing for the cost of electricity to be a cost pass-through, it must do so in a way that does not relieve
                         the developer from seeking reductions in its operating costs that it could adequately manage through
                         reduced pumping or using low electricity tariffs at night.

                      •	 Tariff indexation formulas also seek to protect the developer from costs which are beyond its control, and
                         these formulas seek to anticipate certain changes in the cost of providing a service. Some of the contracts
                         that have been evaluated in this research suggest that there are two main problems with this provision:
                         (a) problems with approval of adjustments, and (b) problems with using indexation to offset the effects


                 54	 Manila is a good example where tariffs are adjusted at five-yearly intervals to allow a rate of return for an efficient developer.
                 55	 Bucharest: tariffs can be adjusted for events such as changes in laws. The amount of the adjustment is the required tariff change to offset the change in cash
                    flow resulting from the event.
                 56	 UK Shipwreck clause (as contained in the England and Wales Water Licenses): tariffs can be adjusted if an event occurs that results in a change in cash flows
                    by more than 20 percent of turnover, which could not have been avoided with prudent developer action.

        of foreign exchange devaluation. The indexation formula needs to be flexible enough to protect against
        certain items such as general inflation, changes in prices of particular inputs (e.g., electricity and chemicals
        increase by more than the average rate of inflation), prices of inputs such as fuel, personnel, imported
        goods and import taxes.

If changes to conditions occur that are catered for within the contract, it is the responsibility of the private firm
and government to adhere to the terms and conditions as required. In the event that the nature of the change is
so significant that it is not catered for in the contract, the PPP parties will need to work together to manage the
situation in the spirit of the contract.


4.8.	 Contract expiry and handover of assets

At the end of the PPP contract, any assets that have been temporarily transferred to the control of the private
firm should be passed back to the government. The PPP contract should include the provisions to guide this
process.

The PPP contract should include specific information on the assets that will be returned to the government
and the required quality. In addition it should specify exactly how the quality of the assets will be defined and
assessed. As many of the PPPs for irrigation that have developed are relatively new, there is less experience
of how this process works in practice, though the UK Ministry of Finance has provided some guidance on this
issue.57 There are two distinct types of contract approach which deal with how assets are handled upon expiry of
the service period (HM Treasury, 2007):

    •	 Contracts where it represents value for money for the grantor to take over the assets on expiry. These also
        include assets which have no other feasible alternative use and is only of value to the public sector entity.

    •	 Contracts where the residual value of the Assets is best transferred to the Developer. Such assets have
        alternative uses and are not required in the long term by the public sector. Residual value refers to
        the market value of the assets associated with the contract at the time of contract expiration. This is
        classified as a risk because the residual value of the assets is unknown at the time of signing the contract.
        Estimations of the value of assets will be made and this will be incorporated into the financing structure of
        the contract.

The key allocation questions to be considered are:

    •	 Which party retains the assets on termination?

    •	 Do these assets have alternative uses?

    •	 How does this affect the termination payment (if any) payable by the grantor?

IMPLEMENTATION

                 The UK government’s PFI Unit recommends that the contracting authorities long term objectives will be best
                 served by requiring either automatic transfer or reversion of the assets to itself on the expiration of the contract
                 or at the very least, an option to purchase the assets at nominal cost. This is the case where legal constraints
                 prevent any practical alternative option or when assets have a useful economic life if retained by the grantor and
                 conversion of the assets for other uses may be costly. The grantor may also require the asset in order continue
                 providing service. The grantor should protect itself by not reducing the options it has available at or just before
                 the termination of a contract. These options include:

                    •	 Taking possession of any assets at no cost;

                    •	 Retendering the service provision with the outgoing Developer making any assets available to the grantor
                        at no cost; and

                    •	 Removing any assets.

                 Where the grantor retains the assets at no cost, considerations should be made as to the Developer’s
                 obligations to deliver the assets in a serviceable condition. This does not apply if the assets have reached the
                 end of their useful economic life. Importantly, the grantor should use operational requirements as their modus
                 operandi rather than attempting to generate residual value interest.


                 4.9.	 Preserving the conditions of the assets on expiry

                 In the past, terminal payments related to the value of the assets at the end of the contract, were used as an
                 incentive mechanism for the Developer to maintain high standards of service throughout the contract period.
                 However, this system is flawed in that it confuses payments for services and payments for asset transfer, as the
                 assets may be well maintained but the quality of service low.

      This handbook has been developed to provide governments, public authorities and other interested
      stakeholders with a practical guide on how to design and tender sustainable public-private
      partnership (PPP) arrangements in the irrigation sector.

      To assist in this purpose, we have organized the handbook’s chapter numbers to correspond with
      the four practical steps that executives should take in establishing a PPP in irrigation: Preparation,
      Structuring, Management of Procurement, and Implementation. In addition there is an Executive
      Summary, Introduction and this Conclusion, which are note numbered, in order to avoid confusion
      with the practical chapters. The chapters provide (i) a high-level review (in two parts, A and B) of the
      issues that policy makers should consider to establish the viability of introducing a private-sector
      partner into a specific irrigation project; (ii) a functional guide to the structuring of the PPP; (iii) step-
      by-step direction of procurement of a PPP partner, and (iv) how to implement the scheme itself to
      ensure that the PPP will be sustainable and viable for the life of the scheme.

      The section checklists provided at the end of each section of the report detail the key issues
      presented in the analysis. Thus in this conclusion section we focus on the main overarching issues
      that constrain the development of irrigation PPPs emerging from the process of completing the
      report, particularly drawing on the case studies.

              BOX 5.1: Key principles behind PPPs in irrigation

                    •	 Sustainability: developing a scheme that ensures a minimum level of funds to enable the replacement
                      of assets at the expiry of the scheme’s life (AMP).
CONCLUSION



                    •	 Affordability: establishing a level of tariff that is affordable to the farmers

                    •	 Fiscal responsibility: related to previous as what is affordable to the public sector in terms of both
                      financial and regulatory support it provides to the scheme.

                    •	 Creditworthiness: maximizing the strength of system’s internally generated revenues (primarily through
                      water user charges or tariff income), and using such revenues to raise private funds

                    •	 Efficient use of public funds: an upfront recognition that a major public contribution will be required
                      to support the capital investment requirements in the form of either a capital grant and or, as
                      appropriate an “availability payment.”

                    •	 Contractual Framework: a strengthened contractual arrangement that allows for a level of risk transfer
                      to the private sector to manage cash generation and contain capital expenditure costs.




             5.1.	 Securing private sector involvement

             Ultimately a private firm will only be willing and able to take on the responsibilities defined in the PPP contract
             if they judge that they have a good prospect of recovering any costs incurred in providing the services and
             achieving a reasonable rate of return commensurate with the main risks that surround the implementation of the
             scheme. There are a multitude of important factors that will determine this but main amongst them is the extent
             to which the private firm believes that it will be able to charge and collect adequate service charges (from either
             farmers or government) over the full duration of the proposed contract. The analysis of the case studies shows
             that this is an issue that is crucial to the successful implementation of a PPP arrangement.

             In many emerging economies contexts setting cost reflective charges for water is a difficult and politicized
             issue, as farmers often view access to water as a free resource. Therefore we have set out some of the different
             approaches that have been used to enable firms to set and collect adequate water charges.

                •	 Understanding farmers’ willingness to pay. The Megech-Seraba irrigation scheme in Ethiopia has shown
                    the importance of carrying out detailed analysis of the amount that farmers are willing to pay to receive
                    the irrigation services. Following the completion of a willingness to pay survey it was determined that it
                    would only be viable to introduce private sector involvement if government part subsidized the irrigation
                    service charges. It is expected that overtime as farmers gain the benefits from the irrigation services their
                    willingness to pay will increase and the subsidy required by government will fall. It is thus assumed that the
                    proportion of the tariff paid by farmers will change over time to reflect this.


             114	                    World Bank Group | PPIAF | How to Achieve Sustainability in Irrigation with Private Sector Participation
   •	 Securing payments upfront. The Muhuri irrigation project in Bangladesh has taken on the lessons from
      the Barind system which makes use of a system of pre-pay coupons to reduce the collection risks around
      irrigation service charges from farmers. Key to this approach is the ability to control adequately the supply
      of water to farmers, so that they actually get the amount of water for which they have paid up-front. This




                                                                                                                          CONCLUSION
      was done in Guerdane and is planned for West Delta as well.

   •	 Contract farming arrangements. An alternative approach that has been used to secure adequate water
      service charges is the use of contract farming arrangements. An example is the case of the Integrated
      Tamale Fruit Company (ITFC) irrigation scheme in Ghana. In these arrangements the farmers enter into a
      contract with the private firm such that the provision of irrigation services is guaranteed dependent on the
      farmers providing a proportion of their produce in return (the irrigations service provider can either act as
      the off-taker or have a contractual arrangement with an off-taker). These arrangements typically work best
      for commercial crops where the commercial off-taker has an ongoing financial incentive to ensure that the
      farmers receive the irrigation services. In addition it is important to have an enabling environment within
      which stakeholders have some confidences that contractual provisions can be enforced adequately. The
      Kaleya irrigation scheme in Zambia provides a good example of this approach.

Box 5.2 below provides an additional example of this approach from India, where it has been difficult to apply
water charges to farmers.

 BOX 5.2: Contract farming of onions and fresh fruit in Maharashtra

    Jain Irrigation System Limited (JISL) has established an onion dehydration and fruit processing plant in
    Jalgaon, Maharashtra. It is a 100 percent export-oriented unit. JISL has entered into a contract farming
    arrangement with the farmers within a radius of 200 km of Jalgaon to buy good quality onion bulbs
    and fresh fruits at an assured price. JISL helps the farmers produce more and better quality produce by
    providing genetically superior HYV planting materials, an efficient water and fertilizer management system
    and agronomical guidance. Farmers have to ensure optimal utilization of the available water resources.
    The involvement of the state government is minimal.

    JISL volunteers provide first-hand knowledge of how to grow onions, technical know-how, and other
    extension services to the farmers, and are a pivotal link between the company and the farmers. Senior
    scientists of the company also visit the farms and exchange views on the latest developments. JISL
    has helped the local farmers to bring more than 80 percent of the onion crops under efficient micro-
    irrigation systems like drip irrigation and sprinklers. Farmers benefit since they receive good quality seeds
    at reasonable prices. The company gains from buying the fruits and vegetables from the growers and
    processing them at modern processing facilities to produce high quality dehydrated onion and vegetable
    products, aseptic fruit purees, pulps and concentrates for export. The company has also put into place a
    dispute resolution mechanism which has been working well so far. The JISL experiment, which combines
    for-profit contract farming with focused assistance to improve water use efficiency, has proved beneficial
    and could potentially be replicated in other parts of India as well.

             5.2.	 Need for public support will continue

             The key decision for the government is how much it can afford and how to use the same funds more efficiently.
CONCLUSION



             Often government has three options: a) continue services as has been, which means usually provision by a
             public company, b) procure a private company to invest and deliver services or c) use a combination which
             enables the government and farmers to share the risk and costs with the private contractor. Perhaps the best
             option is for government to retain the governance function and using its resources to incentivize the right party
             to improve the economic benefits to the farmers.


             5.3.	 Third party involvement

             Most cases have shown to include a third party between the government and farmers. Not only these parties
             have taken over some of the risks but also have augmented the burden to increase productivity of the produce.
             For instance in Megech-Seraba, plan is to set up WUAs who would eventually take over the OMM functions
             increasing reliability and productivity of the small-holders farms. In ITFC, the commercial company acted as the
             agriculture off taker and a service provider at the same time.


             5.4.	 Securing finance for irrigation infrastructure

             One of the main theoretical objectives behind attempts to implement PPPs is to bring in private investment to
             provide an alternative source of finance for irrigation schemes. The analysis that we have presented suggests
             that in practice, most of the PPPs that have developed have had limited success in securing private finance. This
             is because many of the projects are not seen as providing bankable investment opportunities for the private
             sector, in part due to risks associated with primary agriculture but also, in the case of greenfield projects or
             major rehabilitations because of project development risk, which, in the agriculture sector typically involves
             issues around land and water allocation as well as accommodating community needs. There are different
             approaches that projects have sought to implement to reduce the risks associated with the irrigation projects
             and thus increase the potential for private sector investment.

                •	 Use of innovative financial instruments. Capital investments in irrigation schemes typically necessitate
                    high up-front costs while facing uncertain revenue streams given the nature of the demand risks
                    highlighted in this handbook. As a result irrigation schemes often face difficulty in attracting commercial
                    finance because the available financial instruments, particularly in emerging economies, are not best
                    placed to support investments with the characteristics required by irrigation schemes. The development
                    of more innovative financial instruments could help to support more investment in irrigation infrastructure.
                    One approach is the use of patient capital (patient capital is long-term, subordinated capital invested
                    at sub-commercial costs) could help to provide additional sources of finance for the irrigations sector.
                    This is an area where development partners, particularly the IFIs, could play a lead role in supporting
                    the implementation of PPP irrigation projects by considering which financial instruments can be used to
                    facilitate private investment.


             116	                   World Bank Group | PPIAF | How to Achieve Sustainability in Irrigation with Private Sector Participation
   •	 Alternative sources of funds for irrigation projects. Given the issues around the ability to set water
      charges at the required level (discussed above), PPPs in the sector often involve other revenue streams to
      ensure that the scheme is financially self-sustaining. For instance, in the Pontal irrigation scheme the plan




                                                                                                                           CONCLUSION
      is that the irrigation service provider will be able to charge the private agribusiness firm for use of the land
      at the site. While at the Muhuri irrigation scheme in Bangladesh they are investigating the potential to
      lease the assets of the scheme (including the land and water) to aid cost recovery.

   •	 Need for Collateral or a guarantee. While the private sector can provide the necessary expertise and
      often times the certainty of off take, the irrigation scheme by itself offers little opportunity for the lenders
      to lend long term moneys to the private company. The risks are too high to offer a reasonable promise
      of repayment based on future cash-flow. Collateral put up by the parent company or a government
      guarantee is often required even in other infrastructure sectors.


5.5.	 Concluding remarks

Irrigation is much the same as any other public service, especially when a business opportunity exists. As this
report has highlighted, there is a growing demand for the PPP as a vehicle to provide irrigation services to
farmers in emerging economies. Given that many of the PPP arrangements are still quite new or in an evolving
phase, policymakers are still trying to come to terms with the impacts, both positive and negative, that the
projects might have in their varied forms. The World Bank 2007 report suggests that PPPs have the potential for
real improvement in the efficiency with which irrigation services are provided to farmers.

This report has sought to explain the key considerations policymakers and other stakeholders need to make
to ensure that the irrigation PPP project they are contemplating really does deliver on its stated potential for
efficiency while at the same time providing value for money in terms of public expenditure, farmers’ income, and
private investment.

As a practical handbook, the report serves all PPP stakeholders. It describes the type of simple upfront screening
analysis that policymakers can and should do to determine whether a PPP in fact is viable: will it deliver cost-
effective, efficient service while also giving private contractors acceptable returns on their investment? Will it
overcome the affordability constraints faced by governments? Will the farmers’ reliance on the sale of their
agricultural produce cover the service fees related to the irrigation scheme?

There is no one-size-fits-all solution, but there are enough similarities in the way PPP irrigation schemes are
structured that a road map such as this provides practical value. Fundamentally, governments need to ensure
that they have a sound set of regulatory and legal policies in place, carry out robust pre-feasibility and feasibility
assessments, seek to achieve prudent risk allocations, and more generally put in place a robust project
implementation process, supported by sufficient capacity, to secure effective irrigation PPP projects.

             Government has a constant role to play in maintaining social benefits, not only in irrigation but across the entire
             agricultural value chain, and related sectors. In doing so, it can more effectively progress to achieving social

             equity and prosperity for its people and even the region as whole. Self-sustaining, viable, and effective irrigation
             projects are among the key building blocks of a vibrant agriculture sector. But these must be cemented with
             sound enabling regulations to ensure sustainable use of natural resources and hold all stakeholders accountable
             to the highest standards of performance and, ultimately, the public good.

In line with best practice, this tool makes extensive use of internal formatting conventions to guide users,
distinguish input cells, and avoid erroneous entries. Only light blue shaded cells are input cells where you can
enter assumptions. Black cells represent technical inputs and constants, which a priori should not be changed
by the average user. Standard cells are using black fonts, except for calculations referring to other worksheets,
which are colored green (“off-sheet” references). Outputs generated by the excel data table are using brown
font on grey fill. Below is a full list of all formatting styles used in the present tool:

                                                                                                                         ANNEX 1
Purpose of the PPP Options Assessment Tool

One of the challenges in structuring public private partnerships (“PPP”) is balancing the converging interests of
the various stakeholders, i.e. the public sector, end consumers, and the private investor (or “sponsor”) along with
commercial lenders. The purpose of the current tool is to illustrate various structuring options for the irrigation
sector, and to examine the resulting impact on stakeholders. While building the tool1 per se is already a challenging
task, simulating how to balance interests between the stakeholders of a PPP equates to a “multiple optimization”
problem, which – depending on the desired level of sophistication and processing speed – may require advanced
modelling techniques, for instance optimization macros written in VBA2 or Python3.

We have designed the present tool in accordance with best practices applied in the project finance industry.
However, the present spreadsheet is not meant to fill the role of a full-scale, bankable options assessment tool
used for transaction structuring. We simplified some aspects, for example, avoiding any of the advanced features
required for multiple optimization – such as custom goal seek functions. Besides reducing overall complexity,
this approach helps illustrating the raw impact of changes in key assumptions. At the same time, the tool offers
sufficient flexibility and data granularity to allow modelling a wider range of potential structuring scenarios.

The results obtained from options assessment tool often tend to give users a false sense of certainty with regard
to the outcome of a transaction. However, no tool can comprehensively simulate all possible interdependencies
between the large numbers of variables usually involved. Rather than attempting to simulate one future scenario
with full accuracy, the philosophy behind options tool is to assess the upper and lower boundaries for the viability
of a transaction following changes in key assumptions.


Recommended prior knowledge

Before using the tool, it is recommended that you possess at least a basic knowledge of the following areas:

    •	 Use of excel and spreadsheet-based financial modelling;
    •	 Financial accounting;
    •	 Cash flow-oriented / non-recourse lending or project finance4;
    •	 Capital budgeting techniques;
    •	 Various forms of private sector participation in public assets.

          Providing a complete introduction about each of these topics is beyond the scope for the present user manual.
          In addition, make sure the tool uses reasonable assumptions for the agricultural calculations, most importantly
ANNEX 1


          crop yields, agricultural off-take and associated operating costs. For best results, we recommend consulting with
          experts in the agricultural field.


          Some handling instructions

          The present version of the tool works best if used with Microsoft Excel5, starting with version 2010. It has not yet
          been thoroughly tested with alternative spreadsheet programs, such as the open source solutions LibreOffice6
          provided by the Document Foundation, Apache OpenOffice7, or other popular alternatives to Microsoft Excel.
          While most features of the tool are expected to work properly in alternative spreadsheet programs, certain
          formula functions or cell formats may not be compatible, which could affect usability and results.

          Only light blue shaded cells are input cells where you can enter assumptions. The “Input” sheet centralizes all
          the assumptions used throughout the tool. Inputs are structured by area, and can be collapsed / expanded as
          needed for better oversight. Be careful not to enter hardcoded values in non-input cells, as this can break the
          entire tool or falsify results. For a full explanation of the color code employed, refer to the cell formatting legend
          in the present manual.

          The tool employs Excel’s data table technology for scenario analysis. The data table is located at the bottom of
          the “Input” sheet, and the corresponding output area uses a distinctive cell format (brown fonts on grey-shaded
          cells). For best results, make sure that Excel’s settings allow automatic calculation of data tables [Excel 2013
          Menu: Excel Options > Formulas > Calculation Options > Workbook calculation > Automatic], or alternatively
          press keyboard “F9” at regular intervals to update data table results. Also note that, if various Excel workbooks
          are opened in parallel on your device, the calculation settings of the workbook first opened will usually override
          those of workbooks opened afterwards.

          Certain calculations required for project financing are prone to circular logic, most importantly capitalized costs
          during construction. The tool’s design and calculation methods are optimized around the idea of avoiding
          circular logic. Switch off the option “Enable iterative calculation” [Excel 2013 Menu: Excel Options > Formulas >
          Calculation Options > Workbook calculation], so that Excel can detect any accidentally introduced circular logic
          while handling and modifying the tool.

3. Transaction structuring options

The present tool is a simplified project finance model8, along with some specific features for simulating the




                                                                                                                          ANNEX 1
most common structuring options in the irrigation sector (referred to as “structuring options” in the present
manual). Among the structuring options that have been taken into account are (in order of increasing private
sector participation):

    •	 Status quo
    •	 Fully public financing
    •	 Management / service contract
    •	 Lease / affermage (not pre-configured)
    •	 PPP concession
    •	 Fully private financing

For all of the structuring options above (except for “Lease / affermage”), you find preconfigured scenarios
on the “Input” sheet using the “default” values listed in the assumption section below. The tool is currently
optimized for simulating “greenfield” projects9. You can configure a parallel “status quo” scenario for
benchmarking. However, due to the greenfield approach, no pre-completion revenues for funding or OpEx
(the later which could be either expensed or capitalized) are taken into account during the construction phase,
which may distort some of the results when comparing to a status quo scenario without construction period. The
standard currency of funding and applied throughout the tool is USD.

For simplicity, the present version of the tool does not model any Quality-of-Service (QoS) indicators, albeit
typical and required for most PPPs, such as reward / penalty mechanisms applied to revenues based on the
concessionaire’s performance.


4. Inputs and assumptions

The idea of the present tool and its manual is to provide initial guidance to users on how to configure each
of the structuring options listed above. To this purpose, we list a range of possible “default” values for each
structuring option in the tables below. Whenever applicable, we also provide an “idle” setting, which allows
switching a model feature off. Besides reconsidering the default values, we strongly recommend that you
discuss and reconfirm any technical values for the agricultural side (i.a. crop yields, agricultural off-take and
associated operating costs) with experts in the field and in function of each particular project, as the values used
in the present tool are for illustrative purpose only.

          4.1	Timing

          Model projections start at the first day of month following the month entered as “Model start” date.
ANNEX 1



          Accordingly, for a clean, annual calendar timeline, enter any date in December before the first construction year.
          The tool allows projecting a total project duration of up to 30 years, including the construction phase. Maximum
          duration of the construction phase is 7 years (84 months), in which case the resulting maximum operations phase
          is 23 years. You should modify and configure the timeline with care, as the inputs are critical for the mechanics
          applied throughout the entire model.

          Concessions frequently have contract terms between 20-30 years and more, whereas management contracts,
          lease or affermage arrangements tend to be shorter in duration, typically 3-10 years. Shorter terms often
          result in additional costs for the grantor because of the necessary renegotiations when contracts expire. Such
          renegotiation costs, however, are not part of this calculation. For the purpose of comparability, the present
          tool assumes the same contract terms (and construction periods) for all PPP options considered, including
          management contract and PPP concession.

          4.2	 Land & crop yields

          Enter the total amount of irrigated land surface for each year in hectares, which includes land cultivated by both
          smallholders and commercial farms (if any). The total land area is multiplied by crop yield percentages, which
          may ramp up for up to 10 years depending on crop type, soil, irrigation and other factors. Crop yield ramp-
          up percentages apply only to new land added on year-on-year basis, as mature land will eventually reach the
          maximum crop yield of 100%.

          4.3.1	   Land & agricultural offtake by farming scheme

          Split irrigated land and the corresponding agricultural offtake between smallholder farms, i.e. land independent
          from any project SPV / PPP concession, and land for commercial (or “PPP”) farms. For the purpose of the

offtake and OpEx related to irrigated land categorized as commercial (or “PPP”) is factored into the SPV’s

offtake factored into the concession revenue – you should assign all irrigated land to smallholders. Irrigated
land multiplied by average crop yield produces the total agricultural offtake available to either smallholders, or
commercial farms, respectively. Agricultural offtake and OpEx is then allocated to commercial (/PPP) farming
and smallholders in proportion to allotted land.

4.3.2	   Commercial (/PPP) farming scheme

Enter agricultural offtake per hectare for commercial (/PPP) farms. Values here depend heavily on the underlying
agricultural factors. Typically, you should expect agricultural offtake for commercial or PPP-based farming to be
higher than that of smallholder farms.

Irrigation operating expenditure (“Irrigation OpEx”) of commercial (/PPP) farms depends on the individual
characteristics of each transaction, and may or may not include items such as pumping energy costs, staff costs,
regular maintenance and inspection, among others. With the goal to make the tool as flexible as possible, OpEx
calculations are abstracted. Choose between the following calculation methods:

   •	 Fixed costs, as percentage of initial CapEx, per annum
   •	 Fixed costs, per hectare, per annum

Other operating expenditure (“Other OpEx”) of commercial (/PPP) farms refers to all other costs typically
associated with agriculture, and depends on the individual land and crop characteristics of each transaction,
and may or may not include items such as fertilizers, staff costs, and regular maintenance of machinery, among
others. Like above, OpEx calculations are abstracted. Choose between the following calculation methods:

   •	 Variable costs, as percentage of the agricultural offtake from commercial (/PPP) farming
   •	 Fixed costs, per hectare, per annum

OpEx is allocated to commercial farming in proportion to land allotted. Cost efficiencies tend to be higher in
commercial (/PPP) farming compared to smallholder farms.

          4.3.3	   Smallholder farming scheme

          For estimating the financial impact per smallholder farm, you can assume an average smallholder size in
          hectares, along with a potential growth of the average smallholder’s farm size over the course of the project.
          Enter agricultural offtake per hectare for smallholder farms. Values here depend heavily on the underlying
          agricultural factors. Typically, you should expect agricultural offtake for smallholder farming to be lower than that
          of commercial or PPP-based farming.

          Irrigation operating expenditure (“Irrigation OpEx”) of smallholders depends on the individual characteristics
          of each transaction, and may or may not include items such as pumping energy or staff costs, among others.
          With the goal to make the tool as flexible as possible, OpEx calculations are abstracted. Choose between the
          following calculation methods:

          Other operating expenditure (“Other OpEx”) of smallholders refers to all other costs typically associated with
          agriculture, and depends on the individual land and crop characteristics of each transaction, and may or may

             •	 Fixed costs, per hectare, per annum

          OpEx is allocated to smallholders in proportion to land allotted. Cost efficiencies tend to be lower in
          smallholder farms compared to commercial (/PPP) farming.

4.4	 Capital expenditure (CapEx)

4.4.1	   Construction CapEx

Initial construction CapEx refers to depreciable CapEx during the construction phase as projected by the
technical consultants. Users enter values by construction year and before inflation. The tool applies inflation
to further calculations automatically, in accordance with the inflation forecast added further below. The share
of initial construction CapEx financed by the private sector is added to the balance sheet of the SPV, while
construction CapEx financed by the public sector does not affect the SPV’s balance sheet. This approach avoids
overstating the SPV’s tax shield caused by depreciation.

Because the current version of the tool is optimized for greenfield projects, no pre-completion revenues for
funding or OpEx (the later which could be either expensed or capitalized) are taken into account during the
construction phase.

4.4.2	   Initial cash & success fees

In order to ease cash flow shortfalls of the SPV during ramp-up of operations, a starting cash balance may be
included at the end of the construction phase as part of initial CapEx. This cash balance will only apply in those
structuring scenarios where an SPV is required for construction. Also, for PPP concessions, the government
may organize a competitive tender among potential equity sponsors, in which case the winning bidder would
typically pay a success fee to the transaction advisors. The bid success fee is then considered an amortizable
investment cost from the SPV’s point of view, and as such part of initial CapEx.

          4.4.3	   Major maintenance CapEx

          Major maintenance (or expansion) CapEx refers to depreciable CapEx during the operational phase as
          projected by technical consultants. Enter values by operational year and before inflation. The tool applies
          inflation automatically, in accordance with the inflation forecast added further below. The share of major
          maintenance CapEx financed by the private sector is added to the balance sheet of the SPV, while major
          maintenance CapEx financed by the public sector does not show up on the SPV’s balance sheet. This approach
          avoids overstating the SPV’s tax shield caused by depreciation.

          4.4.4	   Major maintenance reserve account (MMRA/c)

          Major maintenance CapEx may be financed from cash flow only, or through a combination of operational cash
          flow and the MMRA/c, and with or without additional government financing. In most project financings, where
          major maintenance CapEx is significant relative to operational cash flow, lenders would typically require the SPV
          / project company to set up an MMRA/c, to make sure sufficient cash is put aside to match the SPV’s ongoing
          CapEx. The MMRA/c is usually funded up to certain target balance, which in the current tool may be set at 12,
          24 or 36 months of projected major maintenance CapEx (less major maintenance CapEx eventually financed
          by the government, if any). It may even involve a fixed minimum balance, which users can define separately. In
          order to ease cash flow during ramp-up of operations, the MMRA/c may also be pre-funded on the last day of
          construction, and then built up from cash flow according to minimum and target balances.

          In terms of seniority in the cash waterfall, cash flow available to fund MMRA/c is usually ranked after operational
          cash flow, but takes precedence over debt service payment. The modelling approach of the MMRA/c as
          suggested by the tool avoids the occurrence of any circular references in its calculation. Also, for reasons of
          simplicity, the current tool ignores any potential interest income on reserve account balances.

4.4.5	Depreciation

For simplicity, the tool applies a standard, straight-line depreciation across all asset classes. While a default
value of 20 years is assumed for the purpose of the tool, fixed irrigation assets typically have depreciation
periods of several decades. Depreciation only plays a role for the structuring options involving private sector
financing, reducing the net book value (NBV) of commercially financed assets, and providing a corresponding
tax deduction on the profit & loss (P&L) statement.


4.5	 Allocation of costs & revenues amongst stakeholders

4.5.1	     Funding of initial CapEx

In order to avoid the circular logic10 which typically affects a project financing due to the capitalization of
construction costs, senior debt funding needs to be entered both as percentage ratio of total funding, and as
maximum amount made available for drawdown. For the purpose of the present tool, drawdown is on a “pro-
rata” basis only (i.e. the same percentage in each year of construction), as opposed to other common drawdown
mechanics like “equity-first” or “milestone-driven”. The table below shows typical funding ratios for each of the
structuring options under consideration.

Once you entered the senior debt financing ratio in percentage, it must be matched by its corresponding



10	 A classic example for this type of circular logic is that of interest on a deposit or a loan account, where the interest is calculated on the average balance
   and the interest accumulates within the account, which is what typically happens during the construction period in project financings due to interest during
   construction (IDC) and fees. In a bankable financial model, such optimisation is typically achieved through macros.

          funding amount in numbers, taking into account the impact of interest during construction (IDC), commitment
          fees, and inflation on initial CapEx (same as capitalized CapEx). Ideally, the maximum amount of senior debt
ANNEX 1


          does not exceed the required amount by more than 10%, as any outstanding loan balances not effectively
          drawn will result in unnecessarily high commitment fees for the borrowing SPV. For commercial financings, any
          funding shortfall is made up by additional sponsor equity, up to the amounts required to match capitalized
          CapEx. Finding the adequate senior debt funding amount may require a couple of attempts.

          For simplicity, the present tool models the construction period on an annual basis only. Project finance best
          practice, however, consists in modelling construction phases on a quarterly basis at least. Lower periodicities
          allow calculating interest during construction (IDC), commitment fees and other costs with more accuracy.
          Accordingly, you should be aware that the present tool might misrepresent the true costs of capitalized
          construction, as compared to a full-scale, bankable project finance model.


          4.5.2	    Funding of major maintenance CapEx

          Major maintenance CapEx (or expansion CapEx) may be financed internally either from the SPV’s cash flow
          (which equates to equity financing), from additional external government funds, or a combination of the
          two. Internally financed major maintenance can also draw from the MMRA/c, if applied. The share of major
          maintenance CapEx financed by the private sector is added to the balance sheet of the SPV, while major
          maintenance CapEx financed by the public sector does not affect the SPV’s balance sheet.

The allocation of irrigation OpEx and Water Usage Charges (WUC) will depend on the chosen structuring option and




                                                                                                                                     ANNEX 1
economic model. In the present tool, you can flexibly allocate to various stakeholders the following financial flows:

   •	 Irrigation OpEx related to commercial (/PPP) farming assets: Charged to either the private operator /
         concessionaire / sponsor, or the public sector. OpEx is calculated in proportion with any land allocated to
         the commercial (/PPP) side of the transaction.

   •	 Irrigation OpEx related to smallholder farming: Charged to either the public sector, the private operator
         / concessionaire / sponsor, or to individual smallholders / farmers (in case of a scheme fully run by
         smallholders themselves). OpEx is calculated in proportion with any land allocated to the smallholder side
         of the transaction.

   •	 Water Usage Charges (WUC): Received by either the public sector, or the private operator / concessionaire
         / sponsor.

The table below summarizes the recommended configuration for the standard structuring options considered in
the present manual.

Water Usage Charges are paid by smallholding farmers, either to the Government (in a purely publicly financed
structure), or to the private operator (in a PPP or privately financed approach).

Users enter Water Usage Charges (WUC) as starting value per hectare per annum, which is then increased (or
decreased) according to an annual percentage growth path. The “starting value + growth path” approach
allows users to perform a manual goal seek for cost-reflective – or “minimum return” – water usage charges, if
required. The ideal amount of water usage charges will depend on factors as diverse as smallholders’ willingness
to pay and affordability, the ratio of public grant financing, the level of CapEx and OpEx, the level availability
payments by the public authorities, revenues from agricultural offtake, and the return expectations of sponsors.

          For simplicity, the present tool does not include any sophisticated functions or macros for multiple optimization,
          which is why you need to perform manual goal seeks if certain target outputs need to be achieved. For some

          basic guidance on how to do this, refer to the dedicated section below.

          4.5.4	     Private remuneration options

          The two main types of remuneration options of the private sector considered in the present tool are:

              •	 Availability payments11: Paid by the public sector to the private operator / concessionaire / sponsor,
                   typically based on defined quality-of-service or performance indicators. Enter a first year starting value,
                   which you can then increase or decrease by an annual percentage factor. You can also control the duration
                   of availability payments, however, if debt financing is involved, the duration is always equal to debt tenor
                   at the minimum. The approach facilitates goal seek operations on the optimum amount of availability
                   payments.

              •	 Management / service fees: Paid by the public sector to the private operator / concessionaire / sponsor,
                   ideally based on defined quality-of-service or performance indicators. Can be entered either as fixed (and
                   indexed) payment stream, or as a fee per hectare.

          Given their potentially complex nature and dependence on technical quality-of-service parameters, the tool
          does not contain any performance penalty / reward mechanisms at present. The table below summarizes the
          recommended configuration for each of the structuring options. Inputs will depend strongly on the transaction,
          and typically become subject of more or less intense negotiations between the public and the private sector.

          TABLE A1.11: Suggested configuration of private remuneration options for various structuring scenarios.

          11	 Availability payments are a specific type of remuneration under a PPP contract and often used in a situation where the private sector would not accept
             the commercial risk of the transaction, either because the (regulated) tariff is too low to cover costs, or payment risk and/or demand risk from end users is
             significant. Instead of availability payments, governments also pay operational subsidies to the concessionaire. Operational subsidies typically come on top of
             the private sector remuneration to fund the gap between what the concessionaire is allowed to charge to end users (most often by regulation) and operating
             costs. Governments also provide guarantees, which are used only in last recourse in cases where demand is lower than expected, or where end users fail to
             pay. Often, operating subsidies and guarantees are temporary and removed after the achievement of certain milestones, for example following a successful
             ramp-up of revenues in the first years of a PPP. In contrast, availability payments represent a constant, contractual payment stream over the concession term.
             Accordingly, in the case of an irrigation PPP, it would usually be reasonable to assume that - where the concessionaire receives an availability payment – Water
             Usage Charges (WUC) should be received by the public sector rather than the private sector. However, for reasons of simplicity, the present version of the
             tool does not offer a separate mechanism for government operational subsidies or guarantees, which is why the PPP options available should be applied and
             combined more flexibly, if needed.

4.6	 Commercial financing terms

4.6.1	     Senior debt

Senior debt controls are similar to what can be found in other corporate financial models. The assumptions
only apply when debt financing is involved at the level of the SPV, which is typically the case for a PPP, or a fully
privatized operation. You need to configure the following parameters:

   •	 Tenor (all-in): The overall debt tenor in years, including drawdown period during construction, grace
         period on principal and effective repayment period. The value should not exceed the project duration.

   •	 Principal grace period (@ operational start): For commercial debt, we recommended that grace period on
         principal should not exceed 1-2 years following the commercial operation date (“COD”).

   •	 Repayment style: Choose between standard annuity repayment, and a repayment profile based on a
         target debt service cover ratio (“DSCR”).

   •	 Repayment target DSCR: The annual debt service cover ratio (“DSCR”) applied in the target DSCR
         repayment method. You may need to perform trial-and-error on both target DSCR and debt tenor in
         order to find the adequate input. DSCR should not be lower than approx. 1,40x, strongly depending on
         the transaction’s risk profile. Target DSCR repayment may be interesting in cases where the SPV’s revenue
         ramp-up is too slow to allow a full annuity repayment during the first years of operation.

   •	 Senior debt - Interest margin during construction (IDC): Interest p.a. applied to the senior debt
         outstanding balance during the construction period.

   •	 Senior debt - Interest margin during operations: Interest p.a. applied to the senior debt outstanding
         balance during the operational period.

          Most of the above senior debt parameters are usually the subject of intense negotiations between the
          private operator / concessionaire / sponsor and their lenders, and values may vary considerably depending on
          countries, industry sectors, and market cycles. In addition, keep in mind that a bankable tool would calculate
          IDC and commitment fees during the construction phase on a monthly or quarterly basis, and that the annual
          calculation used in the present tool may understate or misrepresent true capitalization costs.

case for a management contract, lease / affermage operation, PPP, or fully privatized operation. You need to
configure the following parameters:

   •	 Dividend payout ratio (% of cashflow available for dividends): The dividend payment ratio determines how
         much cash is distributed and retained by the SPV / project company. This has an impact not only on the
         equity return, but also on the cash balances and internal financing capacity of the SPV. You may need to do
         trial-and-error to find the optimum payout ratio.

   •	 Minimum cash balance: Allows introducing a minimum cash balance to be maintained by the SPV (or
         project company) during construction, taking into account e.g. the overall transaction volume, sales cycles,
         ongoing CapEx requirements, payment risk from end-users and other factors.

   •	 Covenant minimum DSCR: If the transaction involves debt financing, users can apply a covenant for
         minimum debt service cover ratio (DSCR), to make sure no dividends are distributed if debt service cover
         is not sufficient.

   •	 Disbursement not allowed before operations yr.: For transactions where ramp-up of revenues during the
         first years of operations in slow, users can simulate a dividend distribution block during the first 1 to 3 years
         of operations.

          4.6.3	   Cost of capital

          The tool allows calculating the cost of capital for the project as a weighted average cost of sponsor equity,
ANNEX 1



          government grant and senior debt (weighted average cost of capital, or “WACC”). Free cash flow to project can
          be discounted either at cost of debt or at WACC, while free cash flow to equity is always discounted at cost of
          equity. You should factor any country-specific risk premiums directly into the cost of equity, government funding
          and debt, respectively.

          4.6.4	   Working capital

          Working capital is entered in days of cash owned by debtors (same as accounts receivable) and cash owed
          to creditors (accounts payable), which are then used to calculated a net working capital impact on cash flow.
          The cash flow impact is considered separately for the SPV / project company, and smallholders. A reasonable
          working capital estimate for the agricultural sector should take into account the impact of harvest cycles on cost
          and revenues for both farmers and the project SPV.

          4.7.1	Tax

          The tool suggests a standard approach to calculate corporate taxes. However, depending on the country where
          the project is located, actual tax calculations may be very different. Corporate taxes apply to the SPV / project
          company and the smallholders, whereas withholding tax is charged only on dividends distributed to the private

investor / project sponsor. For the purpose of the present tool, no tax holiday has been assumed, and the
tax loss carry forward has no expiration period. For a bankable tax calculation, make sure the tool follows the
applicable domestic tax regime.




                                                                                                                           ANNEX 1
4.7.2	     Inflation & base interest rates

Enter inflation and base interest rates for each project year, based on official forecasts and / or market estimates.
For real cash flows instead of nominal cash flows to be used across the entire tool, set all yearly inflation rates to
zero. Interest rate stress tests could require changing both the interest base rate, and the senior debt margin, as
applicable.


5. Outputs


5.1	 Results & integrity alerts

The tool comprises a flexible result and integrity alert system to help you spot and trace errors, and issues
related to results. Each worksheet contains result and integrity signaling flags on the top left corner, which
display yellow for “result”, and pink for “integrity” alerts. Clicking on the flags takes you straight to the bottom
of the “Input” sheet, where the “Result” and “Integrity” checks informs you about issues and errors found:

   •	 Result: Triggered by insufficient returns, debt service cover ratios (DSCR), or cash balances, for instance.
         Most “Result” issues can be managed and resolved by changing assumptions where possible, until
         achieving the desired results. Some deal configurations, however, may always trigger a “Result” alert.
         Make sure you understand the results of your simulation.

   •	 Integrity: Triggered by mismatching balance sheets, funding uses and sources, or discrepancies between
         financial statements across worksheets, for example. Integrity issues normally indicate a more serious
         problem with the tool, which will need to be fixed by diving deeper into the formulas.


5.2	 Data table output

The tool makes use of Excel data table technique for calculating scenario results. Depending on your calculation
settings in Excel, you may need to press keyboard “F9” at regular intervals to update data table results. The
data table is situated at the bottom of the “Input” sheet (grey-shaded area with brown fonts). It provides a
side-by-side comparison between the different scenarios along key output parameters, such as CapEx, return
to stakeholders, contractual configuration, government cash flows, as well as integrity checks and result alerts
for the entire tool. For technical reasons, the data table needs to be located on the “Input” sheet, within reach
of the scenario manager. To learn more about data table techniques, refer to one of numerous free tutorials
available on the internet.

          5.3	 Screen and print summary

          The screen and print summary provides users with a complete overview for the currently active scenario,
ANNEX 1



          including key results, core financial statements and graphs. You may need to adjust the page breaks for printing
          in paper formats other than the standard output A4 or US Letter. For changing between scenarios, select from
          the drop-down list in the top left corner.


          5.4	 Manual goal seek of target returns (IRR, NPV)

          In order to reduce complexity, the tool does not contain any optimization macros, such as VBA scripts for target
          return iterations. However, you can perform a manual goal seek using Excel’s built-in goal-seek function. Below
          are some basic instructions on how to perform a goal seek for two common optimization targets, based on
          Excel 2013:

             •	 Water usage charge (WUC) required for achieving target IRR / NPV: Make sure you have the right
                 scenario selected in the Scenario Manager. Go to [ Data > What-If Analysis > Goal seek ] to open the
                 “Goal seek” dialogue. In the “Set cell” box, select the cells where IRR or NPV results are calculated for
                 either the equity investor (“Sponsor” sheet, cell names “IRR_Project”, “NPV_Project”, IRR_Equity” or
                 “NPV_Equity”, respectively), or the government (“Government” sheet, cell names “IRR_Government” or
                 “NPV_Government”). In the “To value” box, enter the desired target IRR as decimal number, for example
                 0.15 for 15%, or the desired nominal target NPV amount. In the “By changing cell” box, select the “Water
                 Usage Charge (WUC) per hectare, p.a., 1st yr.” cell for the active scenario (!). The corresponding section
                 on the “Input” sheet may need to be expanded first before being able to select cells from the goal seek
                 dialogue. Click “OK”. Excel should now iterate for the desired target value, or alternatively interrupt the
                 iteration loop after a number of runs in case there is no solution.

             •	 Availability payment required for achieving target IRR / NPV: Follow the same instructions as above, but in
                 the “By changing cell” box, select “Availability payment, 1st yr. of operations” for the active scenario (!),
                 and run the iteration.

          The interdependencies between the various modelling variables can be very complex at times, and not all
          configurations may actually have an optimum solution. Make sure you understand the results of your simulation,
          their interdependencies, and the logical limits to multiple optimization.

          introduction
ANNEX 2




          This Annex provides case studies of 29 irrigation PPPs around the world. Twenty-one of these were described in
          the World Bank’s 2007 report; the remaining eight—relatively recent schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa and South
          Asia—are drawn from publicly available information and desk research.

          It should be noted that some of the schemes are still in the planning or developmental phases. Thus, the
          structure of the projects covered may change as further project design and development activity takes place.
          Table A2.1 below groups the 29 cases according to project type, and shows scheme location, agricultural
          off-take, and current status. Table A2.2 indicates the schemes’ Irrigation and Drainage contract functions—
          financing, design, construction, management of water allocation, maintenance, and system operation—with the
          highlighted cells indicating which functions are present in each project):

          1. Concession Contracts
ANNEX 2


          This section describes 13 irrigation schemes that were procured through concession contract—some new or
          planned and others already in operation for several years (in some cases, decades). Under concessionary PPP
          arrangements, the government pays the concessionaire to carry out the development and implementation
          of the scheme and allows the operator to collect user fees for a number of years before transferring the
          scheme back to full government ownership. In most cases, ownership of the scheme’s assets remains with the
          government; demand risk is transferred to the concessionaire.

          Table A2.3 below summarizes key features of the 13 irrigation schemes. Thereafter, each scheme is examined in
          greater detail with tabular representation.

                         The project is a greenfield development that will involve the provision of irrigation services on up to 2,500
                         ha of undeveloped land.




                                                                                                                                                                     ANNEX 2
                         The project will involve commercial farmers (formed into FarmCo(s)), while smallholders will have access to
                         farming equipment and some technical assistance in addition to the irrigated water.

                         Roles and responsibilities
                         Smallholder farmers. Under the arrangements the smallholder farmers have agreed to combine 80
                         percent of their land (which is currently unused) into landholder co-operatives which will enter into 20-year
                         leases with the FarmCo(s). Each smallholder has the opportunity to earn a return from their equity in the
                         FarmCo(s) over the life of the lease. In addition, the 600 smallholders involved in the scheme will produce
                         crops on 0.2 ha plots of irrigated land, with no payment required for the access to irrigation facilities.
                         Cooperative societies will be formed to help manage the interests of the smallholders, technical assistance
                         will be provided from USAID to help with guidance on the establishment of these cooperatives.

                         Commercial farmers (FarmCo(s)). These will be established under ownership of the commercial farmers
                         and smallholder cooperatives. The FarmCo(s) will pay service charges for the irrigation facilities to the
                         service provider. A management contract will be put in place to facilitate oversight of the operations of the
                         commercial companies.
     Project structure




                         Infrastructure Service Company. This will be formed as a not-for-profit, special purpose infrastructure
                         service company and be responsible for building, operating and financing the irrigation assets. The
                         company will supply the bulk water and the long-term lease of irrigation equipment and farm equipment
                         to the FarmCo(s) and will also provide irrigation services to the smallholders.

                         The Board of the company will include representatives of the local farmers and providers of the investment
                         capital. After 25 years, full control of the organisation will transfer to local farmers who will own alongside
                         the government.

                                          The total finance requirement is estimated to be $30.5m, which includes the following:

                                              •	 Capital costs of $25m, which includes $13.6m for one-off start-up costs to build canals, clear land

                                                 pay for resettlement of farmers with the remainder to pay for the irrigation facilities.
                                              •	 Working capital requirement from the commercial farm of $5.5m.
                 Financial arrangements



                                          According to analysis presented by InfraCo,1 with these high upfront costs the project would not have
                                          been able to be established if a private investor were expected to cover the costs through commercial
                                          sources. This is because the expected returns of around 10 percent on equity would not be sufficient to
                                          attract commercial funds given the level of risk entailed by the project.

                                          InfraCo’s analysis shows that through the injection of $15m of patient capital by development partners to
                                          fund the one-off start-up costs of the project (patient capital is long-term, subordinated capital invested at
                                          sub-commercial costs) the estimated returns on equity increase to approximately 16-18 percent, making it
                                          a much more viable proposition from a commercial perspective.

                                          Following a two-year period of consultations by InfraCo with local communities and detailed commercial
                                          structuring of the project, the first phase (210 ha) is complete. According to the PIDG, it is in development,
                                          and is expected to generate annual tax payments of approximately $440,000.




                                          The key lesson from this emerging scheme relates to the way in which an innovative financial solution has
                                          been proposed to enable a project to become more bankable.

                                          The use of patient capital has in this case helped to provide a proposed solution to the barriers to the use
                                          of commercial finance on greenfield irrigation schemes, where the high up-front costs required to develop
                                          the necessary irrigation infrastructure, uncertain demand and other risk can make it impossible to attract
                                          commercial finance.
                 Lessons learned




                                          This is because in a developing country context a greenfield primary agriculture investment without
                                          contracted offtake is typically very high risk. Given this context it is unlikely that an irrigation scheme will
                                          generate sufficient revenues to attract commercial finance.

                                          The injection of patient capital by development partners has been proposed to cover the high up-front
                                          costs and some of the costs of the very long-life assets. With these costs covered, the project should be
                                          able to attract additional commercial finance, which could then be repaid credibly through the expected
                                          revenue stream of the emergent irrigation scheme.

                                       additional 800 smallholders are not served because their mango trees are said to be over three years
                                       old and surviving without the need for irrigation services. While the irrigation scheme began with
                                       investment in 2011, the overall ITFC outgrowers’ scheme began in 2001. Since it began, some farmers
                                       have been removed from the scheme as they have not adhered to the required standard of farming
                                       practices. Up to the time of this report, the irrigation scheme had not generated any revenue and was
                                       still experiencing a lot of changes in terms of crops planted. The output was mostly being exported to
                                       the Italian market.

                                       At first, the main crops covered were organic mangoes, which require no chemicals at all. However,
                                       this situation didn’t last because the land produced very low yields for lack of chemicals supplements.
                                       By the time of this report, the organic mango project had been given up, and replaced with the
                                       cultivation of ordinary mangoes that were dried or turned mainly into mango juice.

                                       ITFC. In the model, the ITFC operates a nursery and a 160 ha mango farm in the Savelugu-Nanton
                   Project structure




                                       District of the Northern Region of Ghana. Attached to this is an additional 800 ha of land managed
                                       by 1,300 smallholder farmers. The ITFC provides inputs (access to irrigation services, cutlasses, bags
                                       of manure, and seedlings) and technical assistance to the smallholders, who are charged in the form
                                       of an interest free loan. The ITFC also helps farmers obtain licences and certification, a requirement
                                       for organic exportation. It was originally intended that 2,000 farmers would be under the wider ITFC
                                       scheme, however this is currently limited to 1,300 while ITFC addresses organisational issues amongst
                                       the farmers.

                                       Organic Mango Outgrowers Association (OMOA). To strengthen local participation in the
                                       management of the scheme, the farmers are organised into an association known as the Organic
                                       Mango Outgrowers Association (OMOA). This association plays an intermediary role between the
                                       ITFC and the contracted farmers; it is also the farmers’ advocacy platform. The OMOA meets quarterly
                                       with its members and monthly with ITFC management. OMOA begun with funding from ITFC and
                                       later from the government through the Agricultural Sector Improvement Project (ASIP), The African
                                       Development Bank and nongovernmental organisations CordAid, Senter, and Wienco. The ultimate
                                       aim is for the OMOA to become self-sustaining using the contributions from its membership.

                                       Smallholder farmers. To join the scheme, the smallholders have to provide an 85kg bag of maize
                                       upfront (which is equivalent to around $25). From the fifth year onwards the outgrowers will repay 30
                                       percent of their sales to the ITFC until the debt is repaid. Until the debt is repaid in full, all mangoes
                                       must be sold through the ITFC, but thereafter they may sell to any buyer.

                                The total investment is expected to be approximately $4.5 million, which is made up of:

                                    •	 Annual operating cost of $32,500.
       Financial arrangements



                                The scheme was calculated for 15 years (2011-2026), with income projected to begin in 2014. The
                                average farm was expected, in 2014, to have total revenue of $726. With 500 farmers and the expected
                                5 percent annual increases in yield, annual repayments to the ITFC loans in 2016 (the first year in which
                                the ITFC will take its 30 percent cut) will total approximately $120,000, while each outgrower will earn
                                $560 after these repayments.

                                The total investment costs approximately $22,000/ha, which is high considering that irrigation
                                schemes in Sub-Saharan Africa typically cost $10,000 per ha. The main reason for the high costs is
                                that the scheme involved investing in more than just the pumps and accessories, and covered larger
                                investments which make investments in pumps more viable, such as constructing weirs and booster
                                stations.

                                The ITFC has a low financial IRR of only 0.1 percent, while the outgrowers benefit from a financial
                                IRR of 6 percent.3 Once higher fruit yields are achieved, it is expected that the IRR may increase
                                “appreciably”, but the uncertainty and budgetary constraints of the government required donor
                                funding to implement the project in the medium term.
                                The ITFC’s main benefit from the outgrower scheme was based on an expectation of increased market
                                power through organic mango exports. By providing interest-free capital on uniform, relatively small
                                plots to outgrowers, the ITFC was able to target such market power without incurring undue expense
                                or difficulty in acquiring the land itself.

                                Through its choice of repayment method for the farmers, the ITFC (as the private firm in this scheme)
                                reduced its risk: until the loan is fully repaid, outgrowers are required to sell all of their produce
                                through the ITFC, which then returns the appropriate amount to the outgrower (100 percent until 2016
                                and then 70 percent).

                                Operational issues
                                The experience of this project demonstrates some of the difficulties involved in trying to manage a
                                large group of smallholder farmers. None of the outgrower farmers kept independent records of their
                                yields, calculations of expected yields and increases in yields were for a hypothetical farmer and are
                                based upon assumptions of average yields and it is difficult for the ITFC to verify the increases in yield
                                which the scheme has brought about.

                                An additional operational issue with the scheme comes from complaints from those farmers that
                                have been on the scheme prior to the 2011 investment: the farmers claim that they have not always
                                been receiving their portion of the value of their produce on time after the ITFC had deducted its
                                percentage for repayment of the loan. If these issues are not addressed over time they will reduce the
                                sustainability of the scheme.4

                                On a more positive note, the scheme has been successful in targeting poorer farmers; the restriction
                                on the size of land to one acre per grower, coupled with the distances involved and transportation
                                difficulties may have discouraged wealthier people from larger towns joining the scheme.

                             This project involves three main stages, as follows:

                                1.	 Water diversion stage:
                                   The project diverts the Huancabamba River from the eastern side of the Andes (flowing to the
                                   Amazon) to the western side of the Andes so that it will flow to the Olmos plains to provide the
                                   406hm3 required for irrigation. This stage was awarded to Concesionaria Trasvase Olmos S.A,
                                   an Odebrecht subsidiary9 as a $19 million, 20-year contract in 200410 and was completed in
                                   July 2012.11




                                                                                                                                                            ANNEX 2
                                   The public sector involvement in this stage is through the government of Peru granting tax
                                   exemptions and a tax stability agreement to Odebrecht.12

                                2.	 Irrigation stage:
                                   Of the 43,500 ha involved, 38,000 ha was previously wasteland that is being made available for
                                   auction so as to be brought into production. The other 5,500 ha was already owned by local
                                   farmers. Construction of the irrigation infrastructure was completed in October 2014.

                                   The state reserved 110,000 ha of land for the project in the 1990s in order to make it easier to
                                   attract private investors when the project finally did get off the ground.13
         Project structure




                                   This stage was awarded fully to concessionaire H2Olmos S.A. in June 2010.14 H2Olmos is a
                                   subsidiary of Odebrecht, and was formed solely for this project.

                                3.	 Energy generation stage:15
                                   This stage involves the construction of a hydropower generation turbine at the exit of
                                   the tunnel created in stage 1, to generate renewable energy to sell to Peru’s National
                                   Interconnected Electric Grid to enable a reduction in CO2 of up to 200 ktonnes per year. It will
                                   have a capacity of 51MW, expected to generate up to 303 GWh/year.16

                                   This stage was awarded to concessionaire Union Energy SA (SINERSA) in October 2010.17

                             Roles and responsibilities
                             Gobierno Regionalde Lambayeque (GRL). GRL is the Grantor and the Trustor of the land. After
                             transferring the land into a trust to make the process easier, the land and irrigation rights were
                             transferred to the private parties which won the auctions for the 41 plots of land (38,000 hectares).

                             The funds raised through the auction are therefore held in this trust (the Land Trust) rather than being
                             held directly by GRL, with a percentage to be passed onto the concessionaire to cover some of the
                             costs of implementing the infrastructure.

                             Funds raised through the auction process will be held in a trust (the Land Trust) and will be used to
                             pay the GRL for the land and to finance part of the infrastructure investment.

                             Concessionaire. The concessionaire, H2Olmos S.A. Odebrecht, will be responsible for constructing
                             the irrigation infrastructure, electricity transmission, and access roads. Also in charge of the operation
                             and maintenance throughout the 23-year renewable contract.

                                                H2Olmos will receive the capacity fee portion of the auction proceeds (minus tax), which is
                                                approximately 72 percent of the anticipated $160m, and will also receive a flat service fee of $0.07 per
                                                m3 for the water which is used. With an average usage of 10,000 per ha/year, this could equal $26.6m
                                                each year.

                                                Customers. The farmers will acquire the title to the land and the right to the irrigation services, with
ANNEX 2


                                                an obligation to pay the service fee of $0.07 per m3 for water used to irrigate their farm. This is a “C”
                                                contract, meaning that if the farmers do not take the water supply from the concessionaire they will
                                                be liable to pay a penalty.

                                                Some of the 38,000 ha of land auctioned was sold to a combine of Peruvian and foreign companies,
                                                70 percent of which are Peruvian, with the main investor being Grupo Gloria, with 15,000 hectares
                                                of highly-mechanized sugarcane production. A further 4,000 ha was sold to a US investment fund
                                                focused on grapes, avocados, and other crops; with shares also held by California’s Mission Produce,
                                                Peru’s Grupo Arato, and European investment funds. The sale of about 10,530 ha to Odebrecht in the
                                                auction had yet to be completed at the time of this writing. The company planned to sell a block of
                                                5,750 ha, in lots of 1,000 ha at a base price of $6,500 each and 250 ha at $ 7,500 each. It had already
                                                sold 50 percent of these lots by the time of writing. Another consortium, Grupo Wong was interested
                                                in acquiring land to plant sugarcane and for potential integration of the textile industry. Odebrecht
                                                was still evaluating what to do with its remaining land allocation, and might decide to hold onto it.

                                                       has been completed. On November 19, 2014, the President of Peru inaugurated
                                                       the irrigation. However, local daily newspaper, Gestión, reported at about that time
                                                       that despite the project’s completion, 25 percent of the land was not yet ready for
                                                       agricultural production, which would primarily disadvantage local producers.18

                                   The project has been split into three main stages, as follows:

                                       1.	 Water diversion stage $247 million—PPP funded19




                                                                                                                                                                     ANNEX 2
                                          Diverting the water towards the project involved the construction of a 44 million m3 dam and
                                          20km tunnel, funded through a public-private partnership with a total investment of $247
                                          million.

                                          The feasibility studies ($1.9 million) were funded by the Japanese Special Fund (JSF, $1.28
                                          million), the government of Peru (through ProInversión), and the regional government of
          Financial arrangements




                                          Lambayeque (GRL, through the Olmos-Tinajones Special Project (PEOT)).20

                                       2.	 Irrigation stage $280 million—privately funded21
                                          This component is being funded solely through private investment from agribusiness firms
                                          and Odebrecht, with approximately 50 percent from bonds issued on Lima’s stock exchange
                                          backed by a partial credit guarantee of $50 million from the Latin American bank, CAF.22

                                       3.	 Energy generation stage $60-80 million—privately funded23
                                          This stage is being funded by the concessionaire, SINERSA, who will recoup its investment
                                          through the sale of generated energy. Energy generation is expected to cost around $4.75 per
                                          MWh, and be sold at an estimated $38.30 per MWh.24 The IRR of this component of the project
                                          is 9.51 percent.25

                                          The 38,000 ha of lots to be auctioned have been broken into six lots of 500 ha and 35 lots of
                                          1,000 ha, which all face a price of $0.07 per m3 for the irrigation water.26

                                   35,500 ha had been successfully auctioned by the time of writing,27 which had raised at least
                                   $150 million.28 The money raised from these auctions is split between GRL and the H2Olmos S.A.
                                   Odebrecht, with the latter’s share of 72 percent provided to repay the costs of implementing the
                                   infrastructure.


                                   With 38,000 of the 43,500 hectares being kept to be auctioned to private investors (who will produce
       Lessons
       learned




                                   high-value crops) and 35,500 ha already successfully auctioned, the development and design of this
                                   irrigation scheme reinforces the view that expensive and large-scale schemes such as Olmos are most
                                   typically feasible only when developed to support commercial farming activities.

                           The Pontal Project will encompass over 33,500 ha, of which 7,717 ha will be destined for irrigation. The
                           rest of the area will be a national park. With a need to improve the provision of irrigated agriculture in

                           the region, the decision to structure the project as a PPP was due mainly to a set of World Bank studies
                           that showed that irrigated agriculture, if conducted under sustainable and entrepreneurial standards,
                           promotes regional development. Among all economic activities, agriculture has proved to be one that
                           generates most social impact as it requires low investments per job created.32

                           Roles and responsibilities
                           Government of Brazil. The government will cede the land, and the existing infrastructure, which already
                           covers approximately 70 percent of the target area, to the private partner. The government will also be
                           responsible for setting the initial price of the water and the land, which would afterwards be adjusted
                           annually, according to inflation. The government would also finance construction of Pontal‘s basic road
                           and energy infrastructure.

                           The private partner. The private sector partner will form a special purpose company (SPC) which will
                           complete the construction of the common infrastructure, and then ensure that the agribusiness users
                           allocate the land to farmers within six years of the signing of the SPC’s contract with the government. The
       Project structure




                           SPC will be required to operate and maintain the common infrastructure throughout the 25-year contract.

                           Once the land has been allocated (the SPC will have discretion over the physical arrangement of the lots),
                           the SPC will also be responsible for ensuring that the agribusiness users comply with the requirement
                           for 25 percent of the irrigable land to be allocated to (local) smallholder farmers (up to 20 ha each), and
                           for those smallholders to be integrated into the agricultural production chain of the larger commercial
                           farmers.

                           The SPC will receive remuneration for these actions through three streams:

                              1.	 Tariff collection from the agribusiness company on water (maximum of $19.72 per 1,000m3) and
                                  land (maximum of $364.24 per ha/year);

                              2.	 Contraprestação (capacity payment) paid by the government; and

                              3.	 Additional revenues generated by project, if any.

                           Government payment will occur when the concessionaire achieves pre-defined targets related to
                           indicators such as water availability and occupation of the land.

                           The agribusiness company. The agribusiness company will be allocated land from the SPC and then
                           be required to allocate it to the commercial and smallholder farmers, ensuring that at least 25 percent
                           of irrigable land is allocated to smallholder farmers. The agribusiness company is free to select which
                           crops which will be grown, and train the smallholders on farming techniques and quality standards.
                           The agribusiness company will be responsible for paying water and land tariffs to the SPC. They have
                           the option of collecting the smallholders’ irrigation tariffs in the form of a portion of the smallholders’
                           production.

                                    Compared to other public irrigation projects, Pontal seemed to present fewer challenges due to
                                    its smaller area, advanced stage of infrastructure construction, and proximity to a well-established
ANNEX 2


                                    irrigation and fruticulture hub.37 One of the challenges which the project does face, the low credibility
                                    of a guarantee from the government (for example, due to the risk of default), is planned to be solved
                                    by having the Federal PPP Guarantee fund provide the collateral to reduce the financial risk to private
                                    investors.

                                    The development of the PPP proposal has been described as “painstaking” and “protracted”, and took
                                    five years, mainly due to the political sensitivity associated with privatising a government programme.
                                    The level of political involvement is apparent by the fact that the government chose to set the price of
                                    the irrigation services instead of leaving it to the private sector, which one might have expected since it is
                                    the SPC that is responsible for providing the service and collecting the charges.
                  Lessons learned




                                    In the end there was only one bidder for this project, which can be attributed in part to some potential
                                    bidders considering that the investment costs had been underestimated, highlighting the importance of
                                    an up-to-date financial model.38

                                    Impact on other schemes
                                    The Accra Plains Irrigation Project in Ghana derived several important lessons from the Pontal Irrigation
                                    Scheme, including the need for a strong water sector regulator, the handling of risk allocation in the
                                    project design, and connecting irrigation to commercial agriculture and infrastructure development.39

                                    If Pontal succeeds, irrigation PPPs could potentially be replicated on as much as one million hectares
                                    throughout the semi-arid São Francisco River valley, though additional work will be needed to take the

                                            The Accra Plains Irrigation Project is an intervention under the Ghana Commercial Agriculture Project
                                            (GCAP). One of the GCAP’s key aims is to secure PPPs and smallholder linkages in the Accra Plains,
                                            with the purpose of supporting the development of value chains in areas with a good potential for
                                            agricultural growth.

                                            More specifically, the project will include:43

                                               •	 The rehabilitation and expansion of the existing gravity-based Kpone Irrigation Scheme (KIS),
                                                   irrigating 4,100 ha of the 4,310 ha. This component includes 1,100 ha of greenfield land.

                                            The Accra Plains Irrigation Project will include viability-gap funding potentially in the form of an
                                            upfront payment to the project developer. The precise structure of the PPP arrangements for each
                                            site (i.e., KIS and NDIS) are still to be determined, as the project has only recently completed the pre-
                                            feasibility stage.

                                            The project will be implemented by a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) under the responsibility of
                                            the Ministry of Food and Agriculture. The World Bank Appraisal Report concludes that, given the
                                            tariff levels and payment risk from the farmers, it will not be financially viable for a private investor to
                                            carry out the scheme investment activities on its own, hence the need for public funds to support the
                                            development of the scheme.

                                          Funding for the Accra Plains Irrigation Project will be channelled through the GCAP. Of GCAP’s total
                                          forecast cost of $145 million, the Accra Plains Project is expected to constitute slightly more than
                                          30 percent (or $45.5 million)—of which 100 percent is expected to be sourced from the World Bank
                                          Group’s International Development Association (IDA). USAID is also a GCAP sponsor but is supporting
                                          other interventions.44 The specific funding split for the Accra Plains Project is presented below:

         Financial arrangements (cont.)




                                          As the project has just completed the pre-feasibility stage, the financial arrangements between the
                                          private and public sector entities have still not yet been agreed, or even fully defined. Despite this,
                                          consultants have recommended PPP contract types for each of the two sites, as listed in the table
                                          below. The table allocates project risks (and therefore project costs) between the PPP contract parties.
                                          Under the KIS scheme, either a management or lease contract is the recommended PPP contract

                                          of the TORs for the full feasibility study had been completed. In addition, a modernization plan for
                                          the Ghana Irrigation Development Authority was completed. The first round of the matching grant

                                           constructing and operating irrigation schemes in southwestern France under a long-term
                                           government concession contract. The $600 million in assets—dams and networks—allow irrigation
                                           on 200,000 ha. It is a leading private sector company with 50 percent ownership of the public

                                           dams with capacity of 250Mm3, managing 500 Mm3 yearly. The schemes served 10 000 users and
                                           provided urban water for 200 000 people. CACG operated on a foothill territory with numerous
                                           watercourses with extensive pipe networks and river supply. Infrastructure developed by CACG
                                           served multiple purposes: over 80% for agriculture, about 10%, servicing urban water supply and
                                           less than 10% for industries adapting the tariff policy to every use. The present case study does not
                                           address this model, well documented elsewhere, but presents why and how CACG was enticed
                                           into proposing maintenance contracts to financially autonomous water user associations (WUAs),

                                     From 1960 to 1970, CACG had been operating irrigation with comfortable financial support from
                                     the government. In 1972 the water price paid by the farmers covered barely 10 percent of the




                                                                                                                                                ANNEX 2
                                     irrigation costs in spite of large investment subsidies. At that point, the government began a
                                     drastic reform: phasing out all operation subsidies over the next 10 years and reducing CACG’s
                                     financial risks.

                                     The first change was for CACG to adapt the management of the concession model: create a
                                     user committee (Commission Permanente des Irrigants); cut operating costs (50 percent staff
                                     reduction); and increase water prices for the irrigators. More important, CACG switched to a
                                     demand-driven investment policy: all small- and medium-size irrigation schemes were to be
                                     tended by ASAs, the French WUAs. The concession model would be reserved for larger investments
                                     such as reservoir dams. But the question was how to succeed with this new ASA model: how could
                                     CACG combine an acceptable water price for farmers with sound maintenance practices?

                                     CACG water management practice was based on three pillars: consultation, accountability and
                                     technology. Because CACG usually handles the design function, it can standardise equipment
                                     and guarantee that its technical choices will allow easily maintenance in the future. It integrated all

                                     the skills from design to Operation and Maintenance of hydraulic infrastructure and environment
                                     and local engineering into one frame offering support to farmers for irrigation and agriculture
                                     imrpovment. Thus, the maintenance contracts proposed by CACG to ASAs include the following:

                                         •	 Preventive maintenance by CACG specialists before the start of the irrigation season;

                                         •	 Around-the-clock repair service during the irrigation season;

                                         •	 Stock of spare parts for fast repair service;

                                         •	 Binomial fee to ASAs (a fixed part for preventive maintenance plus a variable part for actual
                                             repairs); and

                                         •	 Under a one-year renewable contract, CACG must be fully accountable to the contracted
                                             ASAs.

                                     This new CACG/ASA model is giving good results in southwestern France. Moreover, it widens
                                     CACG’s experience when consulted in management reforms and irrigation management transfer
                                     (IMT) to WUAs.

                                                dependence on sate support. For the private sector, this maintenance service is not risky because
                                                the bill is not paid directly by farmers. It could be a first step toward a broader service provision,
                                                including operation and billing. When reforming I&D government agencies, setting up such a
                                                maintenance service could be fruitful. The best personnel would be transferred to an efficient

                                         In Morocco, major irrigation schemes are managed by public irrigation agencies (Offices
                                         Régionaux de Mise en Valeur Agricole, ORMVAs). For 10 years, the government has been
ANNEX 2


                                         driving a reform with the World Bank’s support to restore financial sustainability and deal with
                                         the lack of maintenance (see also Guerdane). The Second Plan for Improvement of Large-Scale
                                         Irrigation (PAGI-2) has been partly successful in introducing new tools and methods derived from
                                         private management and in raising irrigation water prices. Nevertheless, “sound” maintenance
                                         has not been reached everywhere, and the water-charge collection rate has been declining due
                                         to late payments.

                                         The next projected phase of water reform consists of removing water service from the public
                                         bureaucracy and considering the new entity in charge a private I&D service provider (IDSP),
                                         using private accounting and private personnel-management practices. Financial sustainability
                                         seems near at hand because part of the water price covers the cost of extension services and
                                         heavy overheads. If water only has to “pay for water,” reaching a “sound” level of maintenance
                                         will require only a limited price increase (four cases out of five).

                                         The former option of management transfer to WUAs has been abandoned or, rather, reserved
                                         for the southern ORMVAs, where there is a collective management tradition. The idea is to set
                 Project structure




                                         up privately managed companies (IDSPs) receiving a public service delegation, with a choice
                                         of legal statute: either ORMVAs subsidiaries, regional Sociétés d’Economie Mixte (SEMs)
                                         associating public governance and private management, or fully private companies.

                                         Although the existing WUAs will not receive management responsibility, they should be
                                         reactivated as client committees to represent farmers relative to the IDSP in negotiating contract
                                         terms and monitoring service quality.

                                         Risks
                                         The main risks have been identified as follows:

                                            •	 Political risk. There is no major political or country risk, but there are some risks
                                                 connected to agricultural policy (European Union, World Trade Organization) concerning
                                                 the price of irrigated cereals.

                                            •	 Social risk. The present staff of the ORMVAs will be concerned about the reform; their
                                                 reassignment to new functions in the IDSP constitutes a social risk if not dealt with
                                                 carefully.

                                            •	 Revenue risk. This risk is limited to working capital needed to cover the staggered
                                                 collection of water charges. A “good deal” in irrigation consists of accepting a large part
                                                 of the payment after the harvest. Current payment delays, however, often exceed one
                                                 year.

                                            •	 Water supply risk. The water supply risk has been well documented in the basin plans
                                                 (PDAIRE) but it is thought that the Agences Hydrauliques de Bassin will assume the risk if
                                                 it respects the order of priority-assigned competing uses.

                                          •	 Water demand risk. This risk resides in farmers’ ability to progress toward higher-value-

                                              subscriptions as a result of improved efficiency in the distribution networks (water savings).

           Lessons learned




                                       innovative arrangements. It is clearly stated that the private sector’s role is not to finance
                                       rehabilitation or new investments but to introduce sound management practices within a private
                                       accounting framework. There will be no major financial risk on assets and only some risk on
                                       working capital.

                                       If this reform succeeds, the companies involved will have excellent credentials for further
                                       projects, considering that several other governments are also plagued by poor maintenance.
                                       The experience of the French SARs proves that public service delegation in irrigation can be
                                       financially sustainable: faultless service wins clients’ loyalty and allegiance.

                                        Dina Farm, a large irrigated private farm, located a few dozen kilometers outside Cairo on the
                                        highway to Alexandria, was created in 1987 on 600 ha by a local private company. With around
                                        4,400 ha today, it can be considered one of the world’s main case of public-private partnership
                                        (PPP) in agribusiness. The farm is large but not unique in Egypt and the Middle East countries,

                                        where private capital often is invested in farming.

                                        Located in a desert area on the west ridge of the Old Nile Delta, Dina Farm exploits groundwater
                                        from three different aquifers. The farm combines some staple crops (wheat, berseem, alfalfa,
                                        corn) irrigated by center pivots and used mostly in milk-cow breeding, as well as intensive cash
                                        crops (banana, tomato, potato, other vegetables) under drip irrigation. It runs its own staff training
                                        facilities and experimental station (120 ha), and employs 600 individuals, most of whom live on the
                                        farm.

                                        Though an entirely private investment, the first P of the acronym PPP corresponds to a number
                                        of counterparts from the government of Egypt, including a free groundwater supply partly
                                        connected to the Nile River through the Old Nile Delta water table, at an estimated average of
                                        20,000 m3/ha/year (up to 30,000 on drip-irrigated bananas).

                                      the risk of devaluation is low. A black market poses the highest commercial risk.

                                      Water-specific risks are limited at present but rising due to other intensive pumping withdrawals
                                      from the aquifers; Dina Farm has asked for (free) additional water from the Nile River, not trusting
                                      the government-announced groundwater availability of 5 million m3 for the next 50 years.

                                        sure public-interest objectives are fulfilled, but these SARs, which are legally Sociétés Anonymes
                                        (SA, public limited companies), have the same balanced management and cost-effective
                                        imperatives as private enterprises. Having water rights, SARs represent tools for sustainable
                                        development of diversified and intensive agriculture through developing water storage, transfer
                                        and distribution infrastructure.

                                     The Société du Canal de Provence (SCP), one of the three (remaining) SARs, was entrusted
                                     by the French government with a long-term concession contract to implement and manage




                                                                                                                                                    ANNEX 2
                                     multifunctional hydraulic infrastructure in southeastern France. The $2 billion in assets—dams,
                                     canals, tunnels, and networks—allow delivery of water needed for economic development in the
                                     Provence region. The water delivered is split almost evenly among industrial, urban, and irrigation
                                     uses (80,000 ha, 30Mm3).

                                     This case study does not address this model, which is well documented elsewhere. Instead, it
                                     examines why and how irrigation has benefited from the scale economies associated with the
                                     system’s multifunctional nature.

                                     The extent of investment could not be economically justified if it only provided irrigation water to
                                     the currently equipped 80,000 ha.

                                     The impact of demand variations can be cushioned for each separate use according to changing
                                     climatic and economic circumstances. Irrigation also benefits from the high operational quality
                                     necessary for the more demanding industrial and urban uses.
         Project structure (cont.)




                                     Because of the role of agriculture in socioeconomic regional development, the synergy between
                                     the different activity sectors is especially beneficial to farmers.

                                     With less than 65 percent public funding of investments, SCP had to borrow from banks and self-
                                     finance the schemes with water fees.. In 1996, SCP reaches a balance in costs versus income, with
                                     all the income coming from water fees. As the debt commitment declines, SCP is able to use its
                                     water sales revenues for structural renovations according to the age of the installations and clients’
                                     service quality and security needs. Currently, SCP is undertaking huge rehabilitation programs.

                                     Marginal cost pricing for long-term development makes consumers accountable for investment
                                     and operational expenses required to fulfill their specific needs. It provides a fair and objective
                                     basis for setting fees according to the different uses. Farmers get a government-authorized
                                     reduction in their irrigation fees, set at 60 percent by SCP, thus highlighting the synergy between
                                     the different activity sectors in favor of agriculture., farmers pay almost nothing for capital costs,
                                     but they pay their share of current OMM. The other uses pay almost the full cost (including
                                     investment and renewal), which makes the overall balance sustainable.

                                     Risks

                                         •	 Political risk. Will the principle of solidarity between agriculture and other uses be
                                             sustainable in a changing socioeconomic context?

                                         •	 Financial risk. Will shareholders continue to give priority to sustainable development
                                             through a sound policy of maintenance and asset renewal, or will they be tempted to skimp
                                             in order to lower the tariffs or to get their money back quickly?

                                         •	 Water service. All is implemented in the house (design and construction with development
                                             of necessary skills, operation and maintenance, and business development).

                                                equitably to expenses so that all uses are legitimately funded. Yet, almost 50% of the investment
                                                was covered by water fees, the rest was provided by public funding (from Europe, government,
                                                and local authorities) and bank loans. The hydraulic infrastructure has a structural and sustainable

                                                role and therefore warrants investment subsidies. Local governments (SCP shareholders) and the
                                                central government have determined that irrigated agriculture should benefit from other users’
                                                and public bodies’ solidarity, and trigger financial sustainability through multi-use of infrastructure
                                                among agriculture, urban supply and industry. Tariff policy is set individually for every use. Income
                                                from water sales enables SCP to reimburse the self-financed portion of its investments and
                                                cover all operational, maintenance, and renovation expenses without any subsidies. Under these
                                                conditions, system sustainability depends solely upon local economic dynamics and loyalty on the
                                                part of clients who are free to subscribe or unsubscribe at will. Meeting their needs with respect to
                                                performance quality and service cost is therefore vital.

                                                SCP has public shareholding and enjoys a decentralized governance, yet it applies commercial
                                                management with private accountancy and efficiency.

                            In France, irrigators do not benefit from actual water rights on river waters. According to the
                            1992 Water Law, they may be authorized to withdraw a predefined amount of water during the
                            irrigation season. The authorization is theoretically given for only one year, so the government
                            can change the water allocation in case of new demands for agricultural, environmental, or
                            domestic uses. This allocation can also be changed in case of unusual water shortages.

                            In southwestern France, rivers are frequently used to convey water from dams to irrigated
                            areas over a distance of roughly 100 km, with hundreds of irrigators and other users along their
                            courses. Although the 1992 Water Law clarified the issue of water allocation and the role of the
                            government, particularly as regards law enforcement, it soon appeared impossible for the few
                            public officials to manage users’ files and to assess demand and resource balance year after
                            year. The law foresaw a possibility for the government to delegate part of its role but contained
                            no specifics.

                                              this new type of delegation of water allocation. It is a leading private sector company with 50

                                              percent ownership of the public shareholding owned by the local government.47 The main
                                              challenge was to separate clearly the role of the water resource management service provider
                                              (WRMSP, a new kind of IDSP) from the government’s role as regulatory authority.

                                              In addition to the standard functions of OMM for canals and dams, the IDSP takes on the new
                                              function of water allocation, consisting of the following:

                                              Preparing the annual file of authorizations supported by impact analyses establishing the
                                              demand and resource balance. For the Neste system, the file consists of 1,500 registrations,
                                              each listing the geo-referenced withdrawal points, details about the client, and the authorized
                                              water “quota”. Every year 10 percent of the authorizations are subject to modifications.

                                              Monitoring, maintaining, and reading the meters. Each year, 5 percent of the meters are
                                              repaired or changed. Public officials are informed of any illegal withdrawals.

                                              Negotiating with users’ representatives and other stakeholders (the Commission Neste) in case
                       Project structure




                                              of unusual water shortages.

                                              Applying the tier pricing system, with a high deterrent price for any water consumption beyond
                                              the quota.

                                              The government retains its role of giving a comprehensive authorization to the entire file,
                                              controlling how the IDSP ensures resource-and-demand balance and respects the minimum
                                              permissible flow at fixed points along the rivers, and enforcing the law in cases of illegal user
                                              activities.

                                              Risks

                                                  •	 Political risk. Courage is needed to clarify inequitable arrangements. Bureaucratic
                                                      wariness on the part of state officials, fearing loss of some of their power or distrusting the
                                                      private operator, can jeopardize success.

                                                  •	 Financial risk. Although the cost of the water allocation service is not high, it cannot easily
                                                      be broken out and charged separately. This service must be coupled with standard canal
                                                      and dam OMM to be accepted by users in a joint package together with demand and
                                                      resource management service.

                                                                         functions of OMM of dams.


                            The PPP has been successful in the Neste system, with local authorities now trying to apply the
                            same arrangement to other basins. Prerequisites for the successful replication of such a contract
                            include the political courage to clarify water authorizations, and the presence of a service
          Lessons learned




                            provider who can and will assume the water development and management activities and
                            technical construction.

                            Opportunities
                            For the private sector, this service (water allocation) is not a large piece of business, but it
                            gives the IDSP credibility for a larger job: resource management. Sharing river water between
                            irrigation and environmental uses is a recurrent problem in France, even when releases from
                            dams can increase low flows during the irrigation season. All stakeholders are interested in
                            innovative solutions. Water markets are not a feasible solution. Instead, the water allocation
                            service has been identified, and this function has been successfully delegated to a professional
                            provider in the Neste system.

                                         and interstate water trading. In this framework, different water management entities are in
                                         charge of water services. In Victoria, for instance, a “corporative” state-owned authority, the
                                         Goulburn-Murray Water Authority (GMWA), was created in 1994 to provide services in irrigation
                                         districts (900,000 ha agricultural area), as well as bulk water supply and diversions licensing. The
                                         asset value is worth AU$3,000 million ($2,250 million). Of this value, district services represent
                                         AU$1,500 million. The turnover is about AU$30 million ($22.5 million). The annual diversions
                                         approximate 3.5 billion m3.

                                        The $2.1 billion Goulburn-Murray Water Connections Project aims to provide the Goulburn
                                        Murray Irrigation District with a more efficient irrigation delivery system. The project has been
                                        implemented in two stages, with the objective of achieving water savings of 225 gigaliters in
                                        Stage 1 and 204 gigaliters in Stage 2.

                                        The state-owned enterprise for irrigation modernisation in Northern Victoria, trading as
                                        Northern Victorian Irrigation Renewal Project (NVIRP), was initially established in 2007 to plan,
                                        design and deliver the project. However, following a restructuring, Goulburn-Murray Water
                                        (G-MW) has been responsible for the governance of the project since July 2012. Since June 20

                               average 55 billion m3 and Sudan gets 35 billion m3. This does not seem to raise important
                               problems between the two countries, because Sudan’s irrigation development remains low
                               and its annual water requirements are far less than 35 billion m3 a year. But other countries
                               within the Nile watershed, such as Ethiopia, are excluded from the sharing agreement and
                               seek renegotiation, arguing that more than 80 percent of the resources come from rainfall
                               inside Ethiopia. The problem, at the moment, is not acute because the other countries’
                               requirements are low and have so far been met.

                               Inside Egypt, water requirements are high. They consist of water for irrigation, industries,
                               domestic use, hydropower, and navigation. Egypt’s water consumption is not monitored
                               internationally, but it seems that more than the agreed allocation of 55 billion of m3 is being
                               used. In addition, at full development, the Toshka project will require a significant part of the
                               Egyptian allocation (at least 10 percent).

                                                        right conditions for the highest possible hydraulic yield of water use. Some technical principles

                                                        water operation in conveyance works; concrete-lined canals for transportation and distribution
                                                        (or distribution under pressure in some cases); drip irrigation or central pivot irrigation (surface
                                                        irrigation prohibited); reuse of drainage water; and control, monitoring, and measurement of
                                                        discharges and volumes supplied. Unit consumption restrictions are supposed to set the water
                                                        allocation lower than the annual evaporation rate, consequently demanding a real water-saving
                                                        effort from future irrigators.

                                                        In addition to the Mubarak Pumping Station, the Toshka Project also involves the construction
                                                        of 50km of main transfer canal (Sheik Zayed Canal), four additional 22km side branches and
                                                        800m of feeder pipeline, at a final anticipated cost of around $70 billion. The project aims to
                                                        double the region’s arable land, develop and extend agricultural production and create new
                                                        jobs and population centres away from the confines of the Nile Valley.

                                                        The project is sponsored by the Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) in Egypt.
                                                        Design of the Mubarak Pumping Station was completed by a JV between Hamza Associates
                                                        and Lahmeyer, while the construction consortium partners were Arabian International, Skanska
                                                        and Hitachi. A strategic partnership between KADCO and Sun World form the project

                                                        The I&D functions are divided as follows:

                                                            •	 Investment and Financing via the government budget.

                                                            •	 Design and construction. The Ministry of Water Resources and Irrigation (MWRI) (one
                                                               department for the pumping station, another department for the conveyance works).

                                                            •	 Water allocation. Nearly all the water will be devoted to irrigation. The requirements
                                                               for domestic uses are low. At full development, an estimated 400,000 people will settle
                                                               in the area. Requirements for industrial uses have not yet been considered, but no one
                                                               can imagine that they will compete with irrigation requirements, no matter what type of
                                                               agribusinesses settle in. The MWRI will be in charge of transportation and allocation of
                                                               water at the head of the distribution works.

                                                            •	 Water monitoring (allocation control). MWRI will be responsible for water control at
                                                               the head of the distribution system. Who will be in charge of water control within the
                                                               distribution system has not yet been decided. Two main options are being considered:
                                                               either a water user association (WUA) or a WUA federation, or a company that will
                                                               collect water distribution fees and pay for operation, maintenance, and management of
                                                               the distribution system.

                                               a federation of WUAs, or a specific company. MWRI is supposed to be in charge of
                                               maintenance works control.

                                          •	 Actual maintenance and operation. MWRI is responsible for O&M of the production and
                                               transportation works.

                                          •	 Agricultural production (water value optimization). There is no planned control of water
                                               use. The government deals mainly with limitations on the annual water use volume, but
                                               not by use, as long as water for agricultural use is clean and the wastewater is disposed
                                               of outside the Nile River Basin. The private sector is expected to be attracted by the
                                               project and would be able to get the optimized water benefit within the restricted water
                                               consumption standard.

                                          •	 Among commercial risks, construction is satisfactory, and time schedules are respected,
                                               but prices are increasing rapidly. In operations, there is little experience operating a
                                               main canal and no experience recovering charges. On the upside, new management
                                               technologies are being developed (for example, remote control, SCADA).

                                          •	 Water-specific risks. Water resources are plentiful, but in case of successive dry
                                               years restrictions will be applied, posing possibly drastic water supply risk after full
                                               development but not in the development phase. Because no farmer but KADCO has
                                               settled down in the area, the water demand is zero.

                                                      high-unit consumption. However, these prices do not appear to adequately cover the cost of

                        Financial arrangements



                                                      As regards the pumping and conveyance infrastructure, the government does not seem able
                                                      to take care of most expenses sustainably. Water fees collected by the Ministry for abstraction
                                                      and conveyance of water barely cover the pumping costs. Some budgeting problems may
                                                      therefore crop up over the long term.

                                                      As for the distribution system, the fees to be collected are not known yet, but they should
                                                      in principle cover all the investments when the private sector (KADCO) takes over the
                                                      distribution system and a fraction (to be determined) of the investments in case of a delegated
                                                      management arrangement. In this case, the system should become sustainable under the
                                                      responsibility of the private partners, investors, or delegated management.

                                                      An investor for the first 25 percent of the area was found reasonably quickly, demonstrating
                                                      interest in the project.




                                                      There have been some suggestions that the project was too political, and that not all technical
                                                      considerations had been taken into account prior to commencement of implementation, with
                        Lessons learned




                                                      a lack of overall transparency about the project. These together have led some to suggest that

                              In Morocco, major irrigation schemes are managed by public irrigation agencies (Offices
                              Régionaux de Mise en Valeur Agricole, ORMVAs). For 10 years, the government has been driving
                              a reform with the World Bank’s support to restore financial sustainability. Another way is also
                              being explored: attracting the private sector in financing, implementing, and managing new
                              investments. Vast areas have already been equipped but, because of water scarcity, few new
          Project structure




                              irrigation investments are in the pipeline. Its main characteristics are as follows:

                                    	 total of 600 farmers grow irrigated high-value crops and have well-organized marketing

                                    arrangements, but their water resource is a fast-declining aquifer also used for municipal
                                    purposes. The technical-best solution is a 70 km–long pipe transferring 45 million m3 from
                                    the Chakoukane Dam to a gravity-pressurized network of 10,000 irrigated ha at Guerdane.

                                 •	 The I&D service provider (IDSP) is asked to finance an investment estimated at $80
                                    million, including $40 million in government funds, to design and construct the project
                                    on the basis of farmers’ subscriptions, and to provide water service for 30 years. This is a
                                    concession contract, which includes all the transferable functions. The winning bid will be
                                    the one proposing the lowest water price for the farmer.

                                                       price is acceptable to the farmers relative to the obtained water value but is much higher

                                                Before the last call for tenders, other solutions had been attempted for five years on
                                                approximately the same technical basis. A first project was supported by Agence Française
                                                de Développement (AFD) through water user associations, more in line with management
                                                transfer than public-private partnership (PPP). The project failed because of insufficient
                                                farmer subscription (between 50 percent and 70 percent), probably due to the heavy financial
                                                engagement required from farmers and their agricultural bank (Crédit Agricole du Maroc) at the
                                                beginning of the process. A second project, a concession, was proposed by the Suez Group.
                                                It’s more attractive conditions elicited a higher level of subscriptions, but the process was
                                                interrupted by the IFC tender.

                                                Roles and responsibilities
                                                All three parties will share the risk of a water shortage, allocated as follows:

                                                    •	 The concessionaire may have up to a 15 percent consequential loss in revenue;

                                                    •	 The farmers face a tariff surcharge during drought-induced shortages, which may be up to
                                                       10 percent of the irrigation tariff; and

                                                    •	 The government will financially compensate the private operator in the event of serious
                                                       water shortage (which would otherwise result in more than 15 percent loss in revenue).

                                                also responsible for compensating the private operator if water shortages cause more than a 15
                                                percent loss of revenue.

                                                Private operator – the two main obligations of the private operator are:

                                                    •	 Financing 50 percent of the costs for the investment, design, and construction of the
                                                       irrigation of 10,000 hectares, which includes construction of a 90km pipe and a 300km
                                                       distribution network to transport the water, and a distribution system to deliver it to
                                                       farmers based on the size of their citrus groves; and

                                                    •	 30 years of operation and management of the irrigation system, and all related costs
                                                       which will be reimbursed through irrigation tariffs paid by the farmers.

                                                The obligation to commence construction was delayed until enough farmers had subscribed
                                                (and paid the initial fee) to cover 80 percent of the water supply expected through the scheme.

                                                Commercial farmers. Farmers paid an initial fee (subscription charge) to cover the average
                                                cost of an on-farm connection to the irrigation scheme, which mitigated the risk to the private
                                                operator. This cost is set at approximately €1600 for each of the 10,000 hectares.

                                              risk either in agricultural policy (European Union, World Trade Organization) because
                                              production is limited to cash crops. A minor political risk could lie in the public officials’
                                              aversion to change regarding the IDSP, having to switch from a bureaucracy to a customer-
                                              oriented relationship.

                                         •	 Financial risk. Taking into account the big capital investment usually needed in irrigation
                                              projects, particularly in the Guerdane project, this is the major risk. Roughly two-thirds of
                                              the water price would be devoted to covering the capital cost. It must be kept in mind
                                              that the financial risk would generate a supplemental cost to the farmer because the
                                              private cost of capital will be higher than the public one.

                                         •	 Water supply risk. As well documented in this project, the water risk consists first of the
                                              insufficient filling up of the Chakoukane/Aoulouz reservoirs, a risk partly covered by the
                                              government. The second water supply risk comes from water allocation between uses; but
                                              the government is clearly committed to respecting the order of priority between uses.

                                         •	 Water demand risk. Demand risk does not consist of a breakdown of the agriculture
                                              economic model. But another risk for the future is permanent competition between the
                                              project surface water (price) and groundwater (pumping cost) if the Water Law is not
                                              properly enforced. If the evolution of the aquifer is not as bad as foreseen, quality of
                                              service will enable the IDSP to meet that competition.

                                                   prime importance for future projects, considering that several other governments are in a similar
                                                   context of demand for irrigation investment and public budget constraints. The rate of return
                                                   on capital will probably be less attractive than in the telecom sector, but the experience of the

2. O&M Contracts

This section presents 10 case studies of a PPP scheme type in which the private sector performs functions




                                                                                                                                   ANNEX 2
related to the operation and management of an irrigation scheme.

An operation and maintenance (O&M) contract is an agreement between the project company and the
operator. The project company delegates the operation, maintenance and often performance management of
the project to a reputable operator with expertise in the industry under the terms of the O&M agreement. The
main common features are that the awarding authority engages the contractor to manage a range of activities
for a relatively short time period (2 to 5 years).

The simplest O&M contract involves the private operator being paid a fixed fee by the awarding authority for
performing specific tasks - the remuneration does not depend on collection of tariffs and the private operator
does not typically take on the risk of asset condition. Where the contracts become more performance-based,
they may involve the operator taking on more risk, even risk of asset condition and replacement of more minor
components and equipment.

Table A2.15 provides a list of the case studies presented in this section and schemes’ pertinent details. The
section contains new case studies (Megech-Seraba, Ethiopia) and cases studies produced in the World Bank
2007 case study report.

                                     land in the area of the Megech project is irrigated.

                                     The project will involve two contracts:

                                     •	 Construction, and
                                     •	 Management, including supervision of the first contract and Operation and Management
                                        functions—an $8 million, eight-year contract was signed between the government of

                                     Government of Ethiopia. The government will finance the project with a World Bank
                                     concessionary loan. This includes procuring infrastructure and related equipment required for
                                     the irrigation from the pumping station at Lake Tana to bring the water to field level. There will
                                     be approximately 1,000km of channels.

                                     The government will also set up a trust account which will receive subsidies and other
              Project structure




                                     payments under the PPP contract. This trust account will be managed by a private financial
                                     institution such that it is isolated from government interference. The private operator therefore
                                     understands that the payments which are owed to it from the government are, and will
                                     continue to be, available.

                                     Amhara Bureau of Water Resources. The regional branch of the Ministry of Water Resources
                                     will be responsible for providing support to the farmers in completing the irrigation structure
                                     with implementing the irrigation works at the ground level.

                                     Water User Association. A regulation was passed in 2010 to recognize WUAs. Their primary
                                     responsibilities include coordination among users and maintenance of tertiary water channels.
                                     The users will be responsible for the actual cost of water, which will include the energy costs of
                                     pumping water from the lake. The government will be responsible for user fee collection.

                                     After eight years, the O&M responsibilities will be undertaken by a public entity trained by the
                                     PPP contractor.

                                                       The need for this project to become a PPP was made clear through a PPIAF survey67 which
                                                       found that the farmers’ willingness to pay was too low to cover the estimated operating and
                                                       maintenance costs of the systems. The private operator in the project would therefore need to
                                                       be partially subsidised by the government.

                                                       To provide for the average willingness-to-pay of about Br 300, the subsidy required has a
                                                       present total value of Br 220 million (about $11 million). Four percent of this is for O&M, with
                                                       the rest as a capex subsidy. This is in line with the O&M costs of Br 1,157/ha/year compared to
                                                       the capital costs of Br 213 million.

                                                       Tariff payable by farmers
                                                       It was recommended that the tariff start at the willingness to pay of approximately $15/ha/year
                                                       (Br 310), just 15 percent of the $100/ha/year (Br 2,000) cost paid by others on similar schemes
                                                       in Ethiopia. The tariff will increase towards $100/ha/year over a seven-year transition period,
                                                       with larger increases towards the end of the period allowing smaller increases nearer the start
                                                       to account for the non-linear increase in farmers’ incomes. It is expected that, as farmers begin
                                                       to see the benefits of irrigation, their willingness-to-pay will increase. This is supported by the
                                                       results of the survey of farmers in Megech who do and do not have irrigation, displayed in
                                                       the figure above, where farmers who already use irrigation had an average willingness-to-pay
                                                       much higher than those without irrigation, of Br 495 compared to Br 310.

                                               •	 Staffing and labor;
                                               •	 Administration and finance (User and WUA registration; billing and collection of fees);
                                               •	 Capacity building and customer service (demonstration plot, establishment of IWUAs, long
                                                  term O&M entity);
                                               •	 Operation (irrigation service delivery, efficiency); and
                                               •	 Maintenance (irrigation and drainage service disruptions, access roads).




                                               The difference between the willingness-to-pay of those farmers with and without irrigation
                                               schemes already in place provides valuable information which allows a more effective tariff
                                               path to be chosen, to the benefit of both the farmers and the investors.

                                               This project thus provides an interesting example of an approach to developing the farmers’
                                               willingness and ability to pay for an irrigation scheme to a point at which it can potentially
              Lessons learned




                                               cover the O&M costs and enable some recovery of the up-front development costs.

                                               While the civil works and operation & maintenance contracts are separate, the O&M contract
                                               commences at the design phase itself. The O&M contractor reviews designs, supervises the
                                               construction and then operates and maintains the scheme. Meanwhile, the O&M contractor
                                               will be building capacity and training the local water users associations (WUAs) to take over
                                               the scheme once its contract ends. By having an enhanced O&M contract, the project not
                                               only brings elements from a traditional BOT type of concession, it also brings sustainability by
                                               preparing the actual users to operate and maintain the scheme properly.

                              In 1999/2000, the French Aid Agency, AFD, financed a study to determine the maintenance
                              needs of the 40,000 ha of the Senegal River left-bank irrigation schemes and the response




                                                                                                                                           ANNEX 2
                              the various stakeholders were ready to give. The study’s client was Société d’Aménagement
                              pour l’Aménagement et l’Exploitation des Terres du Delta et du Fleuve du Sénégal (SAED, the
                              governmental local development operator). The study was conducted by BRL (a French SAR,
                              Société d’Aménagement Régional), with CACG (another French SAR) as SAED’s consulting
                              engineer.

                              The most significant features of irrigation on the left bank of the Senegal River Valley, as outlined
                              in the 1989 CACG-Euroconsult-Gibb Master Plan, are as follows. The left-bank potential for
                              sustainable irrigation is about 90,000 ha, taking into account the competing needs of the
                              Manantali hydropower plant and the annual artificial flooding required for environmental
                              preservation. As of the year 2000, roughly 90 percent of that potential had theoretically been
                              implemented, but more than half was out of order and out of production. It had been developed
                              in a rudimentary way, either by companies seeking short-term profit or by unorganized
                              villagers. As a result, the real irrigable area was estimated at only 40,000 ha. Of this area, about
                              three-fourths (30,000 ha) consist of some 40 large-scale, publicly funded schemes, originally
                              managed by SAED but now transferred to WUAs (locally known as GIEs [Groupements d’Intérêt
          Project structure




                              Economique], federated into Unions de GIE). The remaining 10,000 ha consist of well-run, small-
                              scale, private, or village irrigation schemes.

                              All 40,000 ha are gravity irrigated, making use of large diversion feeder canals (adducteurs) and
                              large drainage outlet channels (émissaires). All canals and drains (aménagements structurants) are
                              still under SAED management and (government) funding. Pumping stations withdraw water from
                              the feeder canals into the irrigation networks.

                              The valley cropping pattern has slowly but gradually evolved from single cropping (paddy rice)
                              to a much more diversified type, including tomatoes, onions, groundnuts, sweet potatoes, and
                              maize. For the first time, in 2000, these new crops represented just over half the cropped area.
                              Cropping intensity has, however, remained disappointingly low, some years barely reaching the
                              100 percent mark.

                              Since the management transfer, WUAs have been charging O&M services at 60,000 CFA per
                              hectare (about $100), roughly broken down into: a third for pumping costs, a third for regular
                              upkeep, and a third for heavy maintenance as a set-aside in DAT investment accounts (Dépôts à
                              Terme are investment accounts with the Crédit Agricole du Sénégal), but these funds were often
                              used for purposes other than those planned.

                              In terms of maintenance, SAED was engaged on two fronts: maintaining feeder canals and drains
                              with unpredictable government funding and helping the water user associations (WUAs) maintain
                              the pumping stations and irrigation schemes. For that purpose, an independent department had
                              been created in 1998 within SAED, the Division Autonome de Maintenance (DAM), which could
                              act as the government’s maintenance team on feeder canals and drains and as maintenance
                              service provider to WUAs through private contracting and billing.

                                                       has been set up. The total cost of this heavy maintenance is estimated at $1.1 million a
                                                       year for the 40,000 irrigated ha ($27.50/ha). Farmers have agreed to pay between $15/ha/
                                                       year and $25/ha/year, depending on the type and quality of the services provided. The
                                                       government is to top off the fund in proportion to the charges recovered. Seven mixed-
                                                       management committees (representing government and WUAs) will control the funds and

                                                       a federation of GIEs under governmental supervision (limited to veto right). This fund will

                                               Risks
                                               Among country risks, the political risk and the risk of devaluation are low. The main risk lies in
                                               the nearly total lack of protection for domestic rice against the opening up of the Senegal urban
                                               market to cheap rice imports from Asia.

                                                   •	 Commercial risks. Farmers’ insolvency, linked to rice import risk, is considered moderate.

                                                   •	 Recovery risk. The WUAs will collect maintenance charges, so recovery risk is considered low.

                                                   •	 Water-specific risks. Because no other water resource is available in the valley, the water
                                                       demand risk is nil. The water supply risk is considered low, because OMVS (the three-
                                                       country Senegal water authority) is supposed to take into account all water needs in a
                                                       balanced way.

                                   Funding has been slow to materialise, even though the study and decision-making processes
                                   were highly participative.




                                                                                                                                          ANNEX 2
                                   The greater part of both funds will come from farmers’ contributions, which go some way toward
                                   fulfilling the “water must pay for water” goal.
          Financial arrangements




                                   The government—through SAED—will still keep an eye on both funds; however, this is an
                                   arrangement farmers consider financially safe and technically sound.

                                   No contribution is expected from third parties—for example, rice mills—which is somewhat
                                   disappointing.

        learned




                                   maintenance charges, seems promising. Second, the government’s veto right on the FOMER
                                   maintains public (SAED) supervision and control over the maintenance of transferred irrigation
                                   schemes.

                                Malagasy farmers know Lake Alaotra as the country’s “rice granary.” Sheltered in a natural
                                volcanic depression 200 km north of Antananarivo are 100,000 irrigated ha, which until 1990 were




                                                                                                                                                        ANNEX 2
                                under the overall command of a government operator, SOMALAC (Société de Mise en valeur
                                Agricole du LAC Alaotra). When the government closed down SOMALAC, farmers were hastily
                                organized into compulsory WUAs (known as AURs, for Association d’Usagers des Réseaux) and
                                left to their own devices.

                                The 4,000 ha of the AURs known as “the southeast valleys” (Marianina and PC15) organized
                                themselves into a federation (FAUR) (With the help of French aid from AFD and an AFD-
                                contracted, private irrigation service provider, BRL Madagascar) with promising results in terms
                                of irrigation management and cost recovery. Each AUR sets water charges yearly for “secondary
                                and tertiary” O&M expenditures and makes contributions to the federation’s “primary” O&M
                                expenditures (dam, major canals, and tracks). The cost-recovery rate is high (80-85 percent).

                                There are, however, two major shortcomings. Farmers’ actual weight in the decision-making
                                process was limited in comparison with the private service provider’s, especially because BRL
                                Madagascar was directly contracted and financed by AFD. Water charges were also low in
            Project structure




                                relation to gross output (1 percent compared with 8 percent in the Senegal Valley) and covered
                                only day-to-day operation and (light) upkeep of the irrigation schemes.

                                The situation deteriorated after 1994, when all foreign aid–supported projects were abruptly
                                terminated due to Madagascar’s political line and financial insolvency. Six years later, after
                                the country’s comeback, AFD decided to give it a second chance. A “project revival” study,
                                conducted by CACG in 2000, led to a series of proposals that are being put into practice. The
                                PPP involves an OMM service contract with fees charged to local clients. In this case, the service
                                provider is a sub-contractor, the local branch of the int. company BRL Madagascar. The client is
                                the private IDSP and WUA70 71

                                Risks
                                In light of the past 20 years of Madagascar’s history, country risks loom large. Political risk is
                                considered high to medium. A continuous, double-digit annual inflation is causing regular
                                depreciations in the FMG. Moreover, the opening of the domestic rice import market is pulling
                                down the rice price (no tariff protection for local rice).

                                Commercial risk. The production risk, and farmers’ risk of insolvency, is shared to some extent
                                between farmers and the I&D service provider.

                                Recovery risk. The cost-recovery risk depends on the government’s authority in enforcing the law.

                                Water-specific risks. Because there is no alternative water resource, the water demand risk is nil.
                                On the supply side, the control dam (Bevava) has been regularly silting up for years, depleting
                                reservoir capacity.

                   Lessons learned




                                                 All irrigation functions are covered by actual negotiated, binding contracts. Among these
                                                 contractual links, the most significant is the (proposed) direct link between rice yields and water
                                                 charges.

                                                 The rice mills’ participation in the maintenance fund, if confirmed (so far, it is just willingness),
                                                 would constitute a real breakthrough in the PPP sphere.

World Bank Group | PPIAF | How to Achieve Sustainability in Irrigation with Private Sector Participation 	                                                   213
                                             On the small (27 ha) village scheme of Nakhlet, Mauritania, operated by the village Coopérative
                                             (local village-based WUA), PSI-CORAF has proposed and tested a package of assistance and
                                             advice to farmers on water management and agriculture.

                                             The monitoring, conducted in a series of agricultural campaigns, provided an overall diagnosis
ANNEX 2


                                             of the scheme. It included a technical design assessment (canals recalibration, improved engine/
                                             pump adaptation), as well as a management assessment (establishing irrigation frequency/crop
                                             yield relationships, proposal for enhanced water turnout and monitoring tools).

                                             Results were shown to farmers and discussed with them, using a geographical information system
                                             (GIS) to improve the representation and understanding of critical issues. This support action
                                             resulted in technical and organizational changes and in a 50 percent increase in crop yield. It
                                             was proposed that this type of assistance and advice on design and O&M be later provided by a
                                             private I&D service provider. The cropping season is financed using working capital.75

                                             The project pumps water from a tributary of the Senegal River, with the government agency
                                             handing over management control of the irrigation assets to a farmers cooperative (WUA).76 The
                                             WUA is also responsible for raising credit to lend to farmers, and managing water pumping, input

                                             supply (herbicides, fertilizers, fuel etc.) and land preparation.77

                                             Risks
                                             The main risk identified is the financial sustainability of this service provider, because of the small
                                             size of the scheme. Private activity in this context is affordable and viable only if it can broaden its
                                             intervention to include several schemes.

                                     The public service delegation in Nakhlet should be replicable on comparable rice-cropping,
                                     small-scale schemes in West Africa, limited to assistance and advice on design, O&M, or both.

                                     Local private entrepreneurs seem to be willing to take up the challenge, as long as they can
                                     operate in enough small village schemes to make the venture viable.

                                     The high IRR of the project indicates that involving a third party in irrigation service provision can
                                     contribute to reducing costs for farmers, improving credit terms and enhancing the quality and
                                     responsiveness of irrigation O&M. Commercial risks such as those stemming from a poor harvest

                                     one year, may also be reduced as for instance, the risks of servicing the credit is cushioned to
                                     some extent by the WUA, rather than falling entirely on the farmer as before. Financial pressures
                                     are also reduced as short-term credit and inputs are more favorable, given the collective strength
                                     of the WUA.

                                     Other advantages include the fact that financing is on a seasonal basis and limited to supporting
                                     only O&M, thereby reducing a key risk associated with non-recourse PPPs, whereby predictions in
                                     growth use are not realized.

                                     In general though, as the model is centered on farmer involvement in public service delegation,
                                     key constraints are inexperience, member disputes, high administrative costs and inefficiency. As
                                     such, there is scope to focus on enhancing the professionalism of the third party.

                                              Irrigated agriculture in Brazil’s northeast expanded rapidly from the 1950s to the 1980s, financed
                                              and managed by the government through national and provincial agencies of the Codevasf.
ANNEX 2


                                              The government also ran settlement programs for small family plots of 3 to 8 ha within larger
                                              schemes. When the debt crisis struck, the Brazilian government, under high financial pressure,
                                              decided to transfer irrigation management to local water service providers and promote access
                                              to the irrigated land for agricultural companies (from the south of Brazil) and foreign companies.

                                              Water service management was initially transferred (1980-89) to already existing cooperatives,
                                              which were also in charge of marketing agricultural output. In most collective irrigation systems
                                              of the region, the transfer process is still going on, with co-management between the local water
                                              service providers and the government, represented at the provincial level by the Codevasf.

                                              In 1989, to improve financial sustainability and management transparency of the irrigation
                                              systems, irrigation districts were created by government agencies and given the specific function
                                              of providing water service. They are nonprofit civil associations, often with privileges and
                                              immunities not available to other private sector organizations. The public service demand came
                                              from the government, which wanted to reduce its financial support to irrigation. The offer was
                       Project structure




                                              represented by independent local providers that could be hired to work for the irrigation district
                                              (district manager, water bailiffs, and maintenance technicians) or by local companies to provide
                                              specific and single rehabilitation and modernization work.

                                              This is the case of the Maniçoba irrigation system, located in the Petrolina-Juazeiro irrigation
                                              pole (São Francisco River, Bahia and Pernambuco provinces). The system is still co-managed
                                              by the Codevasf for rehabilitation and modernization of the systems and other administrative
                                              functions linked to, for example, land tenure, and by the irrigation district for administrative,
                                              technical, and financial aspects of scheme operation and maintenance (O&M).

                                              The district operation (fee reviews, O&M choices) are controlled and approved by an
                                              administrative council consisting of the district manager (usually an outside professional), users’
                                              representatives, and a representative from the Codevasf. A fiscal council, including users’
                                              representatives, audits the district’s books.

                                              Risks
                                              The uncertain political and economic environment may affect payment behavior (following
                                              Coface79 classification). The overall country risks are rated “B.”

                                                  •	 Commercial risks. The risk of farmers’ insolvency is considered low.

                                                  •	 Recovery risk. This risk is also low, because sanctions are applied for defaulting on
                                                      payment.

                                        •	 Financial risk. In 2001 the analysis carried out showed that funds supposed to finance
                                           rehabilitation of modernization were partly used for O&M in 1995-2001. This was due

                                           in part to financial management problems: opacity leading to difficulties negotiating
                                           price increases and accounting problems linked to the disequilibrium between the two
                                           parts of the K2 fee. A high volumetric part was more easily accepted by users and hence
                                           more easily negotiated. However, K2 also covered fixed costs, which created accounting
                                           problems during the rainy season and in especially wet years. The evolution of the K2
                                           observed in November 2001, after negotiations among the district, users’ representatives,
                                           and the Codevasf, reflects determination to balancing the district’s budget.

                                        •	 The main risk is related to the lack of clear separation of the financing mechanisms
                                           linked to K1 and K2, leading to lack of transparency—limiting users’ willingness and
                                           compromising the district’s financial sustainability. This risk would increase if public funds
                                           allocated to the irrigation sector and used for modernization and rehabilitation were
                                           further reduced.

                                        •	 Water-specific risks. Water-demand risk is low, because humid years that significantly

                                           curtail water demand are rare (decennial rainfall). The water supply risk is also low and
                                           was affected recently only during the exceptional drought of 2001, during which limits
                                           were put on water withdrawal linked mainly to electricity quotas. Before 2001, there was
                                           neither “physical” nor “economic” scarcity—the river always provides enough water, and
                                           infrastructure development responds to demand. Water demand is generally well taken
                                           into account for service delivery (reliable, flexible).

                                             responsible for the infrastructure and renewal and collects the K1 fee for this purpose. The

                                             The K1 fee, according to the national irrigation law, is supposed to pay for investment
                                             depreciation, even if the investment is related to public infrastructures that will remain public
                                             after management transfer. In theory, the benefits from the K1 could be paid back into irrigation
                                             through rehabilitation and modernization. However, K1 income is insufficient for such financing
                                             and must always be combined with public funds. The K1 fee has a monomial structure, and its
                                             value is $26.72/ha/year.

                                             The K2 fee has a binomial structure. The constant part of the fee ($/ha) covers OMM fixed costs
                                             (for example, salaries), and the volumetric part ($/m3) covers variable costs directly linked to
                                             water distribution (for example, electricity). The resulting K2 value was as follows:

                                                    average price of $0.011/m3/year

                                                 •	 November 2001. $0.0036/m3 + $7.51/ha/month, which corresponds to an average price of
                                                    $0.012/m3/year

                                             The resulting total price paid on average by farmers was $0.014/m3/year before November 2001
                                             and $0.015/m3/year after the November 2001 changes.

                                             area (such as Mandacaru, where the cooperative plays the role of water service provider)—show
                                             interest in and opportunities for separating water service from other functions (for example,
                                             production commercialization) to improve financial sustainability.

                                             Although the definition of the K1 fee remains unclear, the district’s tasks are relatively clear,
                                             which makes the definition of O&M costs easier—a first step toward more transparent and
                                             sustainable management. The evolution of the K2 fee observed in November 2001—after
                                             negotiations among the district, users’ representatives, and the Codevasf—shows willingness to
                                             improve the district’s budget balance. Heterogeneity of demand between users is also receiving
                                             consideration, with discussions about the possibility of optional pricing.

                                      In Niger, water management public service delegation (PSD) was initiated by PGI on two rice-
                                      growing schemes: Toula (350 ha) and Koutoukalé. The objective was to test an innovative way
ANNEX 2


                                      of improving hydraulic management. This was made possible by establishing a contractual
                                      relationship between the irrigation coopérative (a local water user association, WUA) and a service
                                      provider for water service, operation and maintenance (O&M), and financial management. The
                                      first step was to test both private and public I&D service providers (IDSPs). After evaluation, it was
                                      decided to conduct the pilot phase with the private one only (called SENAGRHY). Up to now, a
                                      contract has been in effect between the IDSP and the Rice Office of PGI—which has decided to
                                      second the function and act as a governmental agency—and not the coopérative. The coopérative
                                      has in turn signed a memorandum of agreement with the Rice Office, which shares responsibilities
                                      between the coopérative and the IDSP.

                                      On the Toula scheme, PSD was introduced after physical rehabilitation and organizational and
                                      financial modernization. Rehabilitation created an environment that facilitated PSD: appropriate
                                      infrastructure and institutional and financial stabilization of the WUA. However, rehabilitation does
                                      not seem to be a necessary condition for PSD, which aims to avoid the total degradation of the
                                      irrigation scheme through sustainable use and infrastructure maintenance. In Koutoukalé, a similar
                                      test is being conducted on an un-rehabilitated scheme. What is needed, though, is support from
                 Project structure




                                      the Coopérative and of its members.

                                      A water management committee was set up, chaired by the water manager (Responsable
                                      Gestion de l’Eau [RGE], a staff member of the IDSP). This committee is accountable to the general
                                      assembly of the coopérative. The water manager is in charge of the administrative, technical, and
                                      financial aspects of the scheme operation, while the coopérative provides him with material and
                                      staff support. Equity is overseen both by the coopérative and the water manager, which together
                                      define rules and penalties related to water distribution. Beyond this pilot operation, if successful,
                                      the present arrangement is expected to evolve into a contract linking the IDSP directly with the
                                      coopérative.

                                      As seen in the table below, power consumption for pumping is 70 percent higher in Lata than in
                                      Toula, where water management has been delegated to a private water manager. Other factors
                                      contribute to this difference, but most of it results from better hydraulic management.

                                     The main risk is the financial sustainability of this IDSP. The resulting cost equals the pre-PSD water

                                     service costs—that is, doubles the total water service cost. The resulting lowering of pumping
                                     costs (as compared to a neighboring scheme) hardly makes up for this increase.

                                      Since the early 1990s, Albania has undergone deep structural reforms, including the creation of
                                      a multiparty system and a market economy. So far, however, the country has remained import
                                      dependent, and it is running a trade deficit.

                                      Agriculture is the mainstay of the country’s economy (between 50 percent and 55 percent of gross
                                      domestic product [GDP] in 1999 and 2000, respectively, compared with 15 percent for industry
                                      and 11 percent for construction). In 1991, Albania began land reform in an effort to revitalize its
                 Project structure




                                      agriculture. Land, which in the past had been worked collectively, was allocated in equal amounts
                                      to villagers in rural areas.

                                      Between 1994 and 1999, a first rehabilitation program (IRP-I), supported by the World Bank and
                                      other financial agencies (Netherlands, Italy, the OPEC Fund, and the Kuwait Fund), led to the
                                      rehabilitation of a few thousand ha of irrigable land out of the 400,000 ha in the country. At the
                                      same time, a start was made on transferring distribution network operation (secondary canals) by
                                      creating approximately 200 water user associations (WUAs). The institution that implements this
                                      program, called the Project Management Unit (PMU), was created in 1992 as part of the Albanian
                                      Ministry of Agriculture and Food and supported by the World Bank.

                                      During this period, the difficulties encountered by the government operator (Water Enterprise, WE)
                                      responsible for managing the conveyors (main canals) led the Albanian authorities to recommend
                                      the transfer of these facilities and their operation to federations of WUAs. Since 1998, 12 FWUAs
                                      were thus created on the first rehabilitation project (IRP-I) command areas, and 12 more are
                                      planned in the second project area (IRP-II), on which work began in 2000.

                                     This is the case of the Pequin Kavaje irrigation system (command area: 10,000 ha), located 50
                                     kilometers south of Tirana and managed by one FWUA. The federation of Pequin Kavaje, formed




                                                                                                                                                          ANNEX 2
                                     in 1998, comprises 12 WUAs. Two of them, located upstream in the Pequin district, use pumping
                                     stations; the other 10, located in the Kavaje district, use a mixed system (gravity and pumping). The
                                     Pequin Kavaje main canal is a water conveyance, storage, and supply structure. It is supplied by an
                                     intake structure in the Shkumbinit River.

                                     Supported by the PMU, each winter the federation of Pequin Kavaje prepares a plan for the next
                                     irrigation season, with impact analyses demonstrating the demand-resource balance—that is,
                                     approximately 200 records for each irrigation season. Other federation functions are monitoring
                                     and maintaining the hydraulic infrastructures; operating the main canal to supply water to the
                                     WUAs; negotiating with the WUAs in case of exceptional water scarcity; and collecting fees from
                                     farmers.

                                     Risks
                                     Two risks are identified:
         Project structure (cont.)




                                        •	 Political risk. Courage is needed to rectify inequitable arrangements and to involve state
                                             officials in moving away from bureaucratic procedures.

                                        •	 Financial risk. Although the fee paid for the water allocation service is high compared
                                             with farmers’ income, it does not yet cover the sustainable cost. Evidence of real progress
                                             in O&M efficiency is necessary to persuade users to accept the fee increases in a
                                             comprehensive package of demand-resource management service.

                                     WUAs and FWUA personnel must be trained in hydraulic system management.

                                           Sustainable development of irrigation for this kind of network requires efficient management of
                                           the water resource, sustainable infrastructures, and good quality of service for water users. Service
                                           quality in the short, medium, and long terms is a decisive factor for agricultural production.

                                           Water resource. The different uses of water resources (irrigation and energy) should be formally
                                           linked. This can happen only if all the actors involved—government, managers, and users—realize
                                           that their interests converge in implementing a concerted and participatory polity of economic
                                           water management.
                 Lessons learned




                                           Assets. Sustainable development of the entire command area depends on the sustainability of the
                                           Pequin Kavaje canal infrastructures. Continued investment to improve the system’s efficiency is also
                                           vital for more intensive agricultural production and for any extension of supply. All this makes it
                                           imperative to define an infrastructure management function to be entrusted to the Pequin Kavaje
                                           federation. This federation must have adequate human and financial resources. Here, again, the
                                           nature of this development calls for mobilization of all stakeholders: government, managers, and
                                           users.

                                           Water service. Water users need reliable and sustainable water service to apply appropriate
                                           amounts of water to crops at the right time. Without this, investing in plot development,
                                           mechanical equipment, and plants is useless. Water service quality depends on sound technical
                                           management (O&M) and scrupulous and transparent commercial and financial management based
                                           on a fair pricing structure. Prices must be financially justified and realistic in social and economic
                                           terms; they must make sense in “customer-supplier” relations.

                              Of Mexico’s 6 million ha under irrigation, 4 million ha rely on surface water and 2 million rely on
                              groundwater. Half the irrigation and drainage (I&D) systems are government owned; the other half
                              are privately owned and include systems built and managed by farmers. Management transfer of
                              Mexican irrigation districts to farmers was achieved through the creation of large farmer-managed
         Project structure




                              water user associations (WUAs). This process began in 1991 on a pilot basis with strong political
                              commitment and support at the highest (presidential) level after creation of the water government
                              agency (Comisión Nacional del Agua [CNA]).

                              Eighty-two districts, covering approximately 3.3 million ha (530,738 farmers), have been transferred
                              to farmer WUAs. However, headworks are still operated by the government agency (CNA).

                                              Most WUAs have proven capable of operating and maintaining their irrigation schemes efficiently,
                                              even schemes larger than 50,000 ha. They recover almost 72 percent of O&M costs through the

                                              irrigation service fee. Maintenance, repairs, and irrigation operations are adequate, timely, and
                                              professionally performed on schedule. Funding is available, efficient modern technology has been
                                              introduced, and personnel are well trained and motivated. The WUAs hire the technical staff.

                                              Increasing investment and speeding up the modernization path have been a problem, although
                                              these actions can help improve productivity. Currently, because funding is tight, WUAs are
                                              negotiating with equipment dealers who supply machinery and other goods for system O&M.

                                              The private sector has been involved in activities through banking and lending to WUAs—only
                                              Mexican banks to begin with, but foreign banks now want to join the party.

                                              Risks
                                              International competition is the main risk, with financial ramifications.

                                                  •	 Financial risk. WUAs now bear all the costs of all OMM and some investments for modernizing

                                                      the future, this situation may evolve, inducing new water fees matching this new risk.

                                                  •	 Commercial risk. The major risk for the farmers is the open market of the North American
                                                      Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and World Trade Organization (WTO) rules obliging them
                                                      to compete with North American farmers, particular in corn, wheat, and sorghum. Crop
                                                      diversification toward high-value-added crops is the main challenge.

                           The successful transfer of Mexican irrigation districts to farmer management through WUAs
                           has been a model for many other projects around the world. The main reason for this success
                           is the continuous support of the CNA throughout the process with technical support from the
         Lessons learned




                           Mexican Institute on Water Technology (IMTA) and financial support from the government through
                           subsidies for machinery acquisition and modernization (sprinkler and drip irrigation).

                           WUAs usually perform maintenance with their own personnel. Some outsourcing for heavy repairs
                           is expected to occur to reduce OMM costs and allow farmers to concentrate on farming and
                           marketing. This could well happen for WUAs in Sonora where competition with U.S. farmers is the
                           greatest.

                                        The Tieshan irrigation project includes two main canals (North and South) fed by a 635 million
                                        m3 reservoir completed in 1982 (World Bank 2002b). The Yangtze Basin Water Resources Project
                                        financed by the World Bank (1992–2002) included irrigation and drainage (I&D) works in Hunan
                                        and Hubei provinces. The Hunan component aimed to improve and develop irrigation in the
                                        Tieshan North area through construction and extension of the North Main canal, two sub-main
                                        canals, and branch canals, including tunnels, aqueducts, and laterals supplying irrigation water to
                 Project structure




                                        25,800 ha. The project has also introduced the concept of self-financing irrigation and drainage
                                        districts (SIDDs).

                                        Before the project, there was some confusion about what were taxes and what were water
                                        charges, meaning that municipal government viewed irrigation water fees as a source of
                                        revenue with little obligation of transparency in their use after collection. This remains the case
                                        in the Hubei component of the same project, where farmers pay 58 percent for operation,
                                        maintenance, and management (OMM) when the fair share for agricultural water use would be
                                        24 percent.

                                        The institutional development objective was completed at Tieshan in establishing SIDDs. The
                                        Tieshan Water Supply Corporation (WSC) at the reservoir and main canal level and 24 water user
                                        associations (WUAs) at branch and lateral canal levels were intended to improve irrigation OMM
                                        through farmer management of the I&D system and farmer control over fee collection and use.

                                      The new Tieshan WSC (with 500 personnel) is a strong, financially self-sufficient enterprise,
                                      with diversified sources of income but with a recognized responsibility for all matters related




                                                                                                                                                  ANNEX 2
                                      to water. It is no longer under the control of municipal governments. WUAs generally take
                                      care of the control of funds. Previous destruction of irrigation facilities and water use conflicts
                                      are progressively disappearing. WUAs and the WSC enter into partnerships to fund system
                                      improvements and expansion, and farmers pay at least 75 percent of the costs in labor or in cash.

                                      The provincial government has given a strong lead to the separation of policy, planning, and
                                      regulation from water operation and maintenance in the water sector. This new direction
                                      is modeled on the strong WSC in Hunan, which constitutes a basis for professionalized,
                                      privatized management. A WSC or WUAs are now responsible for collecting service fees; village
                                      administrations remain responsible, under Chinese law, for collecting agricultural taxes.

                                       Risks

                                         •	 Financial risk. The financial stability of the I&D service provider (IDSP) depends on
                                            substantial income derived from other water activities such as hydropower and urban
          Project structure (cont.)




                                            water. The provider’s income looks like inter-sectoral cross-subsidization, or at least a
                                            sharing of corporate overheads.

                                         •	 Technical risk. The lack of volumetric water measurement limits the real and effective
                                            partnership between the WSC and WUAs. The next step would be to scale up the WSC’s
                                            accountability. Volumetric measurement at the farm level would enable documentation of
                                            water cost and water value and perhaps also explain the reasons for the very low water use.

                                             The project had a considerable impact on policy reform and the organization of water
                                             administration, operation, and maintenance in Hunan through the separation of responsibilities
                                             for regulation, technical assistance, planning, and monitoring under the Bureau of Water Affairs,
                                             and for OMM under the WSC and WUAs. The concept of farmers’ self-management of irrigation
                                             is now well established in Hunan as a result of the project, and the project has become a model
                 Lessons learned




                                             for water-sector reform throughout China. The Wuhan Hydropower University has established
                                             an overall monitoring system, enabling the province to understand the benefits of the new
                                             institutional arrangements for self-financing I&D.

                                             The concept of professional service provider acting as a third party independent from the
                                             government is proving to be a success and gives the opportunity for farmers to control OMM
                                             and to pay their fair share of its cost. At the end of the reform process, the Tieshan WSC model
                                             could be benchmarked against the French SARs with a corporate culture and probably an
                                             auditing process implemented by the government.

                                    management in the Jordan Valley (39,000 ha) converted most of the open-channel distribution
                                    networks into pressurized networks and also modernized the King Abdullah Canal. Despite
              Project structure




                                    this modernization program, JVA still delivers water to farmers by rotation and enforces a water
                                    quota system based on crop type and location in the Jordan Valley, with a quota reduction in
                                    some very dry years. Optimizing water use requires some flexibility in meeting farmers’ local
                                    constraints and capacities, while water scarcity imposes some rigidity in managing water so that
                                    everyone has a fair share. This situation constitutes a vicious cycle, where JVA maintains a rigid
                                    distribution system to keep farmers from exceeding their quotas, but farmers use as much water
                                    as long as possible, thus making the pressurized system inefficient. JVA also faces economic
                                    and institutional challenges. Water tariffs are still low ($0.023/m3), representing less than 5
                                    percent of farm production costs. Both water accounting and enforcement of quotas and water
                                    rules are limited. Finally, an improvement in the farm environment is required to address priority
                                    marketing of products, access to credit, and purchase of quality-controlled inputs.

                                                 An interesting experiment was conducted with farmers in a 400 ha secondary command area,
                                                 Adasiyeh, located in the northern part of the Jordan Valley, where the bottleneck for improving

                                                 on-farm irrigation was at the interface between farmers and JVA, at the farm turnout level.
                                                 Almost all the farms still using surface irrigation were equipped with pressurized irrigation (open
                                                 tube or micro-sprinkler on citrus, drip on bananas) and received a public subsidy (from French
                                                 bilateral aid). Quotas enforced by the JVA (down to 50 percent in dry years) were generally well
                                                 respected and appeared a good incentive to save water.

                                                 JVA replaced 12 l/s flow limiters with 6 l/s devices to return to the original design of the system
                                                 and enforced new rules for pumping: the pump operator delivers a fixed daily volume and then
                                                 stops the pumping station but does not regulate the flow delivered by the pumping station.
                                                 JVA checks to make sure farmers comply with the collective schedule and flow imposed by
                                                 the JVA rotation to every farm gate. The farmers open and close the gates themselves, but
                                                 the pump operator is entitled to fine farmers who take water out of turn. The operator is also
                                                 entitled to enforce these rules more strictly by stopping the station when the head pressure falls
                                                 below a set level. Chasing down illegal farm-gate openings resulted in better equity and more
                                                 stable flows and pressures. In a few cases, contractual arrangements have been set up between

                                                 farmers and the JVA to define their respective rights and duties. The next step to be considered
                                                 by JVA and farmers is to transfer pump operations to a private operator who would work under
                                                 contract to JVA and the farmers.

                                                 Risks
                                                 Farmers in the Jordan Valley are highly productive and grow high-value crops such as citrus.

                                                     •	 Country risks. The political risk is considered medium in light of the country’s recent
                                                         stability.

                                                     •	 Export market. The export market that drives the valley’s high-value crops is always subject
                                                         to strong fluctuations, however, especially for valley farmers who are not well organized for
                                                         marketing.

                                                     •	 Commercial risks. Considering valley farmers’ high gross productivity, the risk of insolvency
                                                         is low.

                                                     •	 Recovery risk. The cost recovery risk depends on the government’s authority in enforcing
                                                         the law, which has proven low in the past years.

                                                     •	 Water-specific risk. The Jordan Valley is not high in the country’s water demand priorities.

                                                     •	 Water demand risk. In dry years, most of the flow of the King Abdullah Canal is pumped for
                                                         the city of Amman, while high-quality groundwater on the highlands is spoiled for politically
                                                         protected private irrigation.

                                                     •	 Water supply risk. Recurrent droughts over the last five years (2000-2004) have severely
                                                         reduced water supply, while preserving citrus farms. High gross productivity, however,
                                                         would enable the use of unconventional (for example, desalinized) water. Urban wastewater
                                                         from Amman’s sewage treatment plant goes through a downstream water reservoir and is
                                                         already being reused for agriculture in part of the Jordan Valley.

                                       stations and secondary network. This supports the idea promoted by the World Bank (1997)
                                       to establish WUAs in the Jordan Valley. However, Vidal and Nepveu de Villemarceau (2001)
                                       suggest that farmers in the Jordan Valley are less familiar with such collective organization
                                       (WUAs) than with clear contractual relationships with a reliable service provider (for example, a
                                       mobile phone provider). The recent private-sector boom in Jordan could extend to the water
                                       (and irrigation) sector, which could hire competent professionals from the overstaffed present
                                       water administrations (JVA and the Water Authority of Jordan [WAJ]).

          3. Other Contract types

          This third and final section of Annex 2 presents case studies of six PPP irrigation schemes that are neither
ANNEX 2



          concession nor operation and management types. Instead, they are examples of management, design-build-
          operate, a type of PPP lease, and a private contract.

          From the cases presented in this section, the high level of risk translates into investor reluctance to invest
          and potentially higher costs. If the public sector wants to attract private service providers, it must recognize
          the special nature of these risks and develop packages to mitigate them. Some risks can be mitigated by
          contractual provisions, but others are inherent in PPPs as applied in the irrigation and drainage sector and will
          require guarantees of different kinds to attract private investors.

          The following table provides a list of the case studies presented in this section and a summary of each scheme’s
          pertinent details.

                                                Irrigation Project, estimated at 11,800 ha, and the phased increase of the irrigated area to

                                                17,000 ha. It is expected that around 24,000 families, with an average of 0.7 ha each, will benefit
                                                from the scheme.83 The project will also prepare the modernization of Ganges Gobadak and
                                                Teesta irrigation projects which may also involve private sector participation of management
                                                operation and maintenance of the scheme. The Project was approved by ADB board on 30
                                                June 2014. It is expected to be completed by June 2019.84

                                                The project will rehabilitate and modernise the existing irrigation and energy infrastructure.
                                                There has been a gradual loss of area under irrigation since the World Bank Muhuri Irrigation
                                                Project was completed in 1989.85 This has been caused by several factors, including: reduction
                                                in the reservoir storage, reduction in river flows, and the cost of providing water, particularly to
                                                low-profit crops.

                                                To ensure that the scheme is developed into an efficient and sustainable system, the project will
                                                undertake the following activities:86

                                                       Upgrade pumps, replace open field channels with buried pipes, install prepaid meters;
                                                    •	 	
                                                       Upgrade local electrical distribution system and solar power;
                                                    •	 	
                                                    •	 Provide pre-paid SIM card meters and control systems; and
                                                    •	 Repair and provide office space for BWDB and IMO.

                                                The project’s main aim is to promote farm production, while the scope for including non-farm
                                                income activities to complement those related to increasing farm incomes will also be assessed.

                                                The project is expected to increase Rabi season irrigated area and increase agricultural
                                                productivity and crop diversification. It will restore the protection against flooding, and will have
                                                a positive impact on temporary (construction) and permanent (operation and agricultural) job
                                                opportunities in the area.

                                                The Muhuri project will implement a pre-paid water metering system that has proven successful
                                                in the Barind project.87 This system would allow farmers direct control of their water usage, as
                                                water will flow when they enter their (in-credit) smartcard into the meter. This water system will
                                                not directly measure the water volume used, but will measure the energy used to pump water
                                                which will be directly proportional to the volume pumped. This more flexible and transparent
                                                system is expected to lead to 30 percent water use efficiency gains, a flexible and on-demand

                                               the irrigation service charge. They will therefore be expected to finance the $4.2 million
                                               in O&M costs, which they will recoup by levying a 10 percent administration fee for

                                                  to ensure full recovery of Operation and Management costs is $125/ha. This amount falls below
                                                  the $131/ha which was determined as affordable for a farm whose production has improved
                                                  through irrigation, though the actual tariff amount is yet to be determined by the BWDB and

                                         While much of South Asia suffers from acute overexploitation of groundwater resources, eastern
                                         India possesses more than a quarter of India’s usable groundwater resources; but less than a
ANNEX 2


                                         fifth of it is being developed. Stimulating groundwater development in the region is not only
                                         central to creating livelihoods and welfare for its poor but also to addressing its syndrome of
                                         extensive waterlogging and susceptibility to flooding. A series of public policies have been
                                         designed to promote groundwater development over the past 50 years. Until the mid-1980s, all
                                         these well-intentioned “minor-irrigation subsidy schemes” had produced little minor irrigation.
                                         When electric pumps predominated in groundwater irrigation, and later when diesel pumps
                                         began to replace them, farmers—particularly, small farmers from poor communities—found the
                                         hassle and “transaction costs” involved in accessing the Free Boring Scheme (FBS) prohibitive
                                         and intimidating. This is still the situation in north Bengal, Orissa, and, to a lesser extent, in
                                         north Bihar.

                                         Eastern Uttar Pradesh, however, managed to transform the diesel-pump subsidy scheme into
                                         a powerful instrument of smallholder irrigation. During the mid-1980s, a series of changes
                                         occurred in the design and implementation of the FBS, which turned the private diesel-pump
                                         dealer into a central scheme coordinator. These changes sharply reduced the transaction costs
                                         that small farmers had to bear for access to the subsidy and loan scheme. All that an eligible
                 Project structure




                                         small farmer has to do now is to give the dealer his/her photograph and land documents. The
                                         dealer then takes over and completes the entire process of getting governmental and bank
                                         approvals and clearances. The pump and pipes are delivered to the farmer the same day,
                                         and he can hire local rig operators to do his boring. Within a week of applying, his tubewell
                                         is commissioned. By then, the dealer has cleared all the formalities, and the transaction is
                                         completed. Financially, this farmer-dealer commercial arrangement is a win-win solution: the
                                         farmer pays the same price and often gets a more reliable pump than the brand he would
                                         get from government subsidies. The dealer offers cheaper prices and keeps the difference
                                         (between 8 and 10 percent) to pay for his service: quick and easy pump delivery.

                                         The diesel-pump dealer thus became the one-stop-shop for farmers wanting to set up a
                                         tubewell under the FBS. Since 1985, under the FBS, more than 800,000 small diesel-pump–
                                         operated tubewells have been installed in eastern Uttar Pradesh (UP), irrigating a gross area
                                         of between 2.4 million ha and 3.2 million ha. This rapid increase in diesel-pump density is
                                         considered to be at the heart of eastern Uttar Pradesh’s belated Green Revolution.

                                         Risks
                                         A peculiarity of this case is the abundance of the groundwater resource, which does not seem
                                         to require either pumping regulation or allocation between uses or within each use by any
                                         public agency. This is not, by and large, the case in other parts of India or Asia, where similar
                                         private operator involvement caused a “boom” in individual and private groundwater pumping,
                                         with the unfortunate result of severe water table drawdown. Since the environmental (water
                                         supply) risk is much higher in such a case than the financial risk, it seems that all pump market
                                         stakeholders, farmers and dealers, greatly benefit from it.

                                       pumps. However, it demonstrates that there is space for non-farmer private initiative, even in
                                       one of the world’s poorest agricultural regions where public initiatives, policies, and subsidies
                                       have failed—mostly due to heavy administrative burdens and related transaction costs. Private
                                       initiative in this case seemed to be the only way out. Poor farmers can access the (groundwater)
                                       resource, significantly improving their livelihoods, because the pump dealer negotiates the
                                       administrative hurdles for them.

                               generated, are a core aspect of this vast undertaking. About 100,000 ha are under operation,
                               land is being farmed, and the agricultural impetus is obvious. Irrigation unions (water user
                               associations, WUAs) already operate and maintain secondary and tertiary hydraulic works. The
                               Şanli Urfa region’s economy is being boosted by the agricultural development. This momentum
                               is driven mostly by the private sector, which is gradually assuming government’s role in
                               irrigation.

                               But many discrepancies between the original plans and the present situation jeopardize the
                               sustainability of this development. These include soil salinity, wasteful irrigation practices, short-
                               term horizons for WUA asset management, almost no extension of research results, insufficient
                               technical assistance and farmer training, and inadequate farmer involvement in project
                               design and implementation. Besides this large scheme, collective groundwater schemes (for
                               example, Ikicırcıp, 80 km east of Şanlı Urfa, involving 9,000 ha) were developed and transferred
                               to WUAs, which have neither technical competence nor financial sustainability, and have to
                               face a continuous water table drawdown due to the unregulated and increasing withdrawal by
                               outsiders.
           Project structure




                               The Turkish approach to irrigation management transfer (IMT), presented at international levels
                               as a model, leaves much room for private initiatives because the government no longer ensures
                               some of the essential functions, and WUAs have not (yet) taken them on. To illustrate this trend:

                               Göktepe, a private company and country leader in on-farm irrigation equipment (gated pipes,
                               sprinklers, micro-irrigation), has made large investments since 1996 to the point of seriously
                               competing with Israeli manufacturers. It now provides farmers with credit for modernizing their
                               mostly traditional irrigation. However, the Ministry of Agriculture, which has been in charge of
                               irrigation advisory services with decreasing means, is now planning to privatize this service. It
                               already has offers from the private sector (for example, from Göktepe and others) as well as
                               demand from farmers who claim they have more confidence in paying for private advice than
                               getting it free from the government

                               Risks
                               With strong government disengagement, the main risks for private initiatives such as the
                               ones mentioned in this case are financial, related to a possible decrease in water value (that
                               is, productivity), should subsidies to cotton be dropped. This risk is low on large schemes
                               because the water value would remain high without subsidies ($0.08/m3), but it is significant
                               on groundwater schemes where water table drawdown induces an increase in water fees to a
                               level where, without subsidies, the water value would become very low ($0.02/m3). However, for
                               groundwater schemes, the main risk is the physical and financial inaccessibility to the resource if
                               aquifers continue to drop.

                                                   just to the irrigation sector, because government reforms seem to encourage or result in
                                                   the emergence of a dynamic water sector. Whether the schemes are in crisis (Ikicırcıp) or
                                                   not (Şanlı Urfa–Harran), WUAs and farmers seem open to contracting with private firms for
                                                   various functions related to irrigation (operation, maintenance, finance management, advisory
                                                   service). This is happening with the use of credit facilities offered by local irrigation equipment
                                                   manufacturers, which motivates farmers to modernize their irrigation by shifting from surface to
                                                   drip or sprinkler irrigation. The high value of irrigation water and productivity, partly due to local
                                                   subsidies to the cotton price (up to 15 percent of the gross product), facilitates this momentum.

                                100,000 tons of sugar per year, 8,000 jobs) is a prime example of public-private partnership (PPP)
                                in agribusiness. It was initiated in 1970 by the private Compagnie Sucrière Sénégalaise (CSS).

                                Though an entirely private investment, the first P of the acronym PPP corresponds to a number

                                of counterparts, or rather gifts, from the government of Senegal, including the following: a

                                (private diversion canal), up to 30,000 m3/ha/year; and most important, full tariff protection
                                against sugar imports from the rest of the world, which keeps the domestic sugar price a good
                                10-20 percent above world market prices—in effect, a true monopoly.

                                For its part, CSS provides Senegal with a reliable output of good-quality sugar to meet the best
                                part of local needs (100,000 tons of sugar for 10 million people = 10 kg/person/year); an annual
                                value added of CFA 20 billion ($30 million); and most important, an average of 8,000 jobs per
                                year (60 percent permanent, 40 percent seasonal) that help sustain nearly 80,000 people—almost

                                and a guaranteed purchase price of $1,000/ton of wheat (50 percent to 120 percent above world
                                prices). These exceptional conditions must be viewed in the wealth context of the oil economy.
                                Agriculture also offered an avenue for income redistribution, self-reliance in food, and a way of
                                occupying a huge, unpopulated territory.

                                Three types of farms were involved in the “gold rush”:

                                   •	 Eight highly capitalistic business farms (80 percent of the irrigated surface), whose
                                      stocks are quoted on the Riyad stock market, were formed: HADCO, TADCO, GADCO,
                                      JADCO, and NADEC for wheat, alfalfa, and vegetables; AL MARAI and AL SAFI for dairy
                                      farming; and AL RAJHI for sheep and other livestock breeding. Most business farms had
                                      connections with national equipment suppliers. The average farm size is between 5,000 ha
                                      and 15,000 ha, with between 100 and 300 center pivots. Their only business strategy is to
                                      provide stockholders with the highest possible capital return.

                                                          characteristics as the major business farms but far less capitalistic (individual enterprises).

                                                    •	 Commercial risks. The counter-production measures gradually decided on by the kingdom
                                                          (price reduction, export ban, fuel price rise) make the desert agriculture far less profitable.

                                                    •	 Water-specific risks. Water demand risk is nil, but water supply risk is very high. Because
                                                          most pumping is done from non-renewable (fossil) aquifers, the practice is fuel for ongoing

                                              The West Delta area consists of approximately 110,000 ha of highly productive farmland
                                              on the fringes of the Delta. Since the early 1990s, the area has developed into a
                                              flourishing agricultural economy which today contributes between $300 million and
                                              $500 million annually to the Egypt’s GDP. This irrigation scheme sought to develop a
                                              surface water irrigation system over an area of about 75,000 ha on reclaimed desert
                                              land on the West of the Egypt’s Nile Delta for commercial and small farms that were

                                              threatened by groundwater depletion. The project sought to reverse the imminent
                                              collapse of a highly efficient export-oriented agricultural economy based on high value
                                              agriculture by providing a reliable source of surface water that also would promote
                                              sustainable conjunctive use of the remaining groundwater resources.

                                              The transaction essentially involves contracting a private operator to take over a
                                              concession area consisting of about 190,000 feddans in the southern part of the West
                                              Delta, to design, construct, and operate for 30 years a piped irrigation system. The
                                              concept included piping Nile River water to the site to provide surface water irrigation.
                                              A piped system, through more expensive than an open channel will be more efficient
                                              (due to less evaporation), and have fewer environmental and social impacts. In addition,
                                              a piped system offers many more advantages, such as reduced cost of an unutilized
                                              system, and minimal risk of water theft or cost to control against water losses.

                                                         that were largely “output based” focusing on the achievement of technical milestones.

                                                         Farmer participation
                                                         The project introduced a participatory approach to project planning whereby the
                                                         farmers were encouraged to drive many aspects of project design and preparation
                                                         through a representative advisory group, the West Delta Water User Council. During
                                                         the implementation stage the council would have been given a role in monitoring
                                                         the relationships and potential conflicts between farmers on such matters as water
                                                         entitlements, water use, and alternating hours of irrigation.

                                                         A number of innovative ideas were introduced in the PPP contract of the project. First,
                                                         an institutional and regulatory framework gave de facto water rights to the operator.
                                                         Second, the role of the ministry changed from provider to facilitator. Third, the PPP

                                                         Finally, the PPP contract established an innovative risk allocation framework and
                                                         transaction structure whereby many of the potential risks associated with a privately

                                           Currency risk
                                           Under the agreement, the government assumed the currency risk for the funds it




                                                                                                                                                                ANNEX 2
                                           initially made available to the operator. The private operator’s repayment obligation
                                           to the government is denominated in Egyptian pounds, while the government adds a
                                           premium of several percentage points to the operator’s repayment obligation to cover
                                           its own currency risk exposure in repaying the dollar-denominated loan facility.

                                           Demand Risk
                                           Demand risk would be a major obstacle for any private operator. To reduce that risk,
                                           and the risk of designing a system that exceeds demand, a three-month “subscription
                                           period” was built into the project design phase. During this period, farmers would
                                           sign up to be connected to the new network and pay a security deposit to secure their
                                           commitment. After enough farmers had subscribed, the operator would design the
                                           system to reach those participating. If there was insufficient demand after the initial
                                           “subscription” period, the operator could terminate the contract. The farmers who
                                           decided to subscribe at a later stage would be charged a higher flat fee rate. The
               Project structure (cont.)




                                           subscription deposits not only served as proof of commitment, they also provided the
                                           private operator with additional capital to finance initial construction. This method
                                           of subscription also allowed the operator to expand into new territories within the
                                           concession area without over-extending infrastructure into low-density and unprofitable
                                           areas.

                                                      The project was divided into two phases: Phase 1 includes developing irrigation system
                                                      for area of 90,000 of the total 190,000 feddans in the concession area); Phase 2 is
ANNEX 2


                                                      focused on providing the irrigation system to the remaining 100,0000 feddans.

                                                      For Phase 1, government would facilitate a 20-year soft loan from the World Bank (that
                                                      would include a four-year grace period) and Agence Française de Développement
                                                      would cover up 85 percent of the first area project cost ($175 million) to support the
                                                      financing for the initial 90,000 feddans. The private sector operator would provide at
                                                      least 15 percent of the first area cost ($30 million), and could draw on the loan facility to
                                                      cover up to 85 percent of the initial construction costs.

                                                      In Phase 2, the private operator would need to raise full financing. A concession fee
                                                      would be paid by the private operator to the government for over 20 years to recover
                                                      the part drawn from the loan, plus interest and surcharge for potential currency
                                                      devaluation.

                                                      To ensure government restitution in the event of default, the private operator was
                 Financial arrangements




                                                      required to put up a performance bond. In total, the security would equal 30 percent
                                                      of the entire investment, which is typical for purely private financing. The government
                                                      would be covered in case the operator walked away after construction and could re-bid
                                                      the project. The expansion would be done purely as a private BOT project.

                                                      Farmers were required to pay an upfront deposit when subscribing for their water
                                                      entitlement, which amounted to 8 percent of the project costs. The operator could use
                                                      this funding to reduce its own contribution

                                                      Recovery of costs
                                                      The two-part tariff accrued by farmers—(i) the annual flat fee per feddan over 20
                                                      years based on the land area connected, and (ii) the volumetric fee paid monthly per
                                                      cubic meter consumed—would adjust periodically for inflation. The intention was
                                                      to encourage efficient use of piped water and ensure positive cash flows, especially
                                                      through the critical early years. More important, the flat fee, which was mandatory for
                                                      farmers, regardless of water consumption, would ensure the minimum revenue base the
                                                      operator needed to meet its concession fee payments to the government and recover
                                                      its fixed capital costs—and ensure coverage for the government in repaying its loan.

                                                      The government of Egypt would guarantee a fixed allocation of water to the PPP, based
                                                      on an annual amount per hectare.

                                    The project preparation introduced a number of innovating ideas such as, involving
                                    private investors and the farming community in the preparation and decision making




                                                                                                                                 ANNEX 2
                                    processes: a strategy to mitigate demand, commercial, and currency risks. In terms
                                    of the design, this project has offered a new approach to irrigation development by
                                    introducing a piped surface water irrigation scheme system instead of an open channel.
                                    This would offer more efficiency in use and provide greater environmental and social
                                    benefits than an open canal irrigation.

                                    Unlike the centrally planned projects of the past, this one is demand driven. The
               Lessons learned




                                    focus is on developing an irrigation network with features that farmers want and are
                                    willing to pay for. The project’s sustainability would depend on reconfiguring the water
                                    service delivery model based on conjunctive use of surface and groundwater, and by
                                    recovering costs from water users.

                                    Already, a number of other projects in Ethiopia, Zambia, and India are adopting the
                                    demand-based, participatory approach to assessing feasibility and cost recovery
                                    policies. The West Delta would be, if implemented, be the first such project to test
                                    the newly-created framework of consultation among the Nile riparian nations, which
                                    pioneered its approach and process for sharing knowledge and experiences for mutual
                                    benefits among the Nile basin countries. There is great interest in revitalizing the
                                    project.

The World Bank Group provides assistance to governments in developing
countries to improve access to infrastructure and basic services through public-
private partnerships (PPP). When designed well and implemented in a balanced
regulatory environment, PPPs can bring greater efficiency and sustainability
to the provision of public services such as water, sanitation, energy, transport,
telecommunications, healthcare and education.

The World Bank Group’s support is unique in that it covers the entire PPP cycle
—upstream policy and regulatory guidance, transaction structuring advice, as
well as financing and guarantees to facilitate implementation.
                                                                                     worldbank.org/ppp
PPIAF provides technical assistance to governments to support the creation of        ppiaf.org
a sound enabling environment for the provision of basic infrastructure services
by the private sector. PPIAF also supports the generation and dissemination
of knowledge on emerging practices on matters relating to private sector             @WBG_PPP #PPPs
