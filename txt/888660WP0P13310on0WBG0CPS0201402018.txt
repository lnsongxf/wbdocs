     i. Nepal has achieved remarkable progress over the last           iv. The World Bank Group stands ready to support Nepal’s

     and democratic state.                                             v. World Bank Group support to Nepal will be aligned
                                                                       to the Bank’s twin global goals—eliminating extreme

     the prerequisites that will provide faster, sustained             progress on poverty reduction has been commendable,
     and inclusive growth. While the political process remains
     intricate (understandably so, given Nepal’s relatively short
     experience with democratic governance), the country
     urgently needs to pay greater attention to the economy.
     Remarkably, Nepal’s economy grew steadily even during the
     height of the conflict, and economic management remained
     prudent, resulting in a budget surplus in 2013. Yet growth
     levels are too low to enable Nepal to continue its past
     progress and relegate poverty to history. Current growth
     relies heavily on remittances supporting consumption and
     growth in basic services with low growth potential.


     iii. To move to a higher growth trajectory, Nepal will have
     to remove bottlenecks to private and public investment
     in key growth sectors. The most vivid example of Nepal’s
     economic potential is hydropower. While the estimated
     potential for hydroelectricity generation in Nepal is 84,000
     megawatts (MW), of which at least half is economically viable,
     only 746 MW (less than 2 percent of the viable potential) is
     currently developed. Hydropower development could be a
     game changer for Nepal. Development of the sector would
     reduce load-shedding and provide major revenues through
     exporting electricity to India and Bangladesh.

     at a crossroads. It can either continue on a path of limited                            inclusive society. This process has been made more difficult
     economic management that has delivered modest growth                                    by Nepal’s varied topography, ranging from the Himalayas in

     even during the height of the conflict, and (ii) extensive                              system. Within this system, power remained concentrated in
     labor migration to other countries and a resulting expansion                            the monarchy and a handful of elite high-caste families from

               The estimated poverty trend is calculated on the basis of growth elasticity of poverty. Between 2004 and 2011, the poverty rate measured at $1.25 a day (PPP) declined by 53.2%,
               from 53.13% to 24.82%, with the annualized rate of decrease of 10.3%. During approximately the same period, average annual growth rate in GNDI per capita (constant NRs.) was
               3.8%. Thus the “back of the envelope” growth elasticity of poverty was -2.71%.

       The share of vulnerable population is defined as those falling into poverty if the mean consumption were to fall by 5 percent. Nepal’s vulnerable population is estimated
       at 3.6 percent compared to 4.5 percent in India and Bangladesh, using respective national poverty lines.
