         BOX 1. Types of Emissions Accounting Systems

         1. GHG inventory: An inventory that records physical GHG emissions and removals. Accounting of GHG emissions must be
            distinguished from accounting of carbon units.
         2. Register: A database that records serialized carbon units and any other information specific to the carbon unit required
            by policy. This could include the vintage of the carbon unit, the identity and location of the project for which the carbon
            unit was issued, the project funder, or verification details. A register may be used by a country that receives results-based
            climate finance for generating carbon units backed by emission reductions, to provide assurance that the same emission
            reduction is not paid for twice (double payment). A register could also be used for a simple emissions trading system (ETS)
            without multiple accounts, whereby a country “transfers” carbon units to a purchasing country through simple double-entry
            bookkeeping (a subtraction of a carbon unit in one register mirrored by an addition in another one).
         3. Transaction registry: A database that has all of the features of a register, plus the capability to transfer carbon units
            between multiple account holders on the transaction registry (internal transfer), and/or the capability to transfer carbon units
            to another transaction registry (external transfer). The more complex the ETS, the more features the transaction registry will
            require.
         4. Data Management System (DMS): A database that records and archives specific information about a carbon unit that
            is not stored in the transaction registry or register, but that for policy reasons is required to transparently demonstrate
            environmental integrity, and compliance with safeguards and other conditions. For example, to facilitate compatibility
            between registries, it may be desirable to limit the information that travels with a carbon unit when it is externally
            transferred. At the same time, it may be desirable to archive information about that carbon unit (for example, baseline
            information according to which a carbon unit was issued, or geographical information relating to a project boundary), and
            this can be recorded in a DMS. The serial number of a carbon unit should link it to the information in the DMS, so the latter
            can be retrieved if necessary.

   BOX 2. An Expert View: Tracking Internationally Transferred Carbon Units

   By Christina Hood, International Energy Agency
   One key question for negotiators will be whether to make available (or even require the use of) a central UN architecture for the
   linking of national registries. The Kyoto Protocol’s International Transaction Log (ITL) could be adapted to provide a central hub
   to link both UN-led and domestic carbon pricing mechanisms, though this would require domestic systems to be designed to
   the UN specification. The central hub could also collect the relevant information on unit transfers needed to account for NDCs.
   Alternatively, registries of linked systems could link bilaterally in a peer-to-peer arrangement; in this case, the information
   needed for (UNFCCC) accounting would need to be submitted from the individual registries. This would potentially include
   information on issuances, retirements, international transfers, banking, and holdings (including vintages). The figure below
   compares the two systems.

   Although a peer-to-peer system may be simpler, there may be concerns about varying security standards and a lack of
   transparency: it would be difficult for outside observers to know that units and transactions are unique. This could potentially
   give rise to a separate UNFCCC process of reporting and review of the carbon pricing systems themselves, to demonstrate they
   are maintaining high environmental integrity.
   Under the Paris Agreement, the use of international transfers toward NDCs is voluntary and must be “authorized by
   participating Parties.” This does not preclude subnational systems from linking without approval from national authorities,
   but means that any unapproved flows of carbon units could not be counted toward NDCs. For example, if a plant covered by
   a linked subnational scheme chooses to buy carbon units from a plant covered by a linked scheme in another country, rather
   than reduce its own emissions, then the transaction would be “invisible” in term of progress toward the NDC. Subnational
   systems may therefore need to change (including changing registry arrangements to meet international standards, or aligning
   metrics and methodologies with the UNFCCC) if these systems want their units to be counted toward national NDCs.

 System (DMS)       registry or register, but that for transparency purposes should be recorded and archived

 Types of Emissions Trading Systems

 Cap-and-trade      Creates a fixed ceiling on total emissions for a compliance period, and then distributes allowances (usually
                    through free allocation or auctioning) to regulated entities that are subject to the cap

 Baseline-and-      Entities that are not subject to an emissions cap are issued credits for voluntarily undertaken projects that reduce
 credit             emissions compared to a baseline or counterfactual projection. Credits are sold as offsets to entities subject to an
                    emissions cap

 Purely             Entities that are not subject to an emissions cap generate and sell offset credits to other entities that are likewise
 voluntary          not subject to an emissions cap

 Types of Carbon Units

 Carbon unit        An umbrella term to refer to the three types of carbon units distinguished by this report

 Carbon credit      A credit that is earned for undertaking an activity that reduces emissions against a baseline, according to a regu-
                    lated standard

 Voluntary credit   Similar to a carbon credit, except that it is issued according to a voluntary standard

 Registry Functions

 Issuance           The creation of a carbon unit by a registry administrator and its allocation to an account holder

 External           The transfer of a carbon unit from an account in one registry to an account in another registry
 transfer

 Internal           The transfer of a carbon unit from one account to another one within a registry
 transfer

 Retirement         The disposal of a carbon unit for compliance with an emissions target ; in some contexts, retirement is referred to
                    as “surrender”

 Cancellation       The disposal of a carbon unit where the unit is not used for compliance with an emissions target, and cannot be
                    used by others for compliance either

 Conversion         The transformation of one carbon unit type to another

 Banking            The carrying over of unused carbon units from one compliance period to the next

 Borrowing          The use of carbon units from future compliance periods to meet obligations in the current compliance period

   BOX 4. Registry Arrangements for Linking of California and Quebec Cap-and-Trade Programs

   Following considerable joint planning, the California and Quebec cap-and-trade programs were formally linked in January 2014,
   with the first joint auction held in November 2014. A number of differences exist between the two programs, not least the fact
   that California’s emissions target is for 2020 levels to equal 1990 levels, whereas Quebec’s target is for emissions by 2020 to be
   20 percent below 1990 levels. The ambition of Quebec’s target suggest that it will be a net importer of carbon units.
   High-level rules for linking are set out in an agreement between the California Air Resources Board (ARB) and the government
   of Quebec on the harmonization and integration of cap-and-trade programs. This agreement contains, inter alia, a commitment
   of the parties to work together to develop and use common electronic platforms in order to ensure program compatibility,
   integrity, and integration.
   The registry supporting the California-Quebec linked program is the Compliance Instrument Tracking System Service (CITSS),
   which functions as a single, linked registry. Covered entities, project operators generating offsets, and any other bodies holding
   or trading compliance instruments on the secondary market, must register an account with the CITSS. CITSS is used to issue,
   trade, and retire compliance instruments with unique serial numbers.
   California and Quebec had begun using CITSS separately, prior to formal linking, and thus a number of technical, administrative,
   and legal hurdles had to be overcome for linking to function (e.g., for data security and monitoring purposes, both parties’
   regulations had to be aligned, and new processes and procedures jointly developed).
   The use of a single registry by multiple jurisdictions reduces the threat of security breaches, simplifies accounting of cross-
   border transfers, and creates clear requirements for new participants (a consideration in the case of CITSS, Ontario having
   signaled its intent to join). On the other hand, a challenge of this approach is that it requires policy alignment from participating
   jurisdictions, which in turn requires coordination to resolve differences arising from variant legal structures, regulatory
   timetables, and processes.

4.3.2. Monitoring of account activity
If the volumes of transactions and administrative events—
such as changes in users or opening/closing of accounts—
are substantial, monitoring them to detect suspicious
behavior may be complex and time-consuming, particularly
in the case of linked registries. Using tools to monitor trans-
actions, as some countries are doing, may address both
issues. Germany has created a German Transaction Analysis
Module (GYM) used to monitor transactions and identify
fraudulent ones. Denmark has automated its risk analysis
procedure for new accounts and users. This module cross-
checks the information received by the registry with that
held in the Danish Business Authority, and person and tax
registers, to ensure the reliability and accuracy of the infor-
mation held. The United Kingdom is developing an online
application process that will check the integrity of requests
to open accounts, appoint users, or alter registered data.
The system will use a mix of public, commercial, and gov-
ernment	sources	to	confirm	the	accuracy	of	more	than	80	
percent of the submitted data. The objective is to reduce
the administrative burden of having to manually check the

     2.2.3. Accounting issues and options when
            importing or exporting units
     The following two options exist for registries to ensure
     robust accounting when units are imported (exported) from
     (to) another registry:

      n Definitive transfer: consists of canceling the units in
        the exporting registry to re-issue them in the importing
        registry. Such re-issuance may be done against a “proof
        of cancellation” generated by the exporting registry
        (administrator), to avoid double counting issues.

     Scenario 1: a small least developed country with limited administrative capacity, is currently receiving REDD+ readiness finance and
     expects to access RBCF for reducing emissions from forest loss against a national reference level, with no transfer of carbon units.
     Country 1 is interested, however, in eventually transferring forest carbon units internationally under the flexibility mechanisms of the
     Paris Agreement. There is no project-level REDD+.

     Role of carbon         Country 1 will need to develop a DMS to be able to track ERs for which RBCF are sought. Once a DMS is in
     markets in REDD+       place, a simple registry (i.e., a register) can be developed to issue forest carbon units for international transfer.

     Scale of               Country 1 has no project-level REDD+ and, as a small country, does not have subnational jurisdictional REDD+
     implementation         programs. A simple, single account system will be sufficient, where the national government is the sole owner
                            and beneficiary of forest carbon units.

     Risk management        Country 1 should aim to develop the simplest risk management strategy that is compatible with the rules for

     Governance             The registry will be created by national law in accordance with international standards. The REDD+ registry will
                            be stand-alone as carbon units will not be transferred from other sectors. Where complex risk management
                            functions are required, country 1 should consider using a private sector contractor with existing capacity.

     Administration         With only a single account holder, limited administrative capacity is required to manage the registry.

     Legal issues           It will probably be assumed that the government is the uncontested owner of carbon units with the right to

     Technology and IT      A single national holding account may be sufficient.

     Scenario 2: a lower-middle-income country with a relatively developed administrative capacity, intends to establish a domestic cap-
     and-trade system in which forest emissions are not covered, but in which project-level forest carbon units can be used as offset credits
     by covered entities. Indigenous and community groups are expected to benefit from the sale of forest carbon units. Country 2 is
     currently receiving international RBCF for reducing forest emissions with no transfer of carbon units and does not intend to engage in
     the international transfer of forest carbon units, as it wishes to count all domestic ERs toward its NDC under the Paris Agreement.

     Role of carbon         Country 2 will need to develop a DMS and transaction registry for a domestic regulated market in forest carbon
     markets in REDD+       units, but no international linking to other registries is required. There is no double counting risk with RBCF,
                            as there is no transfer of carbon units internationally, though ERs for which RBCF are received will need to be

Scenario 3: an upper-middle-income country with high administrative capacity, intends to establish a domestic ETS in which some
forest emissions are capped and project-level activities in noncapped forest areas can generate offsets to be used by capped entities.
At the same time, it is expected that carbon units (including forest carbon units) can be transferred internationally by both the
government and project-level participants (e.g., through the sustainable development mechanism of the Paris Agreement).

Role of carbon         Country 3 has chosen the most complex implementation scenario in which forest carbon units can be traded
markets in REDD+       as allowances within a domestic cap-and-trade system, and offset credits can be traded within a domestic
                       cap-and-trade system, and transferred internationally at both the government-to-government level, and by
                       domestic non-governmental entities.

Scale of               Project-level implementation for domestic cap-and-trade system. At the international level, it is likely that

Governance             The registry will be created by national law. Although contracting out of registry services to the private sector
                       is an option, the government may wish to retain day- to-day control because of the need to reconcile trades
                       within the domestic ETS with international transfers.

Administration         As with scenario 2, possible support required for low-capacity participants.

                       country 3, in which case the unit may be counted in two countries). Double-entry bookkeeping will be required
                       to avoid this. The conversion of domestic offset credits into domestic allowances and the conversion of both
                       types of domestic forest carbon units into internationally transferrable forest carbon units may be necessary to
                       avoid double counting.
