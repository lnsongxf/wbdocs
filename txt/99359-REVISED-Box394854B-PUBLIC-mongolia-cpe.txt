This evaluation by the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) of the World Bank
Group’s program in Mongolia is part of the Clustered Country Program Evaluation
for Resource-Rich Developing Countries: Cases of Bolivia, Kazakhstan, Mongolia,
and Zambia.

A team led by Florence Charlier prepared the Mongolia evaluation. It was
conducted under the guidance and supervision of Geeta Batra (Manager) and Nick
York (Director) and the overall direction of Caroline Heider (Director-General,
Evaluation). Members of the evaluation team included Basil Kavalsky, Andres
Liebenthal, George Polenakis, and Disha Zaidi. Barbara Balaj and Barbara Rice
edited the report and Aimee Niane provided administrative support. The report also
benefitted from comments provided by peer reviewers William Ascher (Claremont
McKenna College), Alan Gelb (Center for Global Development), and Andrew
Warner (International Monetary Fund).

IEG is grateful to the numerous representatives of the government, private sector
entities, and nongovernmental organizations who provided valuable insights into
the Bank Group’s program in Mongolia. The team is also thankful to the Bank
Group management and country team members, including both previous and
current staff working on Mongolia, who provided valuable time, information, and
feedback to the evaluation team.

Overview
Highlights
From 2005 to 2013, a mining boom quickly promoted Mongolia from a low-income to a
middle-income country. Although the World Bank Group strategy initially overlooked
the challenge of the mining boom, the new country management team that came on board
in 2005 decided to prioritize mining issues in a more selective framework.
This involved taking a set of bold steps to support Bank Group engagement in the
extractive industry, including basing for the first time a senior mining specialist in the
field and conducting an in-depth political economy analysis. Building on this, the country
team was able to design a comprehensive program of outreach to the government,
parliament, and civil society to build a consensus on the need for efficient and fiscally
sustainable management of earnings from the revenues derived from the mineral boom.
As a result of this new approach, the Bank was well positioned to support Mongolia
during the sharp downturn in mineral prices and exports in 2008–2009. The reshaped
agenda was supported by development policy loans in 2009–2010 and technical
assistance. The agenda included: (i) engaging with civil society organizations and
parliament to build awareness of key challenges and policy trade-offs to achieve a
majority consensus on key legislation for countercyclical fiscal management and social
transfers targeted to poverty; and (ii) fostering community-driven initiatives in
monitoring mining resources and the procurement process.
The Bank also put together an excellent and mutually reinforcing series of projects in the
rural sector. These were designed to improve pastoral practices; support community
initiatives; expand microfinance; offer an inventive livestock insurance scheme; improve
weather forecasting to help herders manage dzuds (extremely cold weather conditions);
and introduce solar panels, which have enabled herders to connect to the outside world
through televisions, computers, and mobile telephones.
The Independent Evaluation Group considers the Bank’s performance to be satisfactory;
however, its contribution to outcomes remains moderately satisfactory. The Bank revised
its strategy to adopt relevant objectives centered on the mining agenda and designed an
overall effective program. The Bank displayed flexibility and innovation in implementing
the program and built awareness about environmental issues. As to results on the
ground, Bank projects have had a highly satisfactory impact in improving rural
livelihoods and reducing herders’ vulnerability.
However, with the rapid recovery from the global crisis, many of the legislative reforms
supported by the Bank to improve fiscal transparency, better target social transfers related
to poverty, and restore the soundness of the banking sector have yet to be implemented
or owned by the government. In addition, the fiscal situation remains fragile and large
off-budget investments financed by international market borrowing are not subject to
parliamentary scrutiny.




                                                                                             ix
OVERVIEW


    Looking ahead, the Bank Group would need to: (i) build demand and capacity for good
    governance; (ii) pursue efforts to improve public investment; (iii) strengthen domestic
    capacity for policy simulation; (iv) assist in the strengthening of the banking system; and
    (v) support fiscal decentralization. In the interests of selectivity, the Bank could scale back
    its support for the urban sector.

1. Country Context and Purpose of the
Evaluation
This country program evaluation (CPE) evaluates the World Bank Group’s operations
in Mongolia from FY05–13, as part of a cluster of country evaluations of resource-rich
developing countries, also including Bolivia, Kazakhstan, and Zambia.


Mongolia’s Development Challenges
Though its location between Russia and China is strategically beneficial in one sense,
Mongolia faces many other geographical challenges, such as low population density,
landlocked borders, a harsh climate, and environmental stress. With an area of 600,000
square miles but a population of only 3 million, it is the least densely populated
independent country in the world. One-third of the population lives in the capital city,
Ulaanbaatar, whereas around 40 percent of the workforce herd livestock in the
extensive pasturelands. The country also suffers from extreme winter weather, the
dzuds, a climatic phenomenon that causes loss of livestock and threatens herders’ assets
and well-being.

Since the early 2000s, the discovery of large mineral resources has contributed to
fiercely contested elections and unstable governments. Mongolia has some of the
world’s major mineral deposits including coal, copper, gold, and uranium. As the size
of mineral resources became known, competition during elections became more intense.
Coalition governments had difficulty in delivering a coherent reform agenda, while
parliament assumed a very direct and populist role in decision making.

The country is now experiencing a rapid economic transformation, but with increasing
dependence on the mining sector. In 2013, the mining sector produced 19 percent of
gross domestic product (GDP), over 80 percent of foreign direct investment (FDI), about
90 percent of exports, and nearly 30 percent of government revenues. Agriculture
employs about 40 percent of the workforce, but contributes less than 15 percent of GDP.
The dominant role of mining in the economy raises many development challenges and
well-known risks associated with mining booms.

ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT
During Mongolia’s Socialist era (1924–1990), governments aimed to transform the
nomadic agricultural economy into an industrial one. The economy that emerged was
an unsustainable one. It was characterized by large deficits, a subsidy-dependent

result of high levels of investment in social services.

After the collapse of the former Soviet Union, a succession of governments grappled
with reestablishing macro-stability and market-based reforms. Mongolia had a difficult
transition from the Soviet-style regime after 1990. Although a democratic coalition
government started to introduce far-reaching economic liberalization and reform,
Mongolia was badly affected by the Asian financial crisis of 1998. The opening of the
economy attracted FDI, first in the wool sector, then in mining and other areas.

By 2005 when this evaluation starts, the economy seemed set for a major growth spurt
driven by coal, copper, gold, and uranium. Rising global mineral prices from 2003 until
mid-2008 and the discovery of copper and gold deposits triggered a mining exploration
boom and a rapid expansion in FDI. Annual GDP growth has averaged 8 percent over
the past 10 years—among the highest in the region.

The global economic downturn and a sharp decline in copper prices in 2008 hit the
Mongolian economy hard. With the local currency pegged to the dollar, there was a
direct link from falling international copper prices to tax revenues. During the boom
years of 2005–07, large increases in untargeted social expenditures, wages and salaries,
and poorly screened investment projects were funded. With the onset of the global
crisis, fiscal and current account balances turned negative, inflation rose sharply, and
the collapse of the fourth largest bank triggered a crisis in the banking sector.

The economy has recovered substantially since 2009, driven mainly by the rapid
rebound of copper prices (see figure 1.1). The economy was also supported in the initial
stages by comprehensive and strong macroeconomic adjustment government policies,
international budget and balance of payments support, and technical assistance.
However, the policies introduced in the wake of the crisis were not implemented.
Following the increase of copper prices, the government set aside the fiscal rules, and
the coalition government elected in 2012 embarked on expansionary policies, putting
the country back on to an unsustainable path.

SOCIAL DEVELOPMENT
Poverty incidence has declined substantially over the evaluation period. Poverty fell to
an average of 27.4 percent in 2012, although it remained higher in rural (35.5 percent)
than in urban areas (23.2 percent). Nomadic families, households headed by women,
and recent urban migrants tend to register higher rates of poverty incidence. Inequality
in household per capita consumption increased from 32.9 percent in 2003 to 36.5 percent
in 2008, as measured by the Gini coefficient.

Substantial progress has also been made with respect to several of the Millennium
Development Goals. Maternal and infant mortality rates have steadily fallen over the

past two decades. There is near universal literacy, and primary and secondary school
gross enrollment is over 90 percent. Mongolia’s gender gap in health and education
favors women rather than men. By contrast, female unemployment in 2008 was 38
percent higher than for men, rising significantly from 18 percent in 2004.


Evaluation Objectives and Report Structure
This CPE evaluates the World Bank Group’s operations in Mongolia from FY05–13. It
covers one completed Country Assistance Strategy (CAS) for FY05–08, an Interim
Strategy Note (ISN) for 2009–2010, and part of the ongoing Country Partnership
Strategy (CPS) for FY13–17.

This report is part of the cluster CPE for resource rich developing countries. Each CPE
assesses whether the Bank Group assistance supported relevant objectives; if it achieved
them effectively and efficiently; and whether institutional development impact was
achieved in a sustainable way.

To maintain consistency across the analyses for the four countries, each evaluation
follows a similar organizing framework around the core development challenges that
arise from a high dependency on natural resources:

       Maintaining macroeconomic and fiscal stability;
       Improving governance and institutions for the effective use of resources;
       Enhancing economic diversification and growth in nonresource sectors; and
       Promoting human capital development and poverty reduction.

In addition, each CPE reviews Bank Group operations around the two cross-cutting
themes of gender and environment, as incorporated in the country program.

This report has seven chapters. Chapter 2 summarizes the Bank Group’s strategies and
provides an overall assessment of its strategic approach. Chapters 3 to 6 assess the
relevance and effectiveness of the Bank Group's activities around the four pillars. The
concluding chapter draws lessons and recommendations for future Bank Group
engagement in Mongolia.

2. World Bank Group Assistance to Mongolia
This chapter presents the strategy pursued by the World Bank Group over the FY05–13
evaluation period and assesses its relevance.


Bank Group Strategy: FY05–13
Bank assistance during the period of this evaluation was guided by three strategy
documents.1 The first country assistance strategy (CAS) covered FY05–08. In view of the
global crisis, the country team interrupted the preparation of the next CAS and instead
prepared an Interim Strategy Note (ISN) for 2009–2010. The subsequent country
partnership strategy (CPS) was not prepared until 2012, covering FY13–17. The focus of
the strategy has been evolving along with the shifts in Mongolia’s development
challenges (see table 2.1).

The FY05–08 CAS was well aligned with the government’s 2003 Economic Growth
Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy (EGSPRS). The EGSPRS articulated Mongolia’s
vision to accelerate pro-poor growth and reduce poverty around five development
objectives: (i) ensuring macroeconomic stability and public sector effectiveness; (ii)
supporting production and exports and improving the environment for private sector
led development; (iii) enhancing regional and rural development and environmentally

sustainable development; (iv) fostering sustainable human development; and (v)
promoting good governance and implementing and monitoring the strategy.

However, the development objectives of the EGSPRS and, consequently, the Bank CAS
were not appropriate given the initial conditions and challenges that Mongolia was
starting to face at the time. Following the adoption of the 1997 mining legislation, a
rapid increase occurred in mining exploration licenses. No significant discoveries were
made until the world class Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mine was found in 2001. Even if
the full extent of this discovery was not then known, Bank analytical work had already
noted the growing importance of the mining sector, which by 2002 was becoming a
significant engine of growth. Hence, the CAS’s neglect of the sector is difficult to
understand. Instead, the CAS was drafted as a follow-up to the previous period to
further strengthen the transition process from the pre-1990 economy.

Apart from failing to prioritize the mining sector and the implications of its growth, the
FY05 CAS lacked focus and selectivity. As the CAS was broadly aligned with the newly
adopted Poverty Reduction Strategy, it contained an ambitious agenda encompassing
measures to improve: (i) public sector effectiveness; (ii) the institutional and regulatory
environment for the private sector; (iii) the efficiency of infrastructure investments; (iv)
the capacity to deliver social services; (v) governance and management of the
environment; (vi) municipal service delivery in peri-urban areas; and (vii) on livestock
losses during extreme winters in rural areas.

The FY05 CAS was never implemented as the Bank program was realigned to reflect the
changes that were occurring. The Bank Country Director who took over in 2005, when
the CAS was being approved, realized that the relevance of the Bank’s strategy
depended on engaging in extractives issues. Therefore, the Bank quickly embarked on
realigning and streamlining its program to reflect the prospect of substantial new
mining revenues. The Country Director decided to target three areas for support: the
mining-related regulatory framework (mining laws and environment law) and
infrastructure, fiscal management, and service delivery to reach the poor. This was an
unusual choice as the Bank rarely focused its program on mining-related issues, likely
because of perceived reputational risks. By making this critical choice, the Bank
program became highly relevant. Indeed, the Bank positioned itself as a key partner for
the government of Mongolia.

During the 2008 economic crisis, the country team adjusted the strategic direction of the
program to address economic vulnerabilities and foster the implementation of good
governance reforms. The ISN reflected the priorities of the government to overcome the
financial and economic crisis by improving the management of mining revenues,
ensuring fiscal sustainability, and restoring the confidence in the banking sector. At the

                                                    WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE TO MONGOLIA
same time, the program rightly aimed at protecting the poor and vulnerable groups.
The ISN supported a set of fiscal reforms for which the Bank had been raising
awareness during the preceding three years. Building on this prior engagement, the
Bank utilized the 2008 crisis as an opportunity to push forward implementation of these
reforms and enhance efficiency, transparency, and accountability in the use of mineral
revenues.

The strategy proposed in the FY13–17 CPS suggests that the Bank again needs to clarify
how it will position itself in the evolving Mongolian context. The CPS is aligned with
Mongolia’s comprehensive National Development Strategy. The Bank aims to help
Mongolia build a world-class, mineral-led economy by enhancing the mining economy
in a sustainable and responsible way; building a sustained and diversified basis for
sharing mining wealth equitably; and addressing vulnerabilities. These objectives are
broad, however, and consistent with any number of strategies. Indeed the positioning of
the Bank raises some tricky questions. Mongolia is a small state, and the Bank has
shown that it can operate effectively at the “retail” level. Its multisectoral interventions
in rural Mongolia (discussed in chapter 6) have played a major role in transforming
rural living standards and reducing vulnerability. However, as Mongolia is now able to
raise resources on the financial markets, the Bank may not have the same ability as
before to influence as many sectors. This climate may call for a more modest scope of
interventions, keeping the focus on the key mining-related governance challenges and
helping to strengthen the quality of investment in urban and rural infrastructure.


Risk Assessment and Mitigation
Initially the country team was not realistic in assessing the internal risk associated with
the FY05 CAS, which was submitted to the Board just a few months before the
parliamentary election. The team considered the faltering commitment to the EGPRS on
which the CAS was based to be a minor risk, expecting that if the opposition group
would be elected they would maintain the course of reforms and the poverty reduction
strategy. Given repeated changes in government since 1996 that adversely affected
continuity, the team’s assumption seems overly optimistic. There was no mitigation
strategy in the case that the new government would abandon the EGSPRS. In addition,
although the team accurately identified macroeconomic and governance risks,
including increasing corruption, nowhere are these risks and the probability of their
occurrence linked to a potential mining boom. Also, trade shocks to Mongolia’s major
exports were not seen to be a potential risk. Hence, no mitigation strategy was proposed
to address the impact of boom and bust cycles driven by global commodity price
volatility.

CHAPTER 2
WORLD BANK GROUP ASSISTANCE TO MONGOLIA
The FY13–17 strategy identifies a wide range of internal and external risks that could
jeopardize development outcomes and the Bank Group program, and it flags risks
directly affecting the Bank Group. These include external factors such as a slowdown in
the global economy, climate change, weather variability, and changes in commodity
prices. The strategy also recognizes internal risks linked to political factors, rising
inequality and social perceptions, increased corruption, and limited government
capacity. The strategy also underlines the reputational risk linked to the involvement of
the International Finance Corporation (IFC) in the Oyu Tolgoi Copper mine project
development, and signals the challenge of retaining competent staff in the rapidly
evolving local labor market.


Monitoring and Evaluation
If the FY05–08 CAS, as initially designed to support the EGPRS, had been implemented,
its result framework would have been inadequate. The matrix was too complex and
displayed many weaknesses. It was difficult to link the proposed policy actions that
were supported through Poverty Reduction Support Credits (PRSCs) with some of the
outcomes. There were too many outcomes and milestones, including some with little
relevance. In several cases, the choice of indicators was not the most appropriate. In
other instances, they were overlapping or could not be measured. Lack of detail about
the measurement method was also a constraint.

The results matrices of the ISN and CPS were simpler and the outcomes were better
aligned with the Bank Group’s activities. Overall indicators are more relevant and
measurable with the baseline and targeted value defined in most cases. Efforts were
made to improve the adequacy of the causal chain between targeted outcomes and
milestones and projected or ongoing lending and analytical work.


Donor Coordination
The Bank Group is seen as an influential and constructive partner by the donor
community and often plays a leading role. Mongolia does not have a formal framework
whereby donors coordinate aid through pooled sector funds or joint strategies.
Nevertheless, development partners are cooperating to avoid overlapping efforts
through regular information sharing. Whenever donors provide joint support, such as
during the 2008 crisis, they make efforts to avoid duplication in conditionality. This was
the case, for example, in the assistance provided by the International Monetary Fund
(IMF), World Bank, and Asian Development Bank (ADB) to support reforms aimed at
stabilizing the banking sector, fostering sustainable fiscal policies, and improving the
targeting of social transfers in some sectors. Mongolia seems to be a best practice

example of how Bank and IMF cooperation contributed to the quality of the legislative
framework that the government was able to put in place. The Sustainable Livelihoods
Program has also become a platform to engage other donors that sought to support
rural Mongolia. The program benefited from trust funds from the European Union,
Japan, Korea, and Switzerland.

Mongolia has grown out of reliance on external development assistance because of its
ability to tap into international financial markets. Consequently, there has been little
interest in promoting expanded donor coordination. The Bank Country Manager in
Ulaanbaatar has taken some initiative in recent years to call informal meetings of the
key donors (i.e., the Bank Group, ADB, the U.S. Agency for International Development,
and the Japan International Cooperation Agency) as well as the IMF and the United
Nations Development Programme to exchange information and share the Bank’s
economic analyses.

3. Macroeconomic and Public Financial
Management Policies
Chapter 3 covers activities related to addressing the risks to macroeconomic and fiscal
sustainability posed by the short-term volatility and medium-term cycle of natural
resource prices, and to improving public financial management (PFM) from the
standpoint of the efficient and effective use of the resources generated from both
mineral taxation and other sources.


Results
Over the review period, Mongolia has averaged around 8 percent growth in gross
domestic product (GDP) per year. During the first four years of the evaluation period,
growth was driven by increased mineral exports and high levels of foreign direct
investment (FDI) attracted by the discoveries of substantial copper, gold, and coal
deposits. This resulted in investment in the construction and services required to
explore and exploit the deposits that had been found. From 2008 to 2010, growth
slowed and turned negative in 2009 as commodity prices fell sharply during the global
economic crisis. Starting in mid-2010, the economy experienced a rapid recovery
following the rebound of commodity prices and the fiscal and monetary stimulus
provided by the government and the central bank (i.e., Bank of Mongolia [BOM]). The
slower than expected start-up of the Oyu Tolgoi copper mine meant that exports grew
slowly. The surge of imports i response to increased domestic demand resulted in a
large current account deficit on the balance of payments and a substantial depreciation
of the currency. Hence, Mongolia’s economy has been increasingly linked to
developments in the global minerals market (see figure 1.1). Table 3.1 shows the key
indicators for the Mongolian economy during the three phases of the review period.

PRIOR TO THE CRISIS OF 2004–2007
In 2004, the potential availability of substantial mineral resources was rapidly becoming
apparent, although the scale was not yet evident. Later, proposals to develop huge
copper and coal reserves, and the associated increase in construction and service
activities, made it clear that Mongolia was going to benefit from very large royalty
earnings relative to the small size of its population. The government introduced child
support transfer payments, initially targeted but with substantial leakages. With an
election looming, the payments were made universal in 2007 at a level that, even with
growing revenues, was fiscally unsustainable. This first phase saw a sharp increase in
dependence on mining exports, which rose from 55 percent of total exports in the early
2000s to 84 percent in 2008. Mining also contributed 31 percent of total government
revenues in 2008.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CRISIS AND QUICK RECOVERY, 2008–2010
The financial crisis of 2008 and the attendant fall in the prices of copper and coal led to
an economic slowdown. By February 2009, copper prices were 65 percent below their
level of June 2008. The resulting decline in export earnings and the government’s
mineral revenues opened up large deficits on both the fiscal and external accounts.
Growth in 2009 became negative for the first time during the decade, and the
commercial banking sector was at serious risk. The experience of Mongolia’s

CHAPTER 3
MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
vulnerability to fiscal shocks led to the passage in 2010 of the Fiscal Stability Law (FSL),
which set new fiscal rules and a stabilization fund (see appendix C).

The rebound of commodity prices in the course of 2009 led to a quick economic
recovery in 2010. The growth rate in 2010 recovered to 6.5 percent and would have been
higher except for the abnormally cold winter that resulted in substantial loss of
livestock. With an election scheduled for 2012, the government shifted to a highly
expansionary policy in 2010. Instead of moving to targeted social transfers, the
government replaced the child transfer program with a much broader universal cash
transfer drawn from the Human Development Fund, which had been created in 2009.
This left little fiscal space for other programs such as investment in the infrastructure
needed to support minerals development.

RUN-UP TO ELECTIONS AND THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD, 2011–2013
Given the fiscal constraints approved by parliament, the government turned to off-
budget financing for its programs. In 2011, the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM)1
was founded as an institution with the capacity to fund investments that were not
subject to the agreed ceilings. Not only was its financing off budget, but it was also not
subject to government procurement rules. It was funded by a combination of domestic
borrowing and an international bond issue of $580 million with a government
guarantee. In an effort to rein in off-budget expenditures and support the
implementation of the FSL, an Integrated Budget Law (IBL) was approved in December
2011. It mandated that only projects that have gone through a proper appraisal process
would be considered for financing. According to the IBL, all financing decisions would
be made by the Ministry of Finance. In 2012, a new Social Welfare Law (SWL) was
approved and replaced universal cash transfers with means-tested benefits. At the time
of this evaluation, the law has not yet been implemented.

The 2012 elections brought in a new coalition government that embarked on an
expansionary fiscal program. In September 2012 as part of the agreement between the
coalition partners, a new Ministry of Economic Development was established with
responsibility for planning the capital budget. By this time, the scale of Mongolia’s
mineral wealth was clear. Ulaanbaatar had become a frequent stop for investment
bankers who were advising the government that the highly liquid international capital
market could provide a huge amount of potential new funding. In December 2012, the
new government borrowed $1.5 billion, the so-called Chinggis bond, to fund both
public infrastructure investments and private sector projects through the DBM.
Mongolia was able to secure rates of 4.125 percent on $500 million of 5-year money, and
5.125 percent on $1 billion of 10-year money. The issue was hugely oversubscribed. The
Ministry of Economic Development was instrumental in launching the bond issue,
drawing up a list of off-budget public investment projects, and channeling these

                                      MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
projects through the DBM2 to start implementing them outside of the budget. Many of
these projects were inadequately prepared. A second, smaller part of the funding was
earmarked for a host of public and private ventures in services and manufacturing.3

The expansionary impact of these fiscal policies was exacerbated by the policies of the
BOM, which added a monetary stimulus to the fiscal expansion. During 2013, the BOM
embarked on three expansionary programs equivalent to 20 percent of GDP, according
to the International Monetary Fund (IMF). The first of these was a price stabilization
program of low-cost funding to corporations whose price-setting behavior has a
significant impact on the consumer price index, for example, wholesale distributors of
meat, flour, and imported petroleum products. The liquidity injection provided banks
with funding in the form of one-year time deposits at 7 percent interest to reverse the
downward trend in lending growth. The mortgaging program and housing supply
support loans aimed to provide low-cost mortgage loans to qualified consumers. The
housing supply support provides low-cost funding to construction companies and real
estate developers, which has contributed to a real estate bubble in apartment
construction in the capital.

During 2013, it became clear that there were likely to be shortfalls against the levels of
exports projected from the new mining development. The second phase of the Oyu
Tolgoi copper project, a major joint venture between the government of Mongolia and
Rio Tinto, was marked by a stand-off between the government and the company on
handling cost overruns The generation of revenue of this second phase, (which was
essentially the underground mining part of the project), was no longer likely to begin as
planned. In mid-2014, a lengthy negotiation was under way, with the International
Finance Corporation as a participant. In addition, the government introduced a foreign
investment law requiring parliamentary approval of all investments with majority
foreign ownership. It had a chilling effect on new exploration activity, and FDI
experienced a sharp slowdown. Although the law was subsequently amended, foreign
investors remain hesitant, waiting to see the outcome of the Oyu Tolgoi negotiations.

      Thus far, there is only a rhetorical commitment to a more measured approach to
       fiscal stability and better risk management. In practice, the policies have added to
       the risks. With the delays in resource revenues to meet social transfer payments,
       the government borrowed against future coal deliveries from the large Tavan
       Tolgoi coal mining project. The expansionary fiscal and monetary policies not
       only kept growth rates high at 12.5 percent, but also contributed to a large deficit
       on the current account of the balance of payments as import demand grew and
       mineral exports slowed. This led to a sharp depreciation of the togrog. Far from
       adopting better prioritization and preparation of public investment, the
       government is considering a follow-up Chinggis bond, which could finance more

MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
       marginal projects. The IMF defines the current set of policies as the “weak policy
       scenario” if maintained.


Bank Group Objectives
Over the review period, the Bank has consistently considered public financial
management a priority area for its support to Mongolia. The Bank’s specific objectives
in the macro-fiscal context relate closely to the phase in which particular strategies were
developed and implemented.

As discussed, when the FY04 CAS was prepared, there was no clear appreciation of the
dominant role that mineral exports were likely to play as a source of government
revenues and growth in Mongolia. The macro-fiscal objectives therefore did not reflect
Mongolia’s emerging status as a resource-rich country. The CAS was primarily
concerned with the macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability of the economy. It
underlined the need to improve utilization of limited public resources. In addition,
under the heading of public sector effectiveness, the CAS cited the need for better
expenditure prioritization and improvement in the quality of infrastructure
investments. These are generic objectives, applicable to almost every Bank borrowing
member country, and reflect the fact that the special problems of mineral resource
dependence had not yet been internalized. The results framework focused on more
transparent and timely budgeting and a more careful prioritization of the public
investment program.

The new Bank country management that took over in 2005 and 2006 realigned the
Bank’s objectives to reflect the prospect of substantial new revenues. With the scale of
Mongolia’s mineral resources becoming publicly known, the government was faced
with political pressure to increase expenditures at an unsustainable pace. The IMF and
the Bank began to create awareness of the risks of price volatility associated with
dependence on mineral exports and the need for fiscal stability and countercyclical
expenditure management. Simultaneously, the Bank aimed at engaging the government
on the issue of targeting social transfers to the country’s poorest groups.

The 2009 Mongolia Interim Strategy Note (ISN) emphasized the immediate crisis
management needs. The ISN, which provided a good diagnosis of Mongolia’s exposure
to the risks associated with commodity price dependence, advocated a two-pronged
strategy for Bank support in the fiscal management area. First, in the short term, it
intended to provide support for Mongolia’s fiscal adjustment in the context of the
global crisis. Second, in the medium term, it aimed to help the government introduce
more sustainable PFM arrangements based on transparent fiscal rules and improved

                                     MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
accountability for expenditure decisions. The ISN results framework was geared to
these priorities with an emphasis on the need for appropriate funding arrangements to
maintain infrastructure, which was being squeezed out by other expenditures given the
tightness of the budget during the global economic crisis.

The latest Country Partnership Strategy (CPS, FY13–17) accurately identifies the need
for a robust fiscal policy as the central development challenge facing the country.4 The
CPS highlights a broad agenda of fiscal policy reforms including: (i) improved targeting
of social benefits; (ii) proper budgeting for maintenance of public infrastructure; (iii)
subsidy reduction through tariff realignment in the utility sector; (iv) improved
sustainability of the pension system; and (v) rationalization of health and education
financing to ensure improvements in equity and efficiency. However, the results
framework for the CPS is light on the macro-fiscal area, with much of the focus on
decentralization. It is difficult to discern a coherent results train linking the results
framework outcomes to the objectives defined in the CPS.

In conclusion, although the emphasis of the Bank’s support program objectives for PFM
in Mongolia has shifted over time, the core directions have been fairly stable over the
review period. Four broad directions can be discerned from an analysis of the program
documents:

      Support the countercyclical use of resources to smooth volatility, promote
       macroeconomic stability, and ensure sustainable growth over the longer-term.
      Build the legal, regulatory, and incentive frameworks needed to improve the
       transparency and efficiency of PFM.
      Strengthen individual and institutional capacity.
      Enhance the development impact of public expenditures, including investment
       prioritization, preparation, and implementation.


Bank Group Contribution to Results
On the whole, both the World Bank and IMF provide a lukewarm assessment of
progress on the macroeconomic and financial management front. According to the most
recent IMF assessment, budgeting is still procyclical, and Mongolia’s fiscal framework
remains unsustainable (IMF 2012). In its review of the Mongolia CAS (FY05–08) and
ISN (2009–2010), the Independent Evaluation Group (IEG) provides an overall
moderately satisfactory rating. It states, over the CAS period budget disclosure and
management improved, while the reforms on aligning the budget with policies, public
sector efficiency and institutions lagged behind. But Mongolia achieved little or no
progress toward establishing a [Medium-Term Expenditure Framework] MTEF,



                                                                                        15

MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
rationalizing public sector salaries and social transfers, or applying rigorous procedures
for project selection. The financial sustainability of the pension system did not
improve.” Subsequent to the publication of this review, the macro-situation has
deteriorated sharply. Similarly, the recent Implementation Completion and Results
Report (ICR) Review for the 2003 Economic Capacity and Technical Assistance Project,
prepared by IEG in September 2013, rated its development outcome as “unsatisfactory”
(see box 3.1).


 Box 3.1. Progress in Public Financial Management Reforms from 2005 to 2013
 The 2013 ICR Review of the Economic Capacity and Technical Assistance Project (ECTAP)
 presents a summary of the most recent progress with regard to the public financial
 management (PFM) reforms in each of the main program areas:
    Creation of a functional, country-wide treasury system—the Government Financial
     Management Information System (GFMIS)—that greatly enhanced expenditure controls
     and improved payment processing: The GFMIS, supported under the Fiscal Technical
     Assistance Project and ECTAP, was launched in 2005 and is credited with a major
     improvement in budget discipline and a decline in budget arrears by 2011. This is
     commonly considered the single major PFM reform achievement in Mongolia over the
     last decade. However, as of late 2013, system functionality remains underutilized. While
     GFMIS has contributed many of the prerequisites, more needs to be done to improve the
     quality of budget reporting and availability of budget information.
    Budget planning reforms: Progress toward the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework
     was quite limited, with no arrangements in place for the regular preparation and update
     of sectoral expenditure strategies.
    Monitoring: While there are ministry performance indicators in place, these are not yet
     used for management and budget purposes.5
    Investment planning: Project appraisals are mandated in the new Integrated Budget Law
     (adopted in 2011), but they are not being effectively implemented.
    Accounting and auditing reforms: The Ministry of Finance has established an internal
     audit department, but it is still in the process of developing a methodology for internal
     audit of government accounts. While timing of external budget audits has improved, their
     findings are not regularly made public.6
    Procurement: The country’s procurement law was upgraded, and the necessary
     supporting regulations were adopted. But implementation progress has been slow due to
     limited capacity and generously granted exemptions from the competitive bidding
     requirements.


Bank analytic work plays an important role in providing independent monitoring of the
economic situation. The Bank started to prepare periodic economic updates during the
global economic crisis that initially were produced monthly, then quarterly, and now
biannually. They are considered valuable contributions and are a significant input into
the general economic analysis and debate in Mongolia. Although specific outcomes

                                      MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
cannot be attributed to them, the general assessment among donors and counterparts is
that they add value and merit being continued.

Another important part of the program has been the Bank’s efforts to reach out to
parliament and civil society organizations. The objective has been to help generate an
understanding of the risks associated with mineral resource revenues and to support
public demand for good government, efficiency, equity, and an inter-generational
balance in using mineral resources. The Bank’s outreach to parliament has been
substantial, including meetings with members of parliament and parliamentary
committees. The Bank has involved them in its dissemination efforts and study tours,
allowing them to interact with representatives from countries that are ably managing
their mineral resources. The Bank’s analytic work is well publicized in the Mongolian
press, and the views of Bank staff are frequently sought and quoted in the media.


Conclusion
Mongolia is exhibiting the symptoms of the “resource curse,” with unchecked public
spending. This development has been exacerbated by the expansion of off-budget
funding through the DBM and a central bank that appears to use monetary policy to
magnify rather than rein in fiscal excesses. Further, there is a lack of a clear strategy
around managing the exploration and extraction of mineral resources.

The CAS and ISN review that was undertaken prior to the preparation of the new CPS
raised some serious questions about Bank performance. It finds that while the Bank’s
macro-fiscal support in Mongolia properly identified core country needs and priorities,
and was based on good analysis, serious problems arose in both the design of project
interventions and the quality of implementation. The review points to the weak link
between program objectives, policies, and actions to achieve them and the outcomes
specified in the results framework. It attributes this to a failure to adequately reflect
political constraints in program design, which resulted in unrealistic objectives in
several policy areas, including introduction of the MTEF and attempts to reform the
system of social transfers. Also, the Bank failed to gain significant traction in enhanced
public investment planning, which was one of the two main outcomes in both the CAS
and the ISN.

Findings across the four broad directions discerned from analysis of the program
documents are discussed here. Bank support in two other areas mentioned in the
strategy documents, but not included in the results framework, deserve attention,
namely decentralization and the Bank’s efforts to support the demand for good
governance. The findings in each of the six areas are summarized here.

CHAPTER 3
MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
COUNTERCYCLICAL RESOURCE USE
The Bank worked closely with the IMF and other donors to put together a package of
good practice fiscal policy reforms during the crisis, but actual budgeting rapidly
shifted back to procyclical patterns. On the one hand, this donor-supported program
provided a stimulus to prevent even larger economic contraction from taking place, and
on the other, it enabled the package of legislative reforms. Unfortunately, during the
post-crisis phase, the initiative slipped away from the donor community. Demands for
spending mineral resource revenues, even before they actually accrued to the budget,
outstripped the level recommended by the policy makers that were calling for more
prudent and sustainable resource use. The IMF no longer has a representative in
Ulaanbaatar, whereas the Bank and the Ministry of Finance have had difficulty in
engaging and coordinating with the Ministry of Economic Development and the DBM,
which raised and disbursed large sums of money with limited parliamentary oversight
and without being subject to regular government procurement procedures.

BUILDING THE LEGAL, REGULATORY, AND INCENTIVES FRAMEWORK
The Bank has contributed to a major overhaul of the legal and regulatory framework for
budgeting and expenditure management, but implementation of these laws has lagged
in many areas. At this time, the FSL, IBL, and SWL are not being implemented by the
new 2012 political coalition. The Bank also supported the development of a Sovereign
Wealth Fund (SWF), which can provide for offshore management of future resource
inflows in excess of what Mongolia can efficiently invest. The MTEF also appears to be
an area where much effort has met little effect. This partly reflects the rapid expansion
of the economy whereby the levels of expenditures projected in the MTEF were quickly
out of date. At the same time, the movement of much of the investment program off
budget in recent years has made the effective use of the MTEF of less interest. In future,
it will be important for Mongolia to make use of the MTEF, particularly with the
weakness in investment planning and the need for contingent planning and
prioritization in the event of shortfalls in revenues from mineral resources.

BUILDING INDIVIDUAL AND INSTITUTIONAL CAPACITY
In the macro-fiscal area, the Bank’s core effort was focused on the Ministry of Finance,
which for most of the evaluation period was responsible for both the current and capital
budgets. As noted, the ICR Reviews of Bank TA projects question the appropriateness
of the Bank’s approach, arguing that the systems that were supported were too complex
and ambitious and that a more gradual approach would have achieved more. The
evaluation mission noted, however, substantial achievements in the Ministry of Finance
over the period as a whole. The core institutional structures and most of the systems the
Bank helped put into place are working effectively—the mechanics of budgeting have
improved, the treasury system and the Government Financial Management Information

System (GFMIS) associated with it are being utilized and are making an important
contribution to decentralization. In addition, budget procurement has been upgraded,
although off-budget procurement has emerged as a serious problem. These new
systems or procedures are being implemented by a well-trained, articulate, and
thoughtful staff. The delays in completing individual projects reflect overambitious
program design. However, for the review period as a whole, the program seems well
conceived. For example, the contractors for the GFMIS have used Mongolia as a model
for successful implementation and brought teams of officials from the Kyrgyz Republic
and Vietnam to Ulaanbaatar to discuss and learn from their experience.

DEVELOPMENT IMPACT OF PUBLIC INVESTMENTS
The Bank’s inability to get any real traction on capital expenditures has emerged as a
major weakness of its institution building efforts in Mongolia. The last 5-year plan
included 5,000 investment projects, which rendered the plan meaningless. The
incoming country management needs to reposition the Bank to try to extend the close
partnership it has with the Ministry of Finance to the Ministry of Economic
Development as well. The re-merging of the two ministries in October 2014, subsequent
to the country program evaluation (CPE) mission, should provide the potential for the
Bank to provide more effective support for better investment planning and preparation
in Mongolia.

DECENTRALIZATION.
In recent years, support for fiscal decentralization has emerged as a major contribution
of the Bank. Its involvement in rural areas combined with its support for PFM systems
nationwide have given it a unique position in Mongolia, enabling it to identify the
needs of local communities and help put in place the mechanisms designed to serve
those needs. The IBL is now in place, and regulations have been issued. The perception
in official circles is that the Bank’s actions have brought forward the implementation of
effective decentralization by several years. However, much remains to be done, and
local officials are far from satisfied with the arrangements for budget transfers. In
addition, local capacity needs to be strengthened, particularly with regard to
procurement.

SUPPORT FOR GOOD GOVERNANCE.
Mongolia was one of six countries within the East Asia and Pacific Region, selected as a
World Bank Country Governance and Anti-Corruption pilot. This, like other
complementary funding streams, freed up funding and resources for research, analysis
and stakeholder engagement. For example, the Bank’s major program of outreach to the
Mongolian parliament recognizes that in the context of closely contested democratic
elections, it is important to reach out both to politicians and the public. The consensus

MACROECONOMIC AND PUBLIC FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT POLICIES
among independent interlocutors is that the Bank has done a good job of engaging with
parliament. Bank staffers have made presentations to parliamentary committees, and
the Bank’s involvement has been instrumental in securing passage of some of the key
legislation. Going beyond parliament, Bank reports have been widely disseminated and
have received considerable coverage in the media. The Bank has supported capacity
building for journalists through a local think tank and other outreach programs, such as
financial and economic literacy for the public at large. The Bank needs to continue its
efforts to persuade the population that: (i) the ability to borrow abroad (with less
favorable interest rates and maturities than those of the International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development [IBRD]) is not proof of national maturity; (ii) the use
of resources on overdesigned and under-maintained infrastructure will create new
burdens for the future; and (iii) untargeted social transfers are not sustainable. This task
will be challenging in the highly politicized environment of economic policy making in
Mongolia.

Whereas the Bank has made impressive progress in helping Mongolia put in place the
necessary conditions for fiscal sustainability, the political context has resulted in
outcomes that are moderately unsatisfactory. No consensus yet exists around the need
for a responsible fiscal policy. Short-term political priorities have overwhelmed the
efforts of both Finance Ministry officials and donor institutions to support prudent
fiscal management for sustainable growth. In this environment, it is difficult to see what
more the Bank could have done to foster political will. This rating of moderately
unsatisfactory (table 3.2) does not reflect Bank performance7 (as measured in the review
of country assistance or partnership strategies), but rather the lack of sustainable results
in the current political setting of Mongolia. The Bank’s ability to take a longer view, to
maintain a consistent presence, and to exploit the synergies between its various
operations could be an important contributor if and when economic populism ceases to
dominate policy making.

1The Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM), a state-owned bank, had many weaknesses including
insufficient clarity around its mandate, excessive authority by the parliament to dictate finance of
projects, thereby compromising DBM’s independence. There was also a lack of clarity around who the
government shareholder is, lack of sufficient independence for the board, lack of clear supervision
function, and excessive authority to lend funds (50 times equity) (Hasnain and others 2013).

4. Strengthening Mineral and Environmental
Management
This chapter reviews the Bank’s contribution to strengthening mineral and
environmental management during the evaluation period. The World Bank Group has
been involved in Mongolia’s mining sector since 1991. Its activities included stabilizing
operations at the Erdenet Copper Mine, rehabilitating the Baganuur Coal Mine,
reforming the legal and regulatory frameworks, and various initiatives to promote
investment in the mining sector.


Context
Some of the world’s richest mineral deposits, including gold, copper, uranium, and
coal, have been found in Mongolia. Following the passage of the Mineral Law of 1997,
an exploration boom driven by foreign direct investment resulted in the discovery of an
impressive pipeline of potential world-class mining projects, including the Oyu Tolgoi
copper and gold mine and the Tayan Tolgoi coal mine in the South Gobi province. As a
result, by 2002, the mining sector was already accounting for about 9 percent of GDP, 49
percent of industrial output, and 40 percent of export earnings. A mining boom was,
indeed, in the making.

The wealth of mineral resources offered the potential for a major contribution to the
country’s growth, but its continued development depended on the government’s ability
to manage the attendant challenges and ensure sound governance for the sector. Aside
from macroeconomic management risks discussed in chapter 3, the specific challenges
related to the need to ensure that the policy framework remained attractive to foreign
investors and that the resources would be developed in an environmentally sound and
socially sustainable manner. In Mongolia, the legal and regulatory framework for the
sector was attractive to foreign investors, but there was concern about a lack of
implementing regulations, especially those related to minerals taxation. In addition, the
continued development of the sector needed to be supported by a major expansion of
the country’s infrastructure, including power, water, and transportation.

The expansion of the mining sector will also increase the pressure on the country’s
fragile natural environment. As the least densely populated country in the world,
Mongolia’s environment is relatively unspoiled. It encompasses large undisturbed
tracts of boreal forest, steppe ecosystems, and the Gobi Desert. These ecosystems
support a semi-nomadic culture for about 40 percent of the population and provide a

STRENGTHENING MINERAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
habitat for a variety of wildlife. However, overgrazing, forest degradation, and
deforestation were negatively affecting biodiversity— key sources of fuel, and vital
watersheds. Over the past decade, Mongolia’s rapid economic transformation had
opened up large areas to mostly unregulated development, which increased
environmental pressures, especially in the South Gobi where the largest mining projects
were planned.

Rapid economic and population growth has also seriously worsened air pollution in
Ulaanbaatar, resulting in high levels of respiratory diseases. The main contributor to
exposure to fine particulates, especially in winter, was the burning of low quality raw
lignite in traditional stoves in the ger areas that cover the hillsides around the city. Dust
from unpaved roads, power plants, industrial boilers, vehicle exhaust, and lack of
greenery also contributed to significant concentrations of particulate matter which can
reach a level that is 10 times higher than Mongolian air quality standards. A major
driver was the influx of largely low-income migrants, who account for more than 60
percent of the city’s population, in turn leading to a rapid expansion of ger areas.


Results
IMPROVING MINING POLICIES AND RELATED INSTITUTIONS
Over the past decade, the vicissitudes of foreign investment in mining have been
strongly influenced by changes in Mongolian mineral laws and policies. These changes
created great uncertainty about the government’s attitude toward foreign investment.

        The Mining Law of 1997 reflected a private sector-led development strategy with
         mining as the lead sector. However, in 2006, this law was amended to increase
         the role of the state by mandating a 34 percent state equity ownership in every
         strategically important mining investment. Erdenes MGL was established in 2007
         as a state-owned limited liability company to hold and manage the government’s
         shares. A Windfall Profits Tax, enacted in 2006, led to a significant loss in
         competitiveness, but was later repealed in 2011.
        The Oyu Tolgoi mining agreement in 2009 boosted investor confidence.
         However, cost overruns and delays in dividend payments expected by the
         government produced a backlash against foreign investors, leading to years of
         still unresolved renegotiations.
        Growing domestic concerns about the extent to which the mining sector was
         becoming dominated by foreign enterprises led to a 2010 moratorium on new
         exploration licenses, including a ban on the transfer of mining licenses, which
         has hampered the entry of new investors. These concerns also led to the
         enactment of the Strategic Entities Foreign Investment Law in 2012, which

                                           STRENGTHENING MINERAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
       restricts foreign ownership in the mining, banking, and media sectors, and
       further damaged investor confidence. Given continuing uncertainties, a
       resolution of protracted discussions around a $4.5 billion financing package put
       together by the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and the Multilateral
       Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) for Phase II of the Oyu Tolgoi project is
       expected to serve as a major signal about the government’s attitude toward
       foreign investment.

As part of its strategy to attract foreign investors, Mongolia has joined the Extractive
Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI). Starting in 2005, it committed to the full
disclosure of payments made by and received from mining sector enterprises. A
multistakeholder process—involving the government, industry, and civil society
organizations (CSOs)—was established. Mongolia issued its first EITI report in 2008 and
became fully compliant in 2010. More recently, the program has been expanding its
scope to meet the additional requirements that EITI adopted in 2013, which require
disaggregation by company and region, information on social investments, and
disclosure of licenses and contracts.

Nonetheless, the overall quality of governance remains a concern and threatens to
undermine the country’s realization of the full benefits from its resource endowment.
The Revenue Watch Institute’s 2013 Resource Governance Index gives Mongolia a
“partial” score of 51/100, ranking it 26 out of 58 resource-rich countries. It rates the
institutional and legal setting as “satisfactory” based on a clear revenue collection
mechanism and reporting requirements, including for environmental impact
assessments. Mongolia’s reporting practices are rated as “failing” since little
information is made public about mineral deposits to be licensed. The safeguards and
quality controls are rated as “weak,” reflecting a lack of public oversight of Erdenes
MGL, which publishes no financial reports. Finally, the enabling environment is rated
as “weak,” given the high level of corruption documented by Transparency
International and low overall government effectiveness.

IMPROVING ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES AND RELATED INSTITUTIONS
Mongolia’s environmental management framework has been gradually reformed and
strengthened. In 2004, the government adopted the more-integrated river basin
approach for water resource management. Since then, river basin boards were
established and became operational for six of the country’s 29 river basins, with priority
given to the South Gobi and the Tuul River, where Ulaanbaatar is located.
Environmental control legislation has been updated and modernized, including an
amended Law on Air Pollution in 2011, a Water Protection Law in 2012, and an updated
Law on Environmental Impact Assessment in 2012 that mandates the disclosure of and
public consultations on environmental assessments for all major investment projects.


                                                                                           25
CHAPTER 4
STRENGTHENING MINERAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Despite these policy and institutional reforms, enforcement has been lagging, and
environmental conditions have not improved. Particulate matter pollution in
Ulaanbaatar still exceeds applicable standards, and ranks among the highest
worldwide. The Tuul River has become heavily polluted, causing frequent fish kills and
endangering the capital’s water supply. The share of land covered by forests has
continued to decline, from 7.3 percent in 2000 to 7 percent in 2010, mainly because of
illegal cutting. The increased use of energy, mostly carbon based, has led to a growth in
carbon dioxide emissions per capita from 3.1 tons in 2000 to 4.2 tons in 2010.

The growth of the mining sector is exacerbating environmental pressures. Major issues
are emerging in water resources management with growing competition among
mining, livestock, ecological conservation flows, and human consumption. Most
important, the ongoing and planned mining developments in southern Mongolia will
require significant quantities of groundwater whose abstraction could have a major
impact on local communities and herders.


Bank Group Objectives
SUPPORTING THE MINING SECTOR
Although the FY05 CAS did not have an explicit strategy for supporting the
development of the mining sector, the new country team subsequently integrated
mining issues into the program. Whereas the document refers to the importance of
creating an adequate policy environment for the mineral sector, the CAS matrix does
not address this. This is a significant omission given the rapidly growing prominence of
the sector, and the fact that a comprehensive World Bank Group mining sector report,
issued in early 2004, had highlighted the critical issues (Husband and Songwe 2004).
After the strategy was issued, the new country team took on mining issues in earnest. In
2008, a senior mining specialist was placed in the Bank’s Ulaanbaatar office to
spearhead the mining dialogue and to support the Mining Sector Technical Assistance
Project (MSISTAP). The full integration of the mining sector into the assistance strategy
was heralded with the official launch of the Bank’s mining sector report in Ulaanbaatar
in March 2005, over a year after the report had been published.

The 2009 ISN retroactively presented a comprehensive strategy for supporting the
development of the mining sector, which is carried over in the FY13 Country Program
Strategy (CPS). In the 2009 ISN, the development of the mining sector became a major
strategic area for Bank Group engagement. The expected outcomes include the
development of a sound regulatory environment, institutional capacity, and
infrastructure for world-class mining. In the CPS, the mining sector has been placed
front and center in the proposed results matrix. Although not mentioned in the ISN, the

                                         STRENGTHENING MINERAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
Bank has actively collaborated with several donors for the implementation of the sector
strategy.1

SUPPORTING ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
In contrast to the absence of mining, the FY05-08 CAS included a broad goal for
environmental management. The CAS commits the Bank Group to strengthening
environmental and natural resource management, mainly by supporting reforms in the
institutional and legal framework. In the 2009–2010 ISN and the FY13–17 CPS, the only
purely environmental objective relates to reducing winter air pollution by supporting
the development and adoption of abatement options.


Bank Group Contribution to Results
STRENGTHENING MINERAL RESOURCE MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
The Bank Group’s interventions were designed to address the full range of the
extractive industries value chain. This encompasses awarding contracts and licenses,
monitoring operations, enforcing environmental protection and social mitigation
requirements, collecting taxes, distributing revenue in a sound manner, and
implementing sustainable development policies and projects (Mayorga-Alba 2009).
With respect to the first part of this value chain, the expected outcomes in the 2009 –2010
ISN comprised: (i) the review and clarification of mining laws and policies—including
taxation issues—and the adoption of a standard investment agreement for mining
concessions; (ii) the reform of state mining enterprise governance; (iii) compliance with
EITI; and (iv) identification of key infrastructure and environmental options for
southern Mongolia. This comprehensive approach was underpinned from 2008 to 2011
by the placement of a full-time mining specialist in the Bank’s Ulaanbaatar office.

The Bank supported the clarification and amendment of mining laws and policies
through a wide-ranging program of technical assistance (TA) and policy dialogue,
backed up by the development policy credits (DPCs). The main TA instrument was the
MSISTAP, which was designed to establish key pieces of the policy, fiscal, legal,
regulatory, and institutional framework for the mining and extractive sector that would
meet the needs of the public sector, industry, and civil society.

The implementation of the most important policy measures prepared under MSISTAP
was supported by the two DPCs. In 2009, the first helped clarify Mongolia’s mining
policy—including taxation and the state’s equity participation in new ventures—and
incorporated responsible mining practices consistent with the Equator Principles.2 The
second DPC in 2010–2011, supported the development of a mining tax policy paper;




                                                                                         27

revision of the mining cadaster operations and processes; and online placement of
Environmental Impact Assessments (EIAs) for mining and other projects.

To date, while the laws and policies have been reviewed, their clarification remains a
work in progress. In spite of concerted efforts, a standard investment agreement does
not yet exist. The MSISTAP supported the preparation of a draft model mineral
development agreement, which was adopted in 2009 prior to the first DPC. The 2009
signing of the Oyu Tolgoi mining agreement was intended to signal the adoption of
such a standard agreement. But the fact that it is still being renegotiated five years later
makes it unlikely that it can serve as a model for the future.

The reform of the public holding company, Erdenes MGL,3 expected to be in line with
the principles of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, is also
still a work in progress. The MSISTAP has been instrumental in supporting the
company’s establishment as a holding company with modern corporate structures and
policies. This includes the preparation of an initial charter and regulations and a
corporate strategy, as well as management and governance-related training.
Nevertheless, political influence remains strong, and key measures remain to be taken
to ensure that its financial reporting and corporate governance practices are up to
international standards.

The Bank’s support for EITI included TA and capacity building to the government and
CSO stakeholders.4 As of 2014, Mongolia’s EITI has made a positive contribution to tax
payments and revenue management, but there is little evidence of any impact on
governance and accountability. Based on interviews with key stakeholders, the
extended and intensive EITI-mandated validation process can be credited with having
reduced tax disputes and improved the mining industry’s compliance with applicable
taxes. Another important impact has been to demonstrate the feasibility of the
multistakeholder approach for discussing issues of public interest. Indeed, it has
become more familiar for government officials and has facilitated opportunities for
CSOs to become involved in other areas, such as budget monitoring and environmental
management.

As an integral part of the Bank’s strategy for the mining sector, the Bank supported
studies that identified the potential impacts associated with the major forthcoming
mining projects in the South Gobi. These studies, looking mainly at the Oyun Tolgoi
and Tavan Tolgoi mining projects, recommended options for addressing environmental
impacts through the development of towns, transport infrastructure, energy, and water
resources, as well as the management of environmental issues. The Mining
Infrastructure Investment Support Project followed directly from the findings of these
studies. Its objective is to facilitate investments in infrastructure to support mining and

                                         STRENGTHENING MINERAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT
downstream processing activities and to build local capacity to prepare infrastructure
projects.

STRENGTHENING ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT AND INSTITUTIONS
In 2005, the Bank was entrusted with the management of the Netherlands–Mongolia
Trust Fund for Environmental Reform. Its objectives were to: (i) establish sound
baselines of knowledge for environment and natural resources; (ii) raise the visibility of
environmental affairs at the local and national levels; (iii) broaden the participation of
local communities in environmental activities; and (iv) help the Ministry of Nature and
Environment to prioritize responses among the many environment and natural
resource issues the country was facing.

The Bank became instrumental in raising the profile of the environmental agenda with
the government, as well as in helping to promote a vibrant civil society response. Field
interviews confirmed that the project’s promotion of environmental messages raised
public awareness of the issues and contributed to their inclusion in every political
party’s campaign platform. Its support for the Environmental Management Plan and
the National Environmental Action Plan directly contributed to the expansion of the
Ministry of Environment’s mandate and power, and enabled it to take a lead role in
preparing the government’s Green Development Strategy. A small grants program
played an important role in strengthening the capacity and increasing the number of
environmental nongovernmental organizations from a very low base. Also, while the
online posting of EIAs (a prior action under the second DPC) is not yet universally
enforced, its implementation for most mining and other major projects represented an
important step toward enhancing transparency and providing opportunities for CSO
participation in the discussion of sector-related issues.

Another area of the Bank’s environmental focus has been the issue of air quality in
Ulaanbaatar. A 2007 Bank report reviewed the challenges and opportunities for
providing cleaner and more energy efficient heating stoves and fuels as one of the
options for addressing the city’s serious air pollution problem (World Bank 2009). A
subsequent 2011 Bank stud5y concluded that Ulaanbaatar was the most polluted capital
in the world, with associated health impacts estimated at about 19 percent of the city’s
GDP (World Bank 2011). The study also evaluated the major abatement options and
recommended a strategy that has informed the design of the Bank’s Ulaanbaatar Clean
Air Project (UBCAP) and parallel projects by the Millennium Challenge Corporation,
the Asian Development Bank, and other donors (World Bank 2012).

The Bank’s involvement with the city’s air pollution problem, including through its
analytical work, helped define and launch a multi-donor effort to address the issues.
The IEG mission confirmed that the Bank-supported studies on air quality management


                                                                                         29

had played a major role in developing the city’s strategy for reducing air pollution,
which is being implemented with the assistance of several donors. As part of these
studies, the UBCAP is testing, selecting, and distributing improved stoves, which have
now been delivered to about 85 percent of ger households. The stoves6 have already led
to a 10-15 percent reduction in peak particulate levels in Ulaanbaatar. The UBCAP is
also laying the groundwork for the strategy’s next steps by helping establish a testing
laboratory, by encouraging the development of better and affordable stoves, and by
coordinating with the Japan International Cooperation Agency to strengthen
Ulaanbaatar’s air quality monitoring agency.


Conclusions
The Bank Group has helped establish the underpinnings for improved mineral sector
management, but full implementation will depend on unpredictable political dynamics.
Overall, the contribution to strengthening the management of the mining sector was
moderately satisfactory. The Bank Group’s support was highly appreciated and
contributed to institutional strengthening and an understanding of sector issues.
However, aside from EITI compliance, the expected outcomes of the Bank’s
interventions are taking longer to achieve than planned. In addition, the ongoing fiscal
and economic crisis has severely curtailed the ability of government agencies to
continue financing and building on the improvements brought about by Bank projects,
thereby jeopardizing some of the achievements.7

The Bank Group’s interventions were instrumental in reforming and strengthening the
environmental management framework, although enforcement has lagged. The
contribution in the strengthening of environmental management was satisfactory (table
4.1). The Bank helped to raise the profile of the environmental agenda with the
government and promote a vibrant civil society constituency to support it. Its studies on
air quality management played a major role in developing Ulaanbaatar’s strategy for
reducing air pollution, and the UBCAP is contributing to its implementation in
coordination with several major donors. The IFC and MIGA’s involvement with Oyu
Tolgoi as well as IFC’s support—through MSC Holdings (Energy Resources)—for a
coking coal project in Tavan Tolgoi helped integrate internationally acceptable
performance standards for environmental and social management in the two largest
mining projects currently under way.

of an electronic system for preparing the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI) reports to
enhance its timeliness and accessibility to the public. The Swiss Agency for Development and
Cooperation is supporting the government’s strategy for managing artisanal mining issues, following an
initial launch by the Bank Group’s Communities, Artisanal, and Small-Scale Mining Program. The
assessment of the South Gobi’s water resources, initiated under the Bank’s Netherlands -Mongolia Trust
Fund for Environmental Reform (known as NEMO), has become a $7.4 million project funded by the
Australian aid agency, AusAID. AusAID has also funded the Responsible Mining Initiative, a civil
society-industry network established to understand and address the impacts of mining on local
communities. German Technical Cooperation is supporting an environmental protection in mining
project. Korea is supporting work on occupational health and safety issues. The Canadian International
Development Agency is focusing on strengthening the geological survey, and addressing mine closure
and reclamation issues.

6The stoves reduce particulate matter emissions by about 40 percent compared to traditional stoves. The
cost of the stoves (at about $250 each) and the price subsidy (of about 90 percent, jointly covered by the
project and the government) were high. However, a study had concluded that the benefits of reduced
health impacts were even higher, and that the promotion of improved stoves was the most efficient first
step for the long-term strategy for reducing pollution.
7 For example, while funding for the independent validation of EITI (a prior action under the first DPC 1
is mandated by law, funding for Mongolia’s EITI Secretariat depends on the vagaries of the budget
process. Funding for the consultant studies and training needed to nurture the mining sector’s legal and
policy reform process could also slow down once the Mining Sector Institutional Strengthening Technical
Assistance Project is completed in 2015.

5. Enhancing Economic Diversification and
Nonmineral Sector Growth
Diversification of the economy is critical for long-term sustainable development.
Diversifying away from natural resources can help reduce the vulnerability of the
economy to commodity price fluctuations, create more jobs and address acute social
welfare problems, helping to generate sources of sustainable growth when resources are
declining or exhausted.

This chapter discusses the role of the World Bank Group in promoting economic
diversification and the entry of the private sector into the nonextractive sectors. It
assesses interventions to: (i) support efficient diversification through private sector
development (PSD) by reducing the cost of doing business and improving the business
environment; (ii) strengthen the financial sector, including expanding access to credit
for small and medium enterprises (SMEs); and (iii) lessen critical infrastructure
bottlenecks in areas such as energy and transport, including through the promotion of
public-private partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure as well as improvement in
regulatory frameworks.


Enhancing Economic Diversification and Private Sector Development
Mongolia’s transition to a market economy has been successful in generating private
sector initiatives. The GDP share of the private sector rose from 5 percent in 1990 to
about 65 percent in 1999, and trade diversified considerably. The government took
measures to enable property ownership, remove price and marketing controls, reduce
trade barriers, simplify the tax regime, and develop an enabling environment for
attracting foreign investment. A positive supply response to these reforms was seen as
early as 1995 in the form of increased investment in mineral exploration and
development, greater livestock production, and an increase in small-scale service and
trading activities in urban areas.

RESULTS

Over the evaluation period, the weight of the mining sector in the Mongolian economy
increased steadily. Mineral production represents 20 percent of GDP and 85 percent of
exports, which is by far the largest share in the East Asia and Pacific Region. Indeed, it
is more in line with the proportions of the oil-producing Gulf states (Hasnain and
others 2013). The 2008–2009 global economic crisis resulted in a dramatic fall of copper

Mining-driven GDP growth is generating little employment for the overall economy.
Although the economy grew by almost 100 percent between 2004 and 2014,
employment increased by less than 11 percent. The capital-intensive mining sector
employs less than 3 percent of the total workforce (see figure 5.2) — mostly foreign
construction workers — although it accounts for one-fourth of total GDP. For example,
the Oyu Tolgoi project employs about 15,000 workers during the construction phase, or
roughly 0.14 percent of Mongolia’s labor force, and will employ only about 3,500 during
production (see figure 5.2). By contrast, the labor-intensive agricultural sector
contributes 18 percent to the GDP, but employs 37 percent of the workforce. Economic
growth resulted in little new employment, and where jobs did increase, it was often at
the expense of productivity. During the global economic crisis, the labor market was
severely affected, and unemployment reached a record 12.8 percent in 2009.

Private sector development has been hampered by corruption, government controls,
and bureaucratic inefficiencies that increased the cost of doing business. Over the
evaluation period, wider policy instability resulted in profound ambivalence towards
foreign investment and deep politicization.1 The most cited impediments to doing
business were corruption, lack of finance, and the burden of taxes, according to the
Bank’s 2004 Investment Climate Assessment (ICA) Survey. The government was still
controlling privatized enterprises in key sectors, including copper, meat, cashmere
processing, energy, railways, air transport, telecommunications, and banking.
Procedures were onerous. Other constraints identified by potential investors included
inconsistent and nontransparent implementation of tax policies and customs
procedures, a difficult land-leasing regime, and cumbersome investment approval
procedures.

The government made legislative amendments to address some of the constraints
identified in the 2004 Investment Climate Assessment, but did not follow up with
needed administrative improvements. The government adopted a major tax law in 2006
to address some shortcomings, including provisions for loss-carry forward and
investment tax credits, but it failed to unify the two-tier tax structure. Tax
administration still has to be modernized by adopting and implementing reforms to
avoid inconsistencies in the administration of the tax code, particularly the excessive
discretion of tax inspectors. In 2008, the government decreased the overall contribution
rate for social insurance from 30 to 20 percent to reduce the burden of social security
taxes.

The government also took some legislative steps to tackle corruption. A new
anticorruption law requiring income and asset disclosure and introducing sanctions
against conflict of interest was passed in 2006. The law created the Mongolian Anti-
Corruption Agency (MACA) in charge of preventing, detecting, and investigating
corruption cases. It also allows business entities, organizations, and private citizens to
report corruption. However, in practice, MACA does not yet have the capacity and
authority to be fully effective in investigating corruption cases. Results from the Survey
on the Perceptions and Knowledge of Corruption ranked corruption as the second most
critical issue in 2006, and the third most important in 2014, after unemployment and
inflation. The impacts of corruption on family, politics, and businesses show declining
trends but remain significant. However, there is a sharp decline in the reported
incidence of bribes at the household level from 28 percent in September 2006 to 8
percent in 2014. In addition, the recent tendency for the party or factions winning the
election to investigate corruption on the part of their predecessors and to bring cases to
court could be a significant deterrent to corruption.

ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
Political influence in the award of contracts has been a significant problem. In 2007, the
government introduced provisions for direct contracting in the roads and energy sector.
As a result, in 2007, 43 percent of all contracts were awarded through direct
contracting— allegedly with numerous technically unqualified and politically well-
connected companies (Hasnain and others 2013, 47). Acknowledging the need to
overhaul procurement, the government is trying to increase transparency and reduce
the risks of corruption.2 In 2011, the government amended the Public Procurement Law
and gave a new role to civil society organizations (CSOs) in evaluating bids and
monitoring implementation of public contracts, placing Mongolia at the forefront of
disclosure and participation in public procurement. CSOs across Mongolia have formed
a network called the Public Procurement Partnership to facilitate engagement with the
government and foster capacity building. Successful CSO oversight will require the
development of sound implementing regulations, appropriate self-regulation by CSOs
to minimize conflict of interest and the prevention of CSOs from being “captured” by
political and business interests, as well as a sustainable funding mechanism (Hasnain
and others 2013). No evidence is yet available on the effectiveness of this new model.

The government has taken measures causing uncertainties for foreign investors. In May
2012, the government adopted the Law on the Regulation of Foreign Investment in
Entities Operating in Strategic Sectors (that is, mining, banking, finance, media,
information, and communications). The law contained provisions that encumbered the
sale of assets and thus the ability of investors to cash in on investments. This in turn
caused a sharp fall in foreign direct investment (see figure 5.3). This led the government
to reverse its decision, and a new investment law was adopted in November 2013. It
eliminated restrictions on private foreign investment, reduced approval requirements
for state-owned foreign investment, and introduced a simpler and more open
investment process. Further, it established a new agency to assist with the process, and
provided an array of investment incentives to create momentum for regaining investor
confidence. It is unlikely that the new law will generate a positive FDI response before
issues are resolved around Phase II of Oyu Tolgoi.

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
Bank Group analytical work and advisory activities identified and addressed some of
the main obstacles to improving the business environment. The 2004 ICA raised
government awareness regarding the key obstacles impeding the business environment
and reinforced the need to amend the fiscal code and pass anti-corruption legislation.
The Business Inspection Reform Project supported the enactment of laws, regulations,
amendments, and codes that reduced inspection time by 20 percent. IFC’s advisory
work targeted access to finance through leasing. The Leasing Development Project
helped the government develop a leasing law and amendments to other corresponding
laws. The new legislation was enacted on January 1, 2007. The project also assisted a
cooperating bank in developing a new leasing company in 2006. With IFC assistance
through a corporate governance project, the Mongolian parliament adopted a new
company law in 2011 to strengthen the country’s corporate governance regulations and
improve transparency. IFC also supported work on a Corporate Governance Project
(2009) and Business Inspection Reform (2008).

Bank PSD assistance was mainly through increased access to financial resources for the
private sector. The Bank’s Private Sector Development Credits (PSDC I and II) tackled
the mismatch of terms between assets and liabilities of the banks in Mongolia, which
limited their capacity to provide longer-term credit to private enterprises. The projects
offered a credit line for eligible private financial institutions (PFIs) for on-lending to
viable investment projects. It also provided technical assistance to strengthen the
financial intermediation function of PFIs, and the financial supervision functions of the
Bank of Mongolia (BOM).

Bank support increased the amounts of term lending available to private firms,
primarily SMEs. Loans supported by the two PSDCs had an average maturity of three
years, whereas PFIs would normally offer only one-year loans from their own


                                                                                                          37

ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
resources. The quality of the portfolio was good.3 The loans had a direct and positive
effect on SME business activity and relevant employment, plus a likely indirect effect on
other banks, inducing them to increase term lending. However, the sub-loans are
offered at interest rates that are not market determined.4 They do not reflect the
maturity risk. As such, they risk skewing the credit market and crowding out
competitive lending. Sustainability will be an issue as the underlying incentives to
commercial banks for term lending have not fundamentally changed. The structural
mismatch between the SME need for long-term assets and their access to only short-
term liabilities has not been solved.

IFC’s investments also contributed to improving access to finance, especially for micro,
small, and medium enterprises (MSMEs) as well as facilitating trade. IFC participated
with equity in the two banks with the largest branch network in Mongolia. One of the
banks pioneered micro-lending while the other focused on micro-finance. Through
additional loans, IFC helped them enhance their capital base and improve access to
finance. As a consequence, one of the two banks was able to expand its micro-loan
borrowers from 150,000 to 330,000 while increasing total loans from $64 million to $480
million—thus supporting livelihoods and employment generation particularly in low-
income rural communities. At least 5,000 MSMEs benefited from loans. Apart from
equity and loans, IFC developed trade-financing facilities in the cooperating banks.
However, they reported that facilities were underused due to scant demand. Instead,
they preferred other funding sources since IFC’s funds were more expensive to use.

More recently, IFC has begun to invest more actively in PSD outside of the financial
sector. In 2008, IFC cooperated with a major holding company to develop residential
and commercial properties ($15 million participation), and later in 2011 to construct a

five-star hotel ($50 million participation). This cooperation continued in 2012 with a $15
million mining project and a $50 million loan to develop a large, affordable housing
complex for middle- and lower-income people in 2013. Other projects include a $2
million investment in a dairy farm in 2011 to expand production, a $7.5 million
participation in the first Mongolian private equity fund for small and medium
businesses, and a $40 million loan in a holding company to support its expansion in
sectors such as renewable energy and transport.

The participation of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA) was
marginal.

      One operation that guaranteed a $20 million investment in 2006 was canceled in
       2007. TDB was the largest Bank in Mongolia when it was established by the
       government of Mongolia in 1990. TDB was also the first Mongolian corporate in
       2007 to successfully complete the public placement of debt in the international
       capital market and has since been followed by two other Mongolian companies
       in 2012. IEG concluded the evaluation of the project in FY13, rating the
       Development Outcome as Excellent. IEG evaluation found that the World Bank
       Group (i.e., World Bank, IFC, and Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency)
       played a key role in the successful privatization of the Bank. The IEG assessment
       stated, “The process of privatization of financial institutions should be fully
       aligned with the Host Country’s strategic program for the development of the
       sector. MIGA’s involvement and close coordination with other leading
       international development and financial institutions increases substantially the
       chances of success of the privatization process.”
      Two pipeline projects are not progressing because of political issues around Oyu
       Tolgoi that are blocking all MIGA engagement.

CONCLUSIONS
The Bank Group seems to have lacked a long-term strategic approach to the challenges
of improving the investment climate. Since 2004, Mongolia has made progress in
developing its legal and institutional structure, but there is still much to do in removing
the constraints to doing business. The 2004 ICA identified key parameters that
hampered the investment climate—political corruption and limited access to finance.
Some advisory efforts were dedicated to improving the business and regulatory
environment, but overall Bank Group involvement does not appear to reflect either the
priority given to the issue in strategy documents or its comparative advantage in
working in this area.

Despite the emphasis in the strategy documents on supporting increased diversification
and competitiveness and improving the investment climate, the Bank Group program


                                                                                          39
CHAPTER 5
ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
focused on providing term lending for SMEs. The PSD strategy at the beginning of the
evaluation period identified the objective of support for developing a vibrant private
sector, with specific targets for FDI and export growth by 2007. In practice, these targets
were met with substantial FDI given the mineral discoveries and increased exports.
However, there is no clear results chain linking the Bank’s programs to these outcomes.
The Bank Group provided support through two consecutive lines of credit for on-
lending to SMEs, and IFC supported the banks for MSME lending. Several businesses in
various sectors benefited, yet the effect was limited. IFC also offered trade finance
facilities, which were not used to the full potential.

Private sector development does not appear to have played a major role in the policy
dialogue. The Bank Group appears to have been ambivalent about how much focus to
put on PSD-related issues in Mongolia and which of these issues to address. Bank
Group support for SMEs, some areas of progress on the institutional framework, and
recent support for agro-enterprises are all worthwhile activities, but taken together they
do not add up to a strategy. Bank lending and analytic work appear to have been
operating independently of each other rather than developing synergies. Consequently,
this evaluation rates the outcomes of Bank support for PSD as moderately
unsatisfactory.


Strengthening the Financial Sector
Natural resource-rich countries face both specific constraints to developing financial
systems as well as extra financial stability risks. At the macroeconomic level, the overall
demand for finance is usually reduced. The nontradable sector, the competitiveness of
which is hurt by Dutch disease effects, tends to reduce its demand for financial services.
Furthermore, a commodity boom often generates changes in entrepreneur behavior as
they become more interested in rent-seeking opportunities than loans to finance the
creation or expansion of their firms. Lending is likely to become riskier as
macroeconomic volatility increases and nonnatural resource-based activities are
crowded out.

Mongolia suffered back-to-back financial crises in the 1990s, but by 2005, its financial
sector had regained momentum and was ahead of other transition economies in East
Asia (World Bank 2010a).5 With support from the International Monetary Fund (IMF),
the government restructured the banking system. Overall, the reform process was
successful in establishing a basic institutional structure. Bank concentration declined,
and the Bank network extended to all aimags (provinces). Non-bank financial
institutions expanded as well. Financial sector assets grew rapidly from 30 percent of
GDP in 1999 to over 60 percent in 2005 and were funded by a sharp increase in deposits.

                                                                                     CHAPTER 5
                              ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
The ratio of domestic credit to the private sector, which reached 30 percent of GDP, was
close to that of lower middle-income countries, and nonperforming loans were
maintained at single-digit levels.

Despite this progress, the overall system remained fragile (World Bank 2010a).
Prudential regulation and supervision were weakly enforced by the central bank. Non-
bank financial institutions had proliferated, but were not adequately supervised,
although they were taking deposits from small depositors. The legal and regulatory
framework needed revision to align with international standards. Central bank
governance and corporate governance of commercial banks were poor. Given the
weakness of credit risk management, the exponential expansion of the loan portfolio
between 2001 and 2005 entailed potentially higher default risks that were threatening
system stability. The government was not prepared for systemic distress.

RESULTS
The 2008 global economic crisis triggered a sharp deterioration in the health of the
banking system. The quality of the banking portfolio was heavily concentrated on major
local borrowers and sectors that suffered most during the downturn (that is,
construction and real estate). This led to the growth of nonperforming loans and a crisis
of depositor confidence by late 2008. To restore confidence in the system, the authorities
responded with a series of actions including the provision of liquidity support, the
introduction of a blanket deposit guarantee in 2009, and a sharp increase in the policy
rate. The fourth and sixth largest banks were eventually placed under receivership by
late 2009.

The banking sector rebounded quickly after the financial crisis, but this recovery masks
lingering vulnerabilities that could trigger another banking crisis. Credit growth
resumed in late 2009. Access to finance has improved over the evaluation period, as
illustrated by an increase in the ratio of the credit to private sector and deposit
increased and in credit to MSMEs and households. Of the population now, 80 percent
have bank accounts, in part because of high branch penetration (see figure 5.4). The
banking system’s assets accounted for 50 percent of GDP in 2011 and 96 percent of total
financial sectors, and market capitalization was more than 25 percent of GDP in 2011.
However, indicators showed that banking stability was fragile. Loan-to-deposit ratios
started to rise again in 2011, and both the ratio of liquid assets to total assets and the z-
score6 remained below the pre-crisis level.

Beginning in 2013, authorities embarked on monetary easing programs that run the risk
of overheating credit demand again. To offset a slowdown in credit growth, the BOM
allowed banks to offer discounted loans to select industries under the Price Stabilization
Program. It also provided liquidity injection to banks and supported low interest rate


                                                                                           41

ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
mortgage lending. As a result, by the end of 2013, banking sector vulnerabilities were
rising as shown by: rapid credit growth fueled by the BOM’s monetary easing policy; an
increasing exposure in the construction and real estate sectors; inadequate provisioning;
and a rise in nonperforming loans. For example, the loan-to-deposit ratio, which had
been increasing since 2010 reached values almost equivalent to those of December 2008
when the bubble burst.7 The credit risk heightened due to recent currency depreciation
and the growth in the share of foreign currency bank deposits, which was about 30
percent of total loans in June 2013.8 The need for strong bank supervision is
demonstrated by the deteriorating situation of the Savings Bank (the fifth largest in the
country), which was put into receivership in 2013 and later transferred to the State
Bank.9 In 2014, Moody’s Investors Service defined the outlook of the banking sector as
negative.

Overall, the transmission channels of systemic risks have been rising. Recognizing these
risks, Mongolia adopted some macro-prudential measures but failed to endorse a
comprehensive banking reform to maintain durable financial stability. Measures to
reduce systemic risks included an increase in the liquidity ratio, tightening of the capital
adequacy ratios of five institutions, and a limit on exposure concentration. However, as
the banking sector recovered, the momentum for policy reform faded, and the reform
agenda remained unfinished. Enforcement of bank regulation was not sufficiently
strong, and improvement of corporate governance practices was lagging.

There is scope for better management of systemic risks through improved monitoring of
rising interconnectedness, concentrated exposure, and the foreign exchange position.
Instead of using countercyclical capital buffers to smooth out the flow of credit, the
BOM fueled procyclical systemic risks by easing policies. Furthermore, follow-up
legislation was not passed to allow Mongolia to respond quickly to another sharp
deterioration of the banking system. In 2009, Mongolia had prepared a comprehensive
revised banking law seeking, among other things, to strengthen prompt corrective
action clauses, improve the bank resolution framework, and reinforce prudential
supervision requirements. However, it was not adopted by the parliament and many
sources of vulnerabilities in the financial sector remain.

BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
The FY05–08 CAS proposed to support the strengthening of the regulatory framework
for the financial sector. It recommended that Bank Group assistance focus on further
consolidation of market reforms in order to establish a sound institutional and
regulatory environment for private sector-led development.

In response to the global economic crisis, the 2008–2010 ISN aspired to restore
confidence in the banking sector. The severe shock in the terms of trade of 2008 exposed

                             ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
the vulnerability of the banking system and undermined public confidence in it. The
Bank Group sought to address bank failures and strengthen the banking system
through a revision of the legal framework for the financial sector. IFC would provide
support to strengthen financial markets and use its newly created, global crisis response
initiatives and activities.

The FY13–17 CPS aimed at developing a deeper, more efficient, and stable financial
system. Steps include: (i) identifying, monitoring, and addressing the vulnerabilities of
the financial system to make the sector more resilient to future shocks; (ii) improving
access to credit; (iii) strengthening financial literacy and consumer protection; and (iv)
expanding the range and quality of financial products provided by non-Bank financial
institutions, including the development of the domestic capital market. IFC is planning
to continue to support the financial markets by introducing more complex and
innovative financial products, working closely with its major clients in the banking
sector.

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
Before the 2008 global economic crisis, the Bank identified the main vulnerabilities of
the financial sector and made recommendations to address them. A 2006 Financial
Sector Reform Program, done jointly with the Asian Development Bank, recommended
strong financial discipline, sound corporate governance and practices, and effective
prudential regulation and supervision in the financial system— as well as the
implementation of an appropriate legal framework and operational structures for
contract enforcement and protection of private property. The 2008 Financial Sector
Assessment Program (FSAP), set up before the crisis, proved useful in addressing issues
as they arose. At the time of the crisis, the Bank conducted a banking sector review and
restructuring program that proposed a hands-on action plan to help with recovery. The
2009 Reports on the Observance of Standards and Codes had clear recommendations
for improving corporate governance of financial and other institutions. Field interviews
confirmed that these analytic reports were critically needed and proved useful during
the crisis.

The Bank Group helped Mongolia develop a modern payments system. By 2007, the
BOM had developed a safe and efficient online transaction system between end-users
and their banks operating in a cost-effective manner and in full compliance with best
international practices.

During the global economic crisis, Bank budget support and TA, complemented by the
IMF program, helped restore confidence in the banking system and accelerate the
legislative process to strengthen bank supervision and restructuring (IMF 2011). At the
time of the crisis, the Bank together with the IMF reacted promptly to provide budget


                                                                                          43

ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
support. One key component of the development policy credits (DPCs I and II) was to
address banking sector vulnerabilities by restoring the health of balance sheets and
rebuilding confidence in the financial sector. In 2010, the Multi-Sectoral Technical
Assistance Project (MSTAP) complemented their efforts. It was designed to address
immediate banking sector weaknesses and to lay the groundwork for sound regulation.
In particular, TA helped the BOM to finalize the liquidation of assets of the failed banks;
prepare a bank restructuring strategy; develop and implement a corporate debt
restructuring in the mining and construction sectors; and carry out targeted audits of
financial institutions. The government approved a revised banking law in January 2010,
introducing consolidated supervision and improving the resolution framework. The
central bank issued new regulations to increase provisioning for restructured loans and
tightened the supervision of related-party loans. The deposit guarantee system was
improved. The government also took a comprehensive banking restructuring approach.
The Empowering the Banking Sector and Capital Support Program, prepared with
support from leading global financial experts recruited through the MSTAP, was
submitted to parliament in 2010 but not approved. Instead, the authorities developed a
bank-by-bank implementation plan to address capital deficiency in some banks.

IFC was also strongly engaged in the financial sector, especially the banking sector. As
noted in para 5.17, IFC engagement in several banks help strengthen and developed the
sector, including via mobilizing funds from other partners. Through its advisory
services, IFC also assisted actively during the financial crisis. IFC provided: (i) direct
financial sector TA (2007–2011) on leasing, both regulatory and operational with the
creation of a leasing company, and for housing finance; (ii) advice on the establishment
of a credit bureau; and (iii) investee-related TA. Working together with two major
banks, IFC provided equity and developed their trade finance facilities.

CONCLUSIONS
Before the global economic crisis, the Bank’s work highlighted Mongolia’s limited
capacity to provide oversight and the limited ability of most financial institutions to
manage risk. The Bank had underscored the need to improve weak corporate
governance and internal control mechanisms, but there was no buy-in from the
government until the crisis hit.

Policy actions supported by the Bank helped forestall a crisis in 2009–2010, but have not
been followed up subsequently. The policy actions taken by the government along with
the rapid recovery of the economy helped reduce banking system stress in 2009–2010,
and avoid a system-wide spillover of the two bank failures. The Bank program
supported legislative progress regarding bank supervision and restructuring, but
implementation failed. With the economy’s quick recovery, the government’s
willingness to adopt a comprehensive banking restructuring strategy for the future

waned, and enforcement of prudential norms by the BOM has lagged. Hence, most of
the targeted outcomes outlined in the CPS have yet to materialize, and Mongolia
remains open to macro-financial vulnerability.


Supporting Better Delivery of Infrastructure
As of the early 2000s, Mongolia had an extensive transport and power infrastructure in
relation to its level of economic development, but water and sanitation lagged. Roads
and electricity access had expanded rapidly, but considerable gaps remained, especially
for access to safe water and sanitation, specifically in rural areas and informal peri-
urban settlements. Only about 30 percent of households had adequate access to water
and only a little over half of the rural population had access to electricity. In the
majority of aimag centers, sewage was collected but flowed untreated into local water
bodies. In addition, less than 30 percent of the paved road network was in good
condition. Many electrical connections provided enough current for only one light bulb,
and electricity distribution losses exceeded 30 percent. In addition, unaccounted for
water usage comprises 29 percent of the supply in Ulaanbaatar (World Bank 2007).
Appendix C provides more detailed information on the conditions and challenges that
the energy, roads, and water sectors were facing at the beginning of the evaluation
period.

At the same time, geography, climate, and social topography made development and
maintenance of infrastructure costly. The rigorous technical requirements for
equipment to operate under Mongolia’s climatic extremes, the short construction
season, and the long distance from international markets make the construction and
maintenance of infrastructure very expensive by global standards. For example,
freezing winter temperatures require that water distribution networks be buried some 3
meters below ground level. The extreme temperature range from –40ºC in winter to
more than 40ºC in summer causes road pavement to become fragile and deteriorate
rapidly. With one-third of the population living below the poverty level, the
affordability of infrastructure services has important implications for their feasibility
and sustainability.

RESULTS
The government has ambitious plans10 to meet infrastructure needs by spending more
than five times the 2011 GDP between 2011 and 2016. It proposes to make major
investments in roads, railways, electricity, and an industrial park. However, Mongolia
has not yet established the institutions and implemented the policy to ensure that these
capital expenditures lead to sustained growth and better lives for Mongolians. As
noted, the public investment program is not grounded on a sound macro-fiscal

framework and public investment management system, resulting in problems of
allocative efficiency. Also, the construction sector faces capacity constraints, and similar
bottlenecks are found upstream in the availability of raw materials as evidenced by
their soaring prices. Another binding constraint is the labor force shortage for the types
of work involved, which is further compounded by restrictions imposed by the Labor
Law on the hiring of foreign workers. Restrictions in the Customs Law on the import of
equipment and noncompetitive procurement practices also create barriers to entry in
the construction industry (Hasnain and others 2013).

Access to electricity has significantly improved since 2004, especially in rural areas. In
urban areas, the entire population has access to electricity, except for recent migrants
and those located in illegal or hazardous areas. Electricity access of the herder
population increased from 15 percent of households in 2006 to about 63 percent in 2012,
and about 85 percent in 2014.

Over the past decade, the energy sector has continued to reform, with significant
progress in its technical performance. The gradual modernization of the regulatory
framework enabled the power companies to modernize their management structure,
become more commercially oriented and improve their quality of service. Also, a
Renewable Energy Law was enacted in 2007, which led to the inauguration of the
country’s first Wind Power Plant (50 megawatt) in 2013.

The financial performance of the sector has improved but still depends on substantial
donor funding and government subsidies. For example, the Ulaanbaatar Electricity
Distribution Company, the country’s largest, was able to reach 100 percent cost
recovery in 2012, but the level fell back to 92 percent in 2013. At the Khovsgol aimag
utility visited by the evaluation team, the local tariff was about 17 percent below the full
cost recovery level, which was causing delays in performing maintenance and repairs.
As a result, whereas the expansion of access is being subsidized by the government, the
rehabilitation and upgrading of generation plants still heavily depend on donor
support. Investments in new generation, through PPP plants, are being delayed by tariff
and other issues. At the root of these problems is the regulatory authority’s inability to
balance the main requirements of the law, which mandates that tariffs are based on the
real costs of operations yet requires them to be affordable to consumers. A 2010
parliamentary resolution directs that all tariffs be brought to the full cost recovery level
by 2015.

The road network of Mongolia is continuing to expand, but maintenance has lagged far
behind. From 2004 to 2012, the network of improved roads expanded from 5,700
kilometers to 7,900 kilometers, and the share of paved roads increased from 33 percent
to 55 percent. Road construction is financed by the state budget and donor loans.

                             ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
However, road maintenance is financed by the Road Fund, the main revenue for which
comes from fuel and vehicle licensing taxes that have not been revised since 1995. As a
result, only about 20 percent of road maintenance needs are covered. Hence, work is
limited to routine maintenance (for example, clearing of drainage) and minor repairs
(for example, filling potholes). It does not include preventive maintenance, medium-
level repairs (for example, gravel foundation replacement), or capital repairs (complete
rehabilitation). About 60 percent of the national paved road network is in need of
urgent capital repair and rehabilitation.

In addition, weaknesses in road planning, management, and supervision continue to
hamper the efficiency of investments. Investment planning still lacks coherence and
prioritization, as well as a reliable technical and economic appraisal. Over the past
decade, road construction works have been transferred to private companies under
competitively tendered contracts. Although prohibited by law since 2011, large-scale
direct contracting continues for a number of road projects implemented by the
Development Bank of Mongolia. The quality of civil works is supervised by the
Department of Roads, and contracts are audited by independent entities. In practice,
project responsibility is distributed among several entities, most of which are
understaffed. This leads to procurement delays and difficulty in making timely
decisions. It has resulted in weak implementation rates and significant cost escalation.
Although the present situation is much better than during the early 2000s when there
was no supervision, the framework remains insufficient to ensure quality (ADB 2011).

The financial performance of Mongolia’s water sector has not significantly improved.
The Water Supply and Sewerage Authority of Ulaanbaatar City has improved its
technical performance. The delivered-to-pumped water ratio increased from 75 percent
in 2004 to 82 percent in 2013, indicating that leakage had been reduced. Its revenues,
however, covered only about 70 percent of its expenses, causing ongoing delays in
maintenance, rehabilitation, and expansion programs, as well as a mounting
dependence on the government for its debt repayment. The inadequate water tariff was
also blocking the government’s efforts to attract private investors to the sector using the
PPP approach. The shortfall of investment has led to a growing risk of water shortages,
as demand by residential and commercial consumers has rapidly increased. In addition,
the rate of groundwater extraction is reaching the limits of sustainability, and industrial
pollution has impaired the treatability of water from the Tuul River, the main
alternative source of supply.

BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
The FY05–08 CAS focused on supporting systemic reforms to improve the efficiency
and distributive impact of infrastructure investments. Recognizing the long-term nature
of the challenges, the CAS emphasized developing an integrated infrastructure strategy


                                                                                           47

with the government to improve the financial sustainability and efficiency of the energy
sector, strengthening institutional capacity to manage the road network, and improving
the Ulaanbaatar ger district’s access to clean water (World Bank 2004).

The 2009–2010 ISN signaled a shift in the Bank Group’s assistance from countrywide
system reform toward a tight focus on helping ger populations in Ulaanbaatar, as well
as on infrastructure for large mining projects (World Bank 2009). This focus is
maintained in the FY13–17 CPS, which also notes the increasing number of people
exposed to natural disasters in urban areas (mainly through flash floods and
earthquakes), and commits assistance for managing these vulnerabilities (World Bank
2012a).

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
In the energy sector, the Bank’s interventions have been more effective in improving
efficiency than financial performance. The Energy Sector Project played an essential role
in supporting the organizational transformation of the power distribution companies
from government agencies to commercially oriented utilities, which improved their
technical and administrative efficiency. From 2004 to 2013, technical and nontechnical
distribution losses were reduced from an average of 31 percent to 15 percent in
Ulaanbaatar, and from 32 percent to 13 percent in 6 aimag utilities. The transformation
also heightened the service orientation of the utilities. They undertook a major push to
expand electricity access by 9–10 percent annually, mainly in previously unserved peri-
urban settlements around both the capital and major aimag centers as well as in soum
centers. Billing and revenue collection improved dramatically by reducing the bill
collection period from 100 to 35 days in Ulaanbaatar, and from 77 to 18 days in the
aimag utilities (World Bank Group 2014b).

Progress has been made toward setting up a modern energy regulatory regime, but
domestic power tariffs are still below full cost recovery levels. The Bank’s 2010 energy
sector topic paper, prepared in response to the global economic crisis, highlighted these
issues (World Bank 2010b),11 but had only a modest impact. Its main recommendations
could not be implemented due to a consistent political reluctance to raise the energy
tariffs.

In transport, the Bank’s interventions have been only modestly effective at
strengthening the management of the road network. The 2001–2007 Transport
Development Project supported the achievement of year-round accessibility for the
main aimag centers in central and western Mongolia; an improved understanding of the
types of pavement appropriate for the country’s unusually harsh weather conditions;
and the installation of vehicle inspection stations for all 21 aimags (World Bank 2008).
Weaknesses in road planning, management, and supervision continue to hamper the

                                     ENHANCING ECONOMIC DIVERSIFICATION AND NONMINERAL SECTOR GROWTH
efficiency of investments. In particular, investment planning still lacks coherence and
prioritization as well as a reliable technical and economic appraisal.

In addition, road maintenance funding continues to fall short. In 2010, the Bank
highlighted the priority of reducing the backlog of rehabilitation and maintenance for
constructing new roads (World Bank 2010b). It supported an extensive discussion of
these funding issues12 at the technical and ministerial levels. The “prior actions” of
DPCs I and II supported an increase in the government’s overall infrastructure
maintenance budget in FY10. However, within that broad category, maintenance
spending by the Road Fund itself was barely raised (World Bank 2012b).

CONCLUSION
Progress has been made on technical management outcomes, but investment planning,
electricity cost recovery, and funding of road maintenance remain important
weaknesses. Given that the government is spending large sums of money on expanding
the infrastructure network, it is particularly important to get this right. The Bank put
considerable priority on the deficiencies, but again political considerations took
precedence in government programs. In future, the Bank needs to continue to focus
strongly on these issues and condition its support on the willingness of the government
to address them.

investment is a reflection of how acute a problem this is in Mongolia.
2According to publicly available information, 8 percent of the members of parliament own shares in
construction companies. The top 10 local construction companies, which combined have received 30
percent of the road construction contracts in the past five years, are owned by either members of
parliament or individuals with close ties to the Mongolian People ’s Party or the Democratic Party
(Hasnain and others 2013, 48).
3Repayment records were good with no arrears on principal, and nonperforming loans (NPLs) of less
than 3 percent on past due interest payments only.
4 While the commercial interest rate that private finance initiatives would charge on their own resource
loans was 31 percent, sub-loans sponsored by the International Development Association were offered at
discounted interest rates of 19 percent to 21 percent (local currency loans).
5 Like other centrally planned economies, banking was conducted by one financial institution only (that
is, the State Bank of Mongolia) that did not possess the capacity to respond to market signals such as
price and interest rate changes. The mono-banking system was transformed into a two-tier system in
1991, with a central bank and a number of state-owned commercial banks. This system inherited a large
percentage of NPLs, most of which were loans to state-owned enterprises. Mongolia suffered from
banking crises in 1994, 1996, and 1998 –1999, which resulted in financial disintermediation. Of 27 banks
licensed between 1990 and 2000, 15 were closed by the end of 2000.
6The z-score measures the number of standard deviations that a return realization has to fall in order to
deplete equity. Therefore, a higher z-score implies stronger resilience to shocks.

8Mongolia’s relatively high dollarization in conjunction with the relatively small size of non -mining
exports suggest that the non-bank private sector may have a considerable foreign currency mismatch
with attendant risk (IMF 2014). The 2010 Financial Sector Assessment Program had recommended the
establishment of guidelines for foreign exchange lending.

Anod Bank and Zoos Bank, of Mongolia in November 24, 2009.

and others 2013, 23).
11The paper highlights the need for new investment in the sector, most desirably undertaken by private
investors who should be attracted with realistic tariffs that would need to be increased while minimizing
the impact on the poor. It also discusses and ranks a long list of thermal and hydro-generation projects
and the possible strengthening of transmission linkages to the Russian Federation and China.

6. Improving the Livelihood of the Population
The heart of Mongolia lies in the rural gers (traditional round tents) that dot the steppes.
Mongolia has 45 million head of livestock and less than 3 million people, with 42
percent living in rural areas. Until recently, a majority of the population were nomadic
herders who depended on livestock for sustenance and moved to different grazing
areas during the year.

In recent years, a substantial population migration to the capital, Ulaanbaatar, of mostly
low-income migrants has created vast ger areas in the outskirts of the city where basic
infrastructure, hygiene, and sanitation services are very limited or nonexistent.1 Water
is mostly only available through a network of public kiosks or from trucks. Many roads
are unsurfaced and in a permanent state of disrepair. The ger areas are also prone to
flash flooding and suffer from water pollution from the prevalence of poorly
constructed latrines, as well as from soil and land pollution resulting from the open
dumping of solid waste (World Bank 2006).

This chapter presents poverty trends, reviews social protection and education policies,
and assesses the effectiveness of programs to improve livelihoods in rural and peri-
urban areas since 2004. World Bank support for poverty reduction and inclusive growth
in Mongolia is discussed in four broad areas of interventions: design of social protection
programs, education, rural development, and urban development. Bank interventions
in the health sector have been limited to a 2008 trust fund, which is improving the
preparedness for and the ability to respond to Avian and human pandemic influenza,
and to a 2012 trust fund for building capacity to prepare for emerging infectious
diseases. These trust funds are not covered by this evaluation.


Understanding the Sources of Poverty and Improving Social Protection Policies
RESULTS
During the review period, Mongolia experienced social and economic progress. This
included, for example, higher educational attainment, lower incidence of illness, and
greater access to solar energy and telecommunications. However, one-third of
Mongolians remain poor, and aggregate poverty data mask large differences across
regions and household dwelling status.

Between 1998 and 2002, Mongolia made considerable progress in reducing the
incidence of poverty. The consumption-based measure of poverty fell by 21 percent,
and per capita household consumption increased by 18 percent. Nonmonetary

CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
indicators of living standards also showed some improvement. Infant mortality fell by
14 points (from 35 to 21 per 1,000 births), and access to physicians improved. Access to
water and electricity increased more for the poor than for the country as a whole. An
important element of these gains was the adoption of a broad social insurance system to
reduce economic insecurity and alleviate poverty. But its design was complex, had
many redundancies, and suffered from extensive “leakages” and poor coverage of the
needy.

The precise decline in poverty trends over the evaluation period is not known. There
was a change in methodology used over this time, making adjustments to obtain
comparability very difficult. Hence, the country team could not compute a consistent
poverty rate estimate from 2005 to 2013. More precisely, no corrected estimates for the
period prior to 2010 have been made.2 Poverty declined over the evaluation period, but
the rate of decline in the earlier years was slower. Prior to 2008, the decline was not
impressive given the rate of economic growth. By contrast, the poverty decline after
2010 was greater, falling by an average of 5 percentage points per year between 2010
and 2012 (from 38.7 percent in 2010 to 27.4 percent in 2012). The poverty decline in rural
areas was faster—13.5 percentage points over the two years—compared with urban
areas (9.9 percentage points). However, with only a few data points, skepticism about
the sustainability of this trend remains.

Over the evaluation period, the government failed to implement a coherent agenda for
social transfers. On paper, the Social Security Sector Master Plan (SSMP) of 2003 is
coherent and well directed, recommending the consolidation of programs and
improved targeting. However, successive governments failed to provide a clear
implementation strategy. Instead, they introduced or expanded programs in response
to populist electoral promises and reversed them during downturns when fiscal
constraints became binding.

In 2005, the Child Money Program was introduced on a targeted basis, and in 2006, it
was expanded to universal coverage. This change contributed to poverty reduction but
at a higher fiscal cost, which progressively became unsustainable because the benefit
served as a consumption subsidy for the nonpoor. With the global economic downturn
in 2008, the decision was made to scale back and target transfers. The 2012 Social
Welfare Law aimed to change the universal social transfer to a well-targeted safety net
program that protects the poor and is fiscally sustainable. However, the government
that took office in 2012 has not yet implemented this legislation (see box 6.1).

                                                         IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION

 Box 6.1. Inconsistent Implementation of Social Protection Policies
 In January 2005, the government introduced the Child Money Program (CMP) as part of the
 2004 election campaign. It was the first attempt to initiate a conditional and targeted cash
 transfer following good practice. However, implementation issues were rapidly encountered.
 The program faced large targeting leakages and was perceived as unfair.3 In addition,
 monitoring was weak.4 As a result, the CMP reached most nonpoor households even before it
 was universalized. An evaluation of the scheme indicated that the CMP had a small impact
 on reducing poverty and a large impact on high school enrollment, but at a high cost. Social
 assistance costs skyrocketed and became unsustainable after universalization of the child
 money transfer in 2006. The CMP quickly became the country’s largest social assistance
 program.
 The 2008 global financial crisis and ensuing fiscal crisis in Mongolia restored the
 government’s interest in developing a more efficient and cost-effective system. However, as
 fiscal space returned, political maneuvers to fund greater social transfers resumed. At first,
 the government cut social transfers. It also started to draft a plan to use legislation to
 overhaul the system through the introduction of a new benefit transfer program targeted
 exclusively to poor households. However, reform momentum plummeted by end-2009 when
 the economy was recovering and revenues were buoyed through high commodity prices and
 revenues. In 2010, the lack of a clear policy direction proved costly as the rural poor were left
 with no social assistance program when the dzud devastated their livestock. In early 2012,
 parliament finally adopted the new Social Welfare Law, which reintroduced more targeted
 social assistance. However, after the 2012 national elections, the new government suspended
 the national rollout of the cash-based Poverty Targeted Benefit, which was the centerpiece of
 the law and resumed the CMP.


The government has not yet adopted the measures passed in 2005 to reform the pension
system, and the deficit keeps growing. Pressing pension policy issues are linked to
treating different workers and cohorts equitably and achieving predictability and
sustainability—the lack of which jeopardizes public credibility and compliance. To
increase labor competitiveness and reduce incentives for underreporting, in 2008 the
government decreased the overall contribution rate for social insurance from 30 to 20
percent. Despite this reduction in the contribution rate, revenue sources remained stable
over the past decade at about 4.8 percent of GDP.5 However, the overall deficit between
contributions and benefits has continued to grow over the evaluation period.
Projections of pension insurance contributors and beneficiaries suggest that future
increases in population old-age dependency ratios will translate into worsening
dependency ratios from 11 percent in 2010 to 53 percent in 2050. The government is
working on a new policy proposal and plans to send it to the parliament before the end
of 2014.

CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
Over the evaluation period, Bank strategies were designed to protect poor and
vulnerable groups. The government received support to: (i) enhance its understanding
of poverty and inequality including its gender dimension; (ii) strengthen the national
poverty monitoring system;6 and (iii) adopt reforms to introduce targeted social
protection policies. In particular, the 2005 CAS sought to improve the targeting of social
assistance programs. During the global economic crisis, a key objective of the ISN was
to protect the poor and vulnerable by retargeting social transfers to the poorest. This
objective was pursued by the current country program strategy (CPS), which seeks to
assist the government in designing and implementing a comprehensive protection
system for the poor.

Social protection objectives were relevant and aligned with the country’s strategic
objectives. The SSMP of 2003 sought to rationalize the system and improve cost
efficiency through a clarification of eligibility criteria and decentralization of
management. Later, the 2008 Comprehensive National Development Strategy reiterated
the goal of implementing a social welfare policy primarily targeting low-income and
vulnerable groups. However, as noted, the successive governments failed to produce a
consistent implementation plan. Despite the lack of buy-in by the government, the Bank
maintained the objective of introducing a targeted social welfare system by trying to
progressively build a broader awareness and consensus across parliamentary parties
around the need to design and implement a poverty-targeted transfer scheme.

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
Over the evaluation period, the Bank produced several poverty-related analytical
activities, provided TA support, and maintained a sustained dialogue on poverty
issues. The Bank’s analytic work included the Mongolia Economic Updates, as well as
the 2006 Poverty Assessment and policy notes produced during the economic crisis. The
Bank also provided TA through a project to strengthen the National Statistical System
of Mongolia (World Bank 2010b). This effort led to the adoption of a new methodology
in 2012 to make a quantitative assessment of the poverty rate and assess poverty
dynamics. This is a noteworthy achievement compared to the mid-2000s when the
official poverty numbers were estimated using inconsistent poverty lines, leading to the
drawing of erroneous conclusions on poverty trends over time. The methodology used
for estimating the most recent 2010–2012 poverty trends follows international standard
practice for consistent poverty estimation over time. It provides policy makers with
more accurate indicators to evaluate the impact of public policies. In field interviews,
representatives from the National Statistics Office (NSO) expressed the view that the
partnership with the Bank to conduct surveys, and announce and publish the results,
had been fruitful— playing a critical role in eliminating political disputes over findings.

                                                     IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
Bank engagement on social protection issues was mostly through analytical work until
the global economic crisis in 2008. The crisis highlighted the need to better protect the
poor and improve the fiscal sustainability of the social welfare system. Its reform
became one of the key policy areas supported by the 2009 and 2010 Bank development
policy credits (DPCs), together with the 2010 Multi-Sectoral Technical Assistance Project
(MSTAP).

Prior to the crisis, Bank analytical work attempted to build awareness and foster a
generate debate on the need to reform social assistance. The objective was to develop a
sustainable scheme that would retarget assistance to the poorest. The Bank was taken
by surprise when the government unexpectedly decided to universalize the child
money transfer program in 2006. Partly as a result, the Bank launched a political
economy study. It concluded that given the reluctance of government to revise the
universal policy, the Bank should focus instead on encouraging: (i) monitoring of the
impact of the CMP to build evidence of the program’s achievements; (ii) public debate
on social policies; and (iii) dialogue with key policy makers in the main political parties.
The Bank followed up on these recommendations.

The Bank’s analysis buttressed the understanding of the limited impact of the universal
child transfer program on poverty reduction and its fiscally high and unsustainable
costs. The Bank’s recommendations focused on policy measures to maximize the social
impact of the program at a lower cost, notably through refining the targeting method7 to
reach poor households. It also simplified the implementation arrangements including
the payment system.

In 2009, building on the prior analytical work and dialogue, the Bank used the global
economic crisis as an opportunity to support the introduction of poverty targeting. The
Bank provided budget support to protect the most vulnerable from the downturn
through an improvement in the efficiency and fiscal sustainability of the safety net.8 The
DPC Phase I (2009) supported the reconversion of the universal CMP into a targeted
program based on a proxy-means targeting formula using the most recent 2007–2008
household data. Since the government terminated the CMP in 2009, the DPC Phase II
(2010) together with the MSTAP (World Bank 2010a) supported the development of a
social welfare reform through the consolidation of existing social transfers; the
establishment of a proxy means test; and the introduction of a poverty-targeted benefit.
These operations were implemented in close coordination with the International
Monetary Fund’s program, and technical assistance from the Asian Development Bank.

Implementation of a targeted and sustainable social welfare system is still a work in
progress. The Bank has made major efforts to reach out to parliament to demonstrate
the need to build support for a targeted social welfare system. As a result, the


                                                                                            57
CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
government adopted the Social Welfare Law (SWL) in 2012 to overhaul the system. It
sought to do this through the introduction of the Poverty Targeted Benefit (based on a
proxy means test), a substantial consolidation of benefit programs, and an adjustment
in the size of the social transfers to improve longer-term fiscal sustainability. In parallel,
the Bank provided TA to build the technical and institutional capacity that was needed
to launch the reform. However, this goal proved challenging, and technical work was
delayed repeatedly due to capacity, technical, procurement, and political reasons.

The current objective is to help build a database to support the targeted provision of a
range of government services (for example, subsidized stoves, medi-cards, and
scholarships). Though the government is pursuing the technical work to build this
database, it is not yet ready to substitute the multitude of categorical transfers into a
coherent set of targeted social transfers as called for by the SWL. The political will is
lacking for implementing the law. In 2013, only one targeted program—the food stamp
program introduced with ADB support—is included in the budget, and it covers only 5
percent of households. Targeting is still on the agenda of the Ministry of Population
Development and Social Protection. During field interviews, interlocutors said that their
objective is to first assess the impact of selected transfers, which in general are
ineffective and costly to administer, and propose to the parliament their consolidation
or elimination before trying to introduce a new poverty-targeted benefit scheme.

The Bank also conducted timely analytical work at the request of the government to
evaluate the Mongolia pension scheme and propose policy reforms (World Bank 2011b).
The state subsidy for pensions and social insurance is expected to increase substantially
under the current policies. Short-term reforms are needed to prevent a severe reduction
in benefits for new female retirees in 2015 and male retirees in 2020. Also, benefits for
herders and workers in the informal sector are likely to be low because of their limited
participation in the pension insurance scheme introduced in 1994, as well as gaps in the
provision of pension benefits.

Bank analytical work on pensions made recommendations that were well customized to
the Mongolian situation and agreed on by technical staff. However, so far, policy
makers have failed to reform the pension system. The 2011 report identified weaknesses
in pension insurance schemes and made a number of recommendations. Field
interviews noted that the technical team found these reports to be excellent and the
recommendations useful. The Bank has provided pension-related training, and the
MSTAP project is financing a study on a government request to refine the options
proposed in the pension policy reform report. The Director of Social Pensions noted that
reforming the system is a top priority of the Ministry.

                                                  IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
CONCLUSION
The Bank’s assistance successfully improved the statistical system and strengthened the
capacity of the government to understand poverty trends and vulnerability. Field
interviews emphasized that the work was “extremely efficient.” Through Bank
assistance, the NSO avoided wasting both resources and time to reach their current
level of expertise in building the capacity to conduct household surveys using
approaches in line with international standards. A key outcome of the close partnership
with the Bank in designing surveys, conducting joint socioeconomic studies, and
announcing jointly the results through the media has been the avoidance of political
interference and elimination of disputes over the study’s findings, which had been the
case prior to 2010. The dissemination process also improved as the survey data are now
available to the public.

Regarding social protection, the government has yet to show ownership and
commitment to implement the provision of the 2012 Social Welfare Law that calls for
introducing sustainable and targeted social transfers. However, this stalemate does not
reflect on the Bank’s performance. Its dialogue with the government on social assistance
through analytical work and lending helped build awareness and understanding by
some policy makers regarding the need to design and implement a more efficient and
cost-effective social welfare system. Because of the lack of a strong endorsement by
political parties, the consensus and impetus for social welfare reform faded quickly in
the face of economic growth and an increasing fiscal envelope. The Bank continued to
put much effort into reaching out to parliament in order to keep the dialogue alive and
push for the adoption of the SWL, which contributed to its adoption two years later
than forecast. However, key reforms were put on hold as soon as the law was passed.

Although the government found the Bank’s analytical work on pensions very relevant,
it has not moved forward with policy reforms. Faced with growing deficits, the
government remains committed to proposing pension reform by mid-2014 using Bank
TA.


Improving Education Services
Beginning in 2000, Mongolia started to recover from the drop in school enrollments that
followed the fall of Communism. However, there were growing concerns regarding the
quality of the education system, as well as disparities between urban and rural areas.




                                                                                         59
CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
RESULTS
Over the period of 2005–2013, Mongolia extended access to pre-primary and basic
education. In particular, gross enrollment ratios in kindergartens rose significantly from
54 percent in 2006–2007 to 77.6 percent in 2012–2013 (see figure 6.1).

The gender gap in school enrollment was the reverse of most countries that have a
similar development level. While there is now little difference in primary school
enrollments, more girls than boys are enrolled in secondary school— although the
difference has declined in less than a decade from more than 10 percent to 1 percent. At
the tertiary level, girls represent 60 percent of enrollment, although this gap is also
closing (see appendix B).

These achievements on enrollments resulted from the introduction of several reforms
that sought to simultaneously expand and improve access to basic and pre-school
education. In 2008, the government further reduced financial obstacles to pre-school
enrollment by adopting a law calling for the public provision of food, books, manuals,
and appropriate toys for children attending state-owned kindergartens.9 The
government dropped the entrance age in primary school from age eight to six, and
expanded the education cycle from 10 to 12 years. The child money transfer program,
which provided demand-side financing, helped to cover the private costs of education,
such as clothing, food, transport, and books. It had a large impact on high school
enrollment among the poor (Araujo 2006).

The government has subsequently shifted its focus to improving the quality of primary
and secondary education. It recently introduced a new program called the Educational

                                                                                      CHAPTER 6
                                                     IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
Quality Reform Program that has three key elements. The book project is designed to
improve the availability and use of learning materials. Teacher development and
upgrading is intended to integrate child-friendly teaching practices into the curricula of
teaching training institutes. The talent program, which is in 100 pilot schools, provides
school grants to increase educational quality. It is too early to assess the impact of these
new policies.

The government has not yet set up an institutionalized system to measure enrollments,
efficiency, and student performance. Progress has not been made to establish a credible
Education Management Information System and a student assessment system to track
not only enrollment, but also internal and external efficiency, gender, and social equity
as well as student achievements over time.

BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
In the education sector, the Bank’s program was aligned with the government’s 2006–
2015 Education Sector Master Plan as well as with its commitment to the Millennium
Development Goals (MDGs). Bank objectives shifted over the evaluation period. In the
first CAS, the objective was to improve the financial sustainability of the education
system. However, as noted, as the government abandoned the Economic Growth
Support and Poverty Reduction Strategy in favor of a MDG-based strategy, the Bank
changed the emphasis of its program to address increased access and improved quality
of primary education in rural areas. The Bank progressively moved to strengthen
participatory processes to foster more responsive and accountable local service delivery,
as well as to expand opportunities for early childhood education.

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
Bank assistance contributed to a transformation in rural primary education through the
2006 Rural Education and Development (READ) Project. This was the Bank’s first
education project in Mongolia. The objective of the project was to enhance the quality of
education in rural primary schools by improving student access to and use of quality
learning books and improving teacher pedagogic skills through promoting professional
networks. Prior analytical work had revealed huge learning gaps for rural children.
Field missions to the provinces suggested that supplying libraries to primary school
classrooms together with targeted training to teachers to use more active and rewarding
pedagogic methods could be the most effective way to reduce these gaps. The project
contributed to shifting the dialogue with the government toward quality, rather than
merely access and school construction. Also, with implementation at the classroom
level, the project design helped to empower teachers, which was also a positive shift
away from a centralized education structure.

CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
The project has yielded a long list of positive outcomes. Positive outcomes attributed to
the READ project include restarting the market for children books;10 improving student
access to and use of books;11 improving teacher pedagogic skills in reading;12 and
fostering the participation of parents and the community in children’s learning. During
the field visits, the evaluation team was able to confirm that primary education has
moved away from rote learning. In addition, classrooms are now colorful and attractive
places, often with upgraded school dormitories and heating provided through the
community-based initiative of the Sustainable Livelihoods Program (SLP). The Bank’s
Education for All–Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI) also provided funding for school
construction and renovation, both in rural and urban areas. In the words of one official
with close involvement in the project, “The program changed the attitudes of parents
and also changed how children spent their leisure time. Children stayed in the
classroom to read the books or prepare their own story books.”

The Bank also made effective use of trust funds to help improve national education
services, and included some well-designed components to address the specific
challenges of the nomadic life.

        The Education for All annual grant (2007–2009) made through the EFA-FTI13
         aimed to ensure universal completion of basic education, as well as to close the
         gender and rural/urban gaps in enrollment and school completion by 2015.
        The 2012 Global Partnership for Education focused on early education for
         children between the ages of two and five. The Trust Fund aimed at providing
         greater kindergarten capacity in urban and peri-urban areas, and the placement
         of 100 mobile ger kindergartens in rural areas with large populations of herders‘
         children and low pre-school enrollment rates.14
        The 2012 grant from the Japan Social Development Fund (JSDF) seeks to improve
         the education outcomes of the most vulnerable children between the ages of five
         and 10 in four educationally underperforming and underserved rural provinces
         in Mongolia.

Bank analytical work15 focused on financial efficiency and equity. The Bank made
recommendations to introduce incentives for efficiency in school spending; enhance
equity across schools, students, and teachers; and promote transparency at all stages of
school finances.

The Bank program also contributed to a significant expansion of kindergarten
attendance. This was supported through the EFA-FTI and the Early Childhood
Education Project, which provided funding for the introduction of mobile kindergartens

satisfaction survey found that 80 to 90 percent of parents judged the ger kindergarten
services as either very good or excellent.

Despite Bank efforts, learning levels are not being effectively monitored. Efforts to track
student achievement have been a major area of weakness during the evaluation period.
In 2007, the READ project helped the Education Evaluation Center (EEC) to carry out
activities related to Mongolia’s participation in the 2007 Trends in International
Mathematics and Science Study (TIMSS).16 However, the government decided to
discontinue the implementation of TIMSS and the “Progress in International Reading
Literacy Study.” In 2008, the Bank provided assistance to the EEC to develop a national
assessment of student achievement aligned with the new curriculum. It covered the
reading and writing of the Mongolian language as well as mathematics at the end of
grade 5. There was no follow-up to the 2008 assessment of learning outcomes given the
lack of sustainable financing, overall capacity, and government impetus. However, the
new IDA project aims to assess early grade learners in math and native language and to
support national assessment in Grade 5.

CONCLUSION
The Bank’s policy dialogue and program has made significant contributions to
education in Mongolia. The policy dialogue shifted the government’s attention toward
the need to improve the quality of education. Bank projects introduced reforms in rural
primary schools that are now being scaled up at the national level through government
policies. Building on the success of READ, the government and the Bank are preparing
a new project called the Educational Quality Reform Program to support the
government in improving reading and math learning outcomes of primary school
children. The project plans to scale up the READ project to achieve national coverage
and support the national rollout of the Early and Fifth Grade Reading and Mathematics
Assessment to monitor student-learning outcomes.


Improving Rural Livelihoods
RESULTS
Rural living conditions have dramatically changed for the better since the mid-2000s.
Even with the recent urban migration, more than 40 percent of the population still lives
in rural areas. Despite the migration, there is little doubt that rural life is becoming less
harsh— and that the quality of life and the economic opportunities for herders have
expanded enormously. Most herders now have a mobile phone, television, and
refrigerator powered through electricity obtained from solar panels. Most herders have
a foot in the capital city, Ulaanbaatar, through children who have enrolled in higher
education institutions and stayed there. The younger children often attend school in the


                                                                                            63

IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
soum and stay with their mothers or relatives there, later joining their parents in the ger
during the summer months.

However, herders remain vulnerable to declines in prices for livestock products. During
the global economic crisis, the crash in the price of cashmere combined with higher
prices for basic commodities severely squeezed poorer rural households. With little or
no savings, herders had to sell livestock for meat in order to cover basic subsistence
costs. Moreover, the sale of cashmere wool has been adversely affected by the
appreciation of the exchange rate. The government tries to support agriculture by not
imposing taxes on herders and subsidizing wool. Similar subsidies are under discussion
for meat and milk.

Another hazard is periodic extreme winters (dzuds) that typically cause significant
losses of livestock herds in some areas. Climate change has increased the frequency of
dzuds. During the most recent dzud of 2009–2010, up to one-third of livestock died.
Often the wealthier herders have sufficient supplies of fodder to mitigate the impact.
During a dzud, poorer farmers who have lost their livestock often move to the soum,
and soum residents in turn may move to the aimag (province) center or even to
Ulaanbaatar.

Decentralization has become an important part of the government strategy in recent
years. Given Mongolia’s large geographic size and widely dispersed population, a
consensus has emerged on the need for increased decentralization, which is one of the
few policies supported by the government and the opposition. The Integrated Budget
Law of 2011 redefined intergovernmental relations and provided funding to each local
community. The subsidy system needs revisiting, however, since subsidies are given
based on the difference between revenues and expenditures, which eliminates the
incentive to raise resources locally. There is discussion of a modest tax on livestock that
would generate substantial resources for local communities. In addition to funding for
salaries and maintenance expenditures, the Local Development Fund (LDF) has been
set up with decisions on its use to be made at the local level. Almost 80 percent of
soums are preparing local development plans to determine longer-term expenditure
priorities.

Effective decentralization is still a work in progress, however. In recent years, with
over-optimistic budgeting at the center, the allocations provided to local authorities
through the LDF have not been realized in practice. Nor can local governors reallocate
funds from one program to another—budget resources are earmarked for specific
activities. In addition, many soums still lack procurement expertise, and training is
required.

BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES
Although the Bank has not taken an integrated view of its interventions in rural
Mongolia, it has successfully designed interventions in several sectors to improve rural
livelihoods and reduce vulnerability. Nomadic systems present an enormous challenge
for development given the need to adapt to a widely dispersed and moving population.
The Bank’s program covers several activities that seem well coordinated on the ground
and have jointly produced important learning and synergies. Yet the country strategy
documents continue to take a sector-specific approach and to define outcomes as a
narrow reflection of project activities. There is scope for taking a more integrated view
of rural development, looking at the spatial dimension and migration issues— and
encompassing disaster management, environmental degradation, infrastructure
provision, social development, and agriculture and livestock production and marketing.

There seems to be a lack of strategizing on decentralization. The Bank has not analyzed
or provided advice regarding the regional structures and the administrative
responsibilities at various levels of provincial and local government. Mongolia seems to
vacillate on decentralization and recentralization over the review period, and the Bank
has adapted to these movements rather than trying to influence them. Still, the
unplanned synergies between the different parts of the Bank’s interventions in rural
Mongolia have been significant, and the imputed rather than the written strategy is
coherent and has contributed to overall program effectiveness.

BANK GROUP CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
The Bank has a consistent and well-formulated program in the rural sector. It evolved
out of a serious effort to understand the needs and vulnerabilities of Mongolia’s herders
and to design programs that relate to their needs. Overall, these efforts provide
coverage of almost every area of rural life and form the basis for reducing vulnerability,
raising income levels, and enhancing the quality of life. More specifically, the program
covers activities to support sustainable pasture management, reduce herders’
vulnerability to climatic shocks, diversify income-generating activities, and improve
access to physical and social infrastructure (see box 6.2).

IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION

 Box 6.2. An Array of Projects to Support Rural Livelihoods
 Bank activities address many of the critical challenges faced by the rural population as
 identified in the 2006 Poverty Assessment.
 Promoting sustainable pasture management
    Improved pasture management to develop optimal grazing patterns (a comprehensive
     mapping of pasture areas was undertaken; tractors were given to farm cooperatives to
     allow them to harvest fodder for winter feeding; and storage facilities were created for
     fodder).
 Reducing herder vulnerabilities
    Micro-finance to support off-farm employment in the soums (districts) and aimag
     (province) centers.
    Insurance to enable farmers to protect themselves against the dzud winters and the
     associated loss of livestock.
    Emergency disaster management through the development of early warning systems.
 Improving access to infrastructure
    Community infrastructure selected through participatory mechanisms at the bagh (ward)
     level (each soum is divided into three or four baghs).
    Decentralization of decision making on local expenditure programs to the aimags and
     soums.
    Solar panels for providing electricity to the gers scattered through the countryside.
    Enhancing rural connectivity with information and communications technology at the
     soum and bagh levels.
 Improving education services
    Upgrading education through the provision of books to rural communities and new
     teaching methods including parental involvement in their children’s education and
     encouraging innovation rather than rote learning.
    Prospectively, new Bank support will be provided for:
    Horticulture development through support for gardens in the vicinity of the gers to
     increase vegetable consumption.
    Moving livestock production up the value chain by quality enhancement and by linking
     farms to larger processing and distribution enterprises.


CONCLUSION
Mission evidence suggests that the rural program as a whole merits recognition as best
practice.17 The individual programs are detailed in appendix C. It is not putting it too
strongly to say that they have transformed life in rural Mongolia for the better. Apart
from individual project results, the projects created synergies between them and the
way in which their various components reinforced the support for higher living
standards for herder households and the adaptation of the traditional nomadic way of
life in a modern, growing economy. For example, the Bank’s projects have changed the

                                                    IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
way herders provide for livestock pasture and fodder needs, attain access to the closest
sources of water, receive warnings about bad weather, buy livestock insurance if they
wish, benefit from improved primary education for their children, receive better
medical services, participate in local planning and investment decisions, and use energy
to watch television, store food, and communicate with their families by mobile
telephones.

 The program has worked well with the macro-fiscal technical assistance in laying the
foundations for Mongolia’s decentralization strategy. The Single Treasury system
supported by the global financial management and information system (GFMIS) has
now been extended to 21 aimags, 330 soums, 14 villages, the city of Ulaanbaatar, and 9
districts, as well as all of the line ministries. The Integrated Budget Law of 2011
provided for the establishment of the Local Development Fund, which was the
institutionalization of the Community Initiatives Fund supported by the Bank. Bank
analytic work as well as TA activities together with the SLP are making important
contributions to the design of an effective decentralization program.

Despite these favorable circumstances, the Bank did not make more of an effort to carry
out impact analysis on these programs, although the original designs included impact
analysis. This is unfortunate from a Bank-wide perspective since the validation of the
approaches adopted in Mongolia would create a strong argument for the relevance of
these approaches to other semi-nomadic pastoral economies.

Government commitment has been the key to the success of the program. In the words
of the SLP and Livestock and Agricultural Marketing Project (LAMP) Task Team
Leader when asked to compare the project with other Bank projects, “The projects are
part of the government’s program, and they take this ownership seriously. The
government will tell you about the project, what is working, and how they propose to
scale it up.”


Improving Urban Livelihoods
RESULTS
 Whereas the provision of municipal services in Ulaanbaatar has been gradually
expanding, the overall level of services has not kept up with the rapid expansion of the
ger areas. The population of Ulaanbaatar has continued to expand from 711,000 in 2000
to 1.02 million in 2010. It is expected to reach 1.3 million in 2015, with about 60 percent
living in the ger peri-urban areas. As of 2012, only around 55 percent of the population
had access to heating, water, and sewerage infrastructure on a reliable basis, and this
share was falling due to the continued expansion of the ger areas. The inability of

CHAPTER 6
IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
municipal infrastructure expansion to keep up with population growth had also
aggravated environmental conditions, including the pollution of air and soil, which
poses health risks such as respiratory diseases and hepatitis.

However, given the low density of ger areas, coupled with the extremely cold climate,
the provision of basic public infrastructure is not economically feasible. A 2010 Bank
study estimated that the connection of detached houses and gers to central water and
heating systems would be extremely costly and uneconomical (Kamata and others
2010). The existing system of public kiosks has emerged as the most practical means of
supplying water. As for heating, a 2011 Bank study evaluated the major abatement
options and determined that the promotion of improved stoves was the most efficient
first step for a long-term strategy to reduce pollution (World Bank 2011).

A series of disastrous flash floods during the summer of 2009 caused extensive damage
and raised awareness of Ulaanbaatar’s vulnerability to catastrophic risks. Over the past
decade, urban sprawl has led to the construction of high rises on the flood plain of the
Tuul River south of the city, as well as the expansion of ger districts and other
nonpermitted developments on landslide-prone slopes and ravines in the north of the
city. Devastation from the floods woke the city up to the need for early warning
systems and a more rigorous enforcement of land zoning and construction permitting
regulations.

BANK GROUP OBJECTIVES AND CONTRIBUTION TO RESULTS
The FY13–17 CPS targets improved infrastructure in the poor neighborhoods of
Ulaanbaatar. The CPS notes the increasing number of people exposed to natural
disasters in urban areas (mainly flash floods and earthquakes) and pollution caused by
burning cheap artisan-mined coal for heating in winter, and commits to assistance for
managing these vulnerabilities (World Bank 2012). The Bank’s major interventions
focused on improving the delivery of basic services in the ger areas of Ulaanbaatar,
notably the provision of water supply and heating. The Bank also encouraged
community-led infrastructure activities. Further, Bank activities attempt to prepare the
city to better manage disaster risk.

Regarding water services, the Bank’s interventions have been reasonably successful in
contributing to improvements in the quality and availability of water for large groups
of Ulaanbaatar’s peri-urban residents. Approved in 2004, the Second Ulaanbaatar
Services Improvement Project (USIP2) was devised to improve water supply to the
urban poor in a sustainable manner. The project has been successful in connecting the
remaining 30 percent of water kiosks in ger areas previously served by trucks to the
city’s main water network. Likewise, it led to an attendant improvement in water
quality and availability. Partly as a result, ger area residents experienced an important

                                                   IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
improvement in their quality of lives in terms of reduced health and safety risks from
previously a unreliable water supply, as well as reduced walking distances and waiting
in queues at water kiosks in extremely cold temperatures.

Nonetheless, neither Bank projects nor the sector studies were able to help put the water
utility on a sound financial footing. The Bank’s infrastructure report (World Bank 2007)
as well as the Water and Sanitation Sector Topic Paper (World Bank 2010) had
recommended increasing the Ulaanbaatar Water Supply and Sewerage Authority’s
financial autonomy, basing it on a more realistic approach to tariff regulation. However,
it had only limited impact. The USIP2 had enhanced the technical and project
management capacity of the company, but was only partially effective in strengthening
the financial position of the utility (IEG 2013). As a result, the utility has experienced
increasing financial losses and a growing dependence on the government to repay its
debts. The inadequate water tariff also blocked the government’s efforts to attract
private investors to the sector using the public-private partnership approach.

Bank-supported community development projects have demonstrated the feasibility
and desirability of community participation in the planning and implementation of
local improvements. The JSDF-funded, community-led Infrastructure Development and
Sanitation Project focused on improving the quality of life for the urban poor.
Specifically, it supported the creation and strengthening of citizen representative
institutions, and the piloting a community-driven development approach for
community participation in building local infrastructure. A follow-up project, the
Community-led Infrastructure for the Urban Poor in Ulaanbaatar Phase 2 Project, was
designed to assist some 10,000 of the most vulnerable households in ger areas to
generate additional income by scaling up community-led infrastructure development
activities. This led to the employment of nearly 13,000 previously unemployed ger
residents (49 percent women) through work on project-financed small works identified
by the receiving communities. The small infrastructure constructed through the project
(pathways, foot bridges, drainage, and so on) had an important impact in
demonstrating the feasibility and desirability of empowering community groups to take
a lead role in undertaking their own projects

Some progress has been made in improving disaster risk management. In response to
the summer floods of 2009 and the winter dzud of 2009–2010, the Bank is supporting a
project to improve disaster risk management18 by strengthening the disaster
preparedness of Ulaanbaatar. The Bank recently delivered the Flood Risk Management
Strategy for UB city with a hazard and vulnerability map in GIS system. As of early
2014, the project had helped to update Ulaanbaatar’s flood control regulations. In this
context, it has already led to the cancellation of several construction permits in flood-
prone areas.

IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION
CONCLUSION
Bank activities have broadly achieved their objectives, with the important exception of
not being able to help put the water utility on a sound financial footing. The Bank
program demonstrated the feasibility and desirability of community participation in the
planning and execution of local improvements, and has been successful in improving
the quality and availability of water services for the ger areas. However, the fact that
interventions have not been able to put the water utility on a sound financial footing
remains a major concern in relation to its ability to keep pace with the expansion of the
ger population and maintain the quality of services.

1These peri-urban areas are called gers because initially when the migrants move they live in tents until
they can afford to put up more permanent housing structures.
2The Bank produced a policy note to compare trends over 2002 –2008 entitled: “Progress in Poverty
Reduction in Mongolia : Did poverty decline between 2002/03 and 2007/08).” The paper uses the official
poverty line of 2007/08 as a benchmark and recomputed a comparable poverty line for 2002/03. The
paper concluded that consumption-based poverty declined substantially (-25.9 points) between 2002/3
and 2007/08. Poverty incidence declined both in rural (from 69.7 to 46.6 percent) and urban areas (from
54.1 to 26.9 percent). Not only the poverty headcount, but also the poverty depth and severity decreased
respectively from (-12.9) and (-7.4) over this period.
Through our discussion with the country team, we concur that the methodology used had some
weaknesses, and have strong reservations on using the projected estimates, especially an estimate of 61
percent for 2002/3 because of flaws in the methodology used. For example: (i) the adjustments are based
on the consumer price index (CPI) which is not always consistent with the change in the cost of the
poverty basket; and (ii) If we were to hold any basket constant, it would have been preferable to using an
estimate the basket in 2002/3 (an earlier period) as a benchmark. The cost of the poverty basket (even if
kept the same between 2002/3 and 2007/8) indeed rose much faster than the CPI, which was used to
make adjustments in the paper. The suggested estimates in the paper thus overestimate the rate of
poverty reduction. Using the cost of the same poverty basket used in 2002/3 from the survey data (only
using secondary sources) would result in a downward adjustment of the poverty line in 2007/8 by less
than 10 percent, which would be associated with a lower poverty estimate, but without the dramatic
decline implied by the paper.
3The proxy means test was not followed, and most non–eligible households receive benefits as local
governors influenced the outcome of the targeting formula, and programs officers had limited capacity.
4For example, conditionality was not monitored, hence beneficiaries continued to received benefits after
they had dropped out of school.
5The reduction in the contribution rate was offset by an increase in coverage and real increases in wage
(World Bank 2011a).

IMPROVING THE LIVELIHOOD OF THE POPULATION

6 One objective of the FY05–08 Country Assistance Strategy (Pillar 3) was to strengthen the reliability and
frequency of the national poverty monitoring system and enhance the capacity of the National Statistics
Office (p. 23).
7   Using multivariate proxy means test.
8The International Monetary Fund’s program called for a comprehensive review of the social protection
system to streamline transfer program and safeguard social safety.
9Prior to the law, parents had to pay 50 percent of food costs and other expenses which prove an obstacle
to their willingness to enroll their children to pre-school.
10 In the first phase, the initial purchase of books for rural schools was centralized. However, this was not
intended to be replicated in a later stage. In a second phase, the project contributed to the development of
an open and transparent system for selecting books based on the distribution of vouchers so that school
committees became responsible for the choice of titles when augmenting their stock of classroom library
books. The children’s book catalog allows publishers based in Ulaanbaatar to reach schools in rural areas.
It enabled these schools to order books using their limited resources. All titles supported in the project
were also included in the international children’s digital library (ICDL) and are available on compact disc
and online.
11 The project made learning materials available in rural Mongolia by establishing 3,560 classroom
libraries in all 383 rural primary schools. Each school received over 160 books, benefiting a total of 130,000
students. Training was provided for 4,144 rural primary teachers, and 383 school directors. Ninety
percent of beneficiary schools reported not having had books prior to the project interventions.
12 Alocal professional development network has been set up consisting of 95 core schools and 178 mentor
teachers.
13 Tohelp Mongolia move toward the goal of quality basic education for all, the Fast-Track Initiative (FTI)
grant aims to: (i) improve access to and promote completion of basic education (primary and secondary
education), with particular attention to rural areas; (ii) improve the quality of basic education; and (iii)
expand access to pre-school education in rural areas. The total allocation from the Education for All (EFA-
FTI) Catalytic Fund is $29.4 million for three years. Allocation is made annually. The allocation for each
year (disbursed in 2 tranches) is formalized by an agreement and an amendment of the Initial Grant
Agreement.
14The objective is highly relevant as many children who begin Grade 1 do not benefit from preschool
education and are not ready to enter primary school.
15Analytic work entailed the 2006 Institutional Review of the Education Sector and the 2009 Public
Expenditure and Financial Management Review.
16However, because of an issue with Trends in International Mathematics and Science Study (TIMMS)
data, the TIMSS report excluded Mongolia from the final report.

7. Conclusions, Lessons, and
Recommendations
Findings and Lessons
PRIORITIZING MINING IN THE COUNTRY PARTNERSHIP STRATEGY
The Mongolia program recognized the centrality of mining to Mongolia’s economy and
refocused its strategy to address mining-related challenges. This proved critical for
forging the credibility of the Bank and positioning it as a strategic development partner
of the government.

CONDUCTING A POLITICAL ECONOMY ANALYSIS ALONG THE EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRY VALUE CHAIN
The team used political economy analysis along with the natural resource management
framework to identify key entry points where the Bank could make a positive impact.
This innovative engagement helped the Bank better understand how policy choices
emerged given political incentives and dynamics. In this context, it helped to focus
analytical work on critical issues, and strengthen engagement on government
effectiveness.

BASING A MINING EXPERT IN THE FIELD AND STRENGTHENING COUNTY OFFICE CAPACITY
The country team made the right decision in placing a senior lead mining specialist in
the field in 2008—the first time the Bank had taken such a step. This proved valuable in
forging a proactive relationship and dialogue with the government and members of
parliament.

FOSTERING DEMAND FOR GOOD POLICIES
The Bank team expended much effort in informing public debates; organizing forums to
discuss policy trade-offs on national development including a specific debate on fiscal
management, social protection, mining-related policies, and banking issues; and
supporting capacity building of key stakeholders—the government, parliament, and
civil society organizations (CSOs). The team used various channels, regular economic
updates, and the media to convey strong messages regarding the risks and
opportunities facing Mongolia. These efforts have led to some progress in overall
transparency and have helped to strengthen oversight of CSOs in several areas
including mining, the environment, budget, and procurement. The Bank also actively
fostered knowledge exchange between Mongolia and other resource-rich countries that
successfully managed mineral resources and related challenges. This also proved vital
for the adoption of the fiscal stability law.


                                                                                       75
CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
ENSURING FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND QUICKLY TO EVOLVING GOVERNMENT PRIORITIES
The Bank Group was flexible and responsive in its approach. It readjusted its strategy to
respond to the mining boom, which had been overlooked in the 2005 CAS. It was also
quick to provide budget support during the global financial crisis. The extensive use of
TA in the overall portfolio proved very useful in quickly adjusting Bank assistance to
country-specific needs, especially at the time of the global economic crisis.


Recommendations
The evaluation concludes that the Bank provided relevant assistance. Its support prior
to the crisis laid the groundwork for improved policies. Its efforts during the global
economic crisis contributed to the prevention of a larger economic contraction and
strengthened legislation for smoother economic development. However, after 2009, the
lack of buy-in by the government to implement these reforms has left unchecked many
sources of vulnerability, and the economy remains exposed to boom and bust cycles.

 In considering recommendations, it is important to recognize the perspective of the
Mongolian government. To date, the main impact of resource availability has been to
enrich business magnates. Without cash transfers, the average Mongolian would have
seen little benefit from the country’s mineral wealth. At the same time, the cash transfer
program depleted the budget to the point where there was no fiscal space for much-
needed infrastructure investment. The new Ministry of Economic Development
contends that it needs the Chinggis bond to fund infrastructure—in effect borrowing
against future mineral earnings. The scale of future earnings relative to the small size of
Mongolia’s population should be sufficient to accommodate the required repayments
provided that mineral prices do not fall sharply.

In effect, this context posed challenges for Bank Group interventions that often support
the first-best option. To lock in a commitment to reform, the Bank may need to adopt a
more progressive approach, opting in some cases for the second-best option that will fit
the concerns of policy makers. This point also was raised in the political analysis report
that suggested that the Bank “engage in institutional and policy options that fit policy
makers’ concern and visions as opposed to first-best options” (World Bank 2009).

Nonetheless, the Bank would need to continue to inform all stakeholders through
regular briefings about the overall macroeconomic and financial situation—pointing to
the risks associated with opportunistic budgetary and monetary policies and the need
to make a pledge for more responsible policies in line with good practice.

                                                CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
Recommendations are proposed to encourage the Bank to concentrate its efforts on
locking in reforms that would reduce the economy’s procyclicality and streamline the
Bank support program to enable it to increase the depth of its engagement in key areas.

      Build the demand and capacity for good governance to strengthen
       accountability. It is important for the Bank to continue its efforts to nurture
       political debate between political parties and civil society, especially when
       stability is jeopardized. Quarterly economic monitoring, interactions with
       members of parliament, and engagement with the media (including television)
       should remain a critical part of the Bank’s agenda. Strengthening social
       accountability is a lengthy endeavor.
      Pursue efforts to improve public investment. Recognizing that the government
       might not refrain from more borrowing, the Bank’s agenda should put a high
       priority on support to improve public investment and safeguard the use of loans.
       The Bank should reorient its TA efforts toward supporting improved investment
       planning, preparation, appraisal, and implementation. It should strengthen its
       relations with the relevant departments of the newly merged Ministry of Finance
       and Economic Development and the Development Bank of Mongolia to assist
       them in working with the line ministries on better project development.
      Strengthen domestic capabilities for policy simulation. Together with the
       Mongolian authorities and independent think tanks, the Bank should undertake
       analytic work to develop alternative mineral production and export and price
       scenarios. It should also sponsor discussions about how Mongolia could manage
       potential price declines. The medium-term expenditure framework should be an
       important part of Mongolia’s participation in this work.
      Support the authorities in strengthening the banking system. The
       comprehensive bank reform program has not been endorsed by parliament, and
       the lack of follow-up legislation and enforcement of bank regulations jeopardizes
       macro-financial stability. Progress in this area remains critical to protect the
       economy from financial vulnerability. The Bank needs to remain engaged in
       supporting improvements in prudent regulation and supervision.
      Be more selective in supporting private sector development. The Bank could
       streamline assistance in developing the private sector. The country team might
       consider focusing on activities in which the Bank can have a direct impact on
       reducing poverty and improving rural livelihoods. For example, the Bank could
       promote ways to strengthen supply chains for livestock-based activities.
      Support the rural sector within the framework of the government’s
       decentralization program. Many parts of the Bank’s excellent rural program are
       being mainstreamed by the decentralization program. Bank efforts should be
       focused on helping the government to operationalize this program effectively.



                                                                                      77
CHAPTER 7
CONCLUSIONS, LESSONS, AND RECOMMENDATIONS
        Scale back support in the urban sector. In the interest of selectivity, the Bank
         should consider scaling back or eliminating its involvement with Ulaanbaatar.
         Migration is likely to continue and the capital will and should remain a major
         focus for donor activity. However, precisely because other donors such as the
         Asian Development Bank, the U.S. Agency for International Development, and
         the Japan International Cooperation Agency are active in the city, the Bank’s
         comparative advantage would seem to lie more in areas such as macro-
         management, governance, and decentralization as well as sectoral programs for
         infrastructure, finance, agriculture, environment and education. Most of these
         programs will continue to have major components in the capital city. This does
         not argue for the Bank stepping away, but by allowing other donors to take the
         lead, the Bank will be able to deepen its engagement in some of the important
         topics.

Appendix A. Gender Thematic Review
Context
GENDER STATUS IN MONGOLIA

Contradictions typify gender issues in Mongolia. It has fared well on the Human
Development Index,1 which is a composite measure of health, education, and income
indicators indicating parity between men and women. However, the Gender
Empowerment Measure (GEM) of the United Nations Development Programme, which
measures gender equality based on women’s participation and access to economic and
political opportunities, ranks Mongolia as low as 94 out of 109 countries (2009), similar
to Cambodia and Syria.2

As reflected in table A.1, maternal mortality almost halved between 2005 and 2010,
literacy rates were higher among females than males, and women on average live
longer than men and with higher life expectancy rates. In particular, gender disparities
exist in higher levels of education with far fewer males than females being enrolled.3
However, women continue to face challenges associated with joining the labor force—
where men’s labor force participation is consistently higher over the years—and in
political participation where the proportion of seats held by women in parliament is
historically very low. Obstacles for working women and female entrepreneurs include
child-care responsibilities, especially for low-income mothers. Other obstacles include
lack of access to capital markets, skills, and the social support required to lead small
and medium business enterprises.4 Other gender-based disparities include high rates of
domestic violence against women.5

GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
GENDER DIMENSIONS OF POVERTY

The gender poverty gap is more pronounced in rural areas than in urban areas.
According to the 2007-08 Household Socio-Economic Survey, the poverty gap in the
rural areas was 14 percent for females and 13.3 percent for males. In urban areas, the
gap is 8.9 percent for females and 7.3 percent for males.

Female-headed households tend to be poor in urban areas, whereas male-headed
households tend to be poorer in rural areas, according to the household survey.
However, it is important to note that almost eight out of ten female household heads
were widowed, divorced or separated, whereas nine out of ten male households were
married— often making female-headed households more susceptible to vulnerability
and falling into the poverty trap. The average size of female-headed households is
three, and four for male-headed households. Also, the average age of the female
household head was eight years older than that of the male head.

Political representation for women in Mongolia was 4 percent in 2010, one of the lowest
rates for women in politics charted globally, according to the Mongolian Inter-
Parliamentary Union. A newly established quota system requiring 20 percent of
parliament members to be women has led to a tripling in women’s political leadership
from 4 percent in 2010 to 12 percent in 2012. Though this figure represents an
improvement, the real changes related to decision making and power dynamics of an
increased number of women in politics remain to be seen.

Gender Assessment of World Bank Engagement
A gender assessment was conducted to analyze Bank engagement through a gender
lens for Mongolia country strategies, operations, and analytical work during the
evaluation period (FY05–13). An emphasis was placed on education and rural
livelihoods.

GENDER IN COUNTRY STRATEGIES

Throughout the evaluation period, there is little emphasis on gender issues in country
strategies until the FY13–17 country partnership strategy (CPS) period.6 The latter
suggests that while strong progress was made achieving the Millennium Development
Goal for maternal health, a downward trend is seen in women’s political participation.7
The CPS also mentions the Gender Equality Law adopted by the parliament in 2011,
and the 20 percent quota for women in parliament designated since 20128 to foster
greater political participation for women. The CAS FY13–17 also recognizes “persistent
inequalities” in economic opportunities for women, including low labor force
participation, as well as lower remuneration for women.9

                                                                    GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
Key findings from a portfolio analysis of lending and advisory work conducted for the
FY13–17 CPS suggested that the Bank could achieve a much greater impact through
better mainstreaming of gender considerations, particularly in key sectors such as
mining, rural livelihoods, urban infrastructure, and social protection. The Mongolia
Country Gender Action Plan (CGAP) of 2013 provides a roadmap for integrating a
gender dimension in Bank projects. However, implementation cannot yet be
determined since several projects are ongoing and not closed.

In the international donor context during the CAS FY13–17 period, the World Bank is
seen to have a comparative advantage in focusing on gender dimensions of economic
development (for example, labor restrictions and pension reform).10 There is also an
emphasis on gender issues as the Bank follows up on a recent series of policy notes on
poverty, where it will specifically looks at the gender dimension of poverty and
inequality.11 The Bank also plans to disseminate a series of policy notes around “women
and the labor markets” and “women and mining.”12

GENDER IN ANALYTIC AND ADVISORY ACTIVITIES

The Bank conducted analytical work on gender issues during the evaluation period
focusing on a Gender Assessment (2005), Impacts of the Economic Crisis (2011), Gender
Disparities in the Labor Market (2013), Social Impacts of Mining in southern Mongolia,
and the CGAP (2013) to implement and monitor gender-related priorities in the FY13–
17 CPS.

The 2005 Gender Assessment emphasized evidence from recent studies demonstrating
that the impacts of the economic transition were different for women and men. During
the transition, poverty increased as previously protected jobs disappeared, and social
services were reduced, thereby aggravating the effects of unemployment. The
assessment also points to evidence from the census and a Participatory Living
Standards Assessment that a disproportionate number of female-headed households
are living in poverty, and their proportion is increasing. An increase in migration has
disrupted social networks and added pressure on women to manage multiple
responsibilities.13 The recommendations of the 2005 Gender Assessment include
systematic gender mainstreaming in implementation and monitoring of existing
policies, as well as gender-sensitive budgeting of government poverty reduction
programs. However little translation of these recommendations is seen in World Bank
programs and project portfolios.

Analytical work regarding the social impacts of mining in southern Mongolia suggests
that particular attention should be paid to integrating women into the labor force. 14 The
study points out that mining and construction sectors face more challenges relating to



                                                                                        81
APPENDIX A
GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
women’s labor force participation. There is a 39.2 percent gender gap in the mining
sector and a 13.8 percent gender gap in the construction sector. This compares with the
service sectors, where the gender gap in the restaurant and hotel sector is 29.6 percent in
favor of women. Barriers to women’s participation in the labor force include
discrimination based on gender, age, family status, and absence of childcare.

The study on the social impacts of mining in southern Mongolia also points to social
risks associated with the artisanal mining sector. Since artisanal mining results in
development of unplanned settlements, there are associated social problems. These
include a lack of basic services affecting human development outcomes, law and order
problems resulting from high alcohol consumption, and rampant domestic violence—
all of which often disproportionately affect women.15

A more recent analysis of the impacts of the economic crisis in Mongolia showed
increased discrimination in the labor markets as reflected in widespread discrimination
in hiring decisions based on age, gender, and appearance.16 Women faced additional
requirements related to “good appearance and body shape,” and some organizations
preferred hiring men since women might incur losses as the result of a one-year
maternity leave.17 In rural areas, microcredit and training in nonpastoral livelihoods
encouraged women’s entrepreneurial activities.18 The study also suggested an increase
in domestic violence. Unemployment among men and alcohol abuse were seen as the
reason for the increase in domestic violence, which was more common in urban areas.19

The Bank also conducted a study on gender disparities in labor markets and policy
suggestions (2013) in Mongolia, observing that women have a limited presence in
managerial positions and entrepreneurial work, with working women taking on
additional household and childcare duties than men. The study suggests potential
policy actions that can be considered, including improving employment outcomes
(wages, career progression) for women in the public sector, introducing more friendly
parental leave policies that cover both fathers and mothers, improving childcare
services, and introducing affirmative action policies in sectors in which women are
underrepresented such as mining. Other suggested policies include promoting
awareness of and encouraging the development of appropriately regulated and
supervised micro-lending institutions.20

The CGAP 2013 provides a roadmap for implementation and monitoring of gender-
related priorities in the FY13-17 CPS. The intention is to establish dialog with the
country team on how best to support CPS gender objectives to increase development
effectiveness. Task teams of specific projects have been asked to ensure that gender
sensitive analysis and/or consultations are undertaken, and that gender actions be
included in Project Appraisal Development and Results Framework. The CGAP

implementation will be monitored through the CGAP Results Framework. The 2013
Mongolia CGAP is definitely a step in the right direction for integrating and connecting
analytical and country strategy work with operations and projects.

GENDER IN OPERATIONS AND PORTFOLIOS

This section reviews Bank lending in the education and rural sectors.

Education Sector Results

Mongolia has experienced a reverse gender gap in access to education that is
progressively closing. In primary education, Mongolia experienced a reverse gender
gap until 2005. Boys also tended to disproportionately drop out of school, but the
current gender imbalance is less extreme than it was 15 years ago.21 However, this trend
changed by 2010 as the primary school enrollment rates for boys became slightly greater
than for girls. However, the gender gap is still reflected in higher levels of female school
enrollment in secondary and tertiary education throughout the evaluation period (see
table A.2), although this gap is improving over time.22 The difference in secondary
enrollment rates has significantly declined in less than a decade, but girls continue to
obtain much more tertiary education than boys do. However, with regard to learning
outcomes, achievement tests show little difference between boys and girls, although for
both genders the low learning levels are worrisome.

Several reasons can be attributed to the reverse gender gap in education, including
specific challenges related to the gender dynamics in herding communities. Since men
are responsible for cattle, boys are taken out of school for herding.23 Sons in poorer


                                                                                                83
APPENDIX A
GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
herder families serve as child labor for animal husbandry, and 60 percent of all
dropouts for the ages of 8–15 year are boys. The reverse gender gap is also explained by
changes in the post-Soviet times; with the fall of Communism, males could resume their
traditional role as herders of the family livestock.24 Under the former Soviet economic
system, 60 percent of students in higher education were male, but as the government’s
vocational and technical training schools closed, young males were encouraged to stay
in the countryside.25 Mongolian culture also encourages parents to pass their in
heritance of material possessions, such as herds and land, to sons.26 At the same time,
parents want daughters to have some resources of their own rather than completely
depend on their husbands and paternal families.27 Therefore, they are encouraged to
have a tertiary education and become economically independent.

Another barrier to better access to primary education for nomadic communities is
delayed school enrollment until the second child is born and reaches school age. Since
the school entrance age was lowered twice—in 2005 from 8 to 7 years of age and in 2008
from 7 to 6 years of age—the problem of over-aged school children in remote rural areas
is more pronounced today than a few years ago.

The most vulnerable nomadic children face challenges in adjusting to school and
dormitory life. Approximately 40 percent of herder families prefer to have their
children accommodated in a school dormitory. They face emotional and psychosocial
challenges from family separation at a young age (5–10 years of age). Since dormitory
space is lacking, especially for students in primary school, a family may need to fall
back on other living arrangements, which may include splitting up the household
during the school year. For example, the mother might stay with the child near the
school, or accommodations might be made with relatives or friends, or separately
alone.28

Changes in education policies by the government have also led to increased male
enrollment rates. For example, the government formulated the Master Plan 2005–2015
for the education sector that contains plans to provide better access to primary and
secondary education, and to maintain a gender balance in education services.29 The
abolition of the meat requirement policy (2000), which asked each family to pay in the
form of 70 kilograms of meat per year and was essentially a fee charged for meals in
school dormitories, helped reduce dropout rates. As this fee was abolished, education
costs fell particularly for nomadic families who would often take boys out of school
before girls.

Bank Contribution to Outcome
During the evaluation period, the Bank funded five education projects in Mongolia. The
strategic focus was to remove barriers to access and quality of primary education in
rural populations, most of which were comprised of herder communities. The Bank also
emphasized early childhood education in rural and vulnerable communities. Even
though trends on primary school enrollment changed through the evaluation period
with more boys being enrolled than girls, direct attribution to the Bank cannot be made.

The Bank’s Rural Education and Development (READ) project did not directly
emphasize any specific gender issues, but there were spill-over effects.30 The impact
evaluations of 2007–2008 and 2011–2012 looked at the project’s gender-related results.
They showed that female students achieved higher scores on the reading test than male
students; that gender differences had no influence on student writing skills; and that
female students had lower scores than male students on vocabulary tests.31 However,
direct attribution to the project is difficult to make.32 The emphasis on primary
education for nomadic communities was also seen in other Bank education projects
such as the Education for All–Fast Track Initiative (EFA-FTI), the Mongolia Global
Partnership for Education–GPE-ECE Project, and the Improving Primary Education
Outcomes Project. Even though the goal of the EFA-FTI Catalytic Trust Fund is to
ensure universal completion of basic education and to close the gender and rural/urban
gaps in enrollment and school completion by 2015, reports during implementation
(such as the Implementation Status Review [ISR]), track only the number of female
beneficiaries for the project rather than other indicators that would reflect closing
gender gaps in basic education.

More recent education projects seek to better track gender trends. The 2012 GPE-ECE, a
follow-up of the FTI, captures gender-disaggregated data. The data show that more
boys than girls were in the ger of children aged 2-5 in the urban districts of Ulaanbaatar
and where new kindergartens were provided. Data from project team show that the
baseline for these ger children for 2009–2010 was 66.8 percent for boys and 69.1 percent
for girls. Actual value achieved in 2013–2014 in year four was 73.27 percent for boys,
and 73.04 percent for girls.33 The 2011 Japanese Social Development Fund grant to
improve primary education outcomes for the most vulnerable children in rural
Mongolia focuses on four educationally underperforming rural provinces. However,
they have not yet provided gender-disaggregated data. The ISR (January 2013)
mentioned a target percentage for female beneficiaries, but no baseline or current data
are found in the most recent ISR.

The recent Education Quality Reform Project (2014) plans to focus on rural areas to
tackle the rural-urban education divide, addressing gender gaps as well. However, no


                                                                                        85
APPENDIX A
GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
targeted gender approach is identified in the project, and indicators are limited only to
the number of female beneficiaries at this point.

Overall, the Bank’s emphasis to close the reverse gender gap in the education sector
remained high even though gender-disaggregated data at the project level was not
collected. Direct Bank attribution is hard to access in closing the gender gap. However,
the primary school level reverse gender gap changed direction during the evaluation
period, with higher primary school enrollment rates for boys than for girls.

Rural Livelihoods

Female-headed households are poorer in urban areas, whereas male-headed
households are poorer in rural areas according to the most recent Mongolia household
survey (2010).34 Almost eight out of ten female household heads were widowed,
divorced, or separated, while nine out of ten male households were married.35

Bank Contribution to Results
World Bank engagement in the rural livelihoods arena was mainly through three
projects in the evaluation period: the Sustainable Livelihoods Project I (SLP I, 2002–
2008), the SLP II (2008–2013), and the Livestock and Agricultural Marketing (LAMP)
Project (2013–2017).

Even though there was no specific emphasis on gender issues, the SLP contributed to
improving women’s livelihood in rural areas. With the improving access to
infrastructure component, the SLP I contributed to an increase in the use of maternity
rest homes by herder families with home births.36 This may have contributed to better
maternal and infant health care outcomes. There was also an increase in children from
herder families (often the poorest and vulnerable) who benefitted from the availability
of dormitories. A total of 30,784 children from poor and vulnerable households were
housed there.37 They were provided with warm blankets, new beds, tables, facilities for
reading and playing, learning rooms, and washing rooms. These amenities helped to
increase the number of herder and poor children living in dormitories by 12,762.38 No
gender-disaggregated data are available for this component of the project. Outcomes of
the project were rated satisfactory both in the Implementation and Completion and
Results Report (ICR) through the project team’s self-assessment and in the ICR Review
by the Independent Evaluation Group.

Women also benefitted from the microfinance component of SLP I. The Micro-Finance
Development Fund outperformed it original targets. By project end, approximately
$7.13 million was allocated to Participating Financial Institutions (PFIs) as wholesale
loans. A total of 29,021 sub-loans had been disbursed to 141,602 beneficiaries (direct and

                                                                              APPENDIX A
                                                                   GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW
indirect), of which 38.3 percent of sub-borrowers were women.39 The quality of the PFIs’
portfolios has been high with a repayment rate of 98.9 percent on the sub-loans.40 The
targeting of poorer households was also successful, with 47 percent of sub-loans lent to
households below the poverty line.41

The SLP II had better participation and tracking of women beneficiaries in the project
compared to the SLP I. A strengthened gender dimension was seen as women were
involved in various components of the project. Women’s participation in community
meetings and decision-making processes increased at the soum level and below.42 On
average, women constituted 44 percent of bagh meeting participants. The microfinance
loans also benefitted women, as 37.4 percent of subborrowers were women compared to
62.6 percent men,43 even though more men benefitted than women did. Regarding the
community involvement (CI) component of the project, it was observed that 69 percent
of women were directly involved in the undertaking of local activities as compared to
72 percent of men.44 Also, more women (94 percent) were aware of the CI mechanism
than men (87 percent).45 Even though the project tracks the number of beneficiaries,
little information is found on how more women’s participation in the project actually
led to greater economic empowerment (in the context of microfinance) or a voice for
women (through community participation).

The Livestock and Agricultural Marketing Project (LAMP) has a significant gender
emphasis. The project started in 2013, so implementation is still underway. However, it
adopts gender mainstreaming as a core aspect of project implementation to ensure
equity and empowerment. The LAMP focuses on activity and income diversification,
which is expected to have a positive impact on women.46 Regarding the component on
linking herders to markets, the project will pay attention to identifying women’s groups
(formal and informal) during the beneficiary identification process and identify training
and technical support requirements of women’s groups through needs assessments and
training programs. The pilot horticulture production subcomponent of the project will
support income and nutrition diversification through horticulture production and
processing. Since this is a pro-poor investment, the horticulture production will focus
on female-headed households, groups of unemployed families, and herders with
animal heads below the national average to establish basic vegetable production plots.47
The project will also develop training and services that respond to actual gender or age-
based division of labor and technical needs in various aspects of animal production, as
women perform most of the young animal care and milking.48 The social monitoring
plan for the project will have relevant indicators for measuring impacts on the
participation of women in the project.49

GENDER THEMATIC REVIEW

Conclusion
Beginning in 2010, there has been an increased emphasis on gender issues during the
evaluation period in the CASs, analytical work, and the project portfolio. Since the
gender emphasis is recent, translation into the project portfolio and outcomes on the
ground are not yet evident. Overall, Bank engagement on gender issues in Mongolia
has been limited to livelihoods programs and a spill-over effect from the rural
education programs. Little analytical work has translated into gender integration in the
project portfolio.

Identifying and integrating more gender-targeted approaches in the Mongolia
education portfolio would help to close the reverse gender gap. A focus on vocational
training and employment generation programs could also lead to better employment
and economic opportunities and reduce gender disparities in labor force participation.

Appendix B. World Bank Group Instruments and
Performance Ratings
Appendix B describes the main trends and sector allocations in the World Bank Group’s
portfolio over 2005–2013 and discusses the performance of Bank operations as well as
the overall portfolio risk during this timeframe.

Official development assistance to Mongolia in terms of gross national income has been
decreasing over the evaluation period since the mining boom fueled growth and
increased gross domestic product per capita (figure B.1). The World Bank Group is a
key participant in the donor community for Mongolia and is seen as an influential and
constructive partner, often playing the role of a leading partner.

The Bank Group used a variety of instruments to provide financial and knowledge
support to Mongolia. This appendix describes the main trends and sector allocations in
the Bank Group’s portfolio over the evaluation period. It also discusses the performance
of Bank operations as well as the overall portfolio risk during this timeframe.

From FY05-13, the Bank Group committed a total of $253 million in International
Development Association (IDA) credits and grants, and $298.2 million in net


                                                                                                                                   91

commitments by the International Finance Corporation (IFC). The Bank also approved
$58 million in trust fund grants during this period. Thirty-six percent of the Bank’s
administrative budget was spent on project supervision, 32 percent on analytic and
advisory activities (AAA), and 26 percent on lending.

Lending by the International Development Association
IDA’s lending increased sharply during the financial crisis as Mongolia relied on
budget support to ease fiscal adjustment. The trend in IDA commitments is shown in
figure B.2. With the exception of the two crisis development policy credits (DPCs)
which constituted 28 percent of the total value of IDA commitments during the
evaluation period, all of the other lending was through investment loans. Net
disbursements to Mongolia surged to an annual average of about $60 million over
FY10–11 because of crisis lending. The annual net disbursements have averaged about
$20 million since FY12.

World Bank activities were concentrated in four broad areas that together accounted for
93 percent of the value of new IDA commitments, including: economic policy, energy
and mining, agriculture and rural development, and financial and private sector
development. (Figure B.3). Economic policy accounted for the largest share of
commitments, most of it from the two crisis era DPCs. Prior to the global economic
crisis however, the greater share of IDA commitments were to agricultural and rural
development, which accounted for 41 percent of FY05–08 commitments.

WORLD BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RATINGS
Regarding nonlending operations, the Bank delivered 69 AAA in Mongolia between
FY05 and FY13. These included 47 economic and sector work (ESW) and 22 technical
assistance activities. The bulk of AAA focused on economic policy, energy and mining,
financial and private sector development, and urban development, which together
accounted for 55 percent of the number of AAA products (figure B.4). Examples of key
services delivered included: reports on mining; assessments of poverty, the investment
climate, and the financial sector; public expenditure reviews; and a report on public
investment planning. A notable contribution of the Bank’s AAA in Mongolia was the
quarterly, and then from April 2009, monthly Economic Updates. These played an
important role in disseminating the rationale for, and progress on, reform measures, as
did the updates on the impact of the crisis on the macroeconomic, financial, and
corporate sectors.

Investments by the International Finance Corporation
The net investment commitment of the International Finance Corporation (IFC) during
this period amounted to $298.2 million for IFC’s own account, across 28 investments.
Most investments were in the Finance and Insurance portfolio, followed by
Construction and Real Estate. A majority of IFC’s transactions in Mongolia were long-
term loans, which accounted for 84 percent of the investment program. Equity
investments amounted to 10 percent ($29.2 million). In the financial markets sector,
IFC’s investments supported banking consolidation; increased bank-lending volumes to
target underserved segments; and expanded product and service offerings in the
market. These investments also included institutional strengthening and advisory work
to improve risk management and spread best practice lending standards. IFC also
successfully established trade finance lines with five local banks. Other IFC investments
include $50 million for the construction of the first Shangri-La hotel in Mongolia, and a
$30 million investment in MCS Holdings LLC, one of Mongolia’s leading private
companies, diversified across such sectors as food and beverage, cashmere, and real
estate. In the mining sector, IFC is supporting an international consortium in assessing
financing of the Oyu Tolgoi copper and gold mining complex.

During the same period, IFC also increased its advisory services in Mongolia and was
involved in projects to help develop the business and investment climate and support
financial markets. IFC’s involvement and advisory services support to Mongolia’s
Credit Information Bureau helped develop the country’s financial markets
infrastructure.

Guarantees from the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
The only operation of the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency during the
evaluation period was a FY06 guarantee for a $20 million investment, which was
canceled in FY07.

Portfolio Performance and Risk
IEG assessments of completed Bank operations in Mongolia indicate better
development outcome ratings (86 percent, moderately satisfactory or better) than the
average for the East Asia and Pacific Region (79 percent) and the Bank as a whole (73
percent) (table B.1). Two projects in the Mongolia portfolio were rated as moderately
unsatisfactory or worse. The Economic Capacity Technical Assistance Project was rated
as unsatisfactory because it was found to be overly complex, and its design did not
adequately account for country conditions. The FY04 Second Ulaanbaatar Services
Improvement Project received a moderately unsatisfactory rating because the project
was not well designed to meet either its quality of life or sustainability objectives. The
design of the project was based on the assumption of future high increases in water
tariffs for apartment buildings in Ulaanbaatar, which never materialized because
decisions on tariff policy were outside the control of the project.

IEG’s review of closed projects found a significant risk to development outcome in four
(36 percent) of the eleven instances where risk was assessed. The total value of loans to
these projects was about $89 million or 51 percent of the value of all projects assessed
for risk to development outcome. Three of the four projects in question were approved
for FY01–04, and one was approved in FY11. The largest, a $29.7 DPC Phase II project,
faced risks arising from too much dependence on high commodity prices accompanied
by a procyclical fiscal policy and uncertain political commitment to reforms.

WORLD BANK GROUP INSTRUMENTS AND PERFORMANCE RATINGS
The riskiness of the Bank’s Mongolia portfolio under implementation increased sharply
as of FY08 and has fluctuated since then— albeit remaining below the average of both
the East Asia and Pacific Region (EAP) and the World Bank portfolio as a whole.
Between FY05 and FY07, no Bank operation in Mongolia (and none of the
commitments) was considered to be at risk. This was in contrast to an average of 7.7
percent of projects and 5.5 percent of commitments at risk in the East Asia and Pacific
Region, and a world average of 15.3 percent of projects and 13.1 percent of
commitments at risk over the same period. At the time of the financial crisis in FY08, the
commitments at risk in the active portfolio increased sharply to 10.7 percent, and
exceeded the Regional average of 8.5 percent and decreasing thereafter. More recently
in FY13, the riskiness of the Mongolia, Region, and world portfolios increased to their
highest levels since FY05, both in the number of projects and commitments at risk. The
Mongolia commitments at risk stood at 14.7 percent (against the Region, 16.7 percent;
and Bank, 23 percent). The proportion of projects considered at risk was 20 percent
(against the Region, 22.1 percent; and Bank, 25.1 percent).

Supplemental Information on Pillar 1
FIRST PHASE: PRIOR TO THE CRISIS, 2004–2007

 The Bank supported a comprehensive TA program to improve budgetary and public
expenditure management systems and processes.1 In 2003, the Bank recognized that
despite improvements in the previous period, significant weaknesses in Mongolia’s
public financial management (PFM) framework remained. These included: (i) poor
annual budget planning and execution leading to unpredictable budget outcomes and
arrears; and (ii) weak accountability of the efficiency and effectiveness of public
expenditure programs because of poor monitoring and information.2 To address these
issues, the Bank financed an integrated package of assistance toward the strengthening
of budget planning, execution, reporting, and accountability. The program was fully
aligned with the government-owned reform strategy and the requirements of the core
national budget legislation. As a result, it had broad coverage and an ambitious design3
(see box C.1).


 Box.C.1. Objectives of the Broad Bank-Supported Public Financial Management Program
 The Bank-supported program was comprehensive, targeting a wide range of areas to
 improve public financial management in Mongolia. The program can be summarized as
 follows:
    Add discipline to budget preparation, policy planning, and budget formulation through
     the upgrading of the core legal framework; develop a comprehensive medium-term
     expenditure framework that would cover both the center of the government and the
     agency level.
    Improve budget execution and accountability systems through the full rollout of the
     Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS) and associated
     improvements in the quality of budget controls and reporting;
    Strengthen public finance accounting and internal auditing at the central and agency
     levels.
    Strengthen budget oversight and monitoring by building the capacity of the government
     to move to a unified accounting system, as well as to improve and expand the functioning
     of state audit entities.
    Strengthen procurement at the central and agency levels by assisting the government in
     refining the overall legal framework for procurement.

APPENDIX C
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE EVALUATION PILLARS
During program implementation, it became clear that the projected timeframe for
achieving the outcomes was unrealistic. Reform progress, measured against the
program’s original targets, was uneven. There were significant delays in achieving
some of the objectives, and important parts of the program remain a work in progress.
Mongolia did not have in place the necessary basic PFM capabilities on which rapid
implementation of such a comprehensive reform package could be securely based.
Moreover, during the boom period of 2003–2007, in an environment of greatly
expanding public spending,4 the need for expenditure rationalization became less
pressing, which naturally eroded the political will to push for PFM reforms.5

The Mongolia Public Expenditure and Financial Management Report, completed in
2009, assessed the progress and set the stage for Bank support during the subsequent
crisis (World Bank 2009). The report provided a valuable stocktaking of what Mongolia
had achieved to that point and of what still needed to be done. It was a useful input into
the Bank’s program development and design. However, at the country level, it received
attention mostly from the Ministry of Finance. The report confirmed significant
progress in the areas of: (i) budget legislation that helped to reduce expenditure
leakages and arrears; and (ii) transparency and fiscal discipline, backed by progress
with adoption of the Government Financial Management Information System (GFMIS)
and treasury automation; (iii) debt management; and (iv) tax administration, primarily
in the area of mining taxation.6 However, major weaknesses remain, notably in
effectively using the Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF),7 monitoring
spending against set performance indicators, and reporting about budget execution on a
functional basis. Moreover, progress in the areas of investment project selection, public
procurement, external audit capacity, and intergovernmental budget transfers was
inadequate.

Overall, in spite of Bank support, Mongolia’s fiscal management arrangements failed
the test of the commodity boom (2003–2007). The government followed a procyclical
policy in 2006–2008 when commodity prices hit record levels. The national MTEF
targets proved to be irrelevant, allowing for budget deficits at times of unsustainably
high revenue inflows and providing for insufficient public savings. As a result, with
annual budget revenues equal to 40 percent of GDP, Mongolia’s fiscal space appeared
to be quite limited during the crisis. Specifically, the growth in public sector wages and
untargeted social transfers, large implicit subsidies (from energy tariffs), and an
overstretched public investment program limited the country’s fiscal space. The Bank’s
analytical work also noted concern over the role played by the parliament in the budget
process (World Bank 2009). High levels of parliamentary discretion in changing the key
parameters of government budget bills had proved to be an important factor
undermining overall fiscal discipline.

SECOND PHASE: THE 2008 CRISIS AND SUBSEQUENT QUICK RECOVERY, 2008–2010

During the global economic crisis, the Bank supported Mongolia’s adjustment to the
mineral price decline through two development policy credits (DPCs), approved in 2009
and 2010, and it realigned its TA to implement policy reforms introduced as part of the
adjustment program. The DPCs, which drew on the analysis undertaken in the Public
Expenditure and Financial Management Report, were designed to help the government
accommodate the costs of fiscal adjustments during the crisis and to lay the basis for
countercyclical fiscal management. They were relatively large in relation to the Bank
program, with combined disbursements of about $75 million8 (about two-thirds of the
International Development Association’s envelope for Mongolia during the period).
The Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) had significant policy leverage at
the time of the project preparation and negotiations as the government was facing the
consequences of earlier expenditure excesses. This was a window of opportunity for the
Bank to push for acceleration of the core policy reforms in Mongolia, especially those in
support of macroeconomic and fiscal sustainability.9.The policy objectives supported by
the DPCs included: the development of a more sustainable fiscal framework;
rationalization of capital budget planning and execution; compliance with the
Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI); and increased efficiency (targeting)
of Mongolia's social transfer system.

The Bank (and other donor) support for the adjustment program has made a significant
contribution10 to the achievement of the declared policy objectives. As part of the
adjustment program, the parliament adopted major pieces of legislation to lay the
groundwork for better fiscal management, including: (i) the Fiscal Stability Law which
provided a set of fiscal rules to impose budget discipline on mineral resources over the
commodity cycle (see box C.2.); (ii) the Integrated Budget Law which provided for
improvements in budget planning and practices at the central and local levels; and (iii)
the Social Welfare Law which provided for the introduction of targeted transfers in a
phased manner. The ICRs for the two DPCs identify areas where progress was made in
the PFM under the adjustment program, including: (i) a reduction in the number of
budgeted capital investment projects without feasibility studies; (ii) improved
accounting for the contingent liabilities accumulated under the public investment
program; and (iii) increased budget financing for priority maintenance of basic
infrastructure. Mongolia has become an EITI-compliant country.

APPENDIX C
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE EVALUATION PILLARS

 Box C.2. The Fiscal Stability Law
 The law imposes fiscal discipline to avoid the temptation to spend mineral revenues
 immediately, and it supports a stability-oriented fiscal policy. The Fiscal Stability Law (FSL)
 puts into place three complementary fiscal rules:
     A ceiling on the structural deficit of 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), effective
      from 2013;
     A ceiling on expenditure growth linked to the rate of growth of nonmineral GDP,
      effective from 2013; and
     A public debt ceiling of 40 percent of nominal GDP, in net present value terms, effective
      from 2014.
 The main rule targets structural balance defined as the difference between “structural”
 revenues and overall expenditures. Structural revenues are defined as revenues that would
 be received if the prices of major minerals were at a particular level, defined as a 16-year
 moving average of mineral prices. Transitional targets are defined for the intervening period
 until the fiscal rules take full effect.
 In addition, “the fiscal framework is supported by a stabilization fund for mineral revenue.
 When actual revenue exceeds structural mineral revenue, the difference has to be placed in
 the stabilization fund.”

THIRD PHASE: THE RUN-UP TO ELECTIONS AND THE POST-ELECTION PERIOD, 2011–2013
Once the global economic crisis was over, the government had no incentive to
implement newly adopted fiscal reform laws. Hence, the achievements expected from
this DPC-supported package of fiscal reforms did not occur. The overall stance of
macroeconomic and fiscal management substantially deteriorated during and
immediately after the program’s implementation. As commodity prices recovered in
2010, there was a massive increase in public expenditures in 2010–2012, largely driven
by increased spending on universal cash transfers, public wages, and capital spending
that was not well prioritized. As reported by the IMF, the fiscal policy was back to its
boom-and-bust pattern with a substantially widened budget deficit, high inflation, and
negative interest rates (IMF 2012, 9). The central provisions of the FSL became effective
in January 2013, and the approved 2013 national budget—the first one expected to be
prepared, approved, and executed in line with the new legal requirements—seems in
compliance only because the very large expenditures under Mongolia’s borrowing from
international markets were taking place outside of the budget.

High quality analytical work in investment planning and budgeting during this third
phase has had very little follow-up, despite the importance of the issues. A World Bank
report emphasized gaps in national procedures for project selection and appraisal, low

completion rates, and chronic problems with underfinancing of maintenance (World
Bank 2010). The follow-up report pointed to the lack of significant progress in project
selection and execution (Hasnain and others 2013). The authors also highlighted
problems in the implementation of the new procurement legislation, in part because of
inconsistency with other pieces of the country’s legislation. The report also discussed
the risk to the integrity of Mongolia’s public investment policy related to the creation of
the Development Bank of Mongolia (DBM) and its operation outside of the budget
framework.

Support for improvements in investment processing has been hampered by
coordination problems between the Ministry of Finance and the new Ministry of
Economic Development, as well as the Bank not being able to engage with the latter.
The Bank’s key partner in Mongolia for most of the period has been the Ministry of
Finance with which it has developed a close relationship. In 2012, political machinations
led to the formation of the Ministry of Economic Development, which was carved out of
the Ministry of Finance and given responsibility for the capital budget. With the major
expansion of the investment program undertaken with financing from the Chinggis
bond, the prioritization, preparation, and implementation of the investment program
became a key to sustainable development. The Bank has been slow to develop a
relationship with the Ministry of Economic Development and the DBM, which serves as
the off-budget financing arm for many of these projects.11 No technical assistance had
been funded from the Bank projects for the Ministry of Economic Development or the
DBM.12 The Bank continued its program of study tours for other ministries or
parliamentarians, but few Ministry of Economic Development or DBM officials appear
to have participated in them.

The Bank has also been supporting the Mongolian government in the design of its
Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF). Starting in 2010, the Multisectoral Technical Assistance
Project and Governance Partnership Facility provided funds to support the Ministry of
Finance with this task. Central to the support has been the involvement of experts from
Chile and the organization of an international conference on SWFs. Bank advisers
working with the government have proposed three sovereign wealth funds, 13 each to
meet a clearly defined economic policy goal. In 2014 parliament approved the setting up
of these funds (SWF Secretariat 2014). The three SWFs include:

      The Fiscal Stability Fund was established concurrently with the FSL in 2010 to
       stabilize volatile mineral revenue and smooth the government’s revenue stream.
      The Future Generations Fund, with a long-term investment horizon, was set up
       to convert a portion of Mongolia’s mineral wealth to financial wealth for the
       benefit of future generations.



                                                                                         101

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE EVALUATION PILLARS
         The Pension Reserve Fund, also with a long-term investment horizon, serves as a
          financial reserve to guarantee public pension obligations.

Overall, since 2010, the Bank’s ongoing PFM support program is modest in its
objectives, and progress remains slow. In recent years, Bank-supported TA has
contributed to the preparation of new regulations, studies, and training. The single most
important achievement relates to the rollout of the GFMIS to all Mongolian local
governments (soums), which is a key enabler of the government’s push toward
decentralization. Progress was also recorded with the implementation of a
computerized cadaster system and the introduction of a new system for public official
assets and income declarations. Program implementation remains slow, especially in
the areas of public procurement, payroll management, and the institutionalization of a
fully functional MTEF. The 2013 country budget was not backed up by a functional
MTEF. Budget revenue projections were overly optimistic, and the capital expenditure
side remained weak.


Supplemental Information on Pillar 3
IMPROVING ACCESS TO INFRASTRUCTURE
Energy

Mongolia had good access to electricity overall, but the distribution was uneven. Its
electricity system reached about 67 percent of the population, an impressive
achievement when considering its income level and low population density. However,
while almost all households in Ulaanbaatar and aimag centers and a majority of soum
(district) households had access to electricity, only 15 percent of the herder population
was being served. In addition, the sector was experiencing high levels of technical and
commercial losses, below-cost tariffs, and overdependence on donor financing for
rehabilitation and expansion.
The electricity sector reform process was under way, but had not yet led to the expected
efficiency and equity improvements. As part of the post-Communist transition, the
government had restructured the legal and institutional framework to detach policy
making from the regulatory function and the operating companies. The Energy Law of
2001 established the Energy Regulatory Authority and the separation of generation,
transmission, and distribution operations into separate companies. A 2004 tariff reform
had not succeeded in raising overall revenues for the distribution companies, while
implicit supply-side subsidies perpetuated high inefficiency in the system. The existing
subsidy scheme intended to help the poor was instead benefiting the nonpoor. Hence, a
few years after these changes, the operating companies had not yet been able to
generate the funds required for investments in new generation capacity or the proper
operation and maintenance of existing facilities. The result was poor quality of service
and continuing high transmission and distribution losses.

                                           SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION ON THE EVALUATION PILLARS
Heating had received little attention from the government, although it was the most
acute problem for the capital’s poor ger households—at least one-fifth of their total
expenditures are for heating fuels during winter. In contrast, households in the city
center connect to the district grid and spend on average 3 percent of their budget on
heating. The poor could not afford cleaner fuels or the more expensive and efficient
stoves. They mostly relied on burning low-quality, highly polluting lignite during
winter months. As noted in a Bank report (World Bank 2011), the associated health
impacts were equivalent to about 19 percent of Ulaanbaatar’s GDP, which pointed to a
need for public sector intervention.
Roads

The country’s road network was also more extensive than would be expected
considering its level of development and low population density. In 2004, there were
about 5,700 kilometers of improved roads, of which about 1,900 kilometers were hard
cover. However, only about 30 percent of the paved road network was in good
condition, which was indicative of the inadequate systems and capacities to prioritize
investments and undertake road maintenance within the fixed budget constraints.
Rapid urbanization had also created a new set of problems for the sector, with many of
the new urban residents having poor access to public transport services, and with those
services being unaffordable to many of them. In addition, the rapid increase in car
ownership with inadequate traffic management had resulted in severe traffic
congestion, a high number of traffic-related fatalities, as well as a significant transport
contribution to the poor air quality in Ulaanbaatar.
Water

In the early 2000s, Mongolia had a highly unequal and gradually deteriorating water
supply system. Whereas the core urban areas were served by relatively sophisticated
water supply and sanitation systems, 70 percent of the population living in the
surrounding ger areas and the countryside had to rely on manually hauling water from
public kiosks or natural sources—a particular hardship during the country’s long
winters. Water was of generally good quality, but the urban supply infrastructure had
deteriorated significantly since the pivotal shift from Socialist policy in 1995.
Subsequent governments had stressed the promotion of private initiatives and the
improvement of water services in ger areas. The Water Law was amended in 2004, but
the implementing regulations and decrees were not yet in place. In the meantime,
inadequate tariff levels had left the water agencies with inadequate funds for
maintenance and expansion into ger areas, as well as a backlog of rehabilitation needs
to improve efficiency and ensure regularity of supply (World Bank 2007).

THE BANK PROGRAM IN EDUCATION
This section provides more evidence regarding the positive outcomes attributed to the
READ project. These include restarting the market for children’s books, improving
student access to and use of books, improving teacher pedagogic skills in reading, and
fostering the participation of parents and the community in children’s learning.
Restarting the Market for Children’s Books

The book market had collapsed during the economic downturn of the 1990s. READ
helped put more than 200 new titles of children’s books on the market.14 Some of the
local Mongolian language books for primary school are now available through the
International Digital Library.
Improving Student’s Access to And Use of Books

Before 2006, rural primary schools in Mongolia had almost no books. READ established
grade-specific classroom libraries in 383 soum and bagh schools,15 and set up an
international children’s digital library in a subset of participatory schools.16 Integrating
reading into the curriculum has enhanced overall primary education quality. During
field visits, the evaluation mission could see that classrooms in each primary school in
the soum had a library corner with a selection of books for each grade.
Improving Teacher Pedagogic Skills in Reading

The READ project also supported the development and implementation of a teacher-
training program to promote new or improved pedagogic strategies,17 including
interactive learning and the use of digital libraries and laptops,18 and professional
networks. For example, students are asked to prepare their own illustrated books
(“small books”).19 At the same time, the books are used to develop critical reading and
creative thinking (“big books”)20 and role-playing in the schools. Follow-up surveys in
2007 and 2008 showed that not only had teachers used READ learning materials to
improve literacy skills, but they were also used to teach other subjects such as math and
science. To stimulate storytelling outside the classroom, READ introduced book bags,21
which allowed students to take books home and share stories with their families. A
focus group discussion with primary school teachers confirmed much enthusiasm for
these new and effective teaching methods that also changed the cultural perception of
reading.

Fostering the Participation of Parents and the Community in Children’s Learning.

As a way to reach out and involve parents and the greater community, the project
financed a national campaign to promote community and family participation in
schools around reading activities, emphasizing the role that parents can play in

monitoring teacher and student performance. Parents became involved in children’s
homework and in some soums, they had a say in selecting the books from a catalogue.

THE BANK PROGRAM IN RURAL MONGOLIA

Reducing Herders’ Economic Vulnerability

Improved pasture management, micro-finance, and community development have been
successfully supported through the Bank’s three-phase Sustainable Livelihoods
Program (SLP). The SLP was conceived as a long-term involvement that would address
the vulnerability and reduce the poverty of herders through carefully piloted activities.
The program began in 2001 and is still ongoing. Broadly, the idea was to conduct pilots
in 16 soums during the first phase (2001–2007), scale up to all 330 soums in the second
phase (2008–2013), and institutionalize the program in the third phase (starting in 2014).
Implementation Completion and Results Reports rated the outcomes of the first phase
as satisfactory, and the second phase as highly satisfactory.

The Community Initiatives Programs have provided some impetus and the basic model
for the government’s recent expansion of decentralization. Consultations are
undertaken through periodic meetings at the bagh (ward) center.22 The priorities
decided by the herders are then reported back to the soum center where community
representatives decide which proposals should go forward. Prior to this community
program, there was poor participation in the meetings held at the bagh level. However,
herders have quickly come to realize a link between the decisions taken at the bagh and
the funding received. Therefore, participation under the project has improved
substantially. Another positive feature is the active participation of women and youth.

Decentralization has been supported through Bank analytic work and will be the focus
of the third phase of the SLP. The Bank prepared a policy note on fiscal decentralization
that was discussed with the government. The note appears to have achieved its
objective of creating greater awareness of the policy and logistical issues that need to be
addressed in this area. Technical assistance was also provided by the Bank for drafting
the legal provisions of the Law on Decentralization and for work on the formulas for
revenue transfers. The third phase of the SLP will build on this through working with
the Local Development Fund (LDF) of the government to try to ensure its effective use.
The LDF is roughly 10 times the amount that the project provided to local communities,
and the project will provide technical support to the program.

The Bank designed an innovative livestock insurance to help reduce herders’
vulnerability to harsh winters. Insurance has been provided to herders through the
Index-Based Livestock Insurance Program (IBLIP), reflecting the realization that the loss
of livestock during extremely cold winters was an important cause of poverty in

Mongolia. The Bank of Mongolia approached the donor community for advice on what
could be done to protect herders. The Bank invited a group of experts to discuss a
possible insurance scheme. At that time, index insurance was well established for crops
but not for livestock. A workable design evolved from these discussions and was
piloted under the SLP Phase 1. The project was initially set up in a few aimags and after
successful piloting, scaled up to the country as a whole, starting in 2009. The Bank
played a major role in obtaining political buy-in for the IBLIP. It arranged study tours to
Indonesia and Switzerland and brought all 21 provincial governors to Washington, D.C.
to participate in sessions revolving around international experience. As a consequence,
there was a large body of support across institutions for the program.

The program was successful, and 15 percent of the herder population now buys private
insurance against loss of livestock in a dzud. The program is entirely handled through
the private insurance industry and involves the payment of annual premiums by
herders to the local insurance companies who participate in the IBLIP. The Bank project
essentially finances a reinsurance program. Seven insurance companies participate in
the project, and during the course of the project, they have expanded the number of
rural branches from 30-40 to 148. Funds are paid out to herders when there are losses
triggered by a severe dzud, which is defined not in meteorological terms but on the
basis of the average die-off in the aimag. Hence, the scheme does not trigger moral
hazard behavior but instead rewards good fodder management for the herders who
save a higher percentage of animals. A successful outreach campaign means that most
herders have heard of the IBLIP and understand what it does. In aimags that
participated in the pilot, coverage has reached 33 percent of herders, while in the newer
ones, it is 10-15 percent. The government intends to institutionalize the approach by
establishing its own reinsurance agency and fund.

To further improve pasture management and reduce herder’s vulnerability to climate
shocks, the Bank is also supporting the Emergency Disaster Management Program. This
has taken over the Livestock Early Warning System from the SLP and is extending it.
The project23 supports capacity building at the National Agency for Meteorology,
Hydrology, and Environmental Monitoring for the institutionalization and full
deployment of a livestock early warning system and the piloting of an emergency feed
and fodder production system to help reduce the impact of dzuds on rural livelihoods.
This system has provided accurate forecasting of weather conditions and has become a
major source of information for the herder community. Herders told the mission that
they had been impressed by how accurate the information was within a week of the
arrival of a serious weather event.

In future, agriculture and livestock value chains will be supported through the
Livestock and Agricultural Marketing Project (LAMP). As part of the preparatory work

for LAMP, the Bank has prepared reports on both the meat and livestock sectors. This
project is funded through a trust fund under the Global Agriculture and Food Security
Program and represents an important expansion of the range of Bank support. The
LAMP will focus on livestock products such as cashmere, leather, and meat for export,
as well as meat and milk for the domestic market. It will support the development of
enhanced quality standards in these areas. In addition, a small component of the project
supports horticulture production in home gardens around the settlements, with the
objective of improved diets and living standards of the poor. The LAMP will also
address some of the weaknesses that have emerged in the provision of veterinary
services and the National Breeding Program that arose after their privatization.

Improving Rural Population Access to Energy and Technology Services

The Bank contributed to greater electricity access in rural areas from a baseline of 15
percent in 2006 to 85 percent in 2014. Building on a successful pilot supported by the
Netherlands, the Renewable Energy for Rural Access Project (REAP) supported the
distribution and sales of solar home systems (SHS) to more than 67,000 households,
covering about 63 percent of the herder population. A follow-on beneficiary survey
found high levels (93 percent) of customer satisfaction and of sustainability of
equipment use (90 percent) six years after the purchase of SHS.

The almost universal availability of SHS brought about a dramatic transformation in the
herders’ lives. Major changes include a switch from candles to fluorescent lamps, from
radio to television, and from rare household-to-household contacts to near-universal
adoption of mobile phones, as well as access to new appliances (for example,
refrigerators). Since initial distribution, most herders have bought additional panels
from the market. During field visits, three or four solar panels could be seen outside of
almost every ger.

The REAP also accelerated the development of the SHS market. A reliable supply chain
and a countrywide system of 50 sales and service centers were established for solar
maintenance and repair, and to underpin manufacturer warranties. By mid-2014, the
market for SHS and direct current appliances, such as TVs and satellite receivers, had
become established over the entire country.

The coverage and use of information and communications technology (ICT) services
has grown through support from the 2006 Information and Communications
Infrastructure Development Project. It also aimed to increase private sector
participation in the delivery of e-government services. An incentive-based participatory
arrangement was addressed to private operators, encouraging them to install ICT
infrastructure in selected soums, while the project would finance their operating cost for

a number of years. The arrangement proved successful and helped the operators realize
that more demand for services existed than they expected, which led to services offered
in the remaining soums on a purely commercial basis. Whereas mobile voice services
were available only in about 100 rural soums in 2006, mobile voice and data services
became available in all 330 soums in Mongolia within the first three years of project
implementation. Moreover, over 150 rural herder communities gained access to public
telephone service at the bagh level; 34 soum centers have broadband Internet access for
public and private users including schools connected at discounted rates; and a modern
social media management system was successfully installed and is operational. Today,
operators report full coverage of the Mongolian population and acknowledge that the
project boosted the process of sector growth by at least three years.


1Four technical assistance loans totaling $50 million and focusing mainly on public financial management
(PFM) have been made available by the World Bank since 1998.
2See the Project Appraisal Document for the Economic Capacity and Technical Assistance Project
(ECTAP) approved in 2003.
3One reason for the project’s ambitious nature is that the government itself (with advice from
development partners) had announced a very ambitious set of reform targets inspired by the Organic
Fiscal Law (Public Sector Financial Management Law, PSFML) adopted in 2002. The PSFML introduced
advanced PFM standards in Mongolia, including the adoption of output-based budgeting, management,
and reporting as well as the adoption of accrual budgeting and accounting.
       investments in Mongolia increased by a factor of 20 in real terms between 2005 and 2012 (Hasnain
4 Public

and others 2013).
5 Asan example of the delays, by the time of its conclusion in 2013, the implementation of the ECTAP had
taken almost 10 years and the closing date had been extended three times.
6Mining tax collections increased from 2 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2002 to 15 percent in
2007.
7The Medium-Term Expenditure Framework (MTEF) has not been effectively integrated into the PFM
system despite exposure to effective models of MTEF use, such as from Australia and New Zealand.
8   This included a grant from the Australian government of $4 million.
9Mongolia can be considered a best practice example of Bank and International Monetary Fund
cooperation, which contributed to the quality of the legislative framework adopted by the government.
10The Bank financed international experts to work side by side with Mongolian officials in developing
the approaches embodied in legislation.
11   The off-budget spending of the Ministry of Economic Development is equivalent to 10 percent of GDP.
12Among the highest priorities for capacity building in the Ministry of Economic Development is the
need to implement the provision in the budget law requiring calculation and funding of maintenance
costs of investment projects that are being undertaken. This is not yet being done. Inadequate
maintenance of infrastructure is a major problem in Mongolia.
13These funds draw on the Chilean Sovereign Wealth Fund model, which relies on three funds integrated
into fiscal policy through a rule that limits deficits and governs contributions and withdrawals from the
funds.

14In the first phase, the initial purchase of books for rural schools was centralized. However this was not
intended to be replicated in a later stage. In a second phase, the project contributed to the development of
an open and transparent system for selecting books based on the distribution of vouchers so that school
committees became responsible for the choice of titles when augmenting their stock of classroom library
books. The children’s book catalog allows publishers based in Ulaanbaatar to reach schools in rural areas
and enable these schools to order books using their limited resources. All titles supported in the project
were also included in the international children’s digital library (ICDL) and are available on compact disc
online.
15 The project made learning materials available in rural Mongolia by establishing 3,560 classroom
libraries in all 383 rural primary schools. Each school received over 160 books, benefiting a total of 130,000
students. Training was provided for 4,144 rural primary teachers and 383 school directors. Ninety percent
of beneficiary schools reported not having had books prior to the project interventions.
16 TheICDL includes all 237 Mongolian language children’s book s. The 383 schools participating in the
project were also given compact discs containing all of the books.
17 Alocal professional development network has been set up consisting of 95 core schools and 178 mentor
teachers.
   number of schools have also received computers under an extension of the Rural Education and
18 A

Development project.
19After spending time in the library, students are encouraged to retell the stories they read to teachers,
classmates, and parents. To make this easier, they create “small books” of their own. Gradually, students
have become authors, also telling the stories of their lives.”
20 “Big books” are written by teachers and students together in class. These are based on the stories found
in the library books and are left open-ended with a big question mark on the last page to engage students.
21The book bags effort enables students to take books home and share stories with their families. After
they finish reading one bag of books, they return it to school to exchange it for another bag.
22The bagh is the smallest administrative unit with usually three or four per soum. A small bagh
headquarters building is located on the grazing lands in the center of a large area comprising a few
herders’ family. There seems to be widespread recognition of the importance of influencing the decisions
taken at the meetings, with consequent high levels of attendance by herders.
23The project has enabled the Meteorological Institute to begin testing an improved model for the
prediction of pastureland conditions based on weather forecasts and livestock herd size, down to the
bagh (community) level. The expected outcome is an increase to six months of the current three-month
advance notice for upcoming pasture conditions. This provides local authorities with the time to stock up
on adequate winter feed and fodder levels to enable the herds to survive even the most severe winters.

Appendix E. Guide to the Independent Evaluation
Group’s Country Program Evaluation
Methodology
This methodological note describes the key elements of the Independent Evaluation
Group’s (IEG) country program evaluation (CPE) methodology.1

CPEs rate the outcomes of World Bank Group assistance programs, not the country’s
overall development progress.

A Bank Group assistance program needs to be assessed on how well it met its particular
objectives, which are typically a subset of the country’s development objectives. If a
Bank Group assistance program is large in relation to the country’s total development
effort, the program outcome will be similar to the country’s overall development
progress. However, most Bank Group assistance programs provide only a fraction of
the total resources devoted to a country’s development by development partners,
stakeholders, and the government itself. In CPEs, IEG rates only the outcome of the
Bank Group’s program, not the country’s overall development outcome, although the
latter is clearly relevant for judging the program’s outcome.

The experience gained in CPEs confirms that Bank Group program outcomes
sometimes diverge significantly from the country’s overall development progress. CPEs
have identified Bank Group assistance programs that had:

      Satisfactory outcomes matched by good country development;
      Unsatisfactory outcomes in countries that achieved good overall development
       results, notwithstanding a weak Bank Group program; and,
      Satisfactory outcomes in countries that did not achieve satisfactory overall results
       during the period of program implementation.

Assessments of assistance program outcome and Bank Group performance are not the
same.

By the same token, an unsatisfactory Bank Group assistance program outcome does not
always mean that Bank Group performance was also unsatisfactory, and vice-versa. This
becomes clearer once we consider that the Bank Group’s contribution to the outcome of
its assistance program is only part of the story. The assistance program’s outcome is
determined by the joint impact of four agents: (a) the country; (b) the Bank Group; (c)
partners and other stakeholders; and (d) exogenous forces (e.g., events of nature,


                                                                                       125

international economic shocks, etc.). Under the right circumstances, a negative
contribution from any one agent might overwhelm the positive contributions from the
other three, and lead to an unsatisfactory outcome.

IEG measures Bank Group performance primarily on the basis of contributory actions
the Bank Group directly controlled. Judgments regarding Bank Group performance
typically consider the relevance and implementation of the strategy; the design and
supervision of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support interventions; the scope,
quality, and follow-up of diagnostic work and other analytic and advisory activities
(AAA); the consistency of the Bank Group’s lending and financial support with its
nonlending work and with its safeguard policies; and the Bank Group’s partnership
activities.

Rating Assistance Program Outcome
In rating the outcome (expected development impact) of an assistance program, IEG
gauges the extent to which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved,
without any shortcomings. In other words, did the Bank Group do the right thing, and
did it do it right? Programs typically express their goals in terms of higher-order
objectives, such as poverty reduction. The country assistance strategy (CAS) may also
establish intermediate goals, such as improved targeting of social services or promotion
of integrated rural development, and specify how they are expected to contribute
toward achieving the higher-order objective. IEG’s task is then to validate whether the
intermediate objectives were the right ones and whether they produced satisfactory net
benefits, and whether the results chain specified in the CAS was valid. Where causal
linkages were not fully specified in the CAS, it is the evaluator’s task to reconstruct this
causal chain from the available evidence, and assess relevance, efficacy, and outcome
with reference to the intermediate and higher-order objectives.

For each of the main objectives, the CPE evaluates the relevance of the objective, the
relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the objective, including the
balance between lending and nonlending instruments, the efficacy with which the
strategy was implemented, and the results achieved. This is done in two steps. The first
is a top-down review of whether the Bank Group’s program achieved a particular Bank
Group objective or planned outcome and had a substantive impact on the country’s
development. The second step is a bottom-up review of the Bank Group’s products and
services (lending, analytical and advisory services, and aid coordination) used to
achieve the objective. Together these two steps test the consistency of findings from the
products and services and the development impact dimensions. Subsequently, an
assessment is made of the relative contribution to the results achieved by the Bank
Group, other development partners, the government, and exogenous factors.

         GUIDE TO THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION GROUP’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Evaluators also assess the degree of country ownership of international development
priorities, such as the Millennium Development Goals, and Bank Group corporate
advocacy priorities, such as safeguards. Ideally, any differences on dealing with these
issues would be identified and resolved by the CAS, enabling the evaluator to focus on
whether the trade-offs adopted were appropriate. However, in other instances, the
strategy may be found to have glossed over certain conflicts, or avoided addressing key
country development constraints. In either case, the consequences could include a
diminution of program relevance, a loss of country ownership, or unwelcome side
effects such as safeguard violations, all of which must be taken into account in judging
program outcome.

Ratings Scale
IEG utilizes six rating categories for outcomes, ranging from highly satisfactory to
highly unsatisfactory:

Highly satisfactory:     The assistance program achieved at least acceptable
                         progress toward all major relevant objectives, and had
                         best practice development impact on one or more of
                         them. No major shortcomings were identified.

Satisfactory:            The assistance program achieved acceptable progress
                         toward all major relevant objectives. No best practice
                         achievements or major shortcomings were identified.

Moderately               The assistance program achieved acceptable progress
satisfactory:            toward most of its major relevant objectives. No major
                         shortcomings were identified.

Moderately               The assistance program did not make acceptable
unsatisfactory:          progress toward most of its major relevant objectives, or
                         made acceptable progress on all of them, but either (a)
                         did not take into adequate account a key development
                         constraint or (b) produced a major shortcoming, such as
                         a safeguard violation.

Unsatisfactory:          The assistance program did not make acceptable
                         progress toward most of its major relevant objectives,
                         and either (a) did not take into adequate account a key
                         development constraint or (b) produced a major
                         shortcoming, such as a safeguard violation.



                                                                                        127
APPENDIX E
GUIDE TO THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION GROUP’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
Highly unsatisfactory:       The assistance program did not make acceptable
                             progress toward any of its major relevant objectives and
                             did not take into adequate account a key development
                             constraint, while also producing at least one major
                             shortcoming, such as a safeguard violation.

The institutional development impact (IDI) can be rated at the project level as: high,
substantial, modest, or negligible. IDI measures the extent to which the program
bolstered the country’s ability to make more efficient, equitable, and sustainable use of
its human, financial, and natural resources. Examples of areas included in judging the
institutional development impact of the program are the:

         soundness of economic management;
         structure of the public sector, and, in particular, the civil service;
         institutional soundness of the financial sector;
         soundness of legal, regulatory, and judicial systems;
         extent of monitoring and evaluation systems;
         effectiveness of aid coordination;
         degree of financial accountability;
         extent of building capacity in nongovernmental organizations; and,
         level of social and environmental capital.

IEG is, however, increasingly factoring IDI impact ratings into program outcome
ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Sustainability can be rated at the project level as highly likely, likely, unlikely, highly
unlikely, or if available, information is insufficient, nonevaluable. Sustainability
measures the resilience to risk of the development benefits of the country program over
time, taking into account eight factors:

         technical resilience;
         financial resilience (including policies on cost recovery);
         economic resilience;
         social support (including conditions subject to safeguard policies);
         environmental resilience;
         ownership by governments and other key stakeholders;
         institutional support (including a supportive legal/regulatory framework, and
          organizational and management effectiveness); and, resilience to exogenous
          effects, such as international economic shocks or changes in the political and
          security environments.

          GUIDE TO THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION GROUP’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY
At the program level, IEG is increasingly factoring sustainability into program outcome
ratings, rather than rating them separately.

Risk to Development Outcome. According to the 2006 harmonized guidelines,
sustainability has been replaced with a “risk to development outcome,” defined as the
risk, at the time of evaluation, that development outcomes (or expected outcomes) of a
project or program will not be maintained (or realized). The risk to development
outcome can be rated at the project level as high, significant, moderate, negligible to
low, or nonevaluable.


 Box E.1. Understanding the Ratings of World Bank Group Program Over 2005-10
 What does the standard IEG CPE methodology rate?
 The rating of the outcome of the Bank assistance program in Tunisia gauges the extent to
 which major strategic objectives were relevant and achieved.
 IEG considered the relevance and implementation of the strategy; the design and supervision
 of the World Bank Group’s lending and financial support; the scope, quality, and follow-up
 of diagnostic work and other analytic and advisory activities; the consistency of World Bank
 Group lending and financial support with its AAA work; and the World Bank Group’s
 partnership activities.
 For each of the main objectives (set-out from strategic documents), the CPE evaluates the
 relevance of the objective, the relevance of the Bank Group’s strategy toward meeting the
 objective, including the balance between lending and nonlending instruments, the efficacy
 with which the strategy was implemented and the results achieved. In short, the report
 reviews whether the Bank Group did the right thing and did it right.
 This evidence-based analysis and the relative contribution to the results achieved by the
 World Bank Group is provided for each pillar in chapters 3 to 6. The analysis draws on (i)
 desk review based in particular on CASPR, CASCR, ICR, ICRR, ISR and Aide memoire and
 (ii) field interviews.
 What does the standard IEG CPE methodology not rate?
 The evaluation rates neither the client’s overall development progress based on its strategic
 plans nor does it rate World Bank Group performance per se. CPEs rate the outcome of
 World Bank Group assistance programs that depend on the joint impact of the Bank Group
 with the country, partners, and other stakeholders, and exogenous factors.
 Can the standard IEG CPE methodology account for World Bank Group programs that are
 modest in terms of size (as in many middle-income countries)?
 Most World Bank Group programs provide only a fraction of the total resources devoted to a
 client’s overall development by development partners, stakeholders, and the government
 itself.
 Bank objectives need to be commensurate to the size of the program. This should be well
 taken into account at the time the country team define targeted objectives in the CAS/CPS.



                                                                                                 129
APPENDIX E
GUIDE TO THE INDEPENDENT EVALUATION GROUP’S COUNTRY PROGRAM EVALUATION METHODOLOGY

    How does the standard IEG CPE methodology account for a difficult external authorizing
    environment?
    IEG takes into account the difficult environment in as much as the country team was keen to
    analyze it and take it into account in setting or revising its objectives and targeted outcome.
    Indeed, it is good practice for Bank Group programs to conduct political economy analysis in
    particular in difficult environments with instability and political resistance to reforms. This
    analysis on top of macro and sector analytical work would help the country team to set
    initially and/or review in the course of the strategy, relevant and credible objectives that take
    into account the difficult environment. If the country team fails to do so and honestly reports
    on the difficulties encountered, IEG will take into account the failure to do so in its overall
    rating.
    How does the standard IEG CPE methodology differ from the “sum of the parts” approach?
    There are no inconsistencies in finding discrepancies between CPE assessment and the
    average ratings of former IEG project or strategy reviews. Indeed, the CPE methodology does
    not derive the overall rating of the Bank Group outcome program as the sum of individual
    ratings of the Bank and the quality of the overall analytical program. First, the methodology
    gauges the relevance of the projects to realize the objectives set out at the strategic level.
    Hence, good projects ratings alone are not enough.
    Second, ratings based on CASCR reviews and ICRRs are desk reviews conducted at project
    closure or at the end of strategy periods. By contrast, the CPE assessment is based on the
    achievement of outcomes based on new evidence (updated quantitative data and qualitative
    information) gathered during field missions several years after project or strategy closure.
    Hence, the CPE ratings can better capture the “sustainability” dimension of World Bank
    Group interventions.
