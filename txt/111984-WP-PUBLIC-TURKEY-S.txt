Turkey, a member of IFC since 1956, is IFC’s
second-largest client. IFC’s work in Turkey is
part of the joint World Bank/IFC CPS. From 2008
to 2011, IFC invested US$3.7 billion in 47 projects
in Turkey, including US$2 billion from IFC’s own
account. In the same period, IFC mobilized about
US$1.7 billion. In 2010, IFC established its Istanbul
office as the first IFC Operations Center. Today it
is IFC’s largest office outside of Washington, DC,
with 200 staff serving 52 countries in the Europe,
Middle East, and North Africa region. As of
February 28, 2015, IFC’s committed portfolio in
Turkey was US$3.6 billion, which includes US$2.67
billion in long-term finance own account and            Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency
US$0.94 billion in B loans. IFC’s investments in        (MIGA)
Turkey have exceeded the expected program that
was agreed for the FY12–15 CPS period.

Background and Objectives:
Small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) play a very important role in the Turkish economy, owing to their considerable
share in the total number of enterprises and in total employment. SMEs in Turkey represent 99 percent of all enterprises, 78
percent of employment, and 50 percent of investments and are estimated to have accounted for up to 53.3 percent of value
added in 2012. A strong SME sector in Turkey would thus positively contribute to key issues such as unemployment,
productivity, competitiveness, and sustainable growth. Turkish SMEs are growing slower than both large enterprises in
Turkey and SMEs in comparator countries. Access to longer-term investment finance is perceived as one of the most severe
obstacles to growth by medium-sized firms. In 2009, in the aftermath of the global crisis, SMEs’ share in total credit declined
by about 5 percentage points to a little over 20 percent, but it has since recovered in line with economic growth in the recent
years. SMEs’ share in total credit was around 27 percent as of December 2014.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to broaden and deepen the access of Turkish SMEs to medium- and long-
term finance, with a view to ultimately contributing to an expansion of productive activities and job creation. The project
will also serve to provide credit in currently underserved regions, ensuring that these areas are not left behind and that the
credit and productivity gap between less and more advanced regions does not widen. The project finances three credit lines
to three participating borrowers for on-lending to SMEs: (i) a US$100 million wholesale credit line to Kalkınma Bank to be
intermediated through private retail banks/leasing companies to SMEs; (ii) a US$200 million credit line to be intermediated
through Ziraat Bank as a retail bank directly to SMEs; and (iii) a US$200 million credit line to be intermediated through
Vakıf Bank as a retail bank directly to SMEs.
The SME II project is complemented by the Export Finance Intermediation Loan series, which has been providing medium-
to long-term funds to exporting enterprises. The SME II project was restructured in 2014 to improve implementation
performance and to provide better access to firms in the priority regions.
Results achieved:
     Under the project, access to medium-term finance has been provided to 696 firms.
     Geographical coverage extends to most parts of Turkey, with an emphasis on underserved areas such as the
        eastern and central regions.
     Funds made available to SMEs through the credit line helped them run their operations smoothly without
        significant difficulties and strengthen their long-term business opportunities. 8,000 jobs were estimated to have
        been created by the utilization of these loans.

Background and Objectives:
SMEs play an important role in the Turkish economy yet face significant access to finance issues and are the first
casualties of financing pressures. Islamic finance and factoring can provide attractive alternatives to mainstream bank
loans to SMEs, including by alleviating constraints related to the lack of collateral and credit history. Nevertheless, Islamic
finance is still a small contributor relative to mainstream banks and can benefit from access to longer-term financing.
Similarly, factoring accounts for a small portion of the financial system, holding potential not only for SME support but
also for the Government’s efforts to triple export volumes by 2023.

The Turkish Government has been taking significant steps to increase the role of such frontier finance, in many instances
with the support of the World Bank. The World Bank has also been working through various channels to support SMEs
and export-oriented enterprises, with Türkiye Sinai Kalkınma Bankası (TSKB) as a key player and valuable partner in
these efforts. Finally, the Bank has also begun initiatives to specifically support Islamic finance, recently launching the
World Bank Global Islamic Finance Development Center (GIFDC) in Istanbul with the Government’s support

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access to longer-term Islamic finance and factoring for
SMEs and export-oriented enterprises. A single component will provide US$250 million equivalent to be intermediated
by TSKB through participating banks and factoring companies targeting SMEs and export-oriented enterprises.

The project is complemented by the Export Finance Intermediation Loan and the Small and Medium Enterprises project
series, which have been providing medium- to long-term funds to exporting enterprises and SMEs.
Results achieved:
 This is the first time ever that the World Bank has used Investment Project Finance to support Islamic finance and
     factoring in Turkey and worldwide.
 Four participating financial institutions have been signed up (three factoring companies and one participating
     bank), with two more participating banks expected to be added soon.
Implementing Agencies: Türkiye Sinai Kalkınma Bankası (TSKB).

Background and Objectives:
SMEs continue to face significant access to finance issues despite their important role in the Turkish economy. SMEs are
estimated to account for 99 percent of all enterprises, 78 percent of employment, 55 percent of value added, 65 percent of
sales, 50 percent of investments, and 59 percent of exports. The last Investment Climate Assessment—“From Crisis to
Private Sector Led Growth” (May 2010)—found strong indications that SMEs face disproportionately severe access to
finance constraints. Lack of cash flow–based financing and high collateral requirements further constrain access to finance
for SMEs. Overall, they receive only 27 percent of total loans, and they are growing more slowly than both large enterprises
in Turkey and SMEs in comparator countries. Their share in total credit declined in the aftermath of the global crisis by
about 5 percentage points to a little over 20 percent in 2009 but recovered to 23 percent by mid-2012 as the economy
rebounded. The sharp decline demonstrates how SMEs are among the first and most affected casualties of a financing
crunch.
At the same time, leasing remains underdeveloped, despite its potential as a key alternative funding source for the corporate
sector and SMEs in particular. The largest users of leasing are SMEs, which allows them access to income-producing assets
without a significant base for collateral and can play a critical role in their inclusion in the formal financial system. Following
continuous volume growth between 2002 and 2006 of around 50 percent, the sector contracted substantially as a result of
the global financial crisis in 2008–09, before starting to recover again in 2010. This contraction reflected lower demand for
investment finance (with the banking sector shifting to working capital) but also the industry’s focus on SMEs that were hit
the hardest. The average transaction size grew substantially, highlighting the shift away from SMEs. In November 2012,
the Parliament enacted a new Leasing, Factoring, and Financing Companies Law (supported by the World Bank
Competitiveness and Savings Development Policy Operation) that is expected to spur growth in the sector, primarily
through the introduction of new leasing instruments.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve access to medium- and long-term finance for SMEs through
lease financing. The project will also serve to provide credit to currently underserved regions. The project finances a credit
line to Ziraat Bank to be intermediated through leasing companies and banks targeting SMEs through lease financing. The
project design incorporates cofinancing and reflow utilization aiming to broaden the impact of International Bank for
Reconstruction and Development (IBRD) financing. Ziraat Bank and/or private finance initiatives (PFIs) will provide at
least 25 percent of the loan amount as additional cofinancing to on-lend to SMEs. In addition, Ziraat Bank will channel at
least US$300 million of the project reflows to PFIs for on-lending to SMEs for the same purpose and under the same terms
and conditions. These two innovative features will help expand the availability of long-term funding to SMEs.
The SME III project is complemented by the Export Finance Intermediation Loan series, which has been providing
medium- to long-term funds to exporting enterprises.
Results achieved:
Three participating financial institutions have been signed up, with two more expected to be added soon.

Background and Objectives:
The World Bank started providing the financial sector with long-term funds to develop medium-term financing for
exporters with the first Export Finance Intermediation Loan (EFIL) project in 1999. The focus on exporting enterprises
ensured their ability to bear the risk of borrowing in foreign currency. Despite improvements in access to finance, medium-
term finance has remained a challenge, constraining the investment and financial planning of enterprises. In addition, as the
Turkish financial sector suffers from a chronic lack of long-term funds, the project helps to lengthen the maturity profile
of the sector.
The fourth EFIL project was prepared as the crisis was looming in Turkey, and the project continues to support the banking
sector in developing medium-term finance for exporters. The original loans to Türkiye Sinai Kalkınma Bankası (TSKB) and
Türk Eximbank were in the amounts of US$300 and US$300 million equivalent, respectively. The project was approved by
the Board in May 2008 and disbursements started in FY09. In April 2011, an additional loan to TSKB in the amount of
US$300 million equivalent was approved to scale up the impact of the project. EFIL IV is the fourth in a series of very
successful credit lines provided to medium-sized exporters in Turkey. Banks expanded into the SME segment in the middle
of the decade, when liquidity conditions improved and macroeconomic conditions stabilized. Two similar projects (SME I
and SME II) support medium-term SME credit.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to address the need for the medium- to long-term financing of investment
and medium-term working capital of exporting enterprises and to deepen financial intermediation. The project has three
components: (i) a US$600 million equivalent credit line to TSKB, whereby TSKB in turn provides medium-term finance to
participating financial intermediaries for further on-lending to eligible private exporters; (ii) a US$296 million equivalent
credit line to Türk Eximbank whereby Türk Eximbank on-lends to eligible exporters; and (iii) US$4 million that supports
capacity building for improved risk management at Türk Eximbank.
Results achieved:
 Exports of target firms grew by 117 percent under EFIL II and by 95 percent under EFIL III (vs. aggregate export
    growth of 81 percent). EFIL III participating firms were more likely to introduce new products, improve
    environmental management, and enter new export markets compared to a control group of nonparticipating firms.
 In EFIL IV, the median participating firm outperformed its sector by 6 percentage points. The project’s impact was
    stronger during the crisis (2008–10), as the export growth of participating firms was 10 percentage points higher than
    that of their relative sector. Even more important, during this period, the median export growth rate of participating
    firms was 50 percent, while Turkish exports contracted by 13 percent. Overall, the performance of participating firms
    would have been even stronger if 2013 had not been a difficult year for Turkish exports. The indicator has been
    significantly reduced from 14 percentage points (based on 2012 exports) to 6 percentage points (based on 2013
    exports), due to a substantial fall of exports in the metal ware sector in 2013.
 Project implementation has come to an end and an Implementation Completion Report is under preparation.

Background and Objectives:
In 2003, the Government of Turkey launched its Health Transformation Program (HTP), a 10-year health reform
initiative designed to bring Turkey’s health indicators in line with other middle-income countries and those in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD). At the time, Turkey’s health financing system
was fragmented, contributing to inefficiency and inequity, and insurance coverage for the poor was scarce. Health care
in rural areas was expensive and difficult to access.
The World Bank has been supporting the Government’s HTP through a two-phased approach. The first phase, through
the Health Transition Project, supported the introduction of the family medicine model and helped build the capacity
of the Ministry of Health (MoH) and the Social Security Institute to expand health insurance coverage and improve
family medicine service delivery.
The second phase, through the ongoing Project in Support of Restructuring the Health Sector, supports reforms aimed
at increasing hospital autonomy, expanding family medicine services, and further strengthening performance
management and pay-for-performance initiatives, as well as supporting activities directed at improving the motivation
and incentives for health workers. Continuing support is currently being discussed, with a focus on maintaining the
success of the HTP and addressing noncommunicable diseases more effectively.

Results achieved:
     In 2003, 24 percent of the population in the poorest income decile
      had health insurance. In 2012, all of the population was covered
      under the Universal Health Insurance (UHI) system.
     Social security systems have been unified and all hospitals
      transferred to the MoH, so people can choose where to be treated.
     The population enrolled with family medicine increased from zero in
      15 pilot provinces in 2003 to the entire population in 2010.
     The utilization of primary care services increased to 2.9 outpatient
      visits per capita in 2013 compared to 2.1 in 2008.
     Patient satisfaction with health care services increased from 66.8

Background and Objectives:
Turkey is part of the Energy Community of South East Europe (ECSEE), established in 2005 with the objective of
creating a stable regulatory and market framework in order to: (i) attract private investment in power generation and
networks to ensure a stable and continuous energy supply, which is essential for economic development and social
stability; (ii) create an integrated energy market allowing for cross-border energy trade and integration with the EU
market; (iii) enhance the security of supply; (iv) improve the environmental situation in relation to energy supply in the
region; and (v) enhance competition at the regional level and exploit economies of scale.

The Bank has been supporting these objectives in a number of ways, including through the March 2004 strategy paper
on the energy trade in South East Europe and the ECSEE Adaptable Program Loan (APL) series, approved in January
27, 2005. The objective of the ECSEE APL program is the development of a functioning regional electricity market in
South East Europe and its integration into the internal electricity market of the European Union (EU), through the
implementation of priority investments. These include: (i) supporting electricity markets and power system operations
in electricity generation, transmission, and distribution; and (ii) providing technical assistance for institutional/systems
development and project preparation and implementation.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) of Turkey ECSEE APL6 is to help improve the capacity and reliability
of the power transmission system in Turkey and its ability to integrate renewable energy capacity into the system. APL6
continues to support the priority investments that APLs 2 and 3 financed earlier in the area of system strengthening and
expansion. The project finances priority investments that create a stable and safe electricity market in Turkey and the
conditions for regional trade. In addition, the project continues the advisory and investment support for internal market
implementation and its integration into the European market.
Results achieved:
A large number of the priority investments under the project have now been successfully completed and are currently
in operation. The completed projects include the day-ahead market and balancing systems, the automatic meter reading
system, five major gas-insulated substations (GIS), two substations, two underground cables interconnecting critical
substations in the system, the development of 3 regional control centers, and the installation of 75 remote telemetry
units. Among the ongoing projects, there are submarine cables that will connect Asia and Europe for the first time via
380 kV transmission lines, SCADA/EMS upgrade, and critical GIS and underground cables in Istanbul. All of these
subprojects represent major efforts to expand the transmission network to serve increasing energy needs in the country
and help improve the reliability of the power supply, to enable the provision of supply to newer urban developments,
and to improve the transmission system as a major endeavor to integrate sustainable renewable energy into the grid.

Background and Objectives:
Turkey is short of domestic energy resources except for lignite and relies for much of its electricity generation on imported
natural gas. In order to reduce Turkey’s dependence on imported fuels and also reduce greenhouse gas emissions, the
Government is encouraging the private sector to utilize the country’s large renewable energy resources. These consist primari ly
of hydropower and wind, but there are also smaller resources of geothermal heat, biomass, and solar. In order to assist the
Government, the World Bank in 2004 financed a Renewable Energy loan, which was implemented by the privately owned
Industrial Development Bank of Turkey (TSKB) and the government-owned Development Bank of Turkey (TKB). The ongoing
project builds on the previous one, covering a wider range of activities. It finances energy-efficiency subprojects and includes
some concessionary financing by the Clean Technology Fund (CTF), supporting renewable technologies and energy efficiency.
The project was restructured in September 2011 to broaden the environmental safeguards coverage to also include an assessment
of the cumulative environmental impact of multiple hydroelectric projects on a river. Additionally, the fund allocation of the
project was adjusted to encourage more focus on advanced renewable energy technologies and energy-efficiency investments.
Following the restructuring, Additional Financing of US$500 million was approved on November 22, 2011.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to help increase privately owned and operated energy production from
indigenous renewable sources, enhance energy efficiency, and thereby help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.
Expected Results:
The project expects to improve Turkey’s supply security by providing domestic energy resources, help reduce greenhouse gas
emissions by building renewable and energy-efficient facilities instead of new fossil fuel-fired plants, and generate a relatively
higher number of jobs in remote and poorer areas, since the areas where hydropower sites are found (most of the new generation
plants are hydropower) tend to be in more remote, mountainous, and poor areas. With the development of capacity in the
financial institutions (FIs), the energy-efficiency projects are now becoming the focus of the project. Overall, the project has
financed 36 renewable energy projects and 27 energy-efficiency projects, the latter of which have focused on paper,
petrochemicals, plastic, and iron and steel. Projects financed so far are estimated to contribute to a greenhouse gas emission
reduction of 4.2 million ton per year.
As of end February 2015, TSKB had committed 83 percent of its total IBRD loans, and TKB had committed 56 percent of its
total IBRD loans. Both institutions have disbursed 100 percent of their original IBRD loans and CTF funds.
Implementing Agencies: TKB and TSKB. Other key agencies include the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources, the
Ministry of Development, and the Undersecretariat of Treasury.
Key Development Partners include the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), the French Development Agency

Background and Objectives:
In Turkey, energy efficiency has emerged as a policy priority due to the relative high energy intensity of the economy and Turkey’s
need to remain competitive. Although total primary energy supply per capita in Turkey is still low—1.44 tons of oil equivalent
(toe) per capita in 2010 compared to the OECD average of 4.39 toe per capita—the Turkish economy is comparatively energy
intensive. In 2010, the economy required 0.19 toe for every US$1,000 of GDP compared to the OECD average of 0.14.
According to World Bank estimates, the industrial and building sectors offer an aggregated energy savings potential of over 15
million toe of energy consumption per year, or 14 percent of total consumption, with corresponding greenhouse gas emission
reduction potential. SMEs play an important role in the development and competitiveness of the Turkish economy, since SMEs
are estimated to account for 99 percent of all enterprises, 78 percent of employment, 55 percent of value added, 65 percent of
sales, 50 percent of investments, and 59 percent of exports, yet receive only 27 percent of total loans. SMEs do not have access
to adequate medium- to long-term financing, which is required for energy-efficiency investments.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the efficiency of energy use in SMEs by scaling up commercial
bank lending for energy-efficiency investments. The project provides IBRD funds through three financial institutions and also
seeks to expand their capacity in assessing energy-efficiency investments and explore alternative financing models tailored to the
Turkish SME market. In addition, The project will seek to enhance the capacity of the Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources
(MENR) to meet its mandate and increase the utilization and effectiveness of its energy-efficiency support programs.
Results achieved:
The project provides three lines of credit for a total amount of US$201 million to three financial institutions (FIs): Halkbank
(US$ 67 million), VakifBank (US$67 million), and Ziraat Bank (US$67 million) to support energy-efficiency financing to SMEs;
a US$3.64 million Global Environment Facility (GEF) grant for technical assistance and risk sharing to the three FIs (Halkbank:
US$0.9 million, VakifBank: US$0.9 million, Ziraat Bank: US$ 0.9 million); and policy and technical assistance support to MENR
(US$0.94 million). The three FISs were chosen given their strong SME client base and market presence in the SME sectors. The
project will also support the General Directorate of Renewable Energy (GDRE), which is mandated with policy implementation
and research on energy efficiency and renewable energy within MENR. The two FIs and MENR have mobilized consultants to
support them in the implementation of the project; one FI is at the finalization stage. The FIs are currently focused on pipeline
development and marketing.
Implementing Agencies: Ziraat Bank, VakifBank, Halkbank, and Ministry of Energy and Natural Resources. Other key
agencies include the Ministry of Development, and the Undersecretariat of the Treasury. Key Development Partners include
UNDP, AFD, and KfW, which are providing technical assistance related to energy efficiency.

Background and Objectives:
The Turkish Government’s main energy policy concern continues to be securing sufficient and reliable energy for a growing
economy in an environmentally sustainable manner. Future demand growth could lead to supply shortages if generation
investments fall behind load growth. To offset its heavy reliance on imported energy, Turkey is increasing domestic energy
production, including through indigenous renewable energy generation from wind and hydro resources. The Government
of Turkey has set an ambitious target of developing 20,000 MW of wind energy capacity by 2023. However, at the present
rate, only about 400–500 MW of wind energy is likely to be added each year, as against the roughly 1,600–1700 MW needed
to achieve this goal. To enhance the rate of addition of wind energy, the key barriers that inhibit faster development of wind
energy in Turkey need to be addressed. These barriers include: (i) the need for upfront transmission investments, (ii) the
limitations of existing load dispatch and control systems, (iii) the limited transmission links relative to the geographical
location of wind energy resources, and (iv) the inadequacy of the existing transmission network to meet the growing demand
for electricity.
The Renewable Energy Integration Project (REIP) assists the Government in meeting its increased power demand by
strengthening the transmission system and facilitating large-scale renewable energy generation. Further, the global
environmental objective of the project is to avoid greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from fossil fuel–based power through
greater integration of renewable energy generation in Turkey. The project has four components: (i) Development of
transmission infrastructure to facilitate faster development of wind power plants, (ii) Smart-grid investments to strengthen
grid operation and management in the face of higher wind energy generation, (iii) Lapseki-2 – Sutluce-2 Submarine Power
Cable to better interconnect wind energy locations with other parts of Turkey, and (iv) Strengthened transmission networks
to cater to the growing demand and supply of electricity in Turkey. The project also envisages technical assistance for
strengthening the environmental aspects of wind energy development (to be funded under a parallel EU-IPA program).
Expected Results:
  Development of transmission infrastructure at Can, Izmir, and Vize will facilitate the installation of 600 MW of wind
   power plants in these areas.
 Turkish Electricity Transmission’s (TEIAS) deployment of smart-grid systems will strengthen grid operation and
   management by upgrading the hardware and software at national and regional control centers. The Renewable Energy
   Resource (RER) operator desk at the National Control Center is functional.
 Transmission networks in Turkey will be strengthened to meet the growing demand and supply of electricity. Peak
   load handled by the transmission system will increase from 38 GW in 2014 to 48 GW in 2019. Lapseki-2 – Sutluce-2
   380kV Submarine Power Cable will provide better interconnection between the European and Asian parts of Turkey,
   including for the wind energy locations.

Background and Objectives:
Turkey remains highly vulnerable to earthquakes. The Marmara earthquake of 1999 claimed over 17,000 lives and left
about US$5 billion in economic consequences, or roughly 2.5 percent of GNP. Istanbul is particularly vulnerable because
of its seismic-prone location on the North Anatolian Fault, high population of approximately 15 million, and
commercial/industrial densities, including being an important intercontinental nexus. If a future seismic event were to
occur in or near Istanbul, the human suffering along with the social, economic, and environmental impacts could be
dramatic; thus, an interruption of Istanbul’s social, economic, cultural, and financial life would be felt for many years to
come.

The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the city of Istanbul’s preparedness for a potential
earthquake through enhancing the institutional and technical capacity for disaster management and emergency response,
strengthening critical public facilities for earthquake resistance, and supporting measures for better enforcement of
building codes.
Key Results Achieved:
  1,053 public buildings were retrofitted or reconstructed,
   including schools that serve over 900,000 students and teachers,
   and hospitals/clinics that serve about 1 million patients annually.
 The back-up Disaster Management Center is operational and the
   Istanbul Governorship’s new main Disaster Management Center
   at Hasdal has been completed.
 Turkey’s first digital inventory of cultural heritage buildings in
   Istanbul facing disaster risk was developed under the project for
   the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, as well as designs for
   strengthening and preserving three historic buildings in Istanbul.
 630,000 people were trained in disaster preparedness and an estimated 5.5 million citizens reached via social and
   public media through the Public Awareness and Neighborhood Community Volunteer programs.
 3,630 engineers nationwide were trained in the seismic retrofitting code, and the e-services concept was introduced
   to citizens through the pilot municipalities of Pendik and Bagcilar.

Background and Objectives:
With limited domestic natural gas reserves, Turkey imports 98 percent of its gas. Natural gas consumption has grown rapidly
in Turkey, mainly as a means of reducing growth in the usage of the environmentally unsustainable domestic lignite. With
increasing urbanization (increased electricity and heating use) and the extension of the transmission and distribution
networks, the demand for natural gas is expected to continue to grow. Turkey obtains its gas supplies through imports,
primarily from Russia through two pipelines: one through Bulgaria and the second under the Black Sea. Turkey consumed
48 billion cubic meters (bcm) of natural gas and liquid natural gas in 2014. Turkey’s geographical location makes it a potential
major gas transit country, connecting the Caspian and Middle East to Europe. In addition to the growing in-country demand
for gas, this role for Turkey as a transit country is likely to drive the development of the natural gas market in the future.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to increase the reliability and stability of the gas supply in Turkey by
putting into place a critically needed gas storage and network infrastructure and supporting the Petroleum Pipeline
Corporation (BOTAŞ) in strengthening its operations as a financially stable and commercially managed corporation. Current
gas storage capacity in Turkey is low (2.6 bcm, about 5 percent of Turkey’s annual gas consumption) and slow (primarily
seasonal storage with only a low daily withdrawal rate). The project will substantially increase storage capacity (to 3.6 bcm,
still low at about 7.5 percent9) and introduce to Turkey its first fast storage facility (with high daily withdrawal capacity). The
storage project is of critical importance, as it would help Turkey ensure gas supply at peak winter times, avoid the penalties
that may stem from take or pay contracts, and develop new transit capacities.
The project has the following components: (i) a gas storage facility in an underground salt dome formation close to Tuz
Gölü, a salt lake in South Central Turkey; the facility, upon completion, would have a storage capacity of about 960 million
cubic meters (mcm), with the capacity to deliver 40 mcm of gas per day for up to 20 days, which can be refilled at the rate
of 30 mcm per day over a period of 25 days; (ii) network expansion—the project finances the Erzincan compressor station
for BOTAŞ, which is required to help transmit the increasing volumes of gas expected to be imported from existing and
new sources; and (iii) technical advisory support for the owner’s engineer, as well as environmental and social monitoring.
Expected Results:
      
      Improve Turkey’s energy security and its ability to cover natural gas demand peaks during the coldest days, lower
      the cost of gas imports by providing seasonal storage, lower network investment costs, and improve operational
      flexibility.
    Increase storage capacity from 2.6 to 3.6 bcm and introduce the first fast storage in Turkey (storage with high daily
      withdrawal capacity).
Implementing Agencies: Petroleum Pipeline Corporation (BOTAŞ).




          9   Other large European gas-importing countries have storage capacities accounting for 20–30 percent of their annual consumption.

Background and Objectives:
With Turkey’s Ninth Development Plan, the Government has laid the ground for a country with stable growth, increased
competitiveness, and an advanced transformation to an information society, while completing harmonization with the EU.
The Government aims to put into practice e-government systems to improve services, protect the environment, and
increase emergency preparedness and disaster risk mitigation with emphasis on the provision of high-quality public services
and continued investment in climate reforms. An effective and efficient cadastre and registration system forms a
cornerstone of the Government’s strategy in these areas by providing accurate and dependable base maps, spatial data, and
property information for planners and investors. Despite the effectiveness of the Turkish cadastre and registration system
and the fact that the registration of property transactions is most efficient in large offices, the system needs to be
continuously upgraded and modernized to provide services at the level of other European countries. Scaling up existing
manual systems to computerized and digitized ones would improve accuracy, consistency, and efficiency and support
linkage to a national network, thereby supporting e-government applications. Similarly, property valuation methodologies
for taxation require an upgrade to equivalent systems in the EU, and institutional arrangements should support the
framework for property valuation guidelines and grievances procedures. Broader property valuation functions should be
developed in line with international standards.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of land registry and cadastre
services in support of the Government’s progress in the e-government agenda. The project supports: (i) renovation and
updating of cadastre maps to enable an efficient digital cadastre and land registry information; (ii) increased access to the
land registry and cadastre information by public and private entities; (iii) improvements in customer services in land registry
and cadastre offices; (iv) improvement in the human resource capacities in the Cadastre and Registration Agency (TKGM);
and (v) development of policies and capacity building to introduce best international practices in property valuation.
Key Results Achieved:
       From past poor ratings, customer satisfaction rates have reached 89 percent; disputes in courts have been
        reduced to 0.3 percent (end-of-project target is 2 percent); time to deliver cadastral data has been reduced to two
        hours (end-of-project target is two hours); 550 external users now have online/offline access to registry and
        cadastre data (against the end-of-project target of 50 external users); and 120 million information requests have
        been received over the Internet against an end-of-project target of 9 million.
    The core project activity that focused on cadastral renovation is progressing successfully and will likely reach the
        end-of-project target of 3.1 million land parcels. A second key activity—base mapping, including orthophotos—
        has exceeded the end-of-project target of 238,560 square kilometers (km2). The original target was 40,000 km2.
    Implementation of the Bursa model office improved customer satisfaction significantly. Disbursements had
        reached 91 percent of the revised loan amount as of March 2015.
Implementing Agency: Turkish Land Registration and Cadastre Agency (TKGM). Food and Agriculture Organization
(FAO) is a key development partner in this project.

Background and Objectives:
Over recent decades, Turkey has witnessed dramatic urban growth, rising from 25 percent of the country’s population
in 1950 to over 75 percent today. Rapid urbanization has also fueled economic growth in cities, which today account for
as much as 90 percent of the country’s gross value added. The importance of cities to the nation’s economy, coupled
with the rapid rate of urbanization, underscores the critical importance of and growing demand for efficient municipal
services that include water, sanitation, and solid waste management. High levels of investment at the local level are
required to keep pace with demand and ensure the delivery of quality services at international standards.
The Project Development Objective (PDO) of the Municipal Services Project (MSP) is to support sustainable
municipal services in selected municipalities. To expand outreach to a wide range of municipalities and support the
institution building of Turkey’s primary source of municipal financing—Iller Bank (Bank of Provinces)—the MSP lends
to Iller Bank as a financial intermediary, which on-lends to eligible municipalities. The MSP supports the: (i) development
of municipal infrastructure to improve water, wastewater, and solid waste management services; (ii) strengthening of the
financial position and operational efficiency of municipal utilities; and (iii) institutional strengthening of Iller Bank.
Key Results Achieved:
  The percentage of non-revenue water (NRW) was significantly reduced in targeted cities. In Asat (Antalya), losses
   were reduced from 52 to 43 percent by the end of 2013; in Kutahya from 69 to 35.5 percent in 2013; and in
   Elbistan from 65 to 32 percent by the end of 2012.
 More than 870,000 households in eight cities around the country have been connected to municipal water supply
   systems for the first time. Sewerage services have also expanded dramatically in some cities. For example, in Ilica,
   the percentage of the city population connected to the sewer network increased from 40 percent in 2006 to 90
   percent by the end of 2012, and in Antalya from 43 percent to 78 percent by the end of 2013, through investments
   carried out under the project.
 The solid waste landfills in Gelibolu and Bergama were established with a total capacity of 54,000 tons and
   provide environmentally sound waste disposal for up to 130,000 citizens.
 The capacity of Iller Bank and municipal staff has been enhanced through training and customized capacity-
   building activities in the areas of project management, procurement, and financial management. The number of
   man-days of training provided to the project management staff of Iller Bank increased from 231 to 1,560 by the
   end of 2012. The increase in training provided for Municipal Project Management Unit staff is also significant,
   having risen from 86 to 630 man-days by the end of 2012.
Implementing Agency: Iller Bank as the borrower and 15 municipalities or utility companies as subborrowers.

Background and Objectives:

On June 27, 2013, MIGA issued guarantees of US$65.5 million covering non-shareholder loans by ING Bank, a branch
of ING-DiBa AG (ING) of Germany, to the Metropolitan Municipality of Izmir (MMI) for the Izmir Marine
Transportation Project in Turkey. The coverage is for a period of up to 10 years against the risk of non-honoring of
sovereign financial obligations. The ING loan will finance up to six ferries in support of the project.

The current ferries in service in Izmir have reached the end of their operating lives and therefore have high maintenance
costs and outdated technology. This project is part of a larger effort to acquire ferries and renovate wharves in Izmir.
The World Bank’s International Finance Corporation (IFC) acted as the loan arranger for this project. Other lenders
include the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) and Agence Française de Développement
(AFD).

The project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Turkey. Improving transportation
infrastructure is a key component of the Bank Group’s focus on helping Turkey improve its competitiveness and
employment opportunities.

MIGA’s support for this investment is also aligned with the Agency’s strategy of supporting complex projects.
Expected Results:
Increase the share of sea transportation in Izmir’s integrated public transportation system, easing road traffic
congestion and pollution and enhancing public safety and security. The new ferries will be significantly faster, more
fuel efficient, environmentally friendlier, and safer.

Background and Objectives:

On December 27, 2010, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$19.5 million to cover an investment by WestLB of Germany
in the Otogar-Bağcılar-Ikitelli-Olimpic Village Metro Project in Turkey. MIGA’s guarantee is for a period of up to three
years against the risk of non-honoring of sovereign financial obligations. It covers a guarantee by the Metropolitan
Municipality of Istanbul (MMI) on a loan amount of up to US$21 million that WestLB AG’s branch office in Istanbul
(WestLB Istanbul) has extended to Istanbul Electricity, Tram and Tunnel, a general directorate of MMI, which is
financing the expansion of the project in Istanbul.

The project consists of two parts. The first section of the project, “Otogar -Kirazlı LRT,” will extend the existing Light
Rail Transit from the Otogar (intercity bus terminal) to densely developed residential areas in Bağcılar and Kirazlı. The
second phase of the project, “Kirazlı -Ikitelli-Başak Konut/Olimpic Village Metro,” will create a new metro line that will
connect the Ikitelli Organized Industrial Area and the new residential areas developed at Ikitelli to the rail network of
Istanbul.

Section one, Otogar-Kirazlı LRT, which consists of a double-track system of 5,510 meters to serve five stations, is the
western extension of the existing LRT track operating between Aksaray and the International Airport. Section two,
Kirazlı-Ikitelli-Başak. Konut/Olimpic Village Metro, which consists of a double track system of 15,834 meters to serve
11 stations, will be the western extension of the metro track planned to operate between Yenikapı and Kirazlı.

The project is also aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Turkey. Improving
transportation infrastructure is a key component of the Bank Group’s focus on helping Turkey i mprove its
competitiveness and employment opportunities.
Expected Results:
       Improved urban mobility and reduced travel times and traffic, thereby contributing to urban productivity and
        private sector–led growth.
       Expanded public transportation in the city, which will reduce the dependence on roads and motorways, help
        reduce the growth of transport-related greenhouse gases, and, through the reduction in pollution, help make
        Istanbul a more attractive business location.

The project, which is located approximately 40 kilometers to the southwest of Ankara, consists of the construction and
operation of a combined cycle power plant, comprising two gas turbines and one steam turbine and delivering a total
net capacity of 763 megawatts (MW). The World Bank has been working with the Government of Turkey on its energy
sector reform, and MIGA’s participation in this project supports this effort, reflecting the project’s anticipated significant
positive developmental impact. Based on conservative economic growth scenarios, Turkey will need at least 2,000 MW
of additional installed capacity per year to meet increased demand.

Expected Results:
The project will help meet the increased demand and allow Turkey to both rely less on imported electricity and focus
more on natural gas as a fuel source (as part of its national energy strategy).

Guarantee holder: Meridiam Eastern Europe SarL
Investor country: Luxembourg
Host country: Turkey
Sector: Services
Gross exposure: US$157.5 million
Project type: Non-SIP


Background and Objectives:
On December 18, 2014, MIGA issued a guarantee of US$157.5 million covering an investment by Meridiam Eastern
Europe SarL of France in ADN PPP Sağlık Yatırım A.Ş. in Turkey. The coverage is for a period of up to 20 years against
the risks of transfer restriction, expropriation, and breach of contract.
The project consists of the design, construction, financing, and maintenance of a new integrated health campus in the
southern Turkish city of Adana, structured as a public-private partnership (PPP). The project will fill a substantial need
in Adana and the surrounding areas for an updated and consolidated public health care facility. The current facilities are
inadequate and difficult to repair or renovate. Existing service units, such as operating rooms, intensive care units, and
emergency rooms, are substandard in terms of physical structure and equipment. Hospitals in the area also have some
of the highest levels of overcrowding in Europe, with only 290 beds per 100,000 people.
MIGA’s support for this project is aligned with the World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Turkey. Under
the strategic objective of improved equity and public services, the World Bank Group plans to support the Government’s
Health Transformation Program as outlined in the Ministry of Health’s Strategic Plan. This includes a PPP program
aimed at providing affordable health care services beyond major urban areas. The World Bank Group’s IFC is also
supporting the project by providing financing of €35 million to ADN PPP Sağlık Yatırım A.Ş.
Expected Results:
The project is expected to contribute to improved health care facilities in Adana, thereby serving as an evidence-based
model for other sectors, where PPP models are under consideration as an alternative to improve social infrastructure.

                      TURKEY: FLIPPING THE SWITCH: POWER TO GROW
                                    Updated in March 2015

The energy sector remains one of the most important
sectors for the Turkish economy. Energy generation,
energy security, energy efficiency, and climate change
mitigation are just some of the many facets influencing
this dynamic sector, as Turkish officials work to meet
the country’s increasing energy demands.
Rapid economic growth, industrialization, and steady
population growth in Turkey over the past decade have
combined to rapidly transform this sector. Although
this past decade has helped increase electricity
generation in the country by 80 percent, including a 90
percent increase in renewable energy generation, an
average annual increase in demand of about 7 percent
since 1990 means further efforts to ensure additional
sources of clean and reliable electricity are required.

As the sector expands, policy makers are working toward the complementary goals of increasing energy
production and security while mitigating the potential impacts of climate change. Faced with this challenge of
providing more energy that is affordable, reliable, and clean, Turkey is looking to further engage the private
sector to help meet this challenge. Officials in Turkey have implemented a series of measures designed to spur
investment and innovation in the energy sector, including an ongoing liberalization program that ended
electricity subsidies, improved the regulatory environment, and paved the way for the privatization of state-
owned electricity distribution and generation assets.
IFC is supporting private sector investments in power generation in Turkey, where only 37 percent of the
generation capacity is privately owned. During the past five years, IFC significantly increased its financing of
renewable energy projects, including US$2.3 billion invested and mobilized for five power generation projects.
IFC’s investments in the power sector have reached nearly 8 million customers.
IFC has also supported several climate change–related projects through its financing in both the financial and
real sectors, investing about US$700 million in 17 energy-efficiency projects, of which more than half was
channeled through commercial banks for on-lending to energy-efficiency projects, including Yapı Kredi
Leasing, Is Bank, TSKB, Akbank, and Sekerbank In the real sector, IFC financed projects with a focus on
energy efficiency, including in cardboard, textiles, agribusiness, and film packaging.
Recently, IFC provided a syndicated loan of US$170 million to ACWA Power, an independent Saudi Arabian
developer of power projects and a long-term IFC client, for the construction of a new natural gas–fired power
plant near the city of Kırıkkale, 50 kilometers east of Turkey’s capital, Ankara. With a capacity of 950 megawatts,
the US$1 billion power plant will help meet Turkey’s growing demand for reliable, sustainable energy.
Such projects not only help to bolster energy production and mitigate the impacts of climate change, but also
to promote further investments by the private sector. Crucially, they represent strong examples of cooperation
among the international financial and development institutions and foreign investors who are contributing to
Turkey’s efforts to fundamentally transform its energy sector and work to provide clean, reliable, and affordable
energy for all.

                TURKEY: ADDRESSING THE CHALLENGES OF URBANIZATION
                                 Updated in March 2015
Improving the quality of city life is and will continue
to be one of the most important global
development challenges. Building sustainable cities
that offer clean air and water, relatively green
buildings, and accessible transportation takes great
planning and effort. Since cities are limited in
resources, they must engage the private sector to
meet the considerable infrastructure and service
provision needs.
Turkey has experienced very rapid urbanization
over the past six decades. The urban share of
Turkey’s population has risen from 25 percent in
1950 to nearly 75 percent today. Over this period,
the pressures of urbanization have grown,
particularly in secondary cities with massive
infrastructure and investment needs.

Over the next 10 years, Turkey will build or refurbish some 13 million housing units, the motorization rate is
expected to increase nearly 40 percent, and the country will need about US$40 billion worth of investment in
water treatment alone. This rapid urbanization creates a challenge for sustainable city development yet offers
an opportunity for the World Bank Group to help.
The World Bank Group’s Country Partnership Strategy for Turkey envisions direct engagement to support
municipal development and investments in essential public infrastructure. Given the high costs of rapid
urbanization, including traffic congestion and deteriorating environmental and social standards, helping to build
sustainable cities is a major priority for cooperation between World Bank institutions in Turkey.
A solid example of this cooperation is found in the work that IFC has been leading in İzmir, the main port on
the Aegean coast and one of the most vibrant cities in Turkey, with nearly 4 million inhabitants. During 2012–
14, IFC helped the Metropolitan Municipality of Izmir implement important projects to boost the city’s
development as a sustainable, environmentally friendly, and modern city, including improvement of wastewater
management, modernization of the traffic management system, and expansion of public transport and the
emergency response system.
IFC’s investment in İzmir’s Çiğli Wastewater Treatment Plant, which serves 80 percent of the city’s population,
is helping expand the city’s water treatment capacity by 35 percent. Another recent project supported by IFC
helps the city finance a traffic management system and purchase new emergency vehicles, promoting economic
growth by increasing urban mobility and enhancing public safety and security.

                           TURKEY: CAPITAL MARKETS DEVELOPMENT
                                     Updated in March 2015

Supporting the development of strong, deep capital markets is
a cornerstone of the World Bank’s strategy in emerging
markets and a priority for IFC regionally and globally, as well
as in Turkey. We help issue local currency bonds and work with
policy makers, regulators, and market participants to
implement frameworks that encourage capital markets
development and greater market diversity, promoting
investment and boosting competitiveness. In addition,
improving access to medium- to long-term financing,
particularly for SMEs and exporters, continues to be a major
development objective in Turkey.

Despite significant financial market deepening over the past decade, Turkey’s banking assets amounted to just
111 percent of GDP by the end of 2013, a relatively low total for a country of Turkey’s income level. Moreover,
despite the relatively large number and variety of non-bank financial institutions, the market share of the
banking sector, already relatively high, has increased. The limited availability of long-term finance is a critical
obstacle to private sector growth.
Supporting the deepening and diversification of Turkey’s capital markets is a core element of the World Bank
Group strategy. IFC and IBRD have been working together to develop the corporate bond market, with IFC
focusing on improving financial inclusion, enhancing long-term finance through capital markets, and
introducing diversified and innovative financing solutions.
In the past three years, IFC has invested US$1.4 billion in Turkey’s financial sector. IFC’s financing addressed
financial inclusion by enabling banks to focus on women-owned companies, support MSMEs, and expand in
poorer areas and underserved sectors such as the agribusiness sector.
IFC has used new securitization structures to increase the depth and competitiveness of the Turkish banking
sector. After the asset-backed security legislation enacted in 2009, IFC helped its client Şekerbank issue a
covered bond, the first such bond issued in Turkey. In 2013, based on best international practices, IFC again
helped Sekerbank as well as Denizbank to issue covered bonds, with the proceeds to be used to fund SMEs
and agribusiness.
In 2010, IFC introduced an innovative product through Akbank, helping to revive the Diversified Payment
Rights (DPR) securitization market, which had been dormant since the start of the financial crisis in 2008. Since
then, IFC has used the same financing structure to provide a total of US$295 million to leading Turkish banks
for on-lending to agribusiness, small farmers, MSMEs, and sustainable energy projects.
More recently, IFC participated as an anchor investor in Şişecam and Mersin International Port bond issues.
The port of Mersin on Turkey’s southern coast is the largest in the country and a key gateway for Turkish trade
with the Middle East. It is positioned as the main gateway to central and eastern Turkey’s foreign trade, which
is an important contributor to Turkey’s economic growth. IFC’s involvement in the first ever infrastructure
bond in Mersin will support the Mersin port’s investment plans and help to diversify its financial resources and
capital expansion. This landmark investment is expected to set an example in opening up infrastructure in
diversified funding resources and encourage other infrastructure companies to diversify their sources of
funding.

                    TURKEY: IMPROVED HEALTH CARE SERVICES FOR ALL
                                  Updated in March 2015
Health care spending, which represents about 10 percent of
global GDP, is rising faster than any other expense, due to
increasing demand for treatment, changing demographics
and epidemiological trends, and advances in medical
technology. Struggling to meet these challenges, governments
worldwide are turning to public-private partnerships (PPPs)
to provide health care services and infrastructure for their
citizens.
For the past dozen years, Turkey has been reforming its
health care financing, delivery, organization, and
management. The country’s Health Transformation Program
has significantly improved access, financial protection, and
service coverage, and the World Bank Group has been
working to support Turkey’s health care transformation.

IFC recently served as an anchor investor in a nationwide PPP program implemented by the Turkish Ministry
of Health to provide improved public health care services. IFC and the Multilateral Investment Guarantee
Agency (MIGA) are supporting the development of a €433 million integrated health campus in Adana in
southern Turkey.
The 1,550-bed Adana campus will include six hospitals with different specializations, such as oncology and
women and children’s health services. In addition to increased bed capacity, it will improve the coverage and
quality of the regional health care network, including improved bed allocation across medical specialties.
“Expanding access to high quality health care services for all population groups is a central element of IFC’s
strategy,” says Guy Ellena, IFC Director for Global Corporate Coverage. “This project is an excellent example
of how the private and public sector can work together to make a difference. We hope that this will set a positive
example for PPPs in other sectors in Turkey and also serve as a model across the wider region.”
In addition to the PPP program, IFC is supporting health care companies that are looking for growth potential
in the region as well as specialized providers of diagnostic and health care services with the potential to reach
poor and middle-income groups. In 2012, IFC made a US$15 million loan and US$15 million equity investment
in MNT, a leading oncology services provider in Turkey.

                                  Updated in March 2015
Although women-owned businesses represent 40 percent of small
and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in Turkey, only 15 percent
have access to finance, representing a credit gap of US$4 billion.
They also have 23 percent less access to technology than men-
owned firms. All this limits women’s entrepreneurial potential and
prospects for contributing to economic growth.
IFC believes that empowering more women entrepreneurs to
participate in business will unleash significant growth potential and
further develop the Turkish private sector. IFC is expanding its
efforts to support women through increased investments
combined with advisory services in the financial and real sectors.

IFC launched its Banking on Women program in Europe and Central Asia in 2011 to support lending to women
through financial intermediaries. To date, IFC has investments in Romania, Turkey, and the Russian Federation.
In Turkey, IFC completed three loans—to Abank, Fibabank, and Şekerbank—totaling US$60 million and
reaching hundreds of women-owned SMEs.
As part of its expanded support for women entrepreneurs, IFC is working with Boyner Grup, Turkey’s largest
non-food retail operator, to strengthen women-led businesses in the firm’s supply chain. The pilot program,
launched in November 2014, aims to train 40 female owners and managers of smaller businesses that supply
Boyner, from in and around İstanbul, İzmir, Samsun, and Eskişehir.
“Through our gender-inclusive practices, we aim to set an example for companies and corporations in Turkey
and promote gender equity in the country,” said Umit Boyner, former vice president of finance, now a member
of the Boyner Grup board. “Investing in men and women equally is not just the right thing to do. It’s also a
smart business decision—placing women and men throughout our operations allows us to tap into a much
wider and more diverse pool of resources.”
