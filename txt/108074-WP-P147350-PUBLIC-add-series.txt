      Box 4.1: Institutions and individuals in water sector improvements
      In many developing countries, the prevailing lack of checks and balances (as would be provided by strong formal
      institutions), means that governments do not always make credible commitments in those polities (Keefer, 2004).20
      However, the basis for credibility may emerge from personalized deals, often coupled with third party enforcement
      mechanisms. Such personalization alone may have limited impact on reform if the leaders disregard the institutional
      constraints and incentives, as well as alliances that make change happen. But it also highlights the importance of
      attention to informal institutions in political economy research on developing countries (see Levy, 2014: 153).21
      Seminal analyses in political economy demonstrate the importance of institutions in structuring politics and relations
      between actors (North, 1990; Steinmo et al., 1992). Development practitioners have incorporated institutionalist
      perspectives into their policies and engagement inasmuch as they typically emphasize the development of formal
      rules, norms and practices, and these structural dimensions can be shaped, to some extent, by specific donor
      interventions. Indeed, there is a reluctance on the part of development partners to focus on individuals and
      personalities, not least because these factors lack generalizability and, more importantly, replicability.
      In the case of successful reforms in the urban water sector, the role of individual utility leaders, although not
      discounted altogether, is seen as unique. The common responses to NWSC’s William Muhairwe and eThekwini’s
      Neil MacLeod exemplify this tendency: Those averse to focusing on personalities note that ‘of course if we had
      5 Williams and 5 Neils we could reform 10 water utilities–but we don’t–we can’t simply create these people and
      insert them. That’s why we need to focus on institutional and structural factors.’
      The successful reform cases of utilities in Ouagadougou, Nyeri, Dakar, Kampala, and Durban suggest that both
      institutions and personalities are important. It has been the personalities that have actually driven institutional reform
      to improve service delivery and prioritize the poor–but to become sustainable, institutional systems had to be
      transformed so that they would work differently even after the reformer has set in motion and consolidated change.
      Those policy makers, development agencies or others who want to promote turnaround, need to be skilled at
      identifying and backing the right type of people, but also need to understand that they need support in their respective
      political economy environments–none of which would ever be exactly the same and replicable elsewhere.

  In general, our analysis is consistent with this view that institutions that are stronger, more inclusive, and more effective in terms of governance, produce better outcomes. This
relationship does not appear in all contexts, however; Uganda is a notable outlier. There, good governance institutions are lacking, but the government can make credible commitments.

          Box 4.2: Role of national and local political support in reforms
          Given the high degree of centralization that characterized African polities in the 1990s and the persistence
          of patron-clientelism, the scope for proactive, reform-oriented leaders, whether in politics or at the utilities,
          ordinarily would be circumscribed.
          Uganda’s utility circumvented this constraint because, in the case of water, at least, the president himself was
          the reformist leader. Among our cases, Uganda offers the clearest case of water sector reform fitting within the
          president’s political objectives at the time: he imbued the Managing Director, William Muhairwe, with a level
          of authority that may have even exceeded that of the water minister. The signs are that his successor, Silver
          Mugisha, has similarly paid considerable attention to working with the president and senior political leadership
          in developing new directions and focus points for the NWSC. Though comparative evidence is more limited,
          we can infer that Burkina Faso’s then-president, the strongman Blaise Compaore, similarly gave his political
          blessing to ONEA, and that the utility leadership has worked hard at making sure that this has been developed
          and grown.
          Kenya followed a different course in the 1990s, as opposition to the tactics of President Daniel Arap Moi caused
          growing alienation of the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) from the Kikuyu people, many of whom
          were embracing the nascent opposition in Central Province and Nyeri, its heartland. Thus, Nyeri’s water sector
          politics were largely divorced from national level politics. Senegal and South Africa, for their part, had more
          democratic, decentralized processes, thus utility reform in those countries would bear less of a presidential
          imprimatur than Uganda.
          The eThekwini case mirrors Nyeri in that the role of national political leaders was less visible and less germane
          to understanding the case. The national and local political transformation in 1994 undoing the apartheid system
          established a broad mandate for reform, with a focus on extending services to the poor.

Providing Water to Poor People in African Cities Effectively: Lessons from Utility Reforms | The Political Economy of Improving Water Service for the Urban Poor




   Box 4.3: Applicability of the findings in fragile environments

   One may question if these findings are applicable in in fragile and conflict-affected states. The experience of
   the Hargeisa Water Agency (HWA) illustrate there relevance in such cities. The HWA provides water for over
   500,000 people in or around Hargeisa, the capital of Somaliland. Currently, 76 percent of poor households have
   access to an improved water supply, and about 55 percent have access to piped water for 22 hours per day.
   Another 13 percent of the poor obtains water from private vendors. On management effectiveness measures,
   the HWA is covering operating costs from revenues, maintaining collections efficiency at 92 percent, and with
   nonrevenue water at 33 percent.

   How has Hargeisa put itself in a position to improve water services, while many others utilities in fragile states are
   financially unsustainable without government support? The answers may be in the political economy dynamics
   of the respective systems. In conflict-afflicted, poor governance environments, failure of government institutions
   is the norm, such as in Kinshasa, Democratize Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the utility, REGIDESO,
   focused on new investments and awarding construction contracts, rather than instilling management autonomy
   and sustained building of institutional systems.41

   In contrast, Hargeisa’s surprising improvement (albeit from a low base) demands explanation. It seems possible
   that, with Somaliland having asserted a form of independence from the rest of Somalia (albeit contested) and
   external assistance being limited, there was no source of surplus in the water sector on which to prey. Equally,
   the local initiative that drove the creation of Somaliland and the HWA may evidence a polity that is relatively
   cohesive and focused on improving things for the community.

   In this environment, the politics appear to have been relatively favorable to the creation of a service-oriented
   utility with autonomous management. The things that Hargeisa credits for its success–good customer relations,
   transparency, accountability to stakeholders, and a focus on fair resolution of conflicts–are exactly in line with
   the governance and political economy approaches in the case studies.

   The HWA faces challenges of limited water resources and damaged infrastructure. Somaliland is a semi-arid
   country with low surface water potential, and the country suffers from persistent drought. The civil war that
   broke out in 1988 destroyed water infrastructure, as state institutions collapsed. When, after the war, some
   development partners provided investments in infrastructure, an emphasis and institutional strengthening
   helped put in place the organizational structure, policies, and procedures required for the HWA to better manage
   its finances, procurement, and human resources.

   With some external support, HWA’s management has improved its performance in key areas: water
   connections almost doubled from 11,900 (2006) to 21,000 (2014); Collection efficiency was 92 percent or
   higher in 2012 to 2014. Access to piped water by the poor is still only 55 percent, but reliably available 22
   hours per day, on average.

   The HWA still has a long way to go to achieve its vision for clean, affordable, and safe water for every resident
   of Hargeisa city, but illustrates that, despite a challenging starting point–with the right external support aimed at
   building core systems and capable management–services can be improved and new approaches introduced.

     4.3	 Key points
     Though reform is often sparked by a catalytic event such
     as a water supply crisis, and driven by utility and political
     leadership, the key reforms ultimately cannot be driven by
     outsiders. Development partners could, however, provide
     initial finance for the turnaround, but their longer term
     impact is highest when they carefully direct financial and
     technical support towards bolstering reform and enhancing
     core systems. Especially in fragile environments, the latter is
     often an essential aspect of sustainable impact.

     A combination of internal competence and motivation,
     external alliances, and institution-building can shape the
     institutional changes required to put service providers on
     track. There are no golden rules or magic bullets–context
     is the key determinant, demanding that external support
     and local reform is problem-focused and adaptive. The
     very notion of ‘best practices’ seems out of place in such
     processes–what is needed from local role-players and
     development partners is creative, adaptive engagements to
     allow reform progress at a pace that locals are comfortable
     with, and that ultimately transcends the individual leaders,
     but getting embedded in locally grown institutions.

     While the search for context-independent best practices
     seems out of place, the good news is that alignment of
     political economy in support of good water services can
     occur in a wide range of circumstances, including in:
       •	 Countries with low incomes. Burkina Faso’s gross

    Box 6.1: The role of private providers in Greater Maputo
    Maputo is not one of the case study cities. However, it illustrates how small scale providers can serve the poor
    in a situation where the utility is struggling. It complements the description of how ONEA worked with small
    scale providers in Ouagadougou.


    The metropolitan area of Maputo has between 1.7 million to 2 million inhabitants. The vast majority of households
    get their water from a yard tap or house connection. Maputo’s 500 or so water operators provide piped water
    services to about 191,000 households. This is more than the 185,000 households served by Águas da Região
    de Maputo (the main utility). The private providers range in size, with at least one serving 12,000 connections.
    The tariffs charged by private providers are higher than those charged by the main utility, averaging 35 Metical
    per m3, compared to the main utility’s charge of 14 Metical for the first social tariff block, 19 Metical for the
    next, and 25 Metical thereafter.

    Private water providers developed because of the lack of service and poor reliability of the public provider.
    Private households drilled boreholes for themselves, some then helped their neighbors and translated this
    into a larger business serving more people. Private operators now provide competing networks even in areas
    where a public network already exists. In some areas the survey found that private providers were more reliable,
    provided a service for longer hours compared with the public provider. More recently, the public provider has
    experienced difficulties with the adequacy of its water supply and has reduced its hours of supply due to
    maintenance problems. The survey also found that private providers offer more flexible terms for payment. For
    these reasons, many customers prefer using a private provider rather than a public provider even when there
    is a choice and notwithstanding the higher tariff. Private providers are 100 percent self-financed. Private water
    providers are practical in Maputo due to the readily available groundwater found in wide-ranging and shallow
    aquifers. This is a safe source of water in many, but not all, areas. Risks involve saline intrusion as the water
    table is lowered through over-extraction and contamination of the source with nitrates and pathogens from
    human waste as a result of inadequate or poorly maintained sanitation and wastewater infrastructure.

    The government has taken the initiative to both recognize and regulate private operators. In areas where
    groundwater quality is a problem, special regulations will apply, and the public provider will sell bulk piped
    water from the public network to the private water providers in these areas. All private providers will need to be
    licensed in terms of a Decree made by the Minister’s Council in October 2015, yet to be published, and licenses
    will address issues of mandate (area of service), water quality, and price. It is anticipated that this system, in
    the process of being established, will reduce conflicts between the public and private providers. Licenses will
    be issued by the local municipalities or district government and the system will be overseen by the national
    water regulator, CRA. A key challenge will be to establish capacity at the local and district government to issue
    licenses, and for this reason CRA will provide training and guidance.

          Box 6.2: Pro-Poor Units: Drivers for serving the poor?
          African water utilities with limited piped works, and with a mandate or requirement to recover their costs, are
          often perceived to predominantly serve businesses and the wealthier residents. In an effort to reorient water
          and sanitation utilities to meet the needs of poor people in large urban settlements, development agencies have
          encouraged utilities to set up dedicated Pro-Poor Units within their utility structures.60


          Dedicated Pro-Poor Units are motivated on the grounds that service delivery to the poor in Africa’s large
          cities requires a special approach due to the challenges presented by unclear land tenure, unplanned layout,
          overcrowding, and a lack of accurate data. It is also argued that Pro-Poor Units are necessary to counter a
          perceived lack of political will on the part of utility owners and/or managers to serve the poor. In Nairobi, the
          utility also intends using the informal settlements unit to house “one-stop” facilities that would make it easier
          for the residents of these settlements to interface with the utility on all service related issues.

          Examples of Pro-Poor Units have been in Kampala (National Water and Sewerage Corporation), the Nairobi City
          Water and Sewerage Company (Kenya), Dar es Salaam Water and Sewerage Authority (Tanzania), and Lusaka
          Water and Sewerage Corporation (Zambia), among others.

          The National Water and Sewerage Corporation Pro-Poor Unit supports branches in the city of Kampala with
          informal settlements and works with headquarters and development partners to implement capital works
          programs targeting the urban poor. The Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company’s Pro-Poor Unit was
          created mainly as a liaison unit based at headquarters. However, the utility found that branch office staff
          were reluctant to serve the poor and the unit has now been established as a seventh ‘region’ to give it greater
          status with respect to investment and operations. The Lusaka Water and Sewerage Company coordinates the
          implementation and operations of services in peri-urban and informal settlements. Dar es Salaam Water and
          Sewerage Authority implements and supervises the community-managed water and sanitation schemes; and
          is also responsible for DAWASA public relations and implementing the resettlement action plan.

          This study has shown that some utilities have achieved very extensive access by poor households to piped
          water and that this is achieved through building an extensive network within reach of most households. This
          requires the pro-poor strategy to be embedded within the overall strategy of the utility. The risk with Pro-Poor
          Units is that their activities may become isolated and marginalized from the rest of the utility.

          Nevertheless, these units can play an important role in catalyzing change, especially as a transitional mechanism
          in a utility reform process. In the National Water and Sewerage Corporation, for example, the setting up of a
          Pro-Poor Unit was one of a number of strategies used to kick-start a new initiative to improve access to water
          by poor people.61 In eThekwini, a dedicated unit was set up to initiate the expansion of piped water services
          into rural areas. After five years the activities of the unit were fully incorporated (“mainstreamed”) into the
          normal business of the utility.

                                 water at all, relying on water vendors and wells. Supply from the utility was limited to 16 hours per day, with
                                 low pressures and contamination of the piped supply in some areas.

    Catalyst for                 Impending crisis catalyzed reform. Inadequate water supplies threatened a city with population growth

                                 falling as much as 1.5 meters per year in some areas. Saline intrusion threatened to ruin the aquifer. Shallow
                                 wells, relied on by poor people and others, were being contaminated with seepage from latrines.1

                                 The only sustainable solution was construction of a new system to bring water from the Senegal River,
                                 about 250 km away. This system was expected to take eight to 10 years to complete. In the meantime,
                                 additional boreholes, expansion of a treatment plant, and leakage reduction works were urgently needed to
                                 prevent further deterioration. This was expected to cost US$162.5 million (in 1995).2

    Actors driving               The government turned to the World Bank for assistance. World Bank staff believed that private operation
    the reforms                  of the system was needed to make the utility efficient and made finance conditional on this.3 The President
                                 of Senegal at that time, Abdou Diouf, was in a relatively secure position. His party had been in power since
                                 1960. Potential opponents were being included in government to build ownership of the reform across the
                                 political spectrum. It has been argued that this approach was supported by donors because the resulting
                                 political consensus made it easier to enact economic reforms in a number of important areas.4

     Service for the Poor




          Course of action           A comprehensive long-term plan was developed. The first stage of the plan focused on quick increases in
          decided on                 production and extension of service into some poor areas. The second stage involved the much larger Keur
                                     Momar Sarr water treatment plant (in 2005, 65,000 m3/d; upgraded in 2008 to 130,000 m3/d) along with a
                                     continued expansion in the distribution network into poor areas.

                                     The infrastructure expansion plan was anchored on institutional reforms. The water supply service of
                                     the state-owned utility was divided into two companies: the SDE became the company responsible for
                                     operating and maintaining the infrastructure, providing service to customers, and collecting revenue. The
                                     infrastructure assets were transferred to SONES, a new publicly-owned company responsible for planning
                                     and financing new investments. A controlling stake in the SDE was to be transferred to an international
                                     water operator through a competitive tender. Sanitation services were spun out from the water utility into a
                                     new public entity (ONAS), since sanitation needed continued subsidies.

          Technical                  Production capacity was increased by about 30 percent (up 60 MLD) in the first phase through expansion
          solutions                  of an existing treatment works and an emergency program of drilling new boreholes. In the second phase,
          implemented                the 130 MLD Keur Momar Sarr water treatment plant (near the Senegal River) and associated transmission
                                     and treatment works were completed. With more water available the system was able to meet the city’s
                                     demand for water.

                                     Another important technical solution was network rehabilitation and active leakage control. In the first phase
                                     (in which production capacity was still not adequate to meet demand) 100 km of pipe were rehabilitated,
                                     along with 25,000 connections.5

                                     Between 1995 and 2013, the distribution network in the SDE/SONES service area was more than doubled
                                     by adding 4,800 km of pipe.

                                     The number of connections in Dakar was almost doubled, from around 189,000 (2002) to around 368,000. In

Providing Water to Poor People in African Cities Effectively: Lessons from Utility Reforms | Appendix A: Case studies: How Cities Turned Around Water
Service for the Poor




    Commercial                  In 1995, most poor people served by the utility got water from standpipes. Earlier in the 1990s, the standpipes
    solutions                   had been given to small entrepreneurs to operate. This was done to reduce waste of water. The standpipe
    implemented                 operators sold water by filling containers, and paid the utility for the water used as recorded by a meter.

                                Standpipes are still an important method for delivering service to poor people, with 22 percent of poor
                                people in Dakar getting water this way.

                                Senegal’s increasing block tariff structure has a subsidized social tariff (tranche sociale) for levels of
                                consumption below 20 m3 (US$0.40) per bimester.6 There is also a regular tariff for consumption from 21
                                m3 to 40 m3 (US$1.39), and a “dissuasive” tariff for consumption above 40 m3 (US$1.75). The dissuasive
                                tariff is designed to be a disincentive for excessive water use. It can be seen that the tariff for household
                                consumption of less than 20 m3 per 60 days is less than a third of the regular tariff, and less than a quarter
                                of the tariff for consumption in the top block. A family of six consuming 50 liters each per day would pay
                                US$3.62 on average each month. Bills are sent every two months based on meter readings, and the SDE
                                can cut off water supply for nonpayment. The standpipe tariff is US$0.73 per m3–this is between the social
                                and regular tariff for domestic piped connections.

                                A disadvantage of rising block tariffs is that they can discourage utilities from serving poor neighborhoods.
                                This is because the utility will expect most customers to pay only the lowest tariff. If this is lower than
                                the cost of service, the utility will lose money–or have to put up tariffs to other customers. The affermage
                                contract for Dakar gets around this problem by paying the private operator the same tariff for every unit of
                                water sold.

                                A more unusual kind of subsidy was introduced in 2007. The cost recovery model indicated that the average
                                tariff should be increased, so that the operator’s tariff and SONES debt service requirements could be
                                covered. Rather than increase all tariffs equally, the government agreed that the tariffs for government
                                customers should be increased by 70 percent, while the tariffs for other customers remained constant.
                                In 2009, the government tariff was raised again, to allow other tariffs to remain constant. In 2015 this
                                arrangement was reversed, necessitating a 4 percent increase in the tranche sociale and a 9 percent
                                increase in the rates to other users.
    Financing                   Total urban water sector investments from 1996 to 2013 totaled US$770 million.7 About half was financed
    solutions                   by loans from donors. Two major programs implemented were the Senegal Water Project (US$223 million,
    implemented                 1996-2004) and the Long-Term Water Project (US$255 million, 2002– 2009).8 The World Bank was a major
                                financier for both projects, providing US$85 million and US$146 million, respectively. The interest rates on
                                these loans were around 6 percent. Tenors were 20 years (including five-year grace periods).9 The cost of
                                finance was kept down because the investments were the responsibility of the publicly-owned SONES. This
                                meant standard donor rates were applied. (If investment had been the responsibility of the private operator,
                                the cost of the finance would have been higher.) These loans had to be repaid. The private operating
                                company (SDE) was limited by its contract to charging a fixed operator tariff. For the sector to be financially
                                self-sufficient, the average retail tariff paid by customers had to cover the operator tariff, plus an amount to
                                service the debt taken on by SONES.

                                Keeping the tariff at affordable levels was a challenge. Thus it was important to keep the operating cost
                                component of the tariff to the lowest possible level. The decision to bring in a private operator was made in
                                part because analysis suggested that this would result in lower tariffs. The winning bid (from SAUR) was for
                                an operator tariff that was 60 percent of the tariff the public utility had been charging customers.

                               To make money within the agreed operator tariff, the SDE had to maximize cost effectiveness. It maintained
                               a collection rate of 98 percent, reduced NRW from 29 percent to 20 percent, and tripled staff productivity,
                               moving from seven staff per 1,000 connections to just two staff per 1,000 connections. Because of these
                               gains, average operating expenditures in real terms declined slightly over the period. Fairly modest real tariff
                               increases (see Figure A.2) then allowed the sector to generate a substantial operating surplus which could
                               be used to service debt, or to pay for capital expenditure directly.

      Management               The most important management solution was to bring in an international private operator. That operator, in
      solutions                turn, brought in modern management systems and techniques, and skilled managers. The operator trained
      implemented              local staff, so the company is now run almost entirely with national staff, at high levels of efficiency. Profit
                               incentives for owners, in turn, led to performance-oriented management for the staff.
      Institutional and        The management model involved a significant realignment of roles and responsibilities in the sector.
      governance               Operational autonomy was conferred on the privatized operating company, which was controlled through a
      solutions                long-term affermage contract that specified what the operator had to achieve, and controlled what it could
                               charge.


     Reflections and conclusions
      Results of the           By 2014, 75 percent of poor people in Dakar had water piped to their premises, with a further 22 percent
      turnaround               accessing standpipes. Compare this with 20 years previously, when most poor people with piped water
                               got it from public taps and 20 percent of the entire population–most of them poor–had no access to piped
                               water at all.

                               Across the city as a whole, 86 percent of people have water piped to their premises. Water supply is
                               reliable and has been available 24 hours per day at constant pressure across most of the system for most
                               of the period since 2007. That said, water demand is once again running ahead of supply. Some residents
                               complain that water does not reach the higher stories, or is not available in certain areas at certain times.

                               The significant increase in access and service seen in Dakar was achieved without burdening Senegal’s
                               stretched public finances. Finance for investment was available on concessional terms because of the
                               credible institutional model adopted. Debt service on the loans was covered out of the utility’s cash flow
                               because the private operator managed to run the system cost-effectively.

 How a mandate            A comprehensive reform plan was prepared with the assistance of the World Bank. The plan was acceptable
 for the reform           to stakeholders because workers were guaranteed employment under the new arrangements, tariff increases
 was secured              were limited, and public sector managers retained control of the investment program. The lack of other
                          financing options, and World Bank insistence on the reforms as a condition of financing, contributed to
                          the Government’s acceptance of the approach. Acceptance was made easier by the cooption of potential
                          political opponents into the Government at the time.

                          Another factor which may have influenced the reform direction was experience with private management
                          of the utility prior to 1971 by the private operator Generale des Eaux (later renamed Veolia Environment). In
                          addition, SAUR, the private operator that won the tender, had been providing technical assistance to the
                          public utility for some years prior to the reforms.
 Phasing the              The reform in Dakar followed a blueprint laid out at the start. Quick measures to increase water availability
 reforms                  and extend service to poor areas were prioritized. Institutional changes were implemented in parallel. While
                          these measures were taking effect, planning for the big increase in water supply the city needed was already
                          under way.
                          The Dakar turnaround is remarkable for its institutional continuity. It has continued in the same basic form for
                          almost 20 years, surviving a change in administration when opposition leader Wade was elected President
                          in 2000. It also continued through the next change in administration in 2012.
 Sustaining               Supply is once again exceeding demand in Dakar. Major new production sources are being developed, but
 performance              there are concerns they will not come on-stream in time. In 2013, a transmission main that carries water
                          from a source 250 km out of Dakar ruptured. This main, which supplies 40 percent of the city’s water, took
                          three weeks to restore to service. The resulting shortages led to outbreaks of social unrest.

                          Some stakeholders suggest that SONES has not been sufficiently proactive in infrastructure development
                          and major rehabilitation works. Indeed, the government recently gave the SDE responsibility to implement
                          some urgent expansions in supply. The affermage model depends for its sustained success on the continued
                          strong performance from the public sector entity in charge of infrastructure development. If this is lacking,
                          the model will need to evolve toward greater private sector responsibility or risk failing to deliver.

                          Another risk to sustainability in Dakar is the periodic expiration of the affermage contract. While the limited
                          term provides the government with flexibility, it also builds in a discontinuity. Every 10 years–more or less–
                          the system has to figure out whether to rebid the contract, bring operations back into the public sector, or
                          negotiate an extension.

                          Despite these risks, stakeholders in Dakar say that the system is generally working well. Accountability is
                          institutionalized through contracts. Reliance on donor finance for investment promotes good governance
                          and limits predation in SONES. As a private company, the SDE is able to insulate its operations from political
                          predation to a great extent. The fact that the SDE and SONES can each perform the other’s functions to
                          some extent provides tension, but also resilience. The SDE has stepped up where SONES has appeared
                          to lag, but this in turn is likely to encourage the latter to improve its performance so it can earn back the
                          territory.

     A.2	 eThekwini (Durban), South Africa
     When apartheid ended in South Africa, local governments                           autonomy, and develop institutional capability to provide
     strove to undo the racial inequalities which had forced                           effective public services.
     the black majority to live in townships spread around the
     periphery of the more affluent suburbs reserved for white                         Over an 11-year period (2004 to 2015) the number of
     people. These townships had poor urban services compared                          connections increased by over 129,000 (from 369,000 to
     to the traditionally white areas.                                                 498,000), an increase of 35 percent at an annual rate of 2.8
                                                                                       percent. The network length nearly doubled from 6,998 km
     In the Durban area, over 46 separate municipal councils                           in 2000 to 13,900 km in 2015. The 2011 Census showed

     eThekwini. The Durban water department now had the                                improved piped water source, giving a total access of 97
     responsibility to manage and extend services over a much                          percent. About 55 percent of the poorest 40 percent of the

     3.6 million people. The far-reaching and complex political                        poor people have access to a safe piped water source.
     and institutional changes brought about by the transition
     to a universal democratic franchise created the space                             For the 97 percent of households using piped water, water
     for ‘public entrepreneurship’ whereby public managers                             is available 24 hours a day and is safe to drink. The city
     were able to build external alliances (within a broad                             received the highest award (‘blue drop’) by the national water
     and progressive political mandate), establish managerial                          ministry for its management of drinking water quality.

      Service before           Reliable data on the situation before 1995 are not available. White people living in and near the city center
      the reforms              (the original Durban municipality) received on-premise, good quality, 24x7 water. However, black people
                               living in townships received an unreliable service and rural households received no service at all.
      Catalyst for             The democratic transition in South Africa in 1994, from an exclusive race-based franchise to universal
      reform                   franchise, and the subsequent reform of local government to amalgamate previously racially separate local
                               governments, created the catalyst for the reform of Durban water.
      Actors driving           Neil Macleod, head of the Durban water department, an engineer with a Master’s in Business Administration,
      the reforms              took up the challenge of extending a good service equitably across a wider and poorer area at the
                               commencement of the political changes in the early 1990s. He was able to work within a stable and enabling
                               political context created by the Executive Mayor, Obed Mlaba (1996–2011), and later with an effective City
                               Manager, Mike Sutcliffe (2002–2012), to establish and sustain the Water and Sanitation unit as a ‘semi-
                               autonomous’ (from a management perspective) entity within the municipal administration over 20 years.
      Course of action         The extension of the service boundary involved taking on additional preexisting service areas (as well as
      decided on               previously unserved areas), and the incorporation of operations and staff from other municipalities. This
                               required normalization of staff conditions across the operations and the creation of a single corporate
                               culture and identity. At the same time, new investments were required and existing services needed to be
                               rehabilitated.
      Technical                A key challenge was to provide universal but affordable services to all people in the service area. A
      solutions                conventional full-pressure system with individual connections and meters for each household was
      implemented              considered too expensive, given the high needs, and the relatively low densities and low income levels on
                               the urban periphery (where most of the population without a piped water supply lived).

                               eThekwini solved this problem by providing a full-pressure metered connection to a local off-take for a
                               group of houses (typically 15 households) and then reticulating through separate inexpensive and flexible

                            small diameter HDPE pipes at low pressures to a 200 liter ground tank at each house. An electronic bailiff
                            unit was developed that automatically filled each tank overnight. This fulfilled the City’s commitment to
                            provide a free basic service in an affordable way. (Households could opt for a higher level of service but
                            would have to pay for this.). About 5,000 units were installed (see Figure A.3).

                            In time, difficulties were experienced with the management of this system. The population in the peri-urban
                            areas grew more rapidly than anticipated and new houses were constructed over existing pipes. New
                            residents made illegal connections to their neighbors’ pipes.

                            In response, the Water Department innovated again, developing an electronic flow-limiter. Poor households
                            are now offered a full pressure connection. The electronic flow-limiter assists households to keep their
                            consumption within the free basic amount of 300 liters per day by limiting flow to a trickle when this amount
                            is exceeded.

 Commercial                 eThekwini adopted a policy of free basic water in 2000. At first, the free basic amount was calculated on
 solutions                  the basis of 25 liters per person per day, a minimum requirement for health specified by the World Health
 implemented                Organization. A monthly amount was calculated assuming eight persons per household to give 200 liters
                            per day, or 6 m3 per month. This was provided to all consumers, due to the difficulty in identifying only the
                            poor households.

                            Following feedback from consumer forums, the free basic water allowance was increased to 300 liters per
                            household per day in July 2008. Households with restricted water services (ground tanks or flow limiters as
                            described above) had the daily amount delivered to them increased by the utility. For customers on regular
                            metered service, consumption in excess of the free water limit was charged at the standard tariff.

                            Tariffs escalate with increased usage, with the top marginal tariff (for consumption above of 45 m3 per
                            month) set at the long run marginal cost of supply. This is above the average historic cost and is both
                            efficient and surplus generating.

                            In July 2012, eligibility for free basic water was restricted to customers whose property value was less
                            than ZAR250,000 (about US$20,000). Customers with higher value houses (an indicator of wealth) are now
                            required to pay the regular tariff for all water consumption.

          Financing                 Immediately after the democratic elections, the municipality focused its investments on expanding access
          solutions                 to poor households. These initiatives were supported across South African municipalities by the national
          implemented               government through capital and operating grants. Initial grants were project specific and were part of the
                                    national Reconstruction and Development Program. These grants were transformed into sector-based
                                    programmatic grants. The multiple grants were then aggregated into a single capital grant called the Municipal
                                    Infrastructure Grant and a single operating grant, the Equitable Share Grant. In addition to the grant money
                                    from national government, the municipality has raised commercial finance. For example, it established a
                                    EUR50 million facility with the European Investment Bank for infrastructure investment in 2010.

                                    The utility has maintained a positive operating cost recovery ratio (see Figure A.4) by implementing cost-
                                    recovery tariffs, and has consistently achieved a high cash collection rate (averaging over 100 percent over
                                    the last few years as a result of successful arrears debt collection).10 This means that the utility is able to
                                    cover all its operating and maintenance costs from the tariff, and generate free cash flow which is available
                                    to the municipality to service the debt raised to finance new investment.

          Management                eThekwini developed a people-focused and trust-based organizational culture in which staff contributions
          solutions                 were recognized and valued. The eThekwini management has consistently emphasized that it regards
          implemented               people as the most important asset in the organization. The Managing Director (MD) adopted a personal
                                    and engaging management style, being quick to give visible recognition to good staff performance
                                    through awards.

                                    eThekwini established a customer management unit with equal status to other major management units such
                                    as finance and the engineering functions. The MD built trust in the management team and communicated
                                    effectively with staff, frequently visiting staff in the field. He fostered a positive attitude by encouraging people
                                    to propose solutions to the problems they brought to management. Perhaps unusually for a department
                                    within a municipality, he encouraged talking rather than writing, with minimum use of memoranda, minutes,
                                    and lengthy reports. The MD negotiated a performance contract with the City Manager linked to the water
                                    unit’s overall performance. This contract made 25 percent of his remuneration dependent on meeting
                                    performance targets. These performance agreements were applied to the senior management team.

       The water unit produces a set of income statements for water that are then amalgamated with the City’s finances (all services). Separate cash flow and balance sheets are not
     available for water and the separate income statement for water is not published. The income statement contains an accounting entry with an estimate of the opportunity cost of
     revenue forgone by providing free basic water (included as negative revenue). This item has been removed from the income statement, so that the revenue used here is the actual
     amount billed.

     Institutional and            The MD protected management and staff from outside interference in operations while demanding
     governance                   accountability, thereby building staff loyalty and promoting staff retention. The MD’s response to inappropriate
     solutions                    requests was to insist these were put in writing. The MD was thus able to establish and sustain the Water
                                  and Sanitation unit as a ‘semi-autonomous’ (from a management perspective) entity within the municipal
                                  administration.

                                  The unit had a distinctive corporate culture (it had its own separate head-office), ring-fenced finances (it
                                  had a separate income statement), was responsible for meter reading, and had its own financial and human
                                  resources staff involved in the day-to-day management of the business.

                                  The MD was able to ‘showcase’ the effectiveness of the unit, winning political support for the unit’s
                                  investment proposals, annual budgets and on-going management autonomy, creating a virtuous cycle–
                                  management effectiveness wins trust, trust enables autonomy, autonomy enables effective management.
                                  It is this virtuous circle that resulted in eThekwini Water and Sanitation being named the 2014 winner of
                                  the Stockholm Industry Water Award, for its transformative and inclusive approach to providing water and
                                  sanitation services.


Reflections and conclusions
     Results of the               The results of the reforms are clear: 55 percent of the poorest 40 percent of households have water piped
     turnaround                   to the premises. Those poor households that do not have water piped to the premises get safe, reliable
                                  water from standpipes.

                                  Overall, 97 percent of the population have access to piped water, with 80 percent having water piped to the
                                  premises. This water is safe to drink and available 24 hours a day. Affordability was enabled by providing
                                  300 liters per day of free water for poor households.
     How a mandate                The national and local political reforms in 1994 established a broad mandate for reform, with a focus on
     for the reform               extending services to the poor. The 1996 Constitution included a right to water. The constitutional and policy
     was secured                  mandate was given practical effect through the key reform actors at the local level–the executive mayor, the
                                  municipal mayor, and the head of the water and sanitation department. Somewhat unusually, Neil Macleod,
                                  a white male, was retained as the head of water (a position he held for over 20 years).11 Early success and
                                  effectiveness was likely to have been a key factor in convincing the city manager (a new appointee) and the
                                  executive mayor (a politician) of the merits are retaining the existing water manager. Macleod himself said
                                  that he ‘ran faster than the others’. Macleod anticipated the forthcoming political changes and acted early
                                  to reorient the water service towards a pro-poor focus even before the first democratic elections in 1994.
                                  New politicians were eager to be seen to be doing something quickly and it was thus convenient to back a
                                  manager who had already demonstrated he was being effective in line with the new political agenda.
     Phasing the                  The MD was able to ‘showcase’ the effectiveness of the unit in providing services to poor people early on
     reforms                      (even before the formal political changes in 1994), and was thus able to win political support for the unit’s
                                  investment proposals, annual budgets, and on-going management autonomy.

                                  The turnaround began with institutional reforms to incorporate multiple municipal water departments into
                                  a single metropolitan water department within the metropolitan government. The utility moved rapidly
                                  to incorporate the various township utilities into its management structure. It focused on expanding and
                                  improving service, and constantly innovated institutionally.

                                  Some elements of the design were agreed early in the process–such as ring-fencing the utility’s finances
                                  and performance pay for the MD. Others, such as the free water allowance and how it would be paid
                                  for, were developed “on the hoof”, and adapted in response to customer feedback. In many ways, the
                                  institutional structure remained very light–a department within the metropolitan municipality. There is no
                                  independent regulator, no long-term performance contract, and no separate legal corporate entity with a
                                  Board of Directors.

11
     In other cities, senior managers have held their positions for much shorter periods. The City of Tshwane, for example, has had five city managers in 12 years.

          Sustaining               The water department remains within the overall municipal structure and is accountable to the municipal
          performance              manager, the executive mayor, and the elected councilors. The council passes budgets annually and the
                                   department must report on its performance and achievements each year. This is an indirect accountability
                                   model operating at the local municipal level. Durban Water must also meet national minimum standards
                                   regulated by the national finance, local government, and water ministries–indirect accountability operating at
                                   the national level. The water unit holds customer focus groups, undertakes surveys of customer satisfaction
                                   and manages an effective call center that responds to queries and complaints. These more direct feedback
                                   mechanisms complement the indirect accountability processes.

                                   eThekwini developed a strong second tier of managers and the transition to a new manager has been
                                   apparently seamless. The strong performance culture within the organization could play an important role
                                   in sustaining the organization going forward. However, time will tell to what extent the formal structures and
                                   organizational culture are sufficient to sustain performance over time and resist predatory pressures being
                                   experienced in other state institutions in South Africa.12

     Service before              A precise picture of service for poor people in Kampala in 1998 is not possible from the available data.
     the reforms                 For the population as a whole, access to piped water (from private connections and public taps) was 48
                                 percent. Most of those without piped water drew water from boreholes and protected springs. More than
                                 half of those with access to piped water got it from a standpipe or kiosk. Data from 2004 (by which time
                                 improvements had already started) show that only around 22 percent of households had water piped to
                                 the premises.

                                 Among the poor, less than 48 percent would have had access to piped water. Around 44 percent of families
                                 in Kampala lived in slums, where piped water services were very limited.14 Many of these slums were built
                                 on private land, on which the utility was generally not able to offer either individual connections or standpipe
                                 service.15 Moreover, the poor families predominantly lived in the low-lying and swampy valleys between
                                 Kampala’s hills. In these areas, wells, springs, and water bodies provided alternative sources of water which
                                 many poor people relied on for reasons of convenience and cost.16 In fact, when households in Uganda that
                                 were not using safe sources were asked why not, 55 percent cited cost as the main reason, while most of
                                 the rest cited inadequate sources or the long distance to safe sources.17 Unfortunately, much of this water
                                 was contaminated, often as a result of infiltration from latrines.18 Contaminated water sources contributed
                                 to cholera outbreaks from late December 1997 to March 1998.19

          Catalyst for                  The catalyst for reform in Kampala was the relationship between the Museveni administration, international
          reform                        financial institutions (IFIs), and political elites in country. In the 1990s President Museveni and his
                                        National Resistance Movement (NRM) were supported by donors.20 This combination of local leadership
                                        and international support enabled consolidation of service and governance reform after a long spell of
                                        dictatorship and civil war.

                                        In early 1995, President Museveni committed his government to privatizing 85 percent of Uganda’s public
                                        enterprise sector by the end of 1997.21 This commitment helped paved the way for a debt forgiveness deal
                                        worth US$2 billion to Uganda, being developed by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank.22
                                        Yet at the same time, many in the NRM resisted foreign private ownership of important Ugandan companies.
                                        The tension between a desire to please donors by embracing market-oriented economic governance on the
                                        one hand–and the desire for national, social control of key entities on the other–shaped the reform path in
                                        the urban water sector.

                                        Donors recommended private participation in water services to deliver sustainable improvements, noting
                                        that “‘Over the last 10 years, the GOU [Government of Uganda] in partnership with the World Bank and
                                        other donors has made significant investments (over US$100 million) in the urban water and sewerage
                                        sector. These investments have contributed immensely to rehabilitating the existing infrastructure under the
                                        NWSC management. Unfortunately, these investments have not been matched with the necessary efficient
                                        commercial and financial management capacity that can ensure the delivery of sustainable services in
                                        the medium to long-term.’”23 The Government of Uganda agreed to bring in an international company to
                                        operate the NWSC under a management contract. At the same time, utility and political leaders in Uganda
                                        began a search for a Ugandan, public sector solution to the performance problems in the NWSC.


          Course of action              In 1997 the principles were set: commercialized management of the utility, continued donor investment,
          decided on                    and the aim of improving service to everyone. In Kampala a management contract with Gauff, a German
                                        company, was signed in 1998. Yet there was no overall blueprint. The management contract was for just
                                        three years–an interim step. The next stage of institutional development was left open. Regulatory matters
                                        such as setting of tariffs and service standards were left largely to the utility. There was no engineering
                                        masterplan that guided service in the city. Much was left open to be solved as new information and
                                        challenges emerged.
          Actors driving the            At a political and policy level the actors driving the reforms were President Museveni and several donors. In
          reforms                       1998, a powerful new player entered with the appointment of William Muhairwe as MD of the NWSC.

                                        From then on, the strategy in Kampala’s water sector was a product of Muhairwe’s drive and enthusiasm,
                                        backed up by President Museveni’s all-powerful support. While donors initially advanced management
                                        reform, the model that developed after 2004 was a new approach that combined autonomy incentives and
                                        accountability with public sector ownership and a Ugandan management team.

     Technical                    Water production for Kampala nearly doubled from 2002 to 2015, increasing from 34 million m3/year to
     solutions                    63 million m3/year. In 2006, the Gaba III water treatment plant project was completed–this raised water
     implemented                  production for Kampala and nearby areas by 80,000 m3/day.

                                  To extend service throughout the city, the NWSC more than doubled the total length of the network, adding
                                  around 1,300 km of pipe in Kampala between 2004 and 2013. Network extensions allowed the total number
                                  of connections to be more than quadrupled, from around 45,000 in 2002 to over 200,000 in 2015.24 In
                                  planning its network extension, the NWSC used geographic information systems (GIS) to identify poor
                                  communities and ensure service reached them.25

                                  Figure A.5 shows rates of access to piped water in neighborhoods of Kampala for which sufficient data
                                  were available. Those areas surrounded by a red line are where the poorest 40 percent are estimated to
                                  live. The map shows that in many poor areas, access to piped water is greater than 90 percent. However,
                                  in some areas in the Northeast, access to piped water by the poor appears very low.

                                       Standpipes serving water kiosks were chosen as the main way of providing water services to low income
                                       communities. This kept costs low, compared to making individual connections, and also enabled service
                                       to poor people in informal settlements on private land where the NWSC could not offer individual service.
                                       The NWSC has more than tripled the number of standpipes in its service area since 2003, bringing the total
                                       number to around 7,700 in 2013.

                                       Water is available for 18 hours per day on average across the network. Results of water quality tests have
                                       been provided in the publicly available Annual Reports since 2010. As of 2013, in the 23 towns the NWSC
                                       served at the time, at least 97 percent of samples passed E-coli tests. In the same year, 22 of 23 towns
                                       produced water that met the National Standard for turbidity (less than 5 NTU).
          Commercial                   In 2004 the NWSC changed its commercial and services delivery strategies to better align them with the
          solutions                    government’s objective that 100 percent of the urban population should have safe, sustainable, water
          implemented                  services within easy reach.26

                                       Around 7 percent of poor households in Kampala have water piped to their premises.27 To promote such
                                       access, the NWSC has operated an Affordable Connections Policy since 2004. Connection fees were
                                       reduced from US$75 to US$35. Moreover, the NWSC took on responsibility for making a service connection
                                       of up to 50 meters from the utility’s supply point. The NWSC also maintains the service line, up to the meter
                                       on the customer’s premises. By taking responsibility for constructing and maintaining the line, the NWSC
                                       has not only helped customers but also increased the quality of the service lines, reducing nonrevenue
                                       water. The connection subsidy is covered from a 10.7 percent surcharge on most consumption. The tariff
                                       for domestic consumption is around US$0.77/m3.

                                       Standpipes and shared taps are the main source of water for poor people in Kampala, with 71 percent
                                       of poor families relying on them in 2011.28 These shared taps have provided a huge increase in access to
                                       safe water, compared with what prevailed in 1998. Most of these taps serve kiosks operated by someone
                                       who has paid for the connection and then on-sells the water. Some kiosks are municipal, some are run by
                                       community groups, others are private. The NWSC charges $0.47/m3 for water dispensed at standpipes.
                                       This is below the domestic tariff. The subsidy is justified on the basis that standpipes are mostly used by
                                       poor people. However, some of the kiosks charge a significant mark-up for the water. Once the water is
                                       dispensed in 20 liter jerrycans at the kiosk, the effective tariff can be US$1/m3or more.

                                       To make access to shared taps more widespread and more affordable, the NWSC innovated by:

                                       	 Removing the monthly fixed charge for some standpipes in poor areas. This reduced the cost of
                                          water from these taps by about 10 percent. This change was made after the President pledged it during
                                          the 2006 election campaign.
                                       	 Recognizing that some individual yard taps are, in fact, shared water points. The NWSC monitors
                                          consumption of water per connection in low income areas. When consumption is unusually high, staff
                                          from the NWSC’s Pro-Poor Branch visit. If it is clear that the yard tap is serving more than two or three
                                          households, then the tariff for public water points is applied.
                                       	 Using prepaid public water points. These are standpipes which automatically dispense water when a
                                          customer inserts an electronic token. By cutting out the middleman (the kiosk operator) these prepaid
                                          water points ensure that poor customers can access water at the tariff set by the NWSC, avoiding
                                          mark-ups.

                                 loan is being serviced from operating cash flow.

                                 When the reforms started, the NWSC had debts to the government that it could not service. Most of
                                 the indebtedness resulted from loans from IFIs to the Government of Uganda that had been on-lent to
                                 the utility. The government agreed to a moratorium on debt service for a period, which gave the NWSC
                                 financial breathing space. Then, in 2007, the government converted the outstanding balance of US$47
                                 million into equity–effectively forgiving the debt.

                                 Achieving financial self-sufficiency was core to the service improvement strategy from the start. The NWSC’s
                                 ability to earn a surplus over operating costs has enabled expansion of service to poor neighborhoods to
                                 proceed independently of availability of funding from the government budget. As Figure A.6 illustrates, the
                                 NWSC has had an operating surplus of at least 18 percent of operating costs since 2002 (bottom right
                                 panel). Figure A.6 shows a positive continuation of these trends in these developments, and a new drive is
                                 in progress to address NRW with fresh dedication.

     Service for the Poor




                                      To achieve this surplus, the NWSC has driven NRW down from 50 percent in 1998, with its continued efforts
                                      helping getting it to around 32 percent in 2015. Collection efficiency has also improved considerably, from
                                      85 percent in 2001 to over 95 percent since 2010. Labor productivity has skyrocketed from 36 staff per
                                      1,000 connections to just six staff per 1,000 connections now. Until 2002 this improvement was achieved
                                      by reducing staff numbers, which brought the ratio down to 10. Since then, productivity gains have been
                                      achieved by adding connections quickly, while holding increases in staff numbers to a lower rate.

                                      Adequate tariffs have been equally important to the NWSC’s ability to finance expansion of service to the
                                      poor. To protect real revenue from the effects of inflation, the NWSC’s tariff has automatically increased
                                      with inflation since 2004.30

                                      Cross-subsidies are important in the NWSC’s strategy to combine financial stability with affordability. The
                                      average water and sewer tariff of US$1.06 – adequate for cost recovery – is higher than the domestic
                                      tariff of US$0.77, which is in turn is higher than and the standpipe tariff of US$0.47. Overall cost recovery
                                      is achieved by charging large users more than domestic customers. However, to keep large users on the
                                      system–and so contributing to revenue–the tariff rate for commercial consumption above 1,500 m3 per
                                      month is lower than for consumption below that rate (US$0.93/m3 compared with US$1.16/m3).

                                      In 2015, eligibility for subsidized connections was restricted to only poor customers. By charging better off
                                      customers the full cost of a connection, the NWSC hopes to increase the cash available to expand service
                                      to poor customers.31

          Institutional and           A new law in 1995 corporatized the NWSC, giving it a fairly standard set of corporate powers and
          governance                  responsibilities. The corporation is governed by a Board of Directors appointed by the Minister responsible
          solutions                   for water. In 1998 a new Board and a reforming MD, Muhairwe, were appointed. Muhairwe replaced Hillary
                                      Onek (who later became Minister of Internal Affairs) as MD “at a time when the company was almost
                                      collapsing due to poor management, poor services and debt”.32

                                      Shortly before Muhairwe and the Board were appointed, Gauff, an international engineering firm, had
                                      been brought in on a three-year contract to run the NWSC’s Kampala operations (more than 70 percent
                                      of the company). After a gap of a couple of years, another management contract was awarded, this time
                                      to ONDEO.

                                      In parallel with these ‘external’ management contracts, Muhairwe developed a series of internal
                                      management contracts. The first of these were ‘area performance contracts’ which applied to the areas
                                      outside Kampala not managed by the external management contractors. The NWSC managers for these
                                      areas were given performance targets, and bonuses for meeting the targets. Later, a similar concept called
                                      ‘Internally Delegated Management Contracts’ was applied to the management of the NWSC’s Kampala
                                      service area also.

                                      In 2003 a Performance Contract was agreed between the government and NWSC. The Performance
                                      Contract set out targets for the utility, including a requirement to develop plans, and funding for network
                                      expansion. The contract was essentially a corporate strategic plan with quantifiable targets and milestones,
                                      setting out the agreed way forward.33

                                      By 2004 then, the NWSC had forged for itself a distinctive governance structure. Contracts agreed with the
                                      national government set out service and efficiency indicators. The utility was financially and managerially
                                      autonomous. Performance targets and managerial autonomy were transmitted down the organization from
                                      the MD to unit managers using internal management contracts. Incentives for good performance were
                                      provided through worthwhile bonuses.

                                  The appointment of quality technocratic leadership in the senior management of the NWSC was instrumental
                                  in enabling reforms to be sustained and further reforms introduced. It has also helped securing political
                                  autonomy and instituting rigorous performance metrics. After Muhairwe retired, his place was taken by Dr.
                                  Eng. Silver Mugisha, a member of the management team developed during these earlier transformative
                                  reforms. There has also been willingness to try new approaches and renew priorities. In the three years or
                                  so since his appointment, Mugisha has been quite assertive in driving a firmer agenda on the NWSC’s role
                                  in smaller towns than was the case under the previous MD. He has also placed a renewed emphasis on
                                  revenue collection, which–according the utility’s data–has doubled. There has been a renewed emphasis
                                  on NRW reduction activities, and notably a new drive for increased community and other key stakeholder
                                  involvement, customer outreach, and responsiveness. This has included upgrading the call center and
                                  digital (social media) systems.


     Management                   During the period of the external management contracts, substantial progress was made in reviving the
     solutions                    NWSC as an effective service provider. NRW fell from 50 percent in 1998 to 43 percent by 2001 while
     implemented                  connections rose from 51,000 to 66,000. GIS and other IT systems were improved.

                                  In parallel, Muhairwe focused on building a performance culture within the organization. An initial 100-
                                  Days program crash program (February 1999 to May 1999) set demanding short-term targets which the
                                  management team stormed toward, shocking the system out of its lethargy. Other initiatives followed,
                                  including consultative strategic planning to build a shared sense of purpose among all staff.34

                                  In 2006 a Pro-Poor Unit was created to bring a focus on extending service to poor areas. This unit, with
                                  seven multidisciplinary staff, takes up issues in effectively serving the poor with the commercial and
                                  operational branches of the Corporation.35

                                  Under the current MD, Mugisha, the cultivation of a professional staff and an institutional culture of efficiency
                                  and accountability remains firmly on the organization’s agenda. With government support for the NWSC’s
                                  new “Water for All” program, this has meant an improvement in getting government institutions to meet
                                  their own debt obligations to the utility.


Reflections and conclusions
     Results of the               Thanks to the NWSC’s turnaround, 78 percent of poor households in Kampala now have access to piped
     turnaround                   water services. The cost of water has come down for many poor people. Across the network, water is
                                  available on average for 18 hours per day. All operating costs, and much of the capital costs of expansion
                                  to poor customers, are covered by resources generated by the utility itself. This resource generation is
                                  made possible by the NWSC’s cost effective operations, coupled with a tariff that allows for cost recovery
                                  overall.

                                  dilemma of ‘efficiency or local control’ by adapting models designed to bring efficiency through foreign
                                  management control to work with local, public sector control. In this way it appealed to local political
                                  elites while also being acceptable to international donors. The model has delivered sustained success in
                                  expanding access for poor people for over more than 15 years.

      reforms                   staunching financial losses. Competing models of local and international management were tried in parallel.
                                Pragmatic solutions including tariff indexation, financial restructuring, and a performance contract rather
                                than a regulator, were developed. Much attention was given to the management aspects of creating a
                                successful utility, from the original 100-day program to eventual construction of a training center to boost
                                skills systematically. After the utility’s finances and management were stabilized in 2004, attention shifted
                                to improving service to the poor, with creation of a Pro-Poor Unit, and development of commercial and
                                technical solutions to improve access for poor households.

                                The utility also cites the barazas (community meetings) as ensuring it remains accountable while building
                                community constituencies of support. A strong culture, coupled with training and management succession
                                planning, support continued professionalism. The formal mechanism of automatic tariff indexation helps
                                to protect against populist short-termism, preserving the utility’s ability to continue to fund expansion of
                                service to the poor.

     Service before              Reliable data on the situation before 1995 are not available. Those who lived through the period recall that
     the reforms                 infrastructure investment had not kept up with population growth. Water was rationed by limiting supply to
                                 a few hours per day–and this water was not safe to drink. Informal settlements were not served at all.
     Catalyst for                There was no donor conditionality, technical assistance or national government intervention to catalyze
     reform                      reform. Rather, the then local government became convinced that the poor service was not in keeping with
                                 the town’s needs, and that it must be possible to do better.
     Actors driving the          The political impetus for reform came from the visionary and charismatic Mayor, Jackson Wanjage, who
     reforms                     had political support from the municipal council. Technical and managerial input came from a capable and
                                 motivated Municipal Engineer, Nguiguti, who at the time was responsible for water supply because of his
                                 role in running all of the engineering services in the municipality.
     Course of action            In 1995 the town administration united around the objective of providing safe reliable water to all citizens.
     decided on                  Lacking money and utility management expertise, the decision was made to seek external support. The
                                 mayor and municipal engineer successfully lobbied to be included in a German Technical Cooperation
                                 (GTZ) program assisting with water utility commercialization. This helped develop the next stage of the
                                 reform vision–to build an efficient utility, and raise finance to expand production and distribution.
     Technical                   The number one problem was that water production was not adequate to supply the needs of the growing
     solutions                   population. A loan from the KfW was negotiated to finance a new bulk water supply scheme. However,
     implemented                 donor sanctions during the Moi administration meant it could not be disbursed. NYEWASCO’s own
                                 engineering team improvised ways to boost production from the existing infrastructure above design
                                 capacity, increasing supply from 6 MLD to 8 MLD. The team also started to get leakage under control.
                                 More production and less leakage meant that hours of supply could be increased.

                                In 2003 the KfW loan was finally disbursed, allowing NYEWASCO to construct a new 21 MLD capacity
                                plant. The new water source brought an end to water rationing. It also reduced pumping and treatment
                                costs because the new facility was located above the town, near the water source.

                                With the new facility on line, NYEWASCO was able to expand its distribution network, taking advantage
                                of a grace period in loan repayment and increased cash flows arising form a better service. Between 2006
                                and 2015, 752 km of pipe were added to the network, more than quadrupling total network length. This
                                allowed more than 13,000 additional households to be connected. During the same period, the number of
                                public water kiosks was increased from 3 to 16. Networks were extended to all parts of the town, both rich
                                and poor. In informal communities, after the installation of public kiosks, households were offered private
                                connections. Where conventional service pipes could not be laid for technical reasons, meter banks were
                                installed. NYEWASCO then assisted households in making flexible pipe connections from the meter bank
                                to their home.
      Commercial                To assist poor households in connecting, Nyeri has kept the upfront costs of connection low. Until recently,
      solutions                 households had to pay KShs 3,100 (about US$35), of which KShs 2,000 is a deposit. Recognizing that even
      implemented               this amount is a barrier, NYEWASCO recently reduced the deposit by 500 KShs.

                                The tariff is rising block. Consumption up to 10 m3/month is KShs 32/m3 (US$0.36/m3). A poor household of
                                six people consuming 50 liters each per day would have to pay KShs 284 per month (US$3.23).

                                Industrial and commercial customers, and residential customers consuming in the higher blocks, pay cost-
                                reflective tariffs. Businesses such as tourist lodges pay tariffs six times higher than people in slums. These
                                cross-subsidies allow the utility to finance universal service. The average water tariff across all customer
                                classes is KShs 58/m3 (US$0.65/m3). All customers are metered.

                                NYEWASCO uses mobile technology to help poor customers manage their cash flow by paying in small
                                and irregular increments, as water is consumed or as cash is available. Customers can read their meter at
                                any time and use a mobile phone to communicate the reading to the utility billing system. The customer
                                can then pay using MPESA, Kenya’s widely used mobile money system.
      Financing                 When Nyeri embarked on its turnaround strategy, it had no funds to invest in infrastructure. After embarking
      solutions                 on the GTZ-supported commercialization strategy, NYEWASCO was able to secure a loan from the KfW.
      implemented               The loan was facilitated by the Government of Kenya, which borrowed in Euros, and on-lent to NYEWASCO
                                as a KShs 1.1 billion (US$18 million) loan. The other loan terms were an interest rate of 2.5 percent, a tenor
                                of 30 years, and a grace period of eight years. This loan financed the new production facility and some
                                initial network expansion, as well as work on rehabilitation and equipment for leak detection and repair.

                                Apart from the KfW loan, other sources of finance were cash generated from operating activities (all of
                                which went on debt service or was plowed back into the business), and a total of US$0.7 million in grants
                                from Kenya’s Water Services Trust fund which assisted with expanding distribution. Financing sources over
                                time are shown in Figure A.7.


     NYEWASCO could not have secured this loan if it had not                           made possible by continued collection of long over-due

 Management                To drive the efficiency gains that allowed universal service to be financed, NYEWASCO adopted modern
 solutions                 management techniques. All staff are involved in strategic planning. Computerized systems are used. The
 implemented               systems are transparent and audited, reducing risk of malfeasance. Staff are provided with technical and
                           managerial training. All of this has built a strong corporate culture which now resists predation or malfeasance.
 Institutional and         At the start of the commercialization program, the utility–which had been a department in the municipal
 governance                government–was corporatized, becoming NYEWASCO (a wholly municipal-owned company established
 solutions                 in terms of private company law in Kenya). Utility staffing, accounts, and finances are ring-fenced.
                           Kenya promulgated a new Constitution in 2010, and since 2013, water services have been a devolved
                           function. This means that Nyeri Water and Sewerage Company is currently owned by the County Government
                           of Nyeri. However, since the national Water Act of 2002 has not yet been repealed, NYEWASCO still has
                           a Service Provision Agreement (SPA) with the nationally owned asset holding Tana Water Services Board.
                           NYEWASCO reports and accounts together with the County Government of Nyeri to the national regulator,
                           WASREB, on an annual basis.
                           The utility is therefore accountable to the county government, but also to WASREB, Kenya’s national
                           water regulator. WASREB sets tariffs and minimum services standards through a process divorced from
                           local politics. WASREB also monitors and publishes key performance indicators for NYEWASCO and all
                           other Kenyan utilities, and it oversees and enforces minimum good governance processes related to the
                           selection of board members, their security of tenure, and related matters.
                           The continuity of the management team is a notable feature, with the capable MD retaining his position
                           from the commencement of the company until 2014. After a prolonged interim arrangement, a new MD
                           took office in 2015.


Reflections and conclusions
 Results of the            The results of the reform are clear: near-universal access to piped water (94 percent), 96 percent of poor
 turnaround                households with access to improved water services, 88 percent of poor households with water piped to
                           their home, water that is safe to drink, and availability of 24 hours a day. All this was achieved with almost
                           no financial support from the local or national government. The utility’s operating efficiency is among the
                           best in Africa, which enabled it to finance near universal service while preserving affordable tariffs and
                           minimizing subsidies.
 How a mandate             Civic pride, a strong political leader (the mayor), and a dedicated and capable utility engineer were the
 for the reform            key ingredients that came together to put Nyeri on the path toward universal high-quality water service.
 was secured               From a political economy perspective, it probably helped that the utility at the time was small and starved
                           of funds. Its small size and weak financial standing likely minimized vested interests in continuation of the
                           status quo–low coverage and intermittent service–for patronage, corruption, and other forms of predation.
                           In other words, it seems the political benefits of improved service outweighed the political costs from loss
                           of rent-seeking opportunities. It may also have helped that Nyeri is a relatively ethnically and culturally
                           homogenous town, minimizing inter-group rivalries that could otherwise have interfered with a drive for
                           universal service and the use of cross-subsidization to achieve it.
 Phasing the               The turnaround began with managerial reforms to increase efficiency. Governance reforms to create a ring-
 reforms                   fenced utility followed. Throughout, the utility’s goal was to raise the finance needed to improve and extend
                           service. However, securing the finance took several years, and disbursement was delayed because of a
                           period of poor relations between Kenya and IFIs. In the interim, the utility improvised low-budget solutions
                           to improve service. These service improvements, together with a policy of avoiding layoffs and building
                           corporate culture, secured continuing stakeholder support for the turnaround plan.
                           Once finance was available, the first priority was to bring a big new production plant on line. This immediately
                           improved service to existing customers. Leakage went up initially, but that did not matter in the short term:
                           ample water was available, and pumping and treatment costs had been reduced. The next priorities were
                           to get leakage under control, and to extend the network. In parallel, NYEWASCO knew it was urgent to
                           increase operating cash flows. The grace period on the loan created just enough time in which to do this.


                                                                                                                                                        83

      Sustaining                NYEWASCO’s success in growing, securing finance, and generating positive cash flow now make it a
      performance               tempting target for predation by politicians and corruption from within. The utility protects itself from
                                predation by building strong community support. It not only provides good service, but also has highly
                                visible commitments which create credibility with the community, such as fixing pipe bursts in less than 24
                                hours. NYEWASCO is transparent, holding regular barazas (similar to town hall meetings) and an annual
                                open day in which customers are invited to tour its offices and facilities. As a result, customers–who are also
                                voters–are fiercely protective of NYEWASCO and its autonomy. For instance, when the local radio station
                                reported that a political attempt to interfere in NYEWASCO’s management could be afoot, many citizens
                                called the utility asking what they needed to do to stop such interference. At NYEWASCO, an internal
                                culture of performance, transparency, and accountability creates an esprit de corps that also militates
                                against corruption and predation.

the distribution network, resulting in an increase in the
number of connections from 42,000 in 1996 to 330,000
in 2014, a growth of 11 percent per year. As a result, 90
percent of the poorest 40 percent of households living in
Ouagadougou (and 94 percent of the total population)
now have access to a piped water service. Only half of the
total population had access to individual or communal
piped water service before 2000. These achievements are
particularly noteworthy in a country with a per capita
GDP of US$713 (2014) and available freshwater resources
of only 711 m3 per person per annum (2014).


After an initial injection of equity, grants, and loans, the
expansion of services was achieved through net positive
cash flows. These were in turn enabled by a combination
of improved management and efficiency and increased
tariffs. These improvements were reflected in increased
revenue collection (from 85 percent to 97 percent), greater
staff productivity (from over eight to below three), and
maintaining NRW at 18 percent.

          Service before            The population of Ouagadougou had doubled in the period 1985 to 2000 (to about 1 million people), but
          the reforms               the development of water services infrastructure had not kept pace with increasing demand. In 2000, only
                                    half of the population had access to piped water (through individual taps or communal standpipes) and
                                    60 percent of the service areas experienced severe water shortages during the three hottest months of
                                    the year. ONEA had 29,000 customers in Ouagadougou. Staff productivity was low at 10 staff per 1,000
                                    connections. Cash collections were also below par at 85 percent from private customers and 65 percent
                                    from government customers. Up until 1996, ONEA was mired in serious management and administrative
                                    problems–it had stopped producing financial statements and, until 1998, its auditors were unable to verify
                                    its accounts. Water was sold below the cost of production and distribution, and the service provider was in
                                    serious financial difficulty. Finances for the expansion of services were not available.37
          Catalyst for              The reforms arose as a result of a deepening crisis. There was not enough water to provide to residents
          reform                    in Ouagadougou and severe shortages were a regular feature, especially in the hot summer months.
                                    The government did not have the financial resources to remedy this situation and turned to donors for
                                    assistance. Burkina Faso entered into a structural adjustment program in 1990 to address its dire economic
                                    and financial situation. Engagement between the government and donors throughout the 1990s ultimately
                                    led to an investment project, conditional on associated reforms of the utility commencing in 2001.
          Actors driving the        Salif Diallo, Minister of Environment and Water (1995 to 1999), negotiated the water sector reforms with
          reforms                   the World Bank and other donors. Mamadou Lamine Kouate was the Director-General (MD) of ONEA over
                                    the period 1995 to 2005 and led the reforms of the utility. Both resisted the World Bank’s recommendation
                                    to introduce a private operator to manage the service, along the lines of the successful reform which had
                                    been implemented in Senegal. This tension produced a different solution–ONEA remained a government-
                                    owned, limited liability company. Through a performance-based service contract, deputy managers for
                                    the commercial and finance functions were brought on from Veolia. A Supervision Committee–comprising
                                    representatives of consumers, government, nongovernmental organizations  (NGOs), and donors–was
                                    established to oversee ONEA’s and the government’s performance against the Contract Plan. Kouate
                                    proved to be a capable leader and manager of the utility reforms (as evidence in the impressive results).
                                    The undertakings made by Diallo on behalf of the government–including, for example, a government
                                    commitment to pay for water–proved to be credible.
          Course of action          Investments in increasing the supply of water to Ouagadougou were urgently needed. Funds were committed
          decided on                in 1996 by 11 donors, including the World Bank who contributed US$70 million of the more than US$200
                                    million water infrastructure and reform project. Conditions related to the funding were negotiated with the
                                    Government of Burkina Faso. Technical assistance from a private operator, Veolia, was provided through
                                    a service contract in the period 2001 to 2006 coinciding with investments in infrastructure, to run ONEA’s
                                    commercial, accounting, and financial operations.
          Technical                 Investments were made in additional supply capacity for Ouagadougou with the Ziga water supply project
          solutions                 (including a new 200 million m3 dam) and in extending the network–171 km of secondary network and 1,437
          implemented               km of tertiary network were constructed.

                                    A key challenge was to provide piped water services to people living in informal settlements (where some
                                    25 percent of the city population lived). Stakeholders agreed on a new vision of water supply to informal
                                    areas in 2004. Pilot projects were conducted in five suburbs of Ouagadougou from 2009. This involved the
                                    construction of the network and supply of water to a meter at the edge of the pilot informal settlements.
                                    The management of the network going into the informal settlements was delegated to private operators, as
                                    was the construction of the network and connections (using flexible HDPE piping and meters) and the retail
                                    to customers. Private household connections are an important part of the service mix as this enables the
                                    private operator to sell more water and hence increase its own revenue. Water is sold on the same terms as
                                    are provided by ONEA. Connection materials are provided by ONEA and the operators’ installation costs are
                                    reimbursed to encourage them to make connections. By the end of 2014, there were 7,578 connections

                           ONEA is the lead agency in the operation and an inclusive stakeholder consultation framework has been
                           established.

                           ONEA monitors water quality using a central laboratory with modern facilities and regional laboratories. The
                           National Public Health Laboratory under the Ministry of Health carries out daily checks and its results are
                           included in the calculation of the indicators and in the water quality reports.

 Commercial                Connection fees were reduced and are subsidized for both ONEA’s direct customers as well as customers
 solutions                 getting water from private operators in informal areas. ONEA sells water to the private operators at a
 implemented               wholesale price which allows operators to apply a margin while keeping the retail price at the same level
                           as ONEA’s retail price in other service areas. The financial model ensures that ONEA maintains a financial
                           equilibrium with free cash flow to repay capital loans and invest in the network. ONEA’s own direct customers
                           benefit from a social tariff for the first 8 m3 per month. Apart from these social tariff arrangements, the tariff is
                           set to recover costs on average. ONEA’s tariff for the first consumption block is just 18 percent of the tariff
                           for consumption in excess of 30 m3.
 Financing                 An investment of more than US$200 million was made by 11 development banks and donors (primarily for
 solutions                 a new dam, transmission and distribution pipelines, and related infrastructure). The World Bank contributed
 implemented               US$70 million through an IDA loan to the government, of which US$42 million was transferred to ONEA in
                           the form of an equity contribution, and the remaining US$28 million on-lent to ONEA with a maturity of 20
                           years, including 10 years of grace period for the principal, and at an annual interest rate of 5.4 percent.

                           The introduction of the financial equilibrium model has been a key factor in the achievement of a financially
                           sustainable provider and sector. The model is used to set the annual tariff through a transparent process
                           agreed with stakeholders. Ongoing network expansion has been financed through free cash flow.

      Management                The Director-General had a tenure of 11 years, and along with other senior staff of long standing, provided
      solutions                 stability in the management of the utility. ONEA’s accounts were certified by an international audit firm
      implemented               for the very first time in 1998. The first strategic plan was developed for the period 2004 to 2008. ISO
                                certification was achieved in 2009.

                                NRW is well managed and has been in the range 17 percent to 19 percent over the last 10 years. ONEA has
                                consistently achieved high cash collections of more than 95 percent since 2006, including from government.
                                (Government is obliged by the performance contract to settle its water bills.)
      Institutional and         The Minister of Water issued a mandate to the Director General of ONEA to establish the Ziga Project Unit.
      governance                In 1997, the Director General of ONEA delegated powers to the Ziga Project Unit, granting it administrative
      solutions                 and financial autonomy. In view of the close ties between the project (with a large infrastructure focus) and
                                the implementation of sector reform, the head of the unit played an increasingly important role and enjoyed
                                excellent relations with the Director General of ONEA.

                                The utility reform component of the project was designed with a focus on the finances, with three key elements:
                                instituting a performance contract between government and the utility, with audits; the development and
                                institutionalization of a multiyear financial equilibrium model (ensuring the sector was adequately funded);
                                and the creation of a path of financial recovery with improved cost controls and efficiency and tariffs that
                                recovered costs. A private operator was contracted to assist with the financial and commercial aspects
                                of the report and played a key part in all three. Financial equilibrium was achieved a few years into the
                                reforms.

                                The audited performance contract between the government and the utility was a key innovation. An
                                international technical auditor was used to audit ONEA’s performance and the service contract for the first
                                time in 1999. The audited performance is published and is used in the stakeholder processes, together with
                                the financial equilibrium model, to agree on targets and to set tariffs.

                                A Supervision Committee was also established to supervise ONEA’s activities. This Committee includes
                                representatives from the government, technical and financial partners, municipalities, and consumers. At its
                                annual meetings, it examines the implementation of the investment program for the attainment of the agreed
                                service targets and ONEA’s management and performance report. The Committee makes recommendations
                                on the sector’s financial stability, particularly whether price adjustments are needed, based on the analysis of
                                the technical auditor who audits all the reports submitted to the Committee in advance.

Reflections and conclusions
     Results of the            The results of the reforms are clear: 90 percent of the poorest 40 percent of households living in Ouagadougou
     turnaround                (and 94 percent of the total population) now have access to a piped water service whereas only half of
                               the total population had access to a piped service before 2000. The network length increased by a factor
                               of 2.5 times over the period 2005 to 2014. The number of connections per 100 people in the service
                               were more than doubled. The water is safe to drink. Service reliability has improved and a 24x7 supply
                               has been achieved in the period 2004 to 2008 and 2011 to 2012.38 Connections were made affordable
                               through a social connection fee policy, and more poor people living in informal settlements are also being
                               served with affordable piped water at or near their houses each year. A social tariff keeps the first 8 m3 of
                               water provided affordable for on-premises connections. Tariffs are cost reflective and the utility is efficiently
                               managed to support and sustain the above.
     How a mandate             The reform mandate arose from a crisis in the water supply coinciding with a financial crisis, both for the
     for the reform            country and the utility. The country needed financial assistance and negotiated access to finance and
     was secured               a related set of conditions with international development partners (the World Bank and others), which
                               included the reform of the utility. The mandate was given effect by two key actors, the Minister responsible
                               for water and the Manager in charge of the utility, with the support for the financiers and a private consortium
                               (for financial management support). This was not a straightforward process and took several years. There
                               were disagreements between the World Bank and the government on what constituted necessary reforms.
                               The World Bank wanted to implement a lease contract with a private operator. The government wanted to
                               retain public ownership and management. A compromise was reached with the use of a private operator
                               to run the financial and commercial functions of the utility for a period of time.

                               The decision to sponsor the subsidized connection program together with an effective communications
                               strategy facilitated buy-in by customers and other stakeholders to the reforms.
     Phasing the               Initial attention was given to the financing of an expanded water supply and then expanding the water
     reforms                   network. Financial management support was provided by a private consortium that was competitively
                               procured. Improved efficiencies softened the necessary tariff increases. An audited contract between the
                               government and the utility clarified accountability and was used to set appropriate performance targets.
                               The achievement of financial equilibrium was phased in. A capable manager was in place throughout a
                               key phase of the reform period–1995 to 2005–and a strong management team built so that the succession
                               was smooth. Later in the reform process (2009), the utility innovated to expand water supply to the rapidly
                               growing informal settlements using the expanded supply and the extended network as the necessary
                               backbone to achieve this. It developed alternative institutional arrangements, making use of small private
                               operators, to overcome the problem of its limited formal and legal mandate.
     Sustaining                The reforms are remarkable in the extent to which they have been sustained, with continued expansion of
     performance               service to serve the poor, supported by ongoing excellent utility performance and financed by the utility’s
                               own cash flows in a country with limited economic means, all over a period of close to 20 years since
                               the onset of the reforms. ONEA has managed to develop and sustain a culture of performance within
                               the organization that is supported by management autonomy and a formal performance contract with
                               government, that is, in turn, overseen by a formalized stakeholder body. These three ingredients–strong
                               performance culture, formal rules of accountability, and a formalized alliance of stakeholders–all appear to
                               reinforce each other to sustain and extend the achievements of the reforms.

to be alleviated in 2017.

       For instance, NRW as a percentage of water supplied is the most widely used and
