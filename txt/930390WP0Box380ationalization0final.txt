     Growth-oriented entrepreneurs, especially those in small countries and those that
     are highly innovative, often look to international markets to grow their business. From
     a development perspective, entrepreneurs’ successful expansion into international
     markets can mean revenue growth and job creation at the enterprise level, along with
     spillover effects into innovation, industry competitiveness, and foreign exchange on a
     broader economic level.


    The      traditional    approach      to     enterprise        infoDev focuses on enabling the growth of early-stage

2. INTRODUCTION



 Growth-oriented entrepreneurs, especially those in
 small countries, often look to international markets to
 grow their business. From a development perspective,             FIGURE 1: IS INTERNATIONAL

 at the enterprise level, along with spillover effects
 into innovation, industry competitiveness, and foreign
 exchange on a broader economic level.

 linkages that would enable the growth of early-stage
 enterprises.

 During 2010 – 2013, infoDev piloted a few approaches to
 enable international market access for small, relatively
 early-stage, growth-oriented enterprises. In total,
 about 200 enterprises from more than 35 countries
 participated in these pilots. The results and lessons
 from these pilot projects summarized in this document
 provide insights for practitioners who are considering
 increasing international market access for early-
 stage entrepreneurs. Recommendations as to further
 research in this field are also provided.



 For the purposes of this document, the term
 ‘internationalization’ is defined as foreign direct
 investment, as well as activities that put companies
 into a meaningful business relationship with a foreign
 partner for the purpose of importing, exporting,
 subcontracting, or technical cooperation.

    3. THE PURSUIT OF INTERNATIONAL
    MARKET ACCESS

    Growth-oriented entrepreneurs in small markets have
    little choice but to look abroad to fulfill their growth
    aspirations. Therefore, it is not surprising that small
    economies stand out for their high levels of international
    trade by early-stage entrepreneurs; according to the
    2013 Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, Singapore,
    Luxemburg, Israel, Croatia, Ireland, and Slovenia top

    customers abroad.4 Is this because the entrepreneurs
    in the former countries are less growth-oriented or less
    competitive? Is it because they face more barriers to
    internationalization? Or perhaps they can fulfill their
    growth aspirations at home?

•	 Thoroughly assess both the entrepreneur’s and the host incubator’s internationalization readiness, both in
terms of expertise and staff capacity/general resources. Challenges in internationalization readiness can include
competing priorities, lack of awareness of co-incubation, lack of incentives, lack of market/industry know-how, as
well as lack of resources including mentors and financing.
•	 The ability of the SME to financially invest in the internationalization process should be ensured.
•	 Do not underestimate the time needed for close support and advice.
•	 Internationalization as a service should ideally be mandated by the governance/management structure and
within the overall business model of the business incubator.
•	 Language, cultural differences, and business language barriers should be addressed appropriately.
•	 Country specific legal and regulatory considerations associated with the hosting of international companies and
entrepreneurs by incubators in their countries should be taken into account.

•	   The value of mentoring in the internationalization process is at least as valuable as funding the companies to
compete in the process. Access to mentors is limited in emerging markets (as opposed to those based in Silicon
Valley for example) and such activities can provide an important and unique platform for companies.
•  	 Such activities raise awareness among mentors in developed countries about the innovativeness and investability of
companies in emerging markets. Mentors become personally invested in company growth during a longer term activity and
mentors often invite companies to “check in” with them even after the end of the formal activities.
•  	 In addition to a more traditional “bootcamp” model of a few days of training followed by pitching, the particular
value of an activity such as the VentureOutChallenge is in the opportunity to provide longer term, targeted coaching
to companies as well as to better understand their challenges during a internationalization “journey” over several
months.
•  	 A global platform for linking companies and mentors could serve as a vehicle for systematically sharing
knowledge and connecting companies in emerging markets to international mentors, while on the flipside providing
practitioners and development organizations with a better view of the needs, statistics, and activities of those active
in such a network.

        training, which will continue to be used after the end of the project with infoDev. This training comprises the following subject areas: (1) What
        is internationalization, and why is it needed?, (2) Phases of internationalization and related operational procedures, (3) International business
