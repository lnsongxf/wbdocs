1. Introduction

    What is the potential of GVCs to enhance productivity of domestic firms in developing countries? This
note focuses on the productivity gains of domestic firms that export and import in global value chains
(GVCs). In particular, we estimate the impact of a domestic firm’s export share and share of imported
inputs on labor productivity for a cross-section of more than 25,000 domestic manufacturing firms in 78
low- and middle-income countries from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys. We use the dataset by
Farole and Winkler (2014) who assess how foreign investor characteristics, domestic firms’ absorptive
capacity and a country’s institutional variables influence intra-industry productivity spillovers to domestic
firms from foreign direct investment (FDI). We modify their analysis and focus on the productivity effects
from selling and purchasing internationally in GVCs on domestic firms in three Southern African Customs
Union (SACU) countries (Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland), but also report the general results for the
rest of the country sample. We also take into account domestic firm heterogeneity as GVC integration
affects different types of firms unequally.

    In order to adequately measure a firm’s participation in GVCs in this context, it is important to first
identify the different forms through which GVC integration can affect domestic firms’ productivity.
Integrating a country’s domestic suppliers into GVCs increases the possibility for productivity gains
through exporting to a buyer abroad or supplying to a multinational in the country. But countries should
not neglect the opportunities for productivity gains that GVC participation can provide from a buyer’s
perspective. Instead of building a complete array of supply chains at home, firms can join existing supply
chains of multinationals through cross-border trade in intermediates and components (Taglioni and
Winkler 2015). While Farole and Winkler (2014) focus on the productivity spillovers from multinationals
in a country, this note looks at the impact of cross-border sales to international buyers (exporting) or
purchases of inputs from international sellers (importing) in GVCs.

    While our dataset doesn’t allow to directly test for the underlying transmission channels, it is
nevertheless useful to understand how GVC integration can impact on firm-level productivity. First,
domestic firms can benefit via forward links in GVCs by selling intermediates to international buyers,
spurring production in upstream sectors. Similarly, they can benefit via backward links by purchasing
international inputs, spurring production in various downstream sectors. Third, domestic firms can
improve productivity via technology spillovers in the same or related downstream or upstream sectors as
a result of GVC production. Fourth, domestic firms can benefit from productivity spillovers via skills
demand and upgrading which is transferred through the training of and demand for skilled labor in the
same, downstream or upstream sectors. Fifth, domestic firms can gain from market restructuring effects,
as GVC participation increases the competition for limited resources in the country which in the long-term
should increase overall productivity and also enables firms to learn from international buyers and foreign

investors. Finally, domestic firms may benefit via minimum scale achievements, triggered by investments
in infrastructure that would not be profitable without GVC participation and that may spur local
production in other sectors (Taglioni and Winkler 2015). Our analysis directly focuses on the first two
transmission channels, but indirectly also covers the other channels. Technology spillovers, increased skills
demand, and minimum scale effects are all thinkable results of exporting and importing in GVCs.

    Besides shedding light on the transmission channels, it is also important to examine which types of
domestic firm benefit most from GVC integration which has important policy implications. It is likely that
the productivity effects from GVC participation are mixed for different types of firms. The literature on
the productivity effects from FDI, for example, suggests that the theoretical postulated spillover effects
often do not automatically materialize just because a country is able to attract FDI in the first place. As a
result, more and more research has been devoted to understanding the various conditions that may
explain these mixed results. Three major types of mediating factors have been identified, including (i)
characteristics of foreign firms, which mediate spillover potential; (ii) characteristics of domestic firms,
which mediate absorptive capacity to internalize spillovers; and (iii) differences in host country factors
(Castellani and Zanfi 2003, Lipsey and Sjöholm 2005), which mediate both domestic and foreign firm
characteristics as well as the transmission channels for spillovers (Paus and Gallagher 2008). In this note,
we examine the role of domestic firm characteristics for productivity gains in GVCs.

    This note is structured as follows. Section 2 reviews the relevant literature with regard to productivity
effects from GVC participation as well as the role of domestic firm characteristics in this context. Section
3 introduces the data and econometric model. In section 4 we present our regression results, while section
5 concludes.


2. Literature Review

2.1 GVC Integration and Productivity

Exporting and Productivity

    The exporting-productivity nexus has been discussed both at the macro and micro levels for a long
time. The macro-economic channels through which export expansion enhances aggregate productivity
and growth are well-known. Exports in Ricardo’s famed theory allow for specialization in a country’s
comparative advantage and thereby raise growth. The new trade theory à la Helpman and Krugman (1985)
and generalized by Grossman and Helpman (1991) shifted the focus from the static gains from trade to
dynamic ones in which the increased investment, knowledge and technology associated with increased
productivity growth can transform trade patterns and accelerate overall economic growth. Under the
new theory, specialization is a result of scale and concomitant efficiencies.

                                                     2
    At the micro-level, researchers have recognized at the latest since the seminal paper by Bernard and
Jensen (1995) that exporters outperform non-exporters in the same sector and country in terms of
productivity, skills, wages, technology, and capital intensity (see detailed literature review in Wagner
2007). Consequently, researchers started to ask whether exporters perform better because of self-
selection into the exporting market and because of learning-by-exporting. Self-selection refers to ex-ante
differences across firms, while learning-by-exporting refers to ex-post gains of exporters versus non-
exporters. Self-selection relates to the fact that exporting involves additional costs of exporting, including
transportation, marketing, and distribution costs, employees with specific skills, and production costs for
necessary adjustment which only more productive firms are able to absorb. Learning-by-exporting refers
to knowledge flows that exporting firms absorb from international buyers and competitors which renders
them more productive (Wagner 2007).

    The wide array of existing studies tends to find that more productive firms self-select into exporting,
while the positive impact of exporting on productivity is less clear-cut. The increased fragmentation of
international trade in GVCs makes learning-by-exporting more likely as selling to international buyers
might increase firm-level productivity ex-post via forward and backward linkages, technology spillovers,
skills upgrading, and minimum scale effects. There are only few studies for African countries. In a firm-
level panel data approach covering Kenya, Ghana, Zimbabwe and Cameroon from 1991 to 1995, Bigsten
et al. (2004) confirm that exporting raises productivity. Biesebroeck (2005) confirms the positive
productivity effects of exporting at the firm-level for nine Sub-Saharan African (SSA) countries between
1992 and 1996. Using country-level data instead, Songwe and Winkler (2012) also find positive
productivity effects of exports for a cross-country sample of 30 SSA countries between 1995 and 2008,
which are only significant in manufacturing and services sectors, but not in primary sectors.

    This note complements the learning-by-exporting literature, with some important differences. While
the latter typically compares productivity growth between year 0 and year t of non-exporters with that of
export-starters, this note emphasizes whether a higher export share in total sales is associated with a
higher productivity level across firms. Using export share as right-hand side variable, we take into account
two types of GVC integration, namely (i) GVC entry (as both firms with 0 and positive export shares are
included), and (ii) expansion of GVC participation (as both firms with lower and higher export shares are
included). The second type should not be neglected, as it is likely that more GVC integration via larger
export shares leads to more ex-post productivity gains via the various transmission channels explained
above.

Importing Inputs and Productivity

    Most of the studies on the effect of imported inputs on productivity focus on developed countries –
as part of the offshoring literature which started in the mid-1990s when developed countries began to

                                                      3
assess whether importing (or offshoring) of material inputs (typically from lower-income countries)
entailed positive welfare effects in the countries of origin. However, the focus was more on the labor
market effects. Shifting the focus on total factor TFP growth, Egger et al. (2001) find that materials
offshoring to Eastern European countries had a significantly positive impact in 20 Austrian manufacturing
industries. There are various ways of measuring offshoring, but in most cases it is the share of imported
inputs as percentage of total inputs, value added or output. Since these measures are typically based on
input-output tables, this type of studies is often performed at the industry-level.

    In the 2000s, this stream of literature gained momentum when the focus shifted on services
offshoring. Amiti and Wei (2006, 2009) find evidence that services offshoring significantly increased TFP
and labor productivity in US manufacturing between 1992 and 2000, which is estimated at a sectoral level,
while the effect of materials offshoring is smaller and often insignificant. Similary, Crino (2008) finds larger
substantially larger productivity gains from services offshoring than materials offshoring for nine EU
countries between 1990 and 2004. Winkler (2010) finds similar effects for German manufacturing
industries covering the period 1995-2006. Michel and Rycx (2011) find evidence for a productivity-
enhancing effect of services offshoring in Belgian manufacturing industries between 1995 and 2004, but
none for materials offshoring. They also examine the impact of inter-industry spillover effects, but only
find little evidence.

    Daveri and Jona-Lasinio (2008), by contrast, find for Italy that only materials offshoring increased TFP
growth between 1995 and 2003. Ito and Tanaka (2010) find that materials offshoring to Asian countries
increased TFP in Japanese manufacturing over the period 1988-2004. Focusing on low-skilled workers,
Egger and Egger (2006) find a U-shaped labor productivity effect from materials offshoring in
manufacturing sectors of 12 EU countries between 1993 and 1997.

    A few studies use firm-level data. Görg and Hanley (2003) analyze the impact of services offshoring
on labor productivity for Ireland using plant level data. The effect was positive in the electronics industry
between 1990 and 1995. In a more recent plant-level study, Görg et al. (2008) evaluate the productivity
effects of materials and services offshoring for Irish manufacturing for the period 1990-1998,
differentiating between exporting and non-exporting firms. They only find a significantly positive impact
of services offshoring on total factor productivity for exporting firms. However, studies focusing on
developing countries are virtually non-existent – especially at the firm-level. This notes feeds into the
literature above by focusing on the impact of materials offshoring on labor productivity at the firm-level
in three SACU countries.

2.2 The Role of Absorptive Capacity
    At the domestic firm level, R&D, human capital, firm size, firm location, export behavior, the
technology gap, type of ownership, and sectoral competition are mediating factors that allow countries
to adopt complementary policies for levering the opportunities of GVC participation. These factors
determine the local firm’s absorptive capacity. While the focus here is on spillovers from FDI, many firm
characteristics can also be expected to lead to spillovers from GVC participation through international
trade and non-equity modes of investment, especially in modular or relational governance forms where
the degree of knowledge sharing is relatively high.

    The technology gap between foreign and domestic firms has been identified as one the most
important mediating factors for FDI spillovers (Kokko 1994; Kokko et al. 1996; Grünfeld 2006)2. Views on
the role of the technology gap for FDI spillovers conflict. Some studies find that a large technology gap is
beneficial for local firms since their catching-up potential increases (Findlay 1978; Wang and Blomström
1992; Smeets 2008). Other studies argue that local firms might not be able to absorb positive FDI spillovers
if the technology gap between the multinational and local producers is too big or too small (e.g. Blalock
and Gertler 2009).

    The literature suggests that there is solid evidence for the supportive role of R&D in local firms in high
income countries, e.g. Spain (Barrios and Strobl 2002; Barrios et al. 2004), the US (Keller and Yeaple 2009),
Ireland (Barrios et al. 2004), and Sweden (Karpaty and Lundberg 2004), among others. There are also
studies confirming the supportive role of R&D in domestic firms for developing or emerging countries,
including the Czech Republic (Kinoshita 2001), India (Kanturia 2000, 2001, 2002), Hungary and Slovakia
(Damijan et al. 2003), and Indonesia (Blalock and Gertler 2009), among others. One exception is Damijan
et al. (2003) finding a negative role of firm-level R&D on FDI spillovers for Estonia and Latvia (reported in
Crespo and Fontura 2007).

    A domestic firm’s ability to absorb foreign technology might also be positively related to its share of
skilled labor. Blalock and Gertler (2009), for example, find that the proportion of employees with college
degrees significantly increases domestic firms’ productivity gains from FDI in Indonesian manufacturing.
However, Girma and Wakelin (2007) only confirm such a finding for smaller firms in the U.K. – they find
that FDI does not affect large firms with a high proportion of human capital, as these firms are probably
the most similar to multinationals in terms of technology and market share. In contrast, Sinani and Meyer
(2004) find for a sample of Estonian firms that a larger share of human capital reduces the positive
spillover effects for domestic firms, but increases it for large firms. Their explanation for this contradicting
result is that the competition effect might reduce workers’ possibility to extract additional rents from local

2 The technology gap is usually measured as a domestic firm’s productivity level relative to a benchmark productivity
level within the same sector – often of the leading firms (Griffith et al. 2002, Girma 2005, Girma and Görg 2007) or
of foreign firms (Castellini and Zanfei 2003).

                                                         5
firms, since multinationals tend to pay better wages. The competition effect might also enable larger firms
to keep skilled workers compared to smaller firms who might lose skilled workers to foreign firms.

    Firm size has been positively related to a domestic firm’s capacity to absorb FDI spillovers (e.g. Jordaan
2011 for Mexico). Larger firms may be better positioned to compete with multinationals and to imitate
their tools (Crespo and Fontoura 2007). Analogously, larger firms may pay better wages and therefore
find it easier to attract workers employed by multinational firms. Larger firms might also be more visible,
e.g. organized in associations, and, thus, more likely selected as local suppliers by foreign firms. While
Aitken and Harrison (1999) find negative spillovers from FDI on domestic plants in Venezuela, these effects
are only significant for firms with less than 50 employees. This suggests that smaller firms are less
competitive and less capable of absorbing positive spillover effects. In contrast, other studies find that
small and medium-sized firms benefit more strongly from FDI spillovers, especially those firms with a
higher proportion of skilled labor (e.g. Girma and Wakelin 2007; Sinani and Meyer 2004).

    Several aspects of domestic firm location have shown to be important for the extent of productivity
spillovers from FDI. Barrios et al. (2006) find evidence that foreign firms collocating (agglomeration) in the
same sector and region significantly increase productivity and employment of local manufacturing firms
in Ireland. Some studies contest the positive role of agglomeration for a firm’s absorptive capacity. For
example, while Sjöholm (1999) confirms positive spillover effects when FDI is measured at the country-
sector level in Indonesia, he finds negative spillovers when foreign presence is measured at the region-
sector level. Aitken and Harrison (1999) and Yudaeva et al. (2003) find similar results for Russia.

    Besides agglomerations, studies focused on other aspects of location. Firm location in special
economic zones, for example, can have a negative impact on FDI spillovers if the zone focuses on export
processing combined with a high percentage of imported inputs (Abraham et al. 2010). More regional
development (e.g. Ponomareva 2000, Torlak 2004, Girma 2005, Girma and Wakelin 2007) and a domestic
firm’s geographical proximity to multinational firms (Girma and Wakelin 2007, Resmini and Nicolini 2007)
seem to have a positive effect.

    Exporting has been linked to a domestic firm’s absorptive capacity for at least two reasons. First, local
exporting firms are generally characterized by a higher productivity, be it via learning-by-exporting or self-
selection into exporting, rendering them more competitive to bear up against negative rivalry effects
created by multinationals (Crespo and Fontoura 2007). Second, the more a local firm exports, the lower
will competitive pressures from multinational firms be felt (assuming that the multinational firm does not
enter the same export market), hence, the incentive to improve, which lowers the extent of positive FDI
spillovers. However, studies show no clear evidence whether exporting increases or lowers the
productivity gains from FDI. While several studies find evidence for lower productivity gains for exporters
(e.g. Blomström and Sjöholm 1999, Ponomareva 2000, Sinai and Meyer 2004, Abraham et al. 2010, and


                                                      6
Du et al. 2011). In contrast, some studies find that the gains from FDI are larger for exporting firms (e.g.
Barrios and Strobl 2002, Schoors and van der Tol 2002, Lin at al. 2009, Jordaan 2011).


3. Empirical Model

3.1 Data
    The World Bank Enterprise Analysis Unit recently published the Enterprise Surveys Indicator
Database.3 This publication covers 215 enterprise surveys for 126 countries over the period 2006 to 2010.
Enterprise surveys represent a comprehensive source of firm-level data in emerging markets and
developing economies. One major advantage of the enterprise surveys is that the survey questions are
the same across all countries. Moreover, the Enterprise Surveys represent a stratified random sample of
firms using three levels of stratification: sector, firm size, and region. Sectors are based on the ISIC Rev.
3.1 classification, but in some cases are further aggregated.

    The Enterprise Surveys Indicator Database covers a wide range of indicators on firm characteristics,
the business environment, innovation and technology, and workforce and skills among others. We merged
this dataset with data on firm-level output, value added, and capital stock obtained from the Enterprise
Analysis Unit of the World Bank.4 All local currencies have been converted into US dollars and deflated
using a GDP deflator in USD (base year 2000). Exchange rates and GDP deflators have been obtained from
the World Development Indicators.

    We apply the following rules to the dataset: (i) We include only the most recent Enterprise Surveys
for each country; (ii) We include only countries that cover foreign firms in the surveys5; (iii) We drop high-
income countries to cover only emerging or developing countries6; and (iv) We drop countries for which
we cannot calculate our FDI spillover measure due to unavailable output and value added data. We focus
only on the effects of productivity spillovers on domestic manufacturing firms, since productivity
measures were unavailable for services firms.

    The procedure above results in more than 25,000 domestic firms and 3,400 foreign firms in 78
countries covering eleven manufacturing sectors. The list of countries, year of most recent survey and
number of domestic and foreign manufacturing firms by country can be found in Appendix 1. The coverage
across manufacturing sectors is shown in Appendix 2. Note that while we drop foreign firms in the

income countries (some OECD countries, some non-OECD countries, and one oil exporter).

regression analysis, we included foreign firms in the computation of some of the mediating factors
discussed in the next section.

3.2 Measures and Econometric Model
       The baseline equation, which is estimated by ordinary least squares (OLS), takes the following form:

lnlpirst= α + β1gvcirst + β2(gvcirst*countryc) + γ1(gvcirst*MF) + γ2(gvcirst*MF*countryc) +….

       + δlncapintirst + countryc + Dr + Dcs + Dt + εirst                                                      (1)

lnlpirst indicates the labor productivity for domestic firm i in subnational region r, sector s and at time t in
natural logarithms, defined as value added per worker. gvcirst designates our measure of GVC integration
at the firm level. In the following, we use two alternative measures of GVC integration: a firm’s total export
share in output, exp, and a firm’s share of imported inputs in total inputs, imp (see Box 1).

                                        Box 1: Mediating Factors, Absorptive Capacity
   •     prod = domestic firm’s labor productivity relative to median labor productivity of multinational firms in
         sector in natural logarithms; a higher number indicates a lower productivity gap.
   •     tech = domestic firm’s technology indicator. tech = iso + tech_for + website + email with tech ϵ {0, 1, 2,
         3, 4}, where iso = 1 if firm owns internationally-recognized quality certification and 0 otherwise,
         tech_for = 1 if firm uses technology licensed from foreign firms and 0 otherwise, website = 1 if
         firm uses own website to communicate with clients or suppliers, email = 1 if firm uses email to
         communicate with clients or suppliers. The technology indicator serves as a proxy for R&D intensity
         which is unavailable;
   •     skills = domestic firm’s share of high-skilled labor in firm’s total labor force;
   •     size = domestic firm’s total number of permanent and temporary employees in natural logarithms;
   •     aggl = region’s total number of manufacturing and services firms as percentage of a country’s total number
         of manufacturing and services firms. This measure is a proxy for urbanization economies (locational
         advantages) and covers both domestic and foreign firms;
   •     exp = domestic firm’s share of direct or indirect exports in firm sales.
   •     imp = domestic firm’s share of imported inputs in total inputs.

       countryc is a country dummy which takes the value of 1 if a country is the country of interest, and 0
otherwise. lncapintirst is capital intensity in natural logarithms. We also include subnational region,
country-sector and time fixed effects. Standard errors are robust to heteroscedasticity.

       MF is a vector designating the mediating factor of interest in the form of a dummy variable which

characteristic (the mediating factor) is given by the sum of four coefficients: β1 + β2 + γ1+ γ2.

    The total impact of GVC integration in countries other than the country of interest on labor
productivity for the same firm characteristic is given by the sum of two coefficients: β1 + γ1.

4. Regression Results

4.1 Export Share
     In a first step, we focus on the productivity effects of export share without taking into account the
mediating factors. Table 2 reports the total coefficients for the country of interest and the rest of the
sample, respectively, and are based on the individual regression results for Namibia, South Africa, and
Swaziland reported in Appendices 4 to 6. The regressions only include domestic firms. We clearly find a
positive association between export share and labor productivity across the sample, and also for our three
countries of interest. The positive impact is highest in Namibia, slightly lower in South Africa and the rest
of the country sample, but very low in Swaziland.

Source: Appendices 4 to 6. Note: p*<0.1, p**<0.05, p***<0.01 (p-values of F-tests of joint significance in parentheses). The total impact of firm-
         level export share on labor productivity in a country of interest is given by the sum of two coefficients: β1 + β2 in equation (1).



     In a next step, we take into account the mediating factors (Table 3). First, we look at the role of
productivity gap for the relationship between export share and productivity. Across the sample, the
results suggest that export share is more likely to be associated with positive productivity effects the lower
the firm’s productivity gap relative to foreign firms in its sector is. In fact, across the board firms with the
highest productivity gap of below 50 percent relative to foreign firms in the sector ( prod0) all show
negative productivity effects, in particular in South Africa. In Namibia, firms with a medium gap between
50 and 80 percent (prod50) also exhibit negative productivity effects from export share which turns
strongly positive for firms with a relatively low gap between 80 and 100 percent (prod80). The productivity
gains from exporting for firms that exceed the median productivity of foreign firms in a sector are positive,
but much smaller (prod100). In Swaziland, we see a similar pattern, only that the positive productivity
effect kicks in only for firms that exceed the median productivity of foreign firms in a sector (prod100).
Firms with a low gap between 80 and 100 percent (prod80) see their initial productivity decline due to
their exporting activity. In South Africa, the productivity effect from export share is positive for all firms,
but decreases with a higher productivity gap. We see a similar pattern for firms in the rest of the sample.



                                                                       10
    Second, we examine the role of a firm’s technology level. Across the sample we find that firms with
the highest technology level (tech4) benefit most strongly, especially in Namibia. The differences for firms
with lower technology levels, however, are ambiguous. In Namibia and Swaziland we find a U-shape effect
on productivity. In Namibia, firms in the lowest category (tech1) show higher productivity effects from
exporting than firms in the medium category, while in Swaziland such firms show lower productivity
losses. In South Africa and the rest of the sample, by contrast, higher technology levels are associated
with higher productivity. Nevertheless, South African firms with low technology levels (tech1) see their
productivity initially decline.

Source: Appendices 4 to 6. Note: p*<0.1, p**<0.05, p***<0.01 (p-values of F-tests of joint significance in parentheses). The total impact of firm-
level export share on labor productivity in a country of interest for a specific firm characteristic is given by the sum of four coefficients: β1 + β2 +
  γ1 + γ2 in equation (1). The total impact of firm-level export share in countries other than the country of interest on labor productivity for the
 same firm characteristic is given by the sum of two coefficients: β1 + γ1 in equation (2). Note that for the first category in each panel, γ1 = γ2 = 0.



     Third, we look at the role of skill levels where we see different patterns. In Namibia, productivity
effects from exporting are negative for firms with the lowest skills levels (skills0), while they are highest
for skills levels between 20 and 50 percent (skills20) and remain positive, but become smaller for higher
skill intensities. In South Africa and Swaziland, by contrast, the productivity gains are highest for firms with
a share of educated in their workforce of less than 20 percent (skills20), while the impact for firms
exceeding 80 percent (skills80) is slightly negative. In the rest of the sample, we only see a slight increase
for firms exceeding a share of 50 percent (skills50) which remains constant for higher skill levels.

     Fourth, we analyze the role of firm size where we also find different patterns. In Namibia and
Swaziland, larger firms show a negative overall productivity effect, but the threshold is different. In
Namibia, firms with more than 50 employees (size50) are negatively affected, while in Swaziland it is firms


                                                                          12
with more than 250 workers (size250). Moreover, in Namibia the smallest firms show the highest
productivity gains (size0), whereas in Swaziland its firms with 50 to 250 employees (size50). In South
Africa, by contrast, firm size is associated with higher productivity effects from exporting. A larger firm
size exceeding 50 workers (size50) is beneficial, and the gains increase for very large firms of 250 or more
employees (size250), while smaller firms face productivity losses (size10).

    Fifth, we study the role of agglomerations for the export share-productivity nexus. In Namibia the
effect is negative for firms in small agglomerations (aggl0), while the effect in other SACU countries and
the rest of the sample is positive. In South Africa, firms in larger agglomerations benefit less strongly
(aggl50), while in Namibia such firms show the largest productivity gains. In the rest of the sample, by
contrast, we don’t see major differences of firm location.

    Finally, a firm’s share of imported inputs in total inputs also mediates the productivity effects from
export share. In Namibia, firms with a small (imp0) and medium import share (imp50) have negative
effects, while large importers (imp80) show high productivity gains from exporting. In South Africa, all
firms benefit, but large importers (imp80) more strongly, followed by small importers (imp0). By contrast,
Swaziland’s large importers (imp80) see their productivity decline, while small importers benefit (imp0).

    In the rest of the country sample, by contrast, we see an inverse U-shaped effect where medium
importers (imp50) show higher productivity gains than other firms.

    4.2 Imported Input ShareIn this section, we focus on the productivity effects of imported input share.
We first look at the overall effects for domestic firms without taking into account the mediating factors.
Table 4 reports the total coefficients for the country of interest and the rest of the sample, respectively.
The coefficients are based on the individual regression results for Namibia, South Africa, and Swaziland
reported in Appendices 7 to 9. We clearly find a positive association between imported input share and
labor productivity. As was the case for export share, the positive impact is highest in Namibia, slightly
lower in South Africa and very low in Swaziland. The positive relationship in the rest of the country sample
lies in the middle spectrum. Interestingly, the positive productivity gain in the rest of the country sample
is higher for sellers (export share) than for buyers (imported input share) in GVCs. In the three SACU
countries, by contrast, the productivity gains from being a buyer in GVCs are relatively and in the case of
Swaziland absolutely higher. This implies that access to technology and knowledge embodied in imported
inputs via GVC linkages matters more strongly in the SACU context.



    We now turn to the mediating factors (Table 5). First, we focus on the role of productivity gap for the
relationship between imported input share and productivity. Across the sample, the results suggest that
imported input share is more strongly associated with positive productivity effects the lower the firm’s
productivity gap relative to foreign firms in its sector is. Firms with the highest productivity gap (prod0) all

                                                      13
have negative productivity effects across the sample. Firms with the second highest productivity gap
(prod50) in Swaziland and South Africa still see their productivity decline due to importing inputs, and the
positive productivity effect kicks in only for firms that have a low productivity gap between 80 and 100
percent relative to foreign firms in a sector (prod80). In Namibia and the rest of the sample, the positive
productivity effects already start for firms with a gap between 50 and 80 percent (prod50).

         level export share on labor productivity in a country of interest is given by the sum of two coefficients: β1 + β2 in equation (1).



     Second, we look at the role of a firm’s technology level. In Namibia and the rest of the sample we find
that a higher technology level is more beneficial for a firm’s productivity effects due to importing inputs.
In South Africa, a technology level exceeding 2 leads to positive productivity gains from importing inputs,
but we see no additional gains for firms in the highest category (tech4). In Swaziland, we see a U-shaped
effect where firms with low (tech1) and high technology levels (tech4) benefit more strongly than firms
the middle. Technology particularly pays off in Swaziland and Namibia where firms in the highest
technological category gain three and two times as much compared to firms in lower categories,
respectively.

     Third, we analyze the role of skill levels. We cannot detect a clear trend as in different SACU countries
different types of firms benefit more strongly from a higher share of skilled workers. In Swaziland, for
example, we see a U-shaped effect where low-skill firms (skills0) and high-skilled firms benefit most
strongly (skills80), but more so the low-skilled ones. Low-to medium skilled firms (skills20), by contrast,
see their productivity decline. In South Africa firms with the lowest skill intensity (skills0) benefit most
strongly, followed by firms with a medium-to high skill intensity (skills50), while firms with a low-to
medium (skills20) and high skill intensity (skills80) benefit less strongly. In Namibia, firms disposing of the
largest share of skilled workers (skills80) have the highest productivity gains across the sample.
Interestingly, firms with a low (skills0) and medium-to high skill level (skills50) gain only a fifth, while low-
to medium-skilled firms (skills20) gain two thirds compared to high-skill-intensive firms. In the rest of the



                                                                       14
sample, by contrast, all types of firms show similar productivity gains from importing inputs, regardless of
their skills levels.

     Fourth, we analyze the role of firm size where Swaziland stands out. Here, we find that firm size
correlates negatively with productivity effects. Firms with less than 10 employees (size10) benefit most
strongly, followed by smaller firms with 10 to 50 employees (size10), while firms in larger size categories
have negative productivity effects. In Namibia, South Africa and the rest of the sample, by contrast, we
clearly see that larger firm size pays off in terms of productivity gains. The gains are particularly strong for
Namibian firms with 50 to 250 workers (size50) and South African firms exceeding 250 workers (size250).

Source: Appendices 7 to 9. Note: p*<0.1, p**<0.05, p***<0.01 (p-values of F-tests of joint significance in parentheses). The total impact of firm-
level imported input share on labor productivity in a country of interest for a specific firm characteristic is given by the sum of four coefficients:
   β1 + β2 + γ1+ γ2 in equation (1). The total impact of firm-level imported input share in countries other than the country of interest on labor
  productivity for the same firm characteristic is given by the sum of two coefficients: β1 + γ1 in equation (1). Note that for the first category in

     Fifth, we study the role of agglomerations. While the SACU countries only have firms that fall in two
of three agglomeration categories, we tend to find that firms in larger agglomerations benefit less

                                                                         15
compared to firms in smaller agglomerations. In Swaziland, firms in larger agglomerations (aggl25) even
show negative productivity effects, while firms in small agglomerations (aggl0) benefit from importing
inputs. In Namibia and South Africa, the gains for firms in small agglomerations (aggl0) are almost four
and three times as high, respectively, as for firms in large agglomerations (aggl50). By contrast, firms in
small agglomerations (aggl0) only benefit marginally less than firms in larger agglomeration.

    Finally, we find that a firm’s export share also mediates the productivity effects from importing inputs.
The results, however, vary strongly. We find a U-shaped effect in South Africa and Swaziland, but the
coefficient signs differ. While in South Africa, all types of firms benefit, more so the ones with low ( exp0)
and high (exp80) export shares, in Swaziland firms with medium export shares (exp50) show large
productivity declines which become smaller for firms with large export shares (exp80). Only firms with
low export shares (exp0) experience productivity gains. In Namibia, by contrast, we see an inverse U-
shaped effect. Firms with medium (exp50) see their productivity strongly increase due to importing inputs,
while firms with low shares (exp0) gain less and firms with high shares even face productivity losses
(exp80). The inverse U-shaped is also slightly pronounced in the rest of the sample where medium
exporters (exp50) benefit marginally more from importing inputs than small (exp0) and large (exp80)
exporters.


5. Conclusions

    This note focused on the impact of a domestic firm’s GVC integration – as proxied by export share and
share of imported inputs – on labor productivity for a cross-section of more than 25,000 domestic
manufacturing firms in 78 low- and middle-income countries from the World Bank’s Enterprise Surveys.
Using the dataset by Farole and Winkler (2014), we study the productivity effects from selling and
purchasing internationally in GVCs on domestic firms in three SACU countries, but also across the broad
country sample. We also take into account domestic firm heterogeneity as GVC integration affects
different types of firms unequally.

    We find a clear, positive association between export share and labor productivity across the sample,
and also for our three SACU countries of interest. The positive impact is highest in Namibia, slightly lower
in South Africa and the rest of the country sample, but very low in Swaziland. Similarly, we find a clear,
positive association between imported input share and labor productivity. Again, the positive impact is
highest in Namibia, slightly lower in South Africa, and very low in Swaziland. The positive relationship in
the rest of the country sample lies in the middle of the spectrum. In summary, Namibian and South African
firms manage to exhibit productivity gains from GVC participation both as sellers and buyers. Firms in
Swaziland, by contrast, appear to face higher hurdles to turn their GVC integration into productivity gains.
This may be symptomatic of the wider problems of low levels of investment and slow productivity growth


                                                     16
in Swaziland. Another possible factor is Swaziland’s almost complete reliance on South Africa, both as a
source of imported inputs and as destination market. By contrast South Africa connects more to global
than to regional value chains, and even Namibia has significantly greater links unto global value chains
and somewhat less reliance on South Africa than does Swaziland. This could potentially impact the nature
of technology and learning that may spill over from GVC integration.

    Our results also support the hypothesis that firm heterogeneity matters in most cases, especially with
regard to import share. In the following, we summarize the general results for the “rest of sample” firms
covering 77 countries (Table 6). It is obvious that higher productivity levels (measured relative to the
median of foreign firms in the sector) are related to higher productivity gains from GVC integration, and
the gains pick up more quickly for firms with higher export shares and imported input shares. Similarly,
higher technology levels are associated with higher productivity gains both from exporting and importing
in GVCs. But while low technology levels don’t increase the productivity gains from imported input share,
their influence on the export share-productivity relationship is slightly positive.

    On the other hand, differences in firm skills, size, and agglomerations all have a similar positive
influence on the relationship between export share and productivity. By contrast, firm heterogeneity with
regard to skills, size, and agglomerations matters for the productivity gains from imported input share.
Firm size in particular seems to be positively related with the productivity gains from imported input
share. Second, while low-skill firms show only weak positive productivity effects from imported input
share, the positive effect becomes somewhat larger for firms with higher skill shares. However,
differences no longer matter much once skill shares exceed 20 percent. Third, firms in large
agglomerations benefit less strongly from importing inputs compared to firms in smaller agglomerations.

    Finally, we examine the role of GVC integration both as a seller and buyer. Interestingly, a medium
import share is more beneficial for the export share-productivity nexus than low or high import shares.
This seems to suggest an inverse U-shaped impact of import share: that is, medium import shares seem
to contain a higher potential for productivity effects than low or high import shares (via backward linkages,
technology spillovers or skills demand, etc.). Low import shares reflect a smaller integration into GVCs and
a lower productivity potential, while large import shares might indicate lacking in-house capabilities.
Different extents of export share, by contrast, do not show any differential effects on the productivity
gains from importing inputs.

    In sum, we find that a lower productivity gap and higher technology levels clearly lead to higher
productivity gains from export share and imported input share. Larger firm size also increases the
productivity effects from imported input share (but not export share). The mediating effect of skills, firm
size, and agglomerations is positive for export share, but firm heterogeneity doesn’t seem to matter here.
Similarly, export share positively moderates the relationship between imported input share and
productivity, but shows no differences across the different categories. Firms with low skill shares and that
are located in large agglomerations, on the other hand, experience smaller productivity gains from
imported input share than alternative types of firms.
