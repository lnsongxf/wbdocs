Executive Summary
In a conflict-affected and newly independent country like South Sudan, rebuilding public
sector capacity is an important aspect of state building, both in the short and in the medium
to long term. If capacity strengthening is not pursued or is ineffective, government functionality
remains patchy and dependency on technical assistants (TA) remains high. While even in a best-
case scenario capacity gains take time, moving in the right direction and accumulating capacity is
crucial for facilitating postconflict development.

Capacity strengthening has been considered amorphous and a difficult topic in academic
literature. Intellectual interest has waned since the late 1980s. Much greater attention has been
focused on policies, and more recently on governance and institutions. Part of the challenge is that
it can be hard to pin down exactly what (public sector) capacity is, how to measure it, and how to
monitor progress. There is also a widespread sense that public sector capacity has not actually
increased in many countries, despite substantial efforts both by governments and by development
partners over several decades.

As part of the increasing engagement of development partners in conflict-affected states,
interest in capacity strengthening is reviving. In postconflict countries, capacity deficits tend to
be particularly stark, giving the issue special urgency. For many countries, achieving the
Sustainable Development Goals will require substantial scaling-up of resources as well as
substantial increases in capacities to use available resources and achieve results.

This paper looks at the experience of efforts to strengthen capacity in South Sudan over the
decade from 2005 to 2016. The context has proved challenging for capacity-building efforts. On
the one hand, some improvements have been seen and some skilled civil servants are in place. On
the other hand, wider progress has been difficult and punctuated by crises and setbacks. Renewed
conflicts from December 2013 to August 2015, and again since July 2016, have disrupted progress
and planning for development support. The report’s recommendations are based on the assumption
that minimum stability will eventually return for capacity strengthening to restart; but it cannot be
predicted when this will be the case.

Conceptual underpinnings
The term ‘capacity building’ refers to a range of objectives from the broadest one of state
building to the specific of training civil servants. State building comprises a range of mutually
reinforcing processes and efforts including establishing a political settlement, public sector
institutions, revenue and expenditure systems, legal frameworks, and systems for provision of
outputs for citizens ranging from basic security to infrastructure to social services. At its heart,
state building requires the government to be able to make credible commitments, and to induce
coordination and enhance cooperation for carrying out key functions (see World Development
                                                                                          1|Pa ge
Report 2017; see also World Development Report 2011 and Fritz and Rocha Menocal 2007). The
civil service, that is, the cadre of staff employed by the government, is both part of the constitutive
domains of the state as well as part of the ‘arms’ of the government for delivering public goods
and services (that is, the output domains or ‘infrastructural powers’).

A common feature across fragile and conflict-affected states is that they rarely move along a
linear and continuous trajectory from conflict to stability. State building is a difficult and
nonlinear process in which periods of achievement are often followed by periods of setback.
International Country Risk Guide (ICRG) indicators show that for the fastest 20 countries to move
to the ‘threshold’ took 20 years for bureaucratic quality.

In the 21st century, public sector capacity building does not take place from scratch: all
inhabited territories have been governed by some form of state, and some form of public sector
staff are employed even in remote areas. Moreover, templates for how a state and a public sector
should function are extensively available, if not always realistic; there is an accumulated
international and regional experience that can be accessed or used for capacity strengthening in a
given postconflict country.
Public sector capacity has a number of key elements, a first of which is individual skills. The
skills of individual civil servants result from the quality of the (primary to tertiary) education that
they have gone through, the quality of selection processes (recruitment), and the expertise
developed while in government (both on the job and through professional development). Only if
the government seeks and is able to attract staff with suitable education and experience will it have
strong individual skills.

Wage and non-wage operating resources and a functional (and safe) working environment
are further essential inputs to overall capacity. Staff need at least a minimally safe and
functional work environment to perform assigned tasks: for example, forms to record transactions,
medical supplies in the health sector, and power and functioning information technology (IT)
systems if these are expected to be used. Typically, some office space and furniture, as well as
storage for archiving documents is also essential. Furthermore, while debates about appropriate
levels of pay are wide ranging and so far inconclusive with regard to the ‘optimal level’, there is
broad agreement that if pay drops below the poverty line or is in arrears, the willingness and ability
of staff to function will suffer.
An ingredient that is essential but less tangible is the motivation and therefore the incentives
to perform. Some civil servants may be strongly mission driven, and there are many examples of
staff who remain dedicated even in highly dysfunctional systems that do not assess or value
performance. Yet, many civil servants are likely to limit their efforts if they perceive that they can
receive pay without actually carrying out their assigned tasks, or do so for only a fraction of the
officially specified working time. In contrast, if politicians and public sector managers convey that
                                                                                            2|Pa ge
public service delivery is urgent, that good performance will be rewarded, and that absenteeism
and poor performance have negative consequences for the individual, then civil servants face an
incentive to do what they can within their given possibilities and constraints of individual skills,
specific guidance, and the operating environment.

In addition to general capacity constraints, there are differences between levels of
government and among sectors. Civil servants at subnational levels often have less education
(length and quality), fewer opportunities for ‘on-the-job’ training or to upgrade their skills, and
fewer operational resources at their disposal. The requisite depth of professional training also
varies significantly by sector and by specific job group—for example, a few months for a junior
tax auditor, two years for a primary school teacher, and five years for a doctor or a civil engineer,
with different costs attached to such training. This is another factor influencing how quickly new
qualified staff may become available, and is often affected (negatively) by the fact that in-country
training institutions are dilapidated or absent and take time to develop after periods of conflict.

Context of capacity-building efforts in South Sudan
The starting point of capacity-strengthening efforts in South Sudan was challenging. At the
postconflict starting point in 2005, socioeconomic indicators were all low, including levels of
education. Formal state institutions were weak or absent. Infrastructure was very limited.
Moreover, the legacies of governance in South Sudan in 2005 were those of Sudan; and Sudan
itself is widely assessed as having some of the weakest governance by regional and global
comparisons.

Nonetheless, the public service did not start from scratch, but rather with tens of thousands
of staff already in post who had been employed either by the Sudanese administration, or by
the South Sudanese rebel forces. According to the 2005 civil service census, at least 32,865 staff
joined the new administration from the Civilian Authority of New Sudan (CANS) and 29,307 from
the Coordinating Council of Southern States (CCSS) side.1 Many existing public sector staff had
received their training in the North (in Arabic) or abroad (in English). The switch in the official
language to English involved some initial capacity loss for those who had been predominantly
trained and worked in Arabic. Furthermore, gender inequality is significant, and this has been
reflected in the composition of the civil service.
While staff were thus inherited from the start, institutional structures and new laws and
regulations only emerged over time. Most ministries started proper functioning only from 2008
onwards. Also, given the uncertainty over South Sudan’s independence, key laws such as the
Public Financial Management and Accountability Act, the National Audit Chamber Act, and the
Civil Service Act were adopted only in 2011. For many of these acts, implementing regulations

                                                                                                         3|Pa ge
were still being prepared as of 2016. Thus, for the past decade, staff and institutions have operated
in an uncertain and fluid regulatory environment, which has been a constraint for using capacity
effectively and for providing in-service training to bring staff together around a common system.

Subsequent recruitment as well as the allocation of positions among existing staff was driven
by considerations related to the political settlement, more than merit. For senior appointments
all the way down to hiring of drivers and cleaners, patronage and loyalty played a role.
Furthermore, public employment functions as a social safety net, as many of those receiving
government salaries support a significant number of dependents. The fastest and most significant
expansion in public employment occurred in the organized and armed forces. The South Sudanese
armed forces grew from an estimated 90,000 in 2005 to about 200,000 in 2015 and the organized
forces from about 30,0002 in 2007 to over 100,000 by 2015. There are also well-qualified staff in
the civil service, but the selection and deployment of well-qualified and performing staff has not
been systematic and has remained far from optimal.

Aid interventions in South Sudan started with a high level of ambition in terms of
coordination and were guided by ‘New Deal’ principles, but rapidly became more
fragmented. Concerns about pooled arrangements, low coordination capacity on the government
side, as well as overoptimistic initial assumptions made it difficult to implement a ‘New Deal’
arrangement in practice. The initial vehicles for directly supporting capacity development were the
‘Skills for Southern Sudan’ program and the Capacity Building Trust Fund (CBTF). The World
Bank-managed Multi-Donor Trust Fund - South Sudan (MDTF-SS) included components
targeting direct contributions to service delivery (building roads, classrooms) and provided capital
funding for refurbishing and equipping key ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs), and
capacity supplementation by hiring consultants for key functional areas. Over time, other partners
such as the European Union (EU), African Development Bank (AfDB), U.K. Department for
International Development (DFID), U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), the
World Bank and others became significantly engaged through individual projects.
Ex post evaluations of capacity-building efforts supported by development partners have
been very critical, especially with regard to (a) a lack of understanding of the severity of the
weaknesses in the context at the outset; (b) fragmentation; (c) a focus on training relative to other
dimensions of capacity; (d) training that has been too short and not well funded; and (e) insufficient
focus on private sector development.3
Efforts toward a more coordinated and effective approach were being made in 2011–2013.
On the government side, this included the development of a South Sudan Development Plan

(SSDP) and an associated Medium-Term Capacity Development Strategy (MTCDS), and on the
side of the development partners considerations about core government functions. However, with
the eruption of renewed conflict in late 2013, these plans were set aside and have not been
systematically implemented.

Cross-cutting issues
The pool of educated citizens from which public sector staff can be recruited continues to be
quite limited, but should be just large enough to allow the recruitment of qualified staff. Basic
literacy stood at 27 percent in 2009 and is likely to have expanded since then. The secondary
enrollment rate was 9.3 percent in 2015. At the tertiary level, enrollment levels in public
universities stood at 11,000 as of 2016, producing less than 3,000 graduates annually. However,
this number is supplemented by those studying abroad as well as by those being trained at teacher
and nursing colleges. Across levels, the quality of education continues to be a significant challenge.
While the number of educated citizens remains limited, good recruitment and deployment
practices could ensure that those with qualifications and experience are brought into the
public sector. The typical size of a civil service relative to population in Low Income Countries
(LIC) and Lower Middle Income Countries (LMICs) is 1–2 percent of the population; legacy
CCSS and CANS staff already accounted for 0.6 percent of the population in 2006.4 So even the
limited pool of secondary school leavers and tertiary graduates should at least be nearly sufficient
if recruitment was well focused on selecting capable candidates. Training bottlenecks are more
acute in the health sector as discussed in Chapter 5, as qualified nurses and doctors were
particularly scarce at the start of the state-building process.

South Sudan has a sizable diaspora, and many families continue to send children abroad to
obtain an education; however, in contrast to some other countries with fragile and conflict-
affected situations (FCS), there has been a reluctance to recruit from the diaspora. The size
of the diaspora is roughly estimated at 500,000. Despite some initial attempts, there have been no
systematic efforts to draw on the diaspora as a potential pool of capable staff.

Gatekeeping functions for recruiting capable staff into the public service have been rather
weak, with some efforts made to strengthen and adequately calibrate them over time.
Initially, a Civil Service Commission (CSC) was established with the intention to build on East
African models, including a gatekeeping role in hiring. However, legal underpinnings and political
commitment were insufficient, and recruitment-related functions were moved in principle to the
Ministry of Labor, Public Service and Human Resource Development in 2008. A Civil Service
Act was adopted only in 2011. Chapter VI of the act sets out key provisions related to recruitment,

 CCSS staff had often received training at Sudanese institutes and universities, as well as at the University of Juba,
founded in 1977 (relocated to Khartoum during the civil war in the 1980s, and back in Juba since 2011).
                                                                                                           5|Pa ge
including a requirement for the Ministry of Public Service to issue a letter of clearance and
appointment (para 33). Implementing regulations and effective institutional arrangements to verify
that rules have been followed still remain under preparation.

Since 2012, a recruitment freeze has been in place in principle, while the decision to create
18 additional states and numerous additional counties triggered a new subnational hiring
wave in 2015–16. While the 2012 hiring freeze was originally intended as a temporary measure
due to the shutdown in oil production, it was subsequently extended due to continued austerity
needs. Exceptional recruitment can be carried out by an ‘austerity committee’, for example, to
decide on the hiring of additional doctors. MDAs also hire staff on temporary contracts who are
then paid from operating budgets, and possibly also from salary payments allocated to ‘ghosts’
that emerged when previous staff left the service. Since the creation of additional states and
counties in October 2015, there has been a new hiring wave at the subnational levels, with limited
monitoring and oversight.5 Moreover, the main focus of such hiring is toward more administrative
staff, as such posts are replicated in each newly created unit, rather than service-delivery-related
staff.6
Despite the widespread and significant problems, it is important to recognize that there has
been some selection of people with relevant skills into the public service. For example,
according to available data, most teachers have at least secondary school degrees and most
accountants have had some form of relevant initial training. The recognition that skills matter and
some efforts in this direction particularly in politically less-sensitive areas offers at least a potential
entry point for stronger efforts to tackle this issue.

Further renewal and skill upgrading have been hindered in recent years by the extended
recruitment freeze on the one hand and the absence of a public sector pension system on the
other hand. Due to the recruitment freeze and the fact that current staff cannot retire on a
government pension, there have been very few opportunities to employ newly qualified staff.7
Constraints to expanding staff numbers have been a particularly difficult issue in the health
sector—which has generally suffered from a lack of prioritization among expenditures.

Several efforts have been and are being made to provide training focused on public sector
management in the country. A challenge is that for such training to be effective, at least a
secondary and typically some prior post-secondary training is required. University of Juba hosts a

  The increasingly small fiscal resources reaching subnational levels may begin to act as a constraint, while
subnational governments can in principle hire staff and then go into salary arrears.
6
  Adding more administrative staff may possibly even be to the detriment of the latter in a context of shrinking
resources.

  Staff hired by Northern Sudan accrued pensions, but payment of these has not yet been fully agreed. Since the
creation of a southern government, pension contributions have been subtracted from salaries; however, those funds
were not saved, but rather used for general expenditures.

School of Management Sciences and since 2014 also a School of Public Service (SPS), offering
master’s-level training. The Ministry of Public Service is seeking to operationalize a Human
Resource Training Center (HRTC) and transform it into a Management Development Institute
(MDI), and the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MOFEP) is seeking to revive the
Government Accountancy Training Center (GATC)—which was first established in the 1970s as
a provincial-level training institution for accountants.

South-South linkages to develop national training institutions as well as to access training
opportunities have already been initiated and could expand further. For the HRTC, the
Ministry of Labor Public Service and Human Resource Development (MoLPSHRD) has
collaborated closely with the Kenya School of Government. The GATC has started being in
contact with the Liberia Financial Management Training Institute. There are also Government-to-
Government agreements for sending students to study at universities in Ethiopia, and a number of
mid-level and senior civil servants have been trained in Kenya.

Beyond the training institutions targeting core government functions and induction training
for civil servants at large, there are a number of relevant sector-specific training institutions.
These include teacher training colleges as well as institutions to train medical professionals such
as nurses, midwives, and doctors. As in other postconflict contexts, the training of physicians poses
a particular challenge, given the rigor and depth of theoretical and practical training required. Some
tertiary institutions (colleges and universities) offer training in other disciplines needed for the
public sector including law, engineering, and others. However, training at these institutions faces
a number of constraints, as is explored in Chapter 5 with regard to the health sector.

The Ministry of Public Service has sought to take a lead in identifying and addressing
training needs; but these efforts still remain in the early stages. A National Curriculum was
first prepared in 2008. Since 2009, at least three larger-scale training needs assessments have been
implemented under the guidance of the MoLPSHRD and funded by development partners. Based
on these, an MTCDS was prepared in 2011. With funding from the AfDB, facilities for the HRTC
have been built outside of Juba. Initial courses have been held with trainers provided by the Kenya
School of Government under a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU). The center is currently
overseen by the Director General for Human Resource Development (HRD) in the ministry;
however, it was looted following the July 2016 conflicts. Other line ministries have made efforts
in their respective sectors. For health, the Ministry of Health has made significant efforts to identify
capacity needs, and has sought to mobilize funds for training with mixed success.
A key problem observed regarding training provided by development partners as well as
regional partners8 is that it is (a) overly short; (b) not sufficiently specific on the rules,

regulations, and processes that civil servants are expected to follow in South Sudan; and (c)
not sustained. This concern has been voiced by the MoLPSHRD as well as by individual
participants in such trainings. The issue is also recognized by some staff and consultants who have
designed training on behalf of development partners. Many courses are held for a few days only.
Furthermore, such training is not sustained and its availability remains solely dependent on
particular funding contracts. The learning materials prepared and used have typically not been
shared with or retained by national institutions.
Essential resources to carry out assigned functions were somewhat adequate at the national
level for main MDAs, but fell below this since 2016 and were inadequate at subnational levels.
Due to its oil wealth, South Sudan started its state-building trajectory with substantial and growing
levels of revenue. However, spending has been concentrated on security functions, and revenue
volatility has been substantial. Especially from 2008 to 2013, efforts were made to roll out manuals
and IT-based systems both at the national and subnational levels. However, due to successive
waves of austerity since 2012, capital expenditures have been very scarce and operational budgets
have become increasingly squeezed. At subnational levels the availability of forms and Internet
connectivity have long been constraints; and at the national and subnational level, access to office
space and transport.

Wage levels were initially rather high, albeit varying over time and employment categories,
but dropped below subsistence level in 2016. Due to initial revenue wealth as well as learning
from neighboring countries, the initial intention was to establish a well-paid but relatively small
civil service, and wage levels were set relatively high in 2007 (World Bank 2015b). However, for
a number of years there was no adjustment of core wages for inflation, followed by the introduction
of various allowances (monthly, housing) and generous per diems for travel benefiting a smaller
group. Pay gaps were still significant for certain employment groups such as nurses relative to pay
provided by international nongovernmental organizations (NGOs). Following the currency
liberalization in December 2015 and hyperinflation triggered by steep fiscal imbalances, the
purchasing power of civil service salaries has dropped below subsistence level in 2016, aggravated
by salary arrears.9 This has a significant negative impact on civil service capacities both in core
and in service delivery functions.
Additionally, as of 2016, operational budgets are also increasingly too tight to allow for
normal functioning. As of mid-2016, even core national MDAs no longer have power most of
the time, and employees largely rely on privately purchased ‘airtime’ to make calls or access the

  The inability and approach of the government in balancing revenue and expenditures is to a significant extent
driven by excessive employment in security functions. As dismissing those staff is considered sensitive, the default
is to erode the value of salaries for all. The fall in the oil price since 2014 combined with rising conflict-related
expenditures led to a deficit of 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) in 2015–2016 and to inflation running at
over 700 percent.
                                                                                                         8|Pa ge
Internet. Institutions newly created by the Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan
(ARCISS) lack even basic office furniture. Even MDAs central to keeping the government ‘alive’,
such as the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MoFEP), have
lacked power to process tax receipts and returns.

Sector-specific capacity challenges and development - Public financial management (PFM)
and health
Capacity for PFM was to a considerable degree inherited from Northern Sudan. A total of
3,096 staff were identified as falling under finance and economic planning in the 2005 public
service survey, of which 2,622 came from the North.
Despite the availability of some staff, formal institutions such as national ministries initially
existed only on paper, and during the early Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) period,
starting in 2005, budgeting and accounting were largely outsourced. The real establishment of
a functioning national Ministry of Finance started from 2008 onwards. As of 2015/16, 375 staff
were employed in central sections of the MoFEP (excluding tax and customs); a further 62210 as
accountants throughout national-level MDAs; and about 3,500 staff in state-level Ministries of
Finance.
The number and qualifications of PFM-related staff at the national level indicate at least
basic capacity.11 In terms of qualifications, at the national level, 66 percent of accounting staff
have tertiary education (diploma level or higher) according to a census undertaken in late 2013.
There is also no obvious ‘missing middle’ in terms of the distribution of staff across grades in the
national Ministry of Finance, although the balance of staff is toward junior grades (grades 9 and
below). At state levels, staffing numbers in Ministries of Finances have been rather high.
However, national capacity to actually operate PFM systems has remained limited, due to a
combination of incentive, organizational, and skills constraints. National staff head the
directorates, but have relied to a significant extent on the remaining TAs as the backbone of the
workforce for key areas (budget, accounts, tax, IT). The number of TAs embedded in the MoFEP
has declined since the re-ignition of conflict in late 2013, but this has only increased ‘self-reliance’
to a limited extent. PFM capacity at subnational levels remained relatively weaker throughout, and
has been negatively affected by the recent fragmentation process.
Political interference and the absence of performance orientation of management appear to
be important contributing factors to weak PFM capacity. Interference frustrates staff seeking

11
  There is no agreed international standard for the volume or level of qualification of PFM-related staff. A World
Bank research effort into staffing numbers at Ministries of Finance indicated an average size of 1,100 (World Bank
2013).
                                                                                                       9|Pa ge
to perform their roles to a professional standard; and staff have also been rotated in what appear to
be retaliatory ways. Expectations and monitoring of performance of staff have remained weak. No
performance system or formal attendance monitoring is in place to date. At the same time, it has
to be noted that a number of staff are committed and are seeking to carry out their functions despite
a difficult and volatile environment.

A National Audit Chamber (NAC) has been created and developed alongside core PFM
functions; its capacity remains nascent. The NAC had about 100 staff on payroll as of 2016,
albeit only three with professional auditing qualifications. Furthermore, its resources to carry out
audits that involve any site visits have remained very limited and dependent on external funding.
Review and follow up on audit findings by the National Legislative Assembly (NLA) has remained
very weak.
In the health sector, the initial cadre was far smaller relative to needs when state building
started in 2005. In 2001, there were less than 2 physicians per 100,000 people, similar to other
postconflict environments such as Liberia and Sierra Leone, but less than in Somalia.12 The total
number of health-related staff inherited from the CCSS and the CANS was 5,900, about equally
split between the two sources. However, this included only about 1,700 nurses and 1,100
‘medics’.13 Thus, while for PFM in principle sufficient staff was available, this clearly was not the
case in the health sector. Unlike other countries where conflict disrupted the health system and
institutions, there was no such system in place before the CPA in South Sudan. During successive
North-South wars in Sudan, health services had been delivered mostly by humanitarian
organizations.

Following independence, the additional number of staff needed in the sector were estimated
at 15,000. This increase would have brought South Sudan slightly closer to international minimum
standards in terms of nurses and doctors per 100,000 population. Capacity strengthening was also
urgently needed for the national- and state-level Ministries of Health to play an effective
coordinating and regulating role. However, this scale-up has not happened, and the strengthening
of management functions only took place to a limited extent. Government budget allocations to
the health sector have decreased and remained extremely low compared to regional and global
levels.

The number of staff positions allocated to the sector has remained constant at the
subnational level and shrunk at the national level in recent years. Government relies on the
assumption that humanitarian and other sources of funding will resource the sector, continuing the
legacies from the pre-CPA period. At the same time, political and administrative elites access

  Based on the 2005 civil service survey. The accuracy of these figures and the specific qualifications cannot be
assured.
                                                                                                   10 | P a g e
government funds or pay privately to seek treatment abroad. The availability of such ‘outsourcing’
and ‘exit’ options limits the incentives to invest in strengthening of the national health system.

Training health sector staff has been challenging. Training institutions are themselves weak and
struggling to find and retain sufficiently qualified teaching staff. The ongoing fiscal crisis has
worsened the situation further by eroding the value of government salaries as well as of the public
scholarships provided to medical students, and by aggravating salary payment arrears.

Rather counterintuitively, it has also been difficult to absorb newly trained national staff into
the public service or (even) into NGOs providing health care. For public health care, the official
hiring freeze since 2012 and irregular salary payments have posed key obstacles for recruiting and
retaining newly trained staff. Initially, ex-soldiers and individuals from local communities were
rapidly (and insufficiently) trained to serve as primary health care workers; as long as budget
allocations and staff ceilings are not increasing, these low-skilled staff continue to occupy
positions and cannot be replaced by those who received longer-term and more in-depth training.
Information flows between medical training institutions and NGOs are poor, limiting awareness
of and the ability to connect to recent graduates available for recruitment. Following independence,
efforts were being made to bring public sector and NGO salaries into closer alignment to facilitate
a transition to public provision; but this has been thrown off track following the devaluation and
hyperinflation, and as of 2016, salaries diverge to an increasing extent (see Figure 5.4 in Chapter
5).
Implications and recommendations
Identify options to cope with a nonlinear state-building process which affects capacity-
strengthening efforts in multiple ways

      Because achieving a political settlement in South Sudan has been and will remain very
       challenging, capacity-strengthening support needs to find (better) ways to bridge periods
       of renewed conflict
The environment is very likely to remain challenging and volatile. Country volatility tends to
reinforce existing tendencies toward fragmentation and stop-go provision of development
assistance. However, to progress, capacity strengthening requires establishing and subsequently
embedding new systems, interlinked classroom-based and on-the-job training, investments in
better primary and secondary education, institutionalizing domestic post-secondary training
institutions, as well as a sequencing of assessing needs, developing strategies, and actually rolling
out training efforts. All of such ‘sequenced’ steps are negatively affected when the funding to
sustain them is too short term, uncertain, or cancelled as new crises erupt. While it will be
impossible to completely avoid volatility in external support to capacity strengthening, more


                                                                                         11 | P a g e
should be done to anticipate and address such volatility. This may also require some agreements
among the international community on how to react to crises.

      Development partners face a dilemma, in that the government has not demonstrated
       commitment to improve governance, but withdrawal of support will further weaken
       institutions

While especially rapid or significant progress is not likely under conditions of limited
commitment, continuation of capacity strengthening and TA support, as well as calibrating
humanitarian assistance in ways that enable rather than undermine national capacity particularly
in the health sector, remains crucial to build gradual progress and to avoid deeper backsliding.
Some assistance can in principle be provided even during periods of heightened insecurity.
Curricula can be developed, externally advised on, and delivered by national staff even during
crisis periods, and discussions on lessons learned organized, even when travel restrictions are in
place.

      Development partners need to ‘up their game’ on coordination efforts, systematic lessons
       learning, and building on previous interventions
Coordination poses tremendous challenges in particular in fragile states. Ministries and
departments are less able to lead on coordination and (nascent) coordination efforts lapse during
periods of renewed crisis. In addition, staff rotations tend to be more frequent for a fragile
environment. For new staff and teams, it can be very challenging to access what has been done to
date, who has benefited and what are lessons learned, previously developed plans for further work,
and so on. Development partners can do much more to accessibly document and share (a) what
has been done and with what effects; (b) lessons learned; and (c) materials developed—plans,
curricula, training content, and so on.

      Prioritizing funding in a situation of deep austerity in the short and medium term while
       seeking to keep sight of longer-term goals

Development partners have significantly less resources available than during the CPA period
and the government is facing extreme austerity in the short and medium term. In this context,
it will be easy to become exclusively focused on near-term priorities rather than continue to foster
investments in the building blocks of a more capable state. But maintaining (also) a longer-term
view of what steps need to be initiated or continued to not be in the same place in 10 or 20 years
remains crucial. This includes considering how to prioritize between different capacity
‘ingredients’ as set out—wages, training, operating funds, enabling retirement, as well as
additional hiring for service delivery functions.



                                                                                        12 | P a g e
Training on its own cannot deliver results—civil service reforms need to be brought into the
policy dialogue, while recognizing that simple ‘best practice’ approaches will not work

      Civil service reforms are difficult but critical and should receive greater attention in the
       policy dialogue and development efforts

Improving who is being recruited into government core and service delivery functions,
ensuring that basic incentives to perform are in place, and stabilizing salary payments are
essential elements of improving state capacity in a conflict-affected country such as South
Sudan. Accordingly, these issues should receive more central attention both in the policy dialogue
and in the programming of specific operational engagements.

In contrast to the provision of training, civil service reforms tend to go ‘against the grain’ of
government incentives, and hence there is also less demand from the government side.
However, development partners can be much clearer in their dialogue that one is not useful without
the other. Given that wholesale civil service reforms have been recognized as rarely successful, a
potentially feasible approach to explore is to focus on specific sectors and government and service
delivery tasks. Highlighting positive experiences from other countries may also be useful.

Training isn’t everything, but significantly more could be done to strengthen its quality and
impact

      Reconsider the design of training efforts
Training investments funded by development partners can be improved on a number of
dimensions: investing more in institutionalizing training (and certification where relevant) and
less in ad hoc and one-off efforts; making training more specific to the day-to-day tasks officials
are expected to undertake, including usage of national rules and regulations, training on existing
IT systems, and so on; and a better linking of organized/classroom-based training and the provision
of ‘hand-holding’ assistance through TAs, including through ensuring that TAs are aware of what
training efforts are being made for staff in the units where they are posted. As set out above,
moving in this direction also requires improved access to lessons learned and to basic data
on what previous training has been carried out and who has benefited among development
partners.

      Especially for shorter-term training, it is important to focus on specific skills that are
       needed and immediately usable on the job, and to select staff with ‘upgradable’ existing
       skills and performance

For those short-term training efforts that continue, it is important to focus on specific skills
that are needed and immediately usable on the job. Given the low levels of individual capacity
coupled with the limited training budgetary allocation as noted in the findings, it would be
                                                                                       13 | P a g e
advisable to focus on developing skills directly relevant to delivering on the job, through
appropriate combinations of classroom-based and on-the-job training.

      Considering cost-benefit tradeoffs between national and foreign training, invest in
       strengthening domestic training institutions

There need to be some decisions about what training can best be provided in country and
what training should be sought abroad, and to invest in the strengthening of domestic
training institutions, drawing also on regional and international linkages. Once training best
provided in the country has been identified, it is important to invest in domestic training
institutions, including those geared to meeting sector needs for a future workforce such as the
universities’ specialized colleges, training colleges for medical and educational staff, the
University of Juba SPS, GATC, and HRTC. Developing and reviving these local institutions
creates a stronger foundation for continuous capacity, and once initial progress has been made, it
also provides some buffer, for example, against reductions of TAs due to renewed crises.

      Development partners should consider provision of co-funding to and coordination with
       existing South-South collaboration which largely has run on ‘parallel tracks’ to training
       efforts sponsored by development partners and is more cost-effective than other modalities
Several MDAs have concluded MoUs with various regional countries and further afield to send
staff for longer-term training, and some of the envisaged training was implemented successfully.
However, development partner efforts have largely been pursued separate from these types of
initiatives. There is scope to provide additional funding to regional teaching staff to come to South
Sudan to provide training, as well as to efforts of sending South Sudanese to regional institutions
on government initiatives, with a strong pull for such staff to return and assume positions in the
public sector.
At the same time, not all South-South collaboration has worked equally well. Again, documenting
and sharing lessons learned among those providing capacity-strengthening support—as outlined
above—is crucial to ensure that the South-South potential can be used to the best effect.
Connecting the dots between training and overall development interventions in sectors

      Make TAs and NGOs more fully part of capacity-strengthening efforts
Technical Assistants and international NGOs can make important contributions to capacity-
strengthening efforts, but this potential has not been fully utilized. TAs often have a very close
knowledge of ‘who can do what’ in a given ministry, as well as of the specific training needs that
exist. Moreover, some TA providers and NGO staff have been far longer in the country than the
staff of development agencies. This inside knowledge can be utilized more fully in the design of
capacity-strengthening efforts. For the health sector, international NGOs that receive donor
                                                                                         14 | P a g e
funding to deliver health services could take on newly trained national staff for further practical
training, for example, for 6–24 months. This could make a significant contribution to upgrading
the practical skills of national medical staff.

      Better connecting training efforts and other investments
Staff who receive training need a functional working environment to actually use new or
improved skills. Government and development partners need to jointly commit to ensuring that
staff have at least basic equipment, such as desks, chairs, paper forms, or IT equipment, power,
and water (especially in hospitals, and at least water in health posts), and basic pharmaceuticals
and medical supplies in the health sector. Ideally, the availability of such basic inputs should be
part of the joint information collection and monitoring efforts about the ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘with
what effects’ of capacity-strengthening efforts. This requires effectively linking capacity-
strengthening efforts with overall development efforts made in a particular sector.
Improved monitoring and evaluation of capacity-building efforts is critical

      There is a dearth of information on who has been trained in what; the quality and impact
       of training received; how classroom learning has been coordinated with other avenues for
       capacity building; and the overall contribution to effectiveness.

Better information is an essential basis for knowing what was done, assessing what works,
and improving on practical challenges such as matching newly trained staff or staff who have
upgraded their skills with recruitment or promotion opportunities. Keeping track of relevant
training efforts will need to be done sector by sector, but must move beyond being ‘within projects’
only. Monitoring efforts will need to be as simple as possible, matched to the incentives and
institutional capabilities on the ground.

To provide aggregate monitoring and to coordinate and channel external support, it would
be beneficial to have a stronger hub in the MoLPSHRD. In principle, the MoLPSHRD’s
directorate for HRD has this responsibility, but it has been a rather weak directorate in recent years.
The MoLPSHRD overall also has potentially an important role to play in linking capacity-
strengthening efforts and pursuing reforms of the civil service which are crucial for capacity
strengthening to have an impact.

Further sector-specific recommendations are reflected in Chapter 6 (in particular for the health
sector).

1.     Purpose, Scope, and Approach
1.      This report was developed in the first half of 2016, when the signing of the Agreement
on the Resolution of Conflict in South Sudan (ARCISS) and subsequent establishment of the
Transitional Government of National Unity (TGNU) presented a possible window of
opportunity to restart and ‘reset’ state-building efforts, in particular, to initiate a more strategic
approach to capacity building. From the government side, it was possible incentives would emerge
to signal a break with the past by delivering services to citizens. Further, the ongoing macro-fiscal
crisis held potential for creating incentives to improve the management of public resources by
addressing capacity constraints across tiers of the government. For development partners, it
provided an entry point for better coordination and alignment of capacity-building support in areas
already gaining traction in the country.
2.      In this context, the main objective of the note has been to contribute a stronger
evidence base for renewed efforts at supporting capacity building. While at the ‘big-picture’
level, capacity constraints in South Sudan are reasonably well understood, a more detailed analysis
was needed to guide (a) future interventions with regard to needs, as well as feasibility and
robustness to governance constraints and (b) efforts to better monitor what is being achieved.

3.      Despite the renewed deterioration since mid-2016, it is expected that many of the key
challenges and tensions analyzed will remain important considerations when capacity-
building efforts are eventually renewed. Since the completion of this report, South Sudan has
faced renewed conflict and a deepening macro-fiscal crisis. Shortly after the formation of the
TGNU in late May 2016, fighting broke out in Juba and the security situation in the rest of the
country has subsequently deteriorated. With regard to scope, this note mainly covers the period
until June 2016, as a contribution to providing a more nuanced understanding of efforts at capacity
building in South Sudan.

4.      A second objective of this analysis is to propose a better monitoring framework for
capacity-building efforts. Over the past decade, development partners (including the World Bank
Group) and the government have been mutually frustrated about the slow and uncertain progress
in capacity development. One important task ahead will therefore be to develop stronger
monitoring not only of individual interventions, but also of overall outcomes and impacts of
capacity-development efforts. The intention would be to better track the progress being made, and
potentially to propose a system for regularly exploring underlying reasons for progress or lack
thereof in identified key areas. This would contribute to a more evidence-based ongoing dialogue
and better targeting of interventions.

5.     With regard to scope, this note is primarily concerned with capacity in the civilian
public service in South Sudan, and its ability to deliver public services. The note explores

                                                                                          16 | P a g e
cross-cutting issues and challenges related to developing a capable and effective civil service and
drills down into two specific areas: public financial management (PFM) and the public health
sector. Given that development of institutional capacity is embedded in the wider processes of
state building, the report highlights areas in which the overall state-building trajectory in South
Sudan has created opportunities or constraints.

6.       As discussed further in Chapter 2, public sector capacity emerges from a range of
factors that jointly shape civil servants’ ability and incentives to perform. Critically, the
success reforms tackling any of these factors depends in part on the quality of the specific
intervention, as well as whether or not other factors are also moving toward greater capacity. This
note specifically addresses the following subset of factors shaping capacity building: the
availability of key skills in South Sudan, the way recruitment decisions have shaped how these
skills are absorbed into the public; the availability of essential resources (buildings, transportation,
information technology [IT] systems and supplies, as well as relevant policies manuals and forms);
and civil servants’ opportunities for training and learning (on the job as well as classroom based).

1.1 Data and information used and caveats
7.      The report draws on the following main sources: For the empirical chapters it draws on
primary data and information, including laws, government strategies and policies, national and
state-level budgets, and data from the electronic payroll system, existing reports and data analysis,
in particular the 2005 survey of civil servants, and the December 2013 census of accountants;
evaluation reports addressing interventions aiming to strengthen capacity in South Sudan, as well
as interviews with government officials, staff at training institutes, technical assistants (TAs),
representatives of development partners, and other relevant interlocutors. For the conceptual
underpinnings set out in Chapter 2, the report draws on key items from the relevant literature on
state building, political settlements, public sector reforms, and capacity development, and on
pertinent recent research carried out by several of the contributors to this note.

8.      The report combines an analysis of the opportunities and constraints created by the
evolving country context; cross-cutting factors which have shaped core public
administration functions across sectors since 2005; and analysis of capacity in two selected
state functions—PFM and health care. The sectors were selected to provide a more detailed
understanding of how capacity constraints concretely play out in functional areas. PFM is a core
government function, and health services are a key social service which the government is
expected to regulate and aspires to deliver. While these two selected functions have some
representativeness also for other core and service delivery functions, it is important to keep in mind
that there are important specifics within each function (between health and education, for
example). The coverage of specific functions is necessarily selective; but similar sector-specific
‘drill-downs’ could be replicated for other state functions if and when needed.
                                                                                           17 | P a g e
9.       There are several important caveats. One is that no visits to subnational levels were
possible during the period when this report was developed. The team has sought to use available
sources of information on subnational levels, in particular, budget documents, existing analyses of
institutional arrangements, as well as information from TAs and government staff who travel to
subnational levels as part of their duties.
10.     A second caveat is that data are limited, patchy, and not in all cases reliable. For
example, data on adult literacy rates is still only available for 2008; there are important differences
between staff numbers as reflected in the electronic payroll system and in annual budgets
(including less as well as more staff for specific functions); and in the absence of a monitoring
system, it has been challenging to establish who has been trained in which functions in recent
years. Achieving a clear picture of the number and qualifications of public sector employees in
South Sudan is difficult. Generally, more information exists regarding the composition of the
civilian civil service as compared to the organized forces and national security sector. Yet, the
most recent civil service census was carried out over 10 years ago in 2005. Annual budgets contain
detailed staffing numbers, but these capture the number of ‘allowed positions’, or nominal rolls,
rather than the actual number of staff. While noting these constraints, it remains important to utilize
existing data with an understanding that they provide approximations more than precise
measurement, as a way to establish as strong an empirical basis for the assessment as possible.
11.    The main empirical work for the report was carried out between November 2015 and May
2016, and reflects data and information available and accessible at this time. As discussed above,
renewed conflict in South Sudan has contributed to a deterioration in overall state capacity.
12.      The rest of this note proceeds as follows: Chapter 2 covers the conceptual underpinnings
of the paper. Chapter 3 provides a cross-cutting perspective on capacity-building efforts in South
Sudan, providing an overview of public sector as a tool for the management of political support,
as well as the evolution of aid architecture. After describing the composition of the civil service,
the chapter then discusses (a) the availability of key skills, (b) recruitment practices, (c) adequacy
of wages and availability of essential resources to carry out key functions, and (d) opportunities
for training and learning. Chapter 4 covers PFM in South Sudan and Chapter 5 addresses the health
sector. Chapter 6 reviews key findings and emerging lessons and concludes with recommendations
and options for improving monitoring of capacity-building efforts going forward.

   2. Conceptual Underpinnings and Methodology
13.    The term ‘capacity building’ is often used to refer to a wide range of objectives from
state building to training civil servants. This note is primarily concerned with building the
capacity of public sector to carry out core functions and deliver services to citizens. Yet as
discussed below, the development of an effective public sector is embedded in wider processes of

                                                                                          18 | P a g e
state building—both feeding into the legitimacy of the state and also being shaped by the political
settlement. As set out in the forthcoming WDR 2017, state capacity is the ability of the government
to enable credible commitment, induce coordination, and enhance cooperation to carry out a set of
functions. It is widely agreed that these functions include the provision of security, delivery of
public goods, and generation of political legitimacy.14 States which cannot deliver in these areas
are often considered to be fragile or failed, and to have weak capacity.

14.     Beyond this, there is a wide range of thinking about the desirable and realistic scope
of government functions.15 This originates in part from ideological debates about the ideal size
and scope of government, as well as from historical and practical considerations about what is
feasible in a given country context.16

15.    Some states may choose to directly deliver basic services such as health, education,
water, or electricity. Others may choose (or need) to outsource delivery to nongovernmental
organizations (NGOs), humanitarian organizations, or the private sector—in which case the state
takes on the role of managing, regulating, and monitoring providers.

16.     Similarly, certain ‘core’ functions such as financial management or accounting can
be contracted out, carried out directly by civil servants, or involve a mix of civil servants and
TAs. As set out by OECD (2008a), in nearly all contexts, states requires a minimum level of
administrative capacity (that is, to operate central ministries, carry out policy making, and
oversight), including a ‘reasonably well functioning civil service and public management system
and the ability to raise funds, particularly through taxation.’ A recent United Nations (UN)-World
Bank report, Rebuilding Core Government Functions in the Immediate Aftermath of Conflict,
identified specific areas in which minimal functionality should be prioritized in fragile and
conflict-affected contexts. These include executive decision making and coordination at the center
of government; public revenue and expenditure management; government employment and public
administration; local governance; aid management; and security.

17.     A key consideration is that capacity building is both a ‘technical’ and a ‘political’
challenge. As highlighted by Fukuyama (2011), the presence of an impersonal bureaucracy
composed of civil servants who can design policies based on evidence and implement them
according to rules rather than personal, political, or family connections is a key element of an
effective civil service. This is difficult to achieve in postconflict contexts in which formal and
informal arrangements that allocate public jobs and resources are typically designed with attention


14
   Brinkerhoff 2010. Fritz and Rocha Menocal (2007), sets out that state functions are divided between an ‘internal
domain’ concerned with management of public resources and staff, as well as ‘output domains’ which concerns the
delivery of tangible outputs to citizens (that is, security, social services, public infrastructure).

to continued stability, while the gradual establishment of rule-bound systems to manage public
finances and deliver public goods is often a secondary goal. Government agencies may be divided
between previously warring parties as part of a peace agreement17 and pressure may exist to recruit
staff based on security or patronage considerations rather than technical qualifications.18



 Box 2.1. Priority Areas for Capacity Building in Postconflict Countries
         Human capacity: Civil servants may have been displaced or have emigrated to safety; basic and advanced
          training facilities may be destroyed; and in many cases, institutional memory lost through the destruction
          of data. Cross-government personal and functional relationships that are critical to the functioning of state
          agencies may have been disrupted. Trauma and uncertainty prevail, and are a hidden part of the legacy of
          conflict that affects people at all levels.

         Institutional and organizational capacity: Almost all postconflict countries possessed central institutions
          prior to the conflict, and in many cases core systems, particularly centralized systems, may have remained
          largely unaffected by violence itself. Nevertheless, peace agreements or changes to basic law may bring
          into question their relevance or validity. It is important to understand what institutional legacy remains,
          while also understanding where specific commitments have been made in peace agreements to reform
          systems of the past.

         Physical infrastructure: The destruction of government buildings and equipment can prevent public
          agencies from being reestablished. The loss of transport and communication networks may isolate
          particular regions and limit the extension of the state. The degree of destruction has varied widely.

18.     At the same time, in low-income or fragile environments, many of the ‘inputs’ for an
effective state are absent (see figure 2.1). There is often a dearth of qualified staff, especially in
environments with low human development, where education systems have been eroded because
of prolonged conflict, and experienced civil servants have left their posts due to security
conditions. Qualified staff may be particularly hard to find for positions outside of main urban
centers, and particularly in areas where violence was concentrated during the conflict.19 Further,
there are likely to be gaps in formal laws, policies, or regulations that guide staff in the performance
of their duties; and infrastructure (roads, buildings, IT systems) may be damaged or destroyed.


17
   As in the case of Liberia in 2003 or South Sudan in 2015.
18
   Countries with very low literacy and numeracy can make this particularly problematic as compared to contexts
with an overall more educated workforce. When meritocratic recruitment cannot be relied on to select the most
qualified, it helps to have a much wider pool of qualified citizens from which to draw.
19
   With regard to capacity, there are a range of situations. Some countries emerging from war were previously states
and had relatively developed administrative systems. Others emerge from conflict as new states (that is, Kosovo,
Timor, and South Sudan). Levels of development prior to and after conflict can also vary (for example, Iraq as
compared to Liberia).
                                                                                                          20 | P a g e
19.      Approaches to capacity building have often focused on the missing ‘inputs’ to
capacity, providing training for individual civil servants, putting in place necessary infrastructure
for staff to carry out their assigned function (that is, providing IT equipment) and placing technical
assistance in key ministries to transfer skills. A key challenge has been that these efforts can fall
short of expectations when they are not aligned with incentives to develop a more effective public
sector or do not sufficiently navigate the wider political economy context (see forthcoming WDR
2017).
20.     A related issue is that some development partners, TAs, and local policy makers have
approached public sector challenges as something that can be addressed through training in
relative isolation from other interventions. Even when such interventions are well aligned with
the state-building trajectory, public sector capacity emerges from the interaction of a range of
factors which jointly shape civil servants’ ability to perform. These mechanisms include the
availability of key skills and overall quality of the pool of potential civil servants; recruitment
practices, and decisions about who from the general pool of potential civil servants applies to and
is selected into the public service; the relative experience of public employees and performance
incentives; and the opportunities for training and learning ranging from on-the-job mentoring to
classroom-based. These factors are laid out in stylized form in Figure 2.2 and summarized in
Annex 1. Critically, the success of reforms in any of these areas depends in part on the quality of
the specific intervention, as well as whether or not other mechanisms are also jointly moving
toward greater capacity (McCourt and Eldridge 2003).

          These factors are located within, influence and are influenced by the overall state-building trajectory including:
          (a) security and political context and prevailing ideology; (b) incentives and examples set by decision makers; (c)
          prevalence, characteristics, and impact of a donor-funded ‘parallel public service’.
Source: Adapted from Fritz and Ort (2016).

21.     An additional consideration is that capacity-building initiatives often attempt to
transplant blueprint institutional models or to influence institutional ‘forms’ rather than
functions. As highlighted by Andrews and Pritchett (2012) and in the WDR 2017, a gap often
emerges between formal organizational models and the functions they carry out. A police force
may have the uniforms and equipment that make it appear similar to those providing public
security in many countries, but in practice it may be a mechanism for collecting bribes. A civil
service may in principle be established to deliver services to citizens, but in practice acts as a social
safety net in lieu of other such systems. Conversely, just because a Ministry of Finance or of Public
Service has not adopted the best systems and models does not always mean it is not effectively or
efficiently managing resources. Typically, it is easier to influence organizational forms than
functions, especially for external actors—including development of bills, strategic plans,
organograms, regulations, master curricula, and so on. Though in some cases these are necessary
perquisites to moving ahead with capacity building, they are not sufficient conditions to influence
the effectiveness or function of the organization.

2.1 Capacity in the context of conflict and fragility
22.     Rebuilding public sector capacity is a key priority in low-income and fragile contexts.
As set out in the 2011 WDR on Conflict, Security, and Development, there is a mutually
reinforcing relationship between transformation of institutions and restoring confidence in the
state. To do so requires that the government is able to function and deliver tangible outputs
(policing, rebuilding infrastructure, organizing service delivery) (OECD 2010). As set out by
Brinkerhoff (2010), capacity building in fragile and non-fragile contexts share a number of
similarities (see Figure 2.3), but there are also importance differences. These include the pressure
to rapidly restore services and security, a typically more limited skills base on which to build, and
a hyper-politicized environment.
23.      In the 21st century, public sector capacity building does not take place from scratch:
all inhabited territories have been governed by some form of state, and some form of public sector
staff are employed even in remote areas. Moreover, templates for how a state and a public sector
should function are extensively available, if not always realistic; and there is an accumulated
international and regional experience that can be accessed or used for capacity strengthening in a
given postconflict country. As is discussed further in Chapter 3, South Sudan’s initial capacity and
institutional legacies were inherited from Sudan. Similar to other recent new states such as Kosovo
and Timor-Leste, South Sudan had been a relatively neglected and backward region within larger
Sudan, and the region had experienced decades of civil war, but some form of administration still
existed especially in the main urban centers. Structures created by the South Sudanese rebel forces
were another legacy that affected the state-, institution-, and capacity-building processes at the
outset of the post-Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) period.

24.     While fragile states vary in their level of economic development and the nature of
violence faced, a common feature across this diverse group of countries is that they rarely
move along a linear trajectory from conflict to stability (Brinkerhoff 2010). Countries which
experience conflict face a high risk of renewed violence; Collier et al. (2003) finds the risk to be
at 40 percent within 5 years (Collier et al. 2003). As OECD (2008a) describes, capacity “is worked
out over the long term, although attention is often focused on its short-term characteristics. State
building is a difficult and nonlinear process in which periods of achievement are followed by
periods of set-back” (OECD 2008a, 22). While gains in capacity can be achieved, moving toward
greater state capacity is a long-term process characterized by distortions and setbacks. International
Country Risk Guide (ICRG) indicators show that for the fastest 20 countries to move to the
‘threshold’ took 20 years for bureaucratic quality (see figure 2.2).
25.     The political settlement and the incentives it creates for leadership is a foundational
factor influencing postconflict trajectories Sitting at the heart of the state and state-society
interface, political settlement can remain fragile and is affected by incentives such as asserting
power or coopting groups that threaten violence (WDR 2011; Rocha Menocal 2015; North, Wallis,
and Weingast 2009, 2013). Some postconflict countries have seen the emergence of leadership
pursuing improvements in governance and economic growth. While typically still far from perfect
and facing various constraints, tangible state-building progress can be observed in such countries
within time horizons of 10–15 years. Available cross-country analysis (World Bank 2012) suggests
that the quality of leadership and leadership incentives linked to the political settlement and other
wider goals (such as seeking external support) are decisive for the degree to which public sector
rebuilding is likely to progress.
26.     While postconflict periods offer the possibility to break with legacies of the past, at
least some legacies typically continue to linger. With regard to ‘breaking with the past’, Kosovo
and Timor-Leste introduced completely new laws modeled on international standards, rather than

                                                                                                    24 | P a g e
continuing existing legal traditions from Serbia and Indonesia, respectively; Rwanda and South
Sudan changed their official languages in their respective postwar periods. Yet preconflict legacies
continue to influence the postconflict period, and prior systems of governance shape the evolution
of the public sector as countries emerge out of conflict. For example, Srivastava and Blum
(forthcoming, 5) find that over time, the public sectors of five very diverse postconflict countries
each “converged toward their distinct pre-conflict sizes and administrative traditions.”

27.      An additional feature of fragile states has to do with the design, management, and
gradual phasing out of ‘parallel systems’. A large number of actors engage in the aftermath of
conflict; given the uncertainty and urgency, the attention of humanitarian and development
partners tends to be on getting service delivery up and running. As a result, TAs or service
providers are often put in place for core management, fiduciary, and also service delivery
functions. In many cases, the long-term objectives is to scale down capacity substitution, yet
experience shows that transfer of knowledge and skills is typically challenging for numerous
reasons. Even those TAs explicitly brought in to advise, mentor, and coach may find difficult to
resist stepping in to directly address day-to-day urgencies. They may face contradictory incentives,
as the more coaching and training of local public servants they do, the less their own continued
presence will prove necessary.

28.     The effects of these parallel structures are complex and vary between countries as
well as within countries across sectors; yet generally they (a) create a dual market for (quasi-
public) employment and (b) create challenges with regard to sustainability, transitioning to a
regular public service, and impacts on longer-term national institutional development (Blum and
Srivastava, forthcoming). The importance of these issues has been highlighted in South Sudan by
the sudden withdrawal of TAs supporting core government functions in 2013–2014, as well as the
challenges associated with developing a more country-led health sector, as discussed in this note.
29.      Finally, in fragile states, subnational capacity poses a particular challenge. Typically
(in any context) capacity is more constrained at subnational levels and can be a significant
constraint to ‘getting things back up and running’ especially for frontline service delivery which
predominantly takes place at the local level. Many with the right skills to serve in the government
are attracted to posts in the capital or main urban centers. Finding civil servants willing to live and
work in rural areas with often limited services and (basic) infrastructure or still facing security
issues can be a challenge. Other factors, such as whether it is considered possible to be employed
in a district with a different language or ethnicity also play a role and limit the pool of potential
staff. Providing training or technical assistance to staff in rural areas is also particularly
challenging, as it involves additional costs for bringing staff to the capital or trainers out to rural
areas. Further, resources to carry out assigned functions such as administrative buildings,
availability of power or Internet, and roads connecting regional to local cities are typically limited.

                                                                                          25 | P a g e
2.2 Public financial management in the aftermath of conflict
30.     PFM is a ‘core’ capacity of the state; management of revenue and expenditures is
comparable to the heart pumping blood through the body and as such is essential for all other
functions. The management of public funds needs to happen jointly with policy directions, and to
be linked to actual execution capacity of staff. Capacity for PFM itself poses a challenge in
postconflict environments, while typically preexisting in some shape or form. Preparing
meaningful budgets, and executing and recording expenditures are challenging functions that
require specialized training and experience in various roles. However, since the staff numbers
required especially in central functions are limited, development assistance is often directed at
providing TAs who may be national, regional, or international as a way to supplement or ‘short-
circuit’ constraints (World Bank 2012). While this is feasible at the national level, it is often more
difficult to also use as a strategy at subnational levels. A further key problem is that PFM-related
staff can be particularly exposed to tensions between professional ethics and political directives,
for example, what payments to authorize or to prioritize.

31.     With regard to training, there can be several key issues: staff have to learn new skills
and concepts, the government needs to ensure that staff are familiar with the new laws and
regulations being issued, and that incentives are (at least broadly) in line with formal rules
rather than the reverse. Operating new IT systems requires pertinent training as well as new
capacities to maintain and upgrade systems (or to outsource such services effectively). Arriving at
sufficient capacity for PFM typically requires training for existing staff as well as of new recruits,
across levels of the government. Furthermore, all such efforts will only feed into good enough
PFM systems if decision makers refrain from excessive abuse.

2.3 Restoring and rebuilding health systems in fragile contexts
32.     In the health sector, postconflict key challenges are usually centered around
transitioning away from a system exclusively reliant on humanitarian organizations with
extensive use of foreign workers. Conflict is usually associated with the displacement of local
medical personnel, destruction of facilities, high logistical costs, high reliance on donor funding
and humanitarian NGOs, and coordination challenges between donors, NGOs, and the
government. Attention and resources are focused on responding to short-term humanitarian needs
rather than building local capacity and systems. In South Sudan, recurrent conflicts disrupted the
development of a strong health system and thus currently, the challenge is to continue building
(not properly restoring) the capacity of the system as a whole to deliver health services to citizens
in terms of availability, accessibility (physical and financial), and quality.
33.    Developing health systems requires substantial numbers of medical (such as doctors,
nurses, midwives, laboratory technicians) and non-medical personnel (administrative staff,

                                                                                          26 | P a g e
monitoring and evaluation [M&E] specialists, logisticians, accountants, guards, cleaners, and so
on). The ability to train new workers rapidly (availability of qualified tutors, training facilities,
financial resources, and inputs) and call on the diaspora and expatriated skilled workers to fill the
gaps define to a greater extent the time required to achieve a relatively well-staffed health system.
A particular challenge for the health sector is that the number of staff needed is relatively large,
training is relatively complex and time-consuming, and staff has to be deployed across the entire
territory if it is to serve citizens effectively and equitably. There is a need to continuously provide
supplies (pharmaceuticals and other medical supplies) and ensure staff complementarity for such
staff to be able to carry out their functions.

     3. Key Cross-Cutting Capacity Challenges in the Public Service
34.     This chapter discusses the mechanisms jointly influencing civil service capacity and
frames the tensions faced by stakeholders when trying to move the public sector toward
greater effectiveness. It provides a snapshot of the contextual factors and legacies that shape
capacity-building efforts in South Sudan, including the use of the public sector as a mechanism for
managing political support and the evolving aid architecture since 2005. It then provides a brief
overview of the size of the civil service, distribution of civil servants between sectors, and civil
servants’ qualifications and professional experience. Finally, the chapter explores several cross-
cutting issues related to public sector capacity including education outcomes, recruitment
processes, and the availability of essential resources to carry out assigned functions, and efforts to
strengthen the skills of existing civil servants.

3.1 Country context: Overall dynamics and constraints20
35.      In 2005, South Sudan emerged from a long civil war with a history of relative isolation
and limited experience with governance through state institutions. State and capacity building
did not start from scratch as South Sudan had been governed through the administrative structures
of Sudan, but capacities were patchy, affected by the long conflict with the North, and included
legacies of poor governance. Some administrative structures existed in particular in the main
‘garrison towns’ controlled by the North, Juba, Yei, Malakal, and Wau, while more ad hoc
institutions and staffing had been established in the rebel-controlled areas. The process of
integrating these two groups into a postwar public service is analyzed in World Bank (2015b and
2015c).




20
  A deeper exploration of the historical-institutional, socioeconomic, and political economy context can be found in
two recent World Bank reports covering human resource management and intergovernmental arrangements in South
Sudan (World Bank 2015a, 2015b). More detailed analysis corresponding to the following sections can be found in
this report’s annexes.
                                                                                                      27 | P a g e
36.      Indicators reflecting public sector effectiveness for South Sudan are only available from
independence (2011) onward and indicate a performance well below regional comparators (see
Figure 3.1 and Figure 3.2) and a declining rather than improving performance over time. The
comparison with other postconflict countries indicates that South Sudan performs below these,
that is, its performance thus far is worse than what would be expected solely as a consequence of
conflict.

37.     While not documented through indicators, some initial gains in state capacity are
widely perceived to have been made during the initial years from 2005 to 2013, mixed with
significant distortions. During this period, national and subnational institutions were developed,
rules approved, and staff hired. This period of institution building benefitted from windfall oil
revenues as well as a strong influx of development aid as discussed in the following paragraphs.
Key distortions included non-merit-based hiring and the beginning of pervasive corruption also
fueled by windfall resources.

38.     Since 2012, South Sudan has experienced multiple shocks, which have stressed fragile
and still nascent institutions. This included a political decision to shut down oil production for
15 months from January 2012 onward, triggering a first fiscal crunch. After a radical restructuring
of the Cabinet in mid-2013, the political situation became increasingly tense. A full-scale conflict
re-erupted in late 2013. Despite a peace agreement reached in August 2015, the country has not
returned to peace. The fiscal situation has deteriorated since mid-2014 due to the steep decline of
oil prices, with a full-scale macro-fiscal crisis taking shape since early 2016 that remains
unresolved.

39.     Frequent violence has remained a feature of life in South Sudan. Rent-seeking
rebellions and intercommunal violence (such as cattle raiding) continued to characterize daily life
for many citizens, even before the outbreak of civil conflict in December 2013. The signing of the
Agreement on the Resolution of Conflict in the Republic of South Sudan (ARCISS) in August
2015 formally brought renewed peace, but armed conflict between groups continued. The country
fell back into conflict in July 2016. Worsening economic conditions and delayed salary payments
to the security sector, along with the proliferation of small arms and the increasing number of
armed groups, compound this.

40.    The macro-fiscal context has been volatile, with initially high, especially since mid-
2014, increasingly constrained government revenue, linked to reliance on oil. At
independence, public expenditure reached levels well above the East African region: over US$300
per capita, as compared to US$100 or less in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and
Ethiopia. However, oil revenue declined with the shutdown in production during FY12/13 and
again as a result of the civil conflict and falling oil prices in the subsequent years. The fiscal deficit
reached a staggering 40 percent of gross domestic product (GDP) for FY15/16.21

41.     The ability to translate initially abundant resources into development outcomes has
been low. The country has an estimated population of 12.5 million.22 As of mid-2016, nearly 74
percent of the population lives below the poverty line, worsening by over 20 percent compared to
previous years.23 The recent civil conflict disrupted livelihoods and the functioning of markets
leaving nearly 25 percent of the population in urgent need of food assistance.24 Development
indicators have remained low and are likely to have deteriorated again since 2014 (see also section
3.2 on education as an input to capacity and section 5 on the health sector). As is discussed further
in sections 4 and 5 on PFM and health sector capacities, there have been bits and pieces of potential
and of progress, but overall capacity remained weak, both due to poor leadership and management
and fragmented external support.

3.1.1 The public sector and management of political support in South Sudan

42.      A key challenge in South Sudan has been a tension between supporting the political
settlement, on the one hand, and fostering merit, effectiveness, and efficiency in the public
sector, on the other hand. Public sector employment—both in the civilian and the security
sectors—has been a mechanism for incorporating powerful stakeholders at the national and
regional levels into the political settlement. It has also been seen as a source of livelihoods for
extended family networks. As in other low-income countries that have problems controlling
violence within their territory, political support has been managed through distribution of
benefits—including higher-level positions within government and associated access to rents and
to positions that can be awarded to lower-level followers—to powerful stakeholders with the
ability to disrupt the political order through violence (see also Chapter 2).
43.      Further, ensuring distribution of employment across regions and communities has been
seen as a way to meet demands for inclusion and an equitable share of running government, even
though existing legislation makes this only a subordinated priority. Public sector employment has
thus been central to the political settlement in South Sudan, with (negative) implications for efforts
to gradually reform government employment and human resource management for improved
institutional capacity.
44.     During the CPA period, the President pursued a ‘big tent’ coalition-building strategy
of bringing the diverse militias who had fought against the North together under the
umbrella of the Sudan People’s Liberation Army/Movement (SPLA/SPLM). Many
community militias were merged into the SPLA or the organized forces (police, prisons, fire, and
wildlife services), resulting in the expansion of public employment in the security sector (see
Error! Reference source not found.). A key tension embedded in this approach is the perception

that those who generate violence are rewarded with further access to benefits and that those
unsatisfied with their allocation can access more through conflict. Further, it comes at a high fiscal
cost with 46 percent of the national budget going to security sector salaries in FY15/16. This
strategy was initially feasible due to the high amount of public resources from oil, but following
the drop in oil prices since mid-2014 it was no longer sustainable. The enormous security sector
costs negatively affect civilian capacities by aggravating the fiscal imbalances and due to the trade-
offs with other expenditures.
45.     A further element of the ‘big tent’ strategy has been the incorporation of subnational
powerbrokers into the national political settlement through devolved governance
arrangements. Formal structures of devolution have been used to reward local elites who might
otherwise rebel, with positions in subnational administrations and access to associated rents.
Devolved governance has been used to accommodate diversity by giving groups (often with a
tribal, clan, subclan, or family dimension) control over territory, resources, and jobs.
Simultaneously, the system has also created tension between and within groups as communities
and political entrepreneurs’ jockey for control over these resources. The decision to expand the
number of states from 10 to 28 in October 2015 reflects the strategy to co-opt support, but its effect
has been to dissipate nascent capacity and to further stretch fiscal resources.

46.    A related dynamic is that government employment—from the level of ministers to
cleaners and drivers—has been associated with the ‘peace dividend’. The 2014 World Bank
Jobs and Livelihoods Report found that 40 percent of citizens expected a government job within
one year, increasing to 50 percent within two years.25 It also found a perception that public sector
employment paid extremely well; respondents expected to earn SSP 7,200 a month as a civil
servant, which was more than twice the actual average government salary of the time (SSP 3,200
in 2011).26
47.    Government employment is an important source of livelihoods for extended families.
A single civil servant may be the main source of income for an entire extended family, and those
with government jobs feel significant pressure to deliver resources to their families and
communities. This may be through drawing a single salary, by finding positions for others in one’s
groups or for higher-level officials through the use of state resources to benefit themselves, their
families, and their communities. The World Bank Jobs and Livelihoods Report found that:
        In urban centers across South Sudan, those who have jobs, mainly those from
        Greater Upper Nile and Greater Bahr el- Ghazal, are compelled by social
        obligations to sustain those without jobs. In large towns, the level of dependency

  World Bank. Jobs and Livelihoods Report (2014), P. 57. In 2016, salary payments have been made with two to
three months of delay, and the purchasing power of salaries has been sharply eroded due to inflation.
                                                                                                  32 | P a g e
        on these social networks finds expression in households of the salaried government
        officials, which often house tens of relatives. The relatives rely on the salaried
        person to feed them, buy them clothes, pay school fees, pay for medical expenses
        etc… There are often further responsibilities and obligations to relatives back in the
        rural villages, with the expectation that these senior government officials supply
        urban goods to relatives in the village.27

48.     Beyond the use of a single salary to support extended family networks, there are other
opportunities for gaining benefits through public sector employment. Evidence suggests that
a variety of individuals draw ‘ghost workers’ salaries. This can be used to substitute for a social
safety net; for example, when a family’s main income earner passes away, his or her name is left
on the payroll so that the family can continue to draw a salary. In other cases, it is a way to
supplement the salaries of senior officials.28

49.     A further issue is the fact that government staff can face security challenges,
especially if they are not from a group dominant in a particular area. Information on ethnicity
in the civil service has not been officially recorded at any level, making it difficult to provide
evidence about favoritism in hiring, domination by particular groups, the impact of successive
earlier peace deals that absorb community or regional militias, or the impact of the current conflict
on inclusiveness and regional representation in the national civil service. A key consideration for
subnational employment has been that it is not considered feasible to have a position in state or
county governments unless one is a member of a politically important group from that area.

50.     Tied to the use of government employment as a tool for managing political support,
the Government of the Republic of South Sudan (GRSS) has made relatively little use of its
diaspora, which stands in contrast to the experience of several other postconflict countries
(notably Liberia). Due to the extended north-south conflict, many South Sudanese fled to other
countries in the region and beyond. Quite a number of these were able to obtain qualifications in
a variety of fields in their host countries. While MoLPSHRD has hosted a small diaspora program,
this has been constrained. Emphasis has been put on hiring those who were involved in the armed
struggle with Sudan and other criteria (such as hiring staff already employed by the Coordinating
Council of Southern States (CCSS) and Civilian Authority of New Sudan (CANS), as well as
family, security, and political ties). There are reports, for example, of diaspora civil servants being
forced to flee the country due to pressure from those who remained. One question going forward

28
  As discussed in Akech Thiong (2016, 28), “It became clear to many commanders that the more forces you report to
be under your command the more money you get since salaries were handed in cash to commanders for distribution
to their soldiers without any centralized roster. A government employee had reported that he was shocked to discover
that his deceased father’s name remained on the payroll for nearly a decade and the obvious question was that who
was pocketing his salary.”
                                                                                                      33 | P a g e
is whether citizens who left the country due to the ongoing civil conflict will be able to return into
the public service.

3.1.2 Evolution of aid architecture and support to capacity building29

51.     In South Sudan, the architecture of international assistance has been the result of
evolving international commitments, shifting political objectives, and technical realities. As
discussed in Chapter 2, development partners face a complex set of incentives when engaging in
South Sudan and other fragile contexts. Relatively high revenue during the early years placed the
government in a fairly stronger negotiating position relative to development partners compared to
more aid-dependent countries with regard to use of countries systems and the acceptable level of
intrusion on or supervision of core functions. Despite initial ambitions for a harmonized
architecture, aid to South Sudan quickly became more fragmented. Moreover, since the reversion
to conflict in late 2013, development aid has been increasingly withdrawn, leading to a stop-go
pattern that stands in contrast to recommendations by the 2011 WDR, but which has been difficult
to avoid given diplomatic as well as security considerations.

52.     At the outset, in the lead-up to the signing of the CPA, the international community
began planning to scale up assistance to Southern Sudan, and to shift its focus from food aid
and basic service delivery through NGOs to state-building objectives. In coordination with the
Government of South Sudan (GoSS), a World Bank and United Nations (UN) Joint Assessment
Mission (JAM) in 2004–2005 set out a framework for peace, development, and poverty reduction
in the northern and southern region. It proposed an ambitious set of public sector outcomes to be
achieved by 2011, estimating the total cost of achieving these outcomes at US$1.6 billion from
2005 to 2011 (see Annex 3).

53.    The coincidental timing of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness with the
post-CPA planning process established South Sudan as a case study in the application of
principles of national ownership, alignment, and harmonization. Following the publication of
the JAM, 60 countries and international organizations pledged over US$4.5 billion to Sudan and
South Sudan to be channeled through a Multi-Donor Trust Fund (MDTF).

54.    A ‘parallel public service’ was initially less prevalent in South Sudan relative to other
postconflict countries, notably Afghanistan (Srivastava et al, forthcoming; Bhatia and Prasad
2015). Given that the government rejected the idea of establishing a single large project
implementation unit within the MoFEP to manage MDTF-financed programs, it was decided to
use government systems (and staff) to manage the program, but with specific technical support
‘contracted in’ to the MoFEP. During this period, the MoFEP and other ministries received

significant technical assistance, though no count has been undertaken of how many TAs were
employed (see also Chapter 4 below).

55.     However, implementation of this streamlined aid coordination system proved to be
challenging, as increased Official Development Assistance (ODA) flows were not matched by
on-the-ground operational capacity to monitor and implement programming. The Multi-
Donor Trust Fund - South Sudan (MDTF-SS) took longer to establish than foreseen, and given the
fund’s reliance on government systems, national capacity constraints increased costs and directly
affected the speed of disbursements.

56.     By mid-2007, the international community perceived that their commitments to the
GoSS and larger CPA process were not being kept, and that this had an impact on the
stability of the CPA itself. Under mounting pressure to deliver a peace dividend, development
partners began to mobilize increased funding outside of the MDTF-SS mechanism, including other
pooled funds and direct bilateral support. Projects funded by individual donors became an
increasingly important source of financing, particularly from the United States which did not
participate in pooled funding arrangements.

57.     A key further issue was the limited coordination of support to public sector capacity
building. On the donor side, the objectives set out in the JAM were not accompanied by a common
plan to build capacity—to establish training centers, job descriptions with skills requirements, a
common curriculum, a training baseline, trainers, or funding responsibility. While some efforts
sought to support these type of activities (such as the Skills for South Sudan and Capacity Building
Trust Fund [CBTF] projects), they were limited in scale and duration. Training was provided on
an ad hoc, project-by-project basis with short-term planning horizons (see also Annex 3).
58.     By 2008, it became clear that the JAM targets would be more difficult to achieve than
initially envisioned. In 2009, South Sudan faced an initial economic shock as oil prices dropped
significantly following the global financial crisis, reducing the GoSS’ budgetary resources
significantly. The approach of the 2011 referendum prompted urgent, prioritized action by donors
and the GoSS. Planning documents from the time noted that coordination had become increasingly
challenging, with donors establishing diverse new projects that did not align with government
priorities and did not use pooled funding mechanisms. By 2010, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development (OECD) noted that 109 Parallel Project Implementation Units
(PPIUs) had been officially established. As set out in the South Sudan Development Plan (SSDP),
the percent “going through pooled mechanisms dropped from 34 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in
2010” with a proliferation of separate projects.

59.     The GoSS joined the G7+ group of fragile states and the ‘New Deal’ on peace and
state building in 2011. Under this framework, focus was to be narrowed from the accomplishment
of all Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) to five peace and state-building goals related to
                                                                                        35 | P a g e
politics, security, justice, the economy, and revenue/services. Under this approach, South Sudan
called for increased budget support from donors to support a proposed four-page compact with a
limited set of benchmarks. While state consultations were held on developing a compact, the
process was never completed.30

60.     The return of large-scale internal conflict in late 2013 and significant political tensions
between the GRSS and the international community led to a rupture in the aid architecture,
as donors dramatically reduced use of government systems and discontinued development
aid in favor of a return to humanitarian assistance. In many ways, the aid architecture was
reversed to the pre-2005 system of humanitarian support through the UN and NGOs, with the
cluster system serving to coordinate the humanitarian response. Distrust between the development
community and the government further deepened following the 2015 ARCISS, given slow
implementation and slow restart of assistance, and following renewed conflict in 2016.
61.      Looking back at a decade of development partner support to institutional
development and capacity building, evaluations have noted three key issues: overly short-
term support, insufficient attention to subnational levels, and a lack of monitoring. First,
short-termism by donors reluctant to commit to longer-term programs in the context of state
fragility led to short-term capacity interventions.31 For example, while the CBTF spanned a ten-
year period, it consisted of multiple two-year funding envelopes with no certainty of extension.
Within these two-year windows, design, approval, and procurement processes further reduced the
possible duration of training programs. Rather than a long-term strategic approach to building
training institutions, curricula, and trainers, interventions were bound by near-term priorities.
Second, the need for capacity-building efforts to reach subnational governments and to coordinate
with subnational ministries, departments, and agencies (MDAs) was something that was not fully
realized during the initial state-building period. Third, it was recommended to improve monitoring
of baseline capacity as well as mid-term and end-line outcomes to allow for mid-course corrections
and better tracking of overall progress.

 Sudan 2005–11: Key Findings in Relation to Capacity Building
 “In general, donors misdiagnosed the capacity-building needs of Southern Sudan and failed to develop a vision
 which consisted of a coherent, well-funded approach supporting state building and its key functions. In detail:

         Donors had a piecemeal approach to capacity building and their efforts were uncoordinated and random.
          Donors have had so much experience in capacity-building programs over the past decades, yet it was only
          in 2009 that they started a coordination working group to improve coordination.

        The severity of the context was not taken as a starting point.
        Capacity building is more than training and this has not been fully understood by both donors and the
         GoSS.
        Programs are too scattered, too short, and underfunded to have a lasting impact in the medium to long
         term.
        The process of capacity building is too slow due to a piecemeal approach and not well targeted.
        Investment in the private sector would have had a positive effect on creating a labor market and would
         have improved access to jobs. This might have contributed to stability in the sense that those retrenched
         from the public sector would have had alternative employment.

62.     The results of investments in public sector capacity building remain difficult to assess
in the absence of a coordinated M&E framework. While individual projects measured training
inputs and outputs (such as the number of civil servants trained), the overall impact of these
programs is unknown. Programs have supported basic operations of government in the context of
a fragile state in its first years of independence—technical assistance to build basic institutional
infrastructure (that is, buildings and IT), generate oil revenues, prepare and execute budgets, and
count and pay employees. The establishment of a robust M&E framework cutting across different
interventions was a comparatively low priority.
63.    Despite a lack of M&E systems, some progress can be assessed. Key public sector
management systems were developed, and legislative frameworks have been established. A basic
budget planning cycle was put in operation, as was an integrated financial management system
(IFMS) and a public sector payroll system to track and pay civil servants. The MoLPSHRD
developed a National Master Curriculum, outlining modules of curriculum for public servants.
Although not all modules have been developed, the document provides a strategic starting point.
Beyond the national curriculum, many key operational manuals have been developed, such as the
Local Government Public Financial Management Manual and its counterpart Local Government
Human Resource Management Manual.

64.    However, many of these areas have experienced a weakening or backsliding in recent
years. Renewed conflict and the fiscal crisis emerging in 2015 and deepening in 2016 are
negatively affecting the areas of progress that were previously achieved. The use of systems and
processes has declined for various reasons—the withdrawal of TAs, the fragmentation of states
and counties, the shrinking of non-wage resources, insecurity, and others.

65.   Overall, the experience of South Sudan indicates that the international community is
not well set up to support institutional development in countries starting ‘from scratch’

                                                                                                     37 | P a g e
outside of a temporary UN administration. Recent state-building experiences in Kosovo and
Timor-Leste were overall relatively more successful, even if still beset by many challenges.32
These benefitted from having a central coordinating body at least for some time. In the case of
South Sudan, expecting coordination through the government as envisaged by the New Deal
approach was not effective, while coordination directly among development partners also proved
elusive.

3.2 Overview of the public service: Evolving size, distribution and qualifications
66.     To frame the following discussion of civil service capacity, this section provides an
overview of the composition of the civil service. Detailed analysis of available data underpinning
this section is provided in Annex 4, including analysis of the number of government employees,
the distribution employees between sectors, as well as the age, qualifications, and years of service
of civilian public servants (see also World Bank 2015b). There is currently no single budget or
single payroll system that gives a complete picture of public employment across sectors and tiers
of government. Therefore, estimating the number of staff in South Sudan requires putting together
data from multiple sources. An approximate picture is provided by the FY15/16 Approved Budget,
which provides for 347,018 central government and 118,023 state government employees, totaling
465,041 government personnel (including all security sectors). Subnational employment is
expected to be somewhat higher, given that states and counties can directly hire staff not reflected
in the national budget.

67.     Public employment has increased well beyond targets set in 2005 when the GoSS
administration first formed. According to the civil service survey completed at the time, the total
number of civil servants and organized forces was approximately 62,000.33 According to approved
national budgets, by FY12/13, government employment in the civil service and organized forces
had increased well beyond the proposed JAM ceiling to 163,000, and by FY15/16 the figure had
increased to 169,842, with substantial additional subnational staff not reflected in national budgets
(see Figure 3.4).

68.    A key feature of government employment has been the high number of staff allocated
to security functions, including Defense, National Security Service, Veterans Affairs, and the
Organized Forces (Police, Prisons, Wildlife, and Fire Services). According to the FY15/16
Approved Budget, security sector salaries make up roughly 47 percent of national government
expenditures and 76 percent of the national wage bill (see Table 3.1). Just over 85 percent of central

   These figures only capture subnational staff being paid through conditional salary transfers. State and county
governments hire additional staff using own-source revenue and block transfers, but it is difficult to estimate the
number or how they are allocated between sectors.

  As noted in the report, “The survey covered all serving public service personnel in the classified grades, including
in the Organized Forces (Police, Wildlife, Prison, and Fire Services), and personnel seconded to NGOs by the CANS,
initially established in 1996 as an organ of the SPLM, and the CCSS. Personnel at all three levels of government—
ministries and central agencies, states, and counties—were surveyed.”

69.      With regard to the national (civilian) civil service, according to the FY15/16 budget,
the Ministry of Higher Education, Technology and Science; Ministry of Finance and
Economic Planning; Judiciary of South Sudan; and Ministry of General Education36 show
the highest levels of employment. Payroll data also suggest a relatively large allocation to the
Ministry of Health. At subnational levels, state-level budgets are generally unavailable and payroll
data are incomplete with some key agencies not fully enrolled, making comparisons of distribution
of staff between sectors difficult. For counties, payroll data reflect a relatively larger share of staff
mapped to public administration and education functions as compared to health. The relatively low
portion of staff mapped to the health sector may be related to the fact that humanitarian assistance
and NGOs provide a large share of health services in South Sudan. Education is handled more
directly by the state (see Chapter 5 on health).
70.     Available data suggest overemployment of ‘support staff’ as compared to
‘professional staff’, but also indicate that there should be a sufficient number professional staff to
operate a public administration. According to payroll data, 61 percent of civilian public officers in
central government are classified (professional) and make up 71 percent of the wage bill; 38
percent are unclassified (drivers, cleaners, mechanics) and make up 27 percent of the wage bill.
For the subnational level, available payroll data for a sample of four states show the distribution
between classified (55 percent) and unclassified (45 percent) staff to be more even. Similarly,


36
  General education comprises a larger number of staff than higher education, but the bulk of staff is employed at
subnational levels.
                                                                                                       40 | P a g e
payroll data from a sample of 17 counties enrolled in the South Sudan Electronic Payroll System
(SSEPS) II indicate that 52 percent of staff are classified, with the remaining 48 percent
unclassified. As described in Annex 4, given that grading is less than systematic, it is difficult to
fully ascertain how staff are actually balanced between professionals and support staff.

71.     Assessing the qualifications and skills of civil servants remains difficult, as data are
extremely constrained. The most recent survey of public servants and organized forces was that
carried out in 2005 (the Survey of Serving Public Service Personnel). Given the expansion of the
public service and ongoing capacity-building efforts, this does not provide an up-to-date reflection
of qualifications and experience, but provides a useful baseline against which later and much more
partial findings can be compared. A 2015–2016 MoLPSHRD Skills Assessment covering a total
of 616 respondents from national and state MoLPSHRD, Ministry of Roads and Bridges (MoRB),
Ministry of Education (MoE), and Ministry of Health (MoH) provides a more up-to-date picture
of a small sample of professional grade civil servants.37

72.     The 2005 survey and recent skills assessments suggest that educational attainment
may have increased over time. The 2005 Survey of Serving Public Service Personnel found that
42.5 percent of public service personnel (including civilian and organized forces) had attained
early education only; 29 percent reached secondary or post-secondary education; 6 percent had a
university degree (23 percent did not specify educational attainment). The 2015 Skills Audit
sample was composed of directors general, directors, deputy directors, assistant directors,
inspectors, human resource (HR) officers, head teachers, engineers, IT officers, and nurses. Of this
group, 98 percent of respondents had completed secondary school, 21 percent had a Bachelor’s,
and 3 percent had a Master’s degree.

73.     Central government and subnational agencies have not established records of staff
credentials, limiting a more systematic tracking of qualifications. In part, this is related to the
fact that many South Sudanese have been trained in other countries. As a result, public officers
may hold academic or professional qualifications that are not uniform or easy to verify. Within the
civilian public service, the MoLPSHRD developed an Excel-based Human Resource Information
System (HRIS) with assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) to
capture information from paper records. In 2013, the ministry piloted an upgraded HRIS with
support from the CBTF. This was rolled out to select ministries to record basic information such
as date and place of birth, as well as degrees or other credentials held.38 Other ministries have also

37
   States covered by the survey include Central Equatoria, Eastern Equatoria, Western Equatoria, Northern Bahr El
Ghazal, Western Bahr El Ghazal, Warrap, and Lakes.
38
   Initially eight computers were provided as part of CBTF funding, though all but one have been damaged or stolen.
Further, as of early 2016, the HRIS faces IT challenges which make it difficult to access or analyze the underlying
data; resolving these issues requires IT support from the firm which originally designed the system, but resources to
do so are unavailable.
                                                                                                       41 | P a g e
initiated sector-specific HRISs. An Education Management Information System (EMIS) has been
rolled out to the education sector. The Ministry of Health has also begun development of an HRIS,
which has been rolled out to five states—these data are analyzed in Chapter 5 on health. Notably,
neither system has been implemented in close coordination with the MoLPSHRD.

74.     With regard to language skills, a key challenge for capacity development has been the
switch from Arabic to English as the main language of the government. A key implication for
the civil service has been a need to distinguish between gaps in technical versus language skills
(for example, a certified accountant who could not read government documents in English). The
2005 survey found that roughly 60 percent of central government employees had ‘good’ or
‘excellent’ English speaking and writing skills. English skills varied for employees of state
government administrations from 18 percent (Northern Bahr el Ghazal) to 48 percent (Western
Equatoria).39 Those serving in the CCSS or Khartoum administration were more likely to be fluent
in Arabic than English. Some efforts have been made to invest in language training through the
‘Skills for Sudan’ effort in the late 2000s.
75.     The majority of staff appear to have been recruited within the past decade. At the
national level, the 2016 Skills Audit found that 41 percent of respondents had been in their current
position for 1–5 years and 33 percent for 6–10 years. It also found that nearly 6 percent of
respondents across levels of government were serving in their role in an acting capacity. Two-
thirds of national government respondents had no work experience outside of the public sector,
though 21 percent had worked with another ministry. At the state level, 35 percent of respondents
had been serving in their current position for 1–5 years and 22 percent for 6–10 years. Roughly 20
percent of staff in the national government and 30 percent of staff in the subnational government
have been in post for over 10 years.40

76.     Data indicate a potentially substantial problem with employment of staff over the
retirement age of 60. The 2005 Survey of Serving Public Service Personnel found that roughly
42 percent of government employees in the civil service and organized forces at the national and
state levels were between the ages 16 and 35. The report estimated that 14 percent of government
personnel surveyed at the time would be at retirement age by 2016. More recent data from the
Skills Audit suggest 34 percent of civil servants were past the retirement age. This is potentially a
considerable challenge for the public sector, given that no government pension system is currently
in place.41

   Based on data available and reflecting a date of appointment.
41
   While pensions deductions are made from civilian and security sector employees, no functional pension systems
exist to allocate payments to retired staff. As a result, many staff stay on the payroll past the retirement age. While
some continue to come to the office and act in their professional capacity, anecdotally, others do not.
                                                                                                          42 | P a g e
3.3 Education and the link to public sector capacity
77.     Key factors shaping public sector capacity are the primary, secondary school, and
university systems in a country. This is especially the case for sectors such as PFM and health,
both of which require (at a minimum) a level of numeracy beyond that which is taught in primary
schools. In addition, a relatively strong foundation in the sciences is critical for expanding the pool
of potential health workers, including doctors, nurses, midwives, and pharmacists. Linked to the
fragile context, South Sudan is characterized by a low level of educational qualifications—limiting
the ‘pool of available civil servants’ from which to recruit.
78.     Basic education outcomes remain low. The adult literacy rate was 27 percent in 2009,
below that of other fragile and conflict-affected states when they emerged from conflict (see Table
3.2 and Table 3.3). In 2000, 20 percent of students completed primary school. By 2011, the
completion rate had increased to 37 percent (compared to 69 percent for SSA on average). In 2009,
48 percent of primary-aged children were enrolled in school, declining to 42 percent by 2012, and
the rate is assumed to have declined further since then due to the conflict.
79.     Data on the number of secondary school graduates in South Sudan are limited.
According to the Ministry of Higher Education (MoHE), the gross enrollment ratio in 2015 was
9.3 percent, far below the average for SSA and countries with fragile and conflict-affected
situations (FCS) (see Table 3.3). Those who can afford it send their children for secondary school
outside the country, typically to Kenya or Uganda. However, there are no data tracking the
enrollment or completion rates for this group, nor is there good information regarding the number
of graduates who return to South Sudan or seek employment in the public sector.
80.      With regard to higher education, there are five operational state/public universities:
the University of Juba (founded in 1977),42 University of Upper Nile at Malakal (1992), University
of Western Bahr el Ghazal at Wau (1990), Rumbek University (2009), and Dr. John Garang
University of Science and Technology in Bor (2010).43 The University of Juba has about 6,000
students in active learning and has graduated about 6,500 students since 2006. According to MoHE
data, in 2015 there were 721 professors and lecturers serving in South Sudan’s 13 universities
(more than half at universities in Juba); all 13 had a library and generators; none had dormitory
facilities and one-quarter did not have safe drinking water. Given the ongoing macro-fiscal crisis,

42
   During the second North-South War, University of Juba was relocated to Khartoum. It only relocated back to Juba
in 2011.
43
   The University of Juba is the biggest with 13 colleges including Arts and Humanities; Art, Music and Drama;
Applied and Industrial Science; Engineering and Architecture; Natural Resources; Medicine; Law; Social and
Economic Studies; School of Management Studies; Computer Science and Information Technology; School of Public
Service (SPS) (postgraduate); and Center for Peace and Development Studies (postgraduate). The other universities
have about three to five colleges. All the colleges are operational though the University of Upper Nile had to relocate
and operate in Juba on a small scale because of the conflict.
                                                                                                         43 | P a g e
salaries and operating expenditures for government institutions have been extremely constrained.
As of June 2016, lecturers at public universities had gone on strike over delayed salary payments.

81.    According to available data from the MoHST, there were 11,419 students enrolled
across South Sudan’s 13 public and private universities in 2015.44 Of this group, the largest
share of students were enrolled in business and management (19 percent), socioeconomic sciences
(19 percent), and education programs (16 percent); 4 percent study public health. A newly opened
SPS at the University of Juba began offering courses during the 2015 academic year (see Annex
7) with 51 students enrolled in the program. As with secondary school, many students have the
opportunity attend university abroad.45 However, there are no data tracking the enrollment or
completion rates for this group, nor is there good information regarding the number of graduates
who return to seek work in the public sector.
82.     If one quarter of total students enrolled annually graduate, then the number of new
graduates per year is only about 2,850, a relatively small number. Even if all of these wanted
to join the public service, it gives limited scope to the government to run a competitive, merit-
based selection; and even more so taking into account employment offers from development
partners and NGOs (which have declined in recent years due to the conflict), as well as the nascent
private sector.46

3.4 Effective use of potential capacity: Recruitment
83.     Recruitment practices hold potential to improve the qualifications and professional
experience of the civil service in South Sudan. While the available pool of literate and qualified
citizens in South Sudan is limited, the pool of educated people needed to sustain or gradually
expand the civilian civil service is not large; the percentage of civilian public servants relative to
the population is in the order of 0.6 percent. In principle, meritocratic recruitment along with
strategic use of transfers and promotions should be able to have an effect. For example, Republic
of Korea faced a literacy rate similar to South Sudan’s (22 percent) at the end of World War II,
but was able to use meritocratic recruitment practices to draw the most-qualified citizens into the
civil service.

84.     Yet the government has not been able to systematically maximize the use of potential
capacity in South Sudan. Institutional arrangements that have sought to improve checking of
qualifications, enforce meritocratic recruitment processes, or limit hiring into the public sector
have not been able to resist pressures created by the use of the public sector for the management
of political support. Further, merging multiple militias onto the security sector payroll as a strategy
for maintaining stability limits the resources that can be spent on funding a capable public
administration (such as hiring accountants, teachers, nurses, and doctors).

   However, a significant share of private sector employment is taken up by non-nationals.

85.     Initial hiring processes appear to have been quite distorted. In part this was related to
the logistical challenge of creating a public sector ‘from scratch’ by merging the CANS and CCSS
administrations. Recruitment was devolved to South Sudan’s MDAs, with over 230 appointing
authorities across three tiers of government. Staff were absorbed with little consideration of their
technical qualifications and experience. Many hired into the civilian civil service had been
involved in fighting (Larson, Ajak, and Prichett 2013), and as is common in postconflict settings,
patronage-based loyalties overrode rule-based arrangements. During the early CPA years,
anecdotally most MDAs at the national and state levels reflected the ethnicity of their ministers.
Given successive changes of ministers since 2005, the situation has changed somewhat.
86.     Efforts to address these initial distortions and improve recruitment practices have
been uneven; in practice, rules and oversight mechanisms at national and state levels have
not been able to exert a strong influence over recruitment processes. From 2007 to 2012 public
sector reforms were initiated targeting adoption of clear legislation and regulations, improvements
in payroll controls, a reduction of ghost workers, and better checking of qualifications (see World
Bank 2014 for a detailed overview). These reforms faced resistance in the Cabinet, especially with
regard to checking qualifications, and ultimately resulted in the resignation of the Minister of
LPSHRD in 2012.
87.     Among these reforms, a Recruitment Board was established under the MoLPSHRD in
2008, and in 2011, the Civil Service Act gave the MoLPSHRD de jure leverage over recruitment
and hiring for the core parts of the (civilian) public service through its mandate to approve
establishment structures setting out the number of posts and associated grade level for all MDAs
(World Bank 2014). In practice, the Recruitment Board has not been able to exercise a role in
hiring decisions (see Annex 6 for a detailed overview). In its absence, the main gatekeeping
exercised for the national level has shifted to the Human Resource Management Directorate in the
Ministry of Public Service, which decides if someone can be included in SSEPS II.

88.     Further efforts to reform recruitment processes have been stalled by successive hiring
freezes, which have driven some hiring decisions outside of the formal recruitment process.
A hiring freeze was brought into effect in FY12/13 as part of a package of austerity measures to
cope with the shutdown in oil production, and it remained in place as the result of civil conflict
and subsequent macro-fiscal crises. During this period, additional militias were brought into the
security sector, and emergency recruitment for priority (civilian) civil service positions was carried
out by an ‘austerity committee’.47 Beyond this, additional hiring may have taken place, but the
scarcity of available data makes the picture unclear. For the central government, the MoPSLHRD
Recruitment Board does not have records reflecting the number of staff hired since 2012. Data

47
 For example, the committee approved recruitment of 200 new doctors by the MOH and 27 staff for DDR. See World
Bank (2014) baseline assessment for Institutional Development and Capacity Building Project (IDCBP).
                                                                                                 46 | P a g e
from SSEPS II indicate that at least 1,000 employees received their letters of appointment between
2014 and 2016. The MoLPSHRD Directorate of Human Resource Management reports that no
new hires have been added to SSEPS II, but suggests that some MDAs have recruited additional
staff ‘outside of the payroll’ who are paid directly by the MoFEP on a contractual basis rather than
through SSEPS II.

89.     Additionally, hiring freezes have reduced the opportunities to bring in or move up the
increasing number of well-qualified citizens and foster renewal of the civil service. Though
qualifications may be improving in the pool of potential civil servants—for example, for teachers,
health workers, IT specialists, and accountants—there is limited new hiring taking place. This is
exacerbated by the fact that civil servants rarely retire, given the absence of a pension system, and
so there is no turnover in staff. Going forward, the macro-fiscal condition makes it extremely
difficult to recruit new staff, while at the same time, pressure to accommodate the formerly warring
parties will create pressure for expansion, including the absorption of non-qualified staff.

3.5 Wages and essential resources to carry out assigned functions
90.     For a number of years, wage levels and allowances were relatively high at least for a
number of staff categories, but they sharply declined in 2016 to below subsistence. A detailed
analysis of the wage bill and of wage levels for key employment categories is provided in World
Bank (2015b). The grid for public sector wages was initially established in 2007, setting wages at
relatively high levels compared to other countries in the region. In addition, a small circle of senior
civil servants enjoyed generous travel benefits. As the real value of salaries eroded over time due
to inflation, the government decided to introduce additional allowances rather than adjust base
wages. By mid-2015, the value of base salaries plus allowances had dropped to around 50 percent
of the original 2007 value for national civil servants, and 33 percent for subnational civil servants.

91.     A sharp downward shift followed in 2016, when the purchasing power of salaries
dropped by a further 80–90 percent due to hyperinflation. While base wages were increased
for lower civil service grades (grades 17–10), which include teacher and nurses, by 300 percent in
February 2016, the overall reduction in purchasing power even for these categories remains around
60 percent; and erosion further continues from month to month given that no end to high rates of
inflation is in sight. The delayed payment of wages and nonpayment of at least one month of wages
for FY15/16 (at the national level) further contributed to the decline in value of public sector
remuneration. This negatively affects the motivation and the ability of staff to perform their
functions, as it generates an urgent need to supplement incomes through other activities.

92.    Apart from salaries, a key element for the functioning of government institutions is
the availability of basic resources required for staff to carry out their assigned functions.
Since 2005 investments have been made in the physical infrastructure to run a government, largely
funded by development partners.48 As of July 2016, government facilities in Juba are basic but
adequate and remained undamaged by the 2013–2015 civil conflict.49

93.     Due to limited or inexistent infrastructure, logistics and utility costs are high for both
the public and the private sector. A national power grid does not exist, making the power supply
largely dependent on generators and fuel that is imported through difficult ports and overland
routes, resulting in a high cost of energy per kilowatt-hour. Similarly, water is provided by trucks
and sewage systems do not exist even in major cities. There is limited roads infrastructure, with
only 4,000 km of all-weather roads, and about 60 percent of the country becomes impassable
during the rainy season (April–October). Commercial flights are available between major cities,
but not on a regular or reliable basis. These transport constraints make moving goods, services,
and staff costly. Communications infrastructure is relatively more established, but exclusively
relies on mobile connectivity—which has been established in all state capitals and most county
capitals.

94.     A cross-cutting constraint for the central government has been the availability of
operating budgets to pay for electric generators or Internet connections. Given the limited
road, water, and electricity infrastructure in the country, South Sudan is an expensive operational
environment. Constraints to public sector operating budgets have increased since FY15/16. Fiscal
resources have become extremely limited since early 2016 and fuel for generators is now more
expensive than in the past. This constrains agencies’ ability to carry out their assigned functions,
and has increased the costs of external assistance to government which must cover basic inputs.
The MoLPSHRD Human Resource Training Center (HRTC) is illustrative. The facility was built
in 2013 by the African Development Bank (AfDB) and was not physically damaged by 2013 civil
conflict. The Kenya School of Government agreed to provide faculty to teach courses at the HRTC
if the ministry covers the operational expenses of holding classes. However, the ministry has not
been able to find funds to provide fuel for transportation to the center, fuel to run the generator, or
meals to trainees.
95.     At the same time, available operational resources are not well allocated. This concerns
both the allocation of operational resources among sectors, that is, the high funding allocated to
security sectors, as well as poor allocations within civilian and service delivery sectors. Ministers
use hotels rather than regular housing, invite followers on a regular basis for meals, and bill their
charges to the ministry. Per diems related to foreign travel have been very high and frequently
made use of. Available budget documents do not allow a disaggregation into ‘overhead’ and
‘productive’ allocations of operating budgets.

96.   In contrast to the national government, subnational facilities developed slowly and
remained limited, especially for counties. A key underlying issue is the limited connectivity
between the national, state, and county capitals. Infrastructure constraints included availability of
                                                                                                           49 | P a g e
adequate school, hospital, and administrative facilities. The impact of the conflict on subnational
infrastructure varies across the country. In areas where the fighting between government and
SPLM in Opposition (SPLM/IO) forces has been limited, government facilities were relatively
unharmed. In other regions where fighting has been heaviest, state facilities were largely
destroyed. The situation has been similar for counties; rebels have burned down or looted local
government buildings in Bor, Twic East, Duk, and Pibor—though some local governments have
already begun to rebuild. NGO infrastructure in these regions has also been affected.
97.     Critically, at subnational levels, scarcity of key inputs such as Internet, computers,
and other basic items such as paper and printed forms have limited county communication
and reporting with regard to revenue management and service delivery. Partly, this is related
to limited operational expenditure. In addition, in many cases inputs are unavailable in local
markets. Counties are further constrained by limited access to banking, transportation, and fuel for
generators. A 2012 survey of local government administrative infrastructure in select counties
found that Internet access was intermittent and powered by generators; cell phone signals in the
county capitals were good, but could be interrupted if fuel was scarce; and there were no bank
branches available. The availability of paper forms has also been a constraint (World Bank 2015c).



3.6 Strengthening skills in the civil service: training and learning
98.     Strengthening the skills of existing civil servants is one avenue for improving the
overall quality of public sector effectiveness in South Sudan. Initially, it was important for the
public workforce to acquire new technical as well as managerial skills, given the limited and mixed
qualification of the civil servants absorbed from the CANS and CCSS administrations. Improving
the skills base of existing staff remains important, given that there is limited turnover or
recruitment of newly skilled staff into the public sector. The following chapter reviews cross-
cutting training initiatives; Annex 7 contains case studies providing a detailed description of South
Sudan’s public sector training institutions and infrastructure; training specific to PFM and health
are addressed in Chapters 4 and 5.

99.     Since independence, efforts have been made to advance a strategic approach to
training, but success has been mixed. Broadly speaking, whether training has an impact depends
on the quality of the specific intervention, as well as whether other influential factors are jointly
moving toward greater civil service capacity as set out in Chapter 2. Given the challenging context,
delivery of quality training in South Sudan has proved difficult. At the same time, as discussed in
this chapter, factors such as good recruitment, performance management, and the availability of
essential resources to carry out ones’ job have not been systematically present.


                                                                                         50 | P a g e
100. The government’s ability to coordinate and foster a coherent approach to training
has been limited, a challenge faced in many postconflict countries. The MoLPSHRD is
assigned responsibility for developing and implementing cross-cutting training.50 Though it has
placed great effort in trying to coordinate resources and ensure that training is delivered according
to pre-identified needs, its own capacity constraints and ability to influence other ministries has
been limited. Many MDAs at both the national and subnational levels move forward with donor-
funded training and capacity-building efforts that are not necessarily linked with the MoLPSHRD
plans or guidance.
101. Linked to this, a good deal of the training delivered has been short term and ad hoc.51
Most in-service training has been provided by development and bilateral partners. As noted by the
MoLPSHRD Directorate of Human Resource Development (HRD), most of this training has been
short (3–5 days long), focused on developing specific skills to carry out specific tasks—often
related to the implementation of a particular development project—and did not result in
certification.52 Limited M&E on the part of the government and development partners, paired with
the overall difficulty of measuring the impact of capacity building, make it difficult to interpret the
extent to which these contributed to better management of projects or wider civil service capacity.
However, frustration about their efficacy exists on both sides.

102. At the same time, some initiatives took a longer-term view but produced strategies,
policies, needs assessments, curricula, and infrastructure that have not been fully used in
practice. Among other factors, volatility, over-ambitious plans, and the short time horizons of
development partner support have made it difficult to bridge the gap between policy and
implementation. On the one hand, significant groundwork has been laid to develop the policy
architecture for training from scratch. On the other hand, resources and energy focused on ‘form’
rather than ‘function’—creating comprehensive systems on paper without resulting in actual
training for civil servants.
103. The legal foundation for training policy was set out in the Civil Service Act of 2011.
Following this, the 2013 South Sudan Civil Service Training and Capacity Development Policy
was developed with the support of a Civil Service Support Officer under the Intergovernmental
Authority on Development (IGAD)/Republic of South Sudan (RSS) Initiative. The first
countrywide training needs assessment was undertaken by the CBTF in 2009, covering civil
servants across the 10 states. With support from the U.K. Department for International

   The government did not have a training policy or a strategy nor strong influence compared to donor partners to
insist on harmonized approach–trainings offered were ad hoc and not well structured to meet a common goal and
vision, or to build on one another to cover different issues or proceed from basic to advanced levels.

South Sudan (SEADGOSS) program, the MoLPSHRD developed a Master Curriculum for Public
Administration and Management in 2009, outlining the training needs of all cadres of civil
servants, and began development of training modules. The CBTF supported development of
additional training modules; however, the series of training materials remained incomplete. A
further technical needs assessment was conducted by the African Capacity Building Project in
2012 covering four states across the greater regions of Bahr el Ghazal, Equatoria, and Upper Nile.
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) undertook a human capacity needs
assessment in 2014, which informed the design of the Phase II IGAD placement program for civil
servants. With funds from the World Bank-funded IDCBP, a syllabus for the Government
Accountancy Training Center (GATC) was developed by the MoFEP and a more recent skills audit
was completed by the MoLPSHRD in May 2016.
104. Since independence, investments have been made in training infrastructure, though this has
not automatically resulted in better (or more) training (see Annex 4 for overview of public sector
training infrastructure). As discussed in Chapter 4, early support from the CBTF provided
assistance with an initial renovation of the GATC. As of May 2016, the buildings remain in
relatively good condition and were used for donor-sponsored workshops, meetings, and working
groups. Yet no accountancy training has taken place at the center for at least the last five years. A
multi-million-dollar facility was constructed by the AfDB in 2013 to house an MoLPSHRD
HRTC. The venue has largely been vacant with the exception of a number of short courses
provided by the Kenya School of Government (KSG). Though it was not initially damaged by the
2013 civil conflict, it has since been looted and is no longer functional. Training facilities were
also constructed in state capitals, but information about whether they have been used for their
intended purpose or have been damaged by ongoing conflict is unavailable.
105. A cross-cutting issue has been the ability to execute even short-term training well (the
‘quality’ of the intervention). Given the context—including among other issues the ability of the
government to coordinate, incentives to use training to access per diem or opportunities for travel,
and the absence of systematic monitoring—delivering quality interventions has been difficult.
Multiple reviews note that supervisors send participants who are not at an appropriate grade, lack
the sufficient technical knowledge to make use of the training, or have jobs that render the training
useless in improving their performance. Linked to this, limited knowledge of English diminishes
training effectiveness. While many government officials can work competently in Arabic, the
official language and medium of instruction is English. Further, low levels of literacy and
numeracy have also had a major impact on training effectiveness.

106. A further question is whether domestic and international actors have tried to solve
capacity problems through training that have roots beyond the availability of individual
skills. A 2010 government evaluation found that some MDAs failed to release staff for training
because they had too few staff to function properly with some away from the office. It also noted
                                                                                         52 | P a g e
the absence of incentives to encourage participation such as linking training to recognition or
promotion within the MDAs. As discussed in Section 3.5, resources to carry out tasks on which
staff have been trained are often absent. Further, many people emerge from training in a specific
area only to be redeployed soon after to a new role in which their newly acquired skills are not
relevant.

107. On-the-job training through the provision of technical assistance has faced its own
set of challenges. Though ‘capacity building’ may be reflected in terms of reference (TORs), in
practice, many TAs have been held accountable for delivering specific outcomes (that is, efficient
and transparent procurement, a policy regulation or strategic plan, provision of health care). This
has incentivized some TAs to do the work directly, rather coach and mentor local counterparts,
which can be slower and deliver less perfect outputs. Even for TAs who wish to coach and mentor,
the pressure of urgent tasks (that is, ensuring fiscal transfers for health are disbursed so that
services are delivered, accounts audited, policies drafted, or reports completed) can be
overwhelming. Beyond this, counterpart staff with requisite qualifications to effectively partner
have often been absent, and turnover of those counterparts who are in place is high (this is a key
lesson emerging from the IGAD program administered by the UNDP).

108. Despite the overall frustrating picture of training, some bright spots have emerged.
There are indications that regional initiatives have been at least moderately successful. For
example, the Kenya School of Government has been an early and consistent partner, sending high-
level staff to KSG during the CPA period for instruction and a two-week on-the-job emersion
program shadowing their counterparts in Kenya. To expand the number of staff reached by the
partnership, KSG has sent instructors to Juba to provide courses for mid-level public servants.
Though there have been frustrations that the material is not adapted to the South Sudanese context,
there is an overall desire on the part of the MoLPSHRD to directly provide training to its civil
servants rather than rely on external actors. Through KSG, nearly 1,550 individuals have been
trained (see Table 3.6).
109. English language courses have been provided to support the transition to English as
the official language. From 2009, Windle Trust has provided English language training to 616
government officials with funding from the CBTF and USAID (Winrock). Courses took place at
the national level, as well as in Wau, Torit, Kuajok, Aweil, and Bentiu (See Annex 4 for a more
detailed overview of Windle Trust). Though the number of civil servants trained has been
relatively limited, systems exist to expand these efforts if relative stability returns.
110. Some longer-term professional development has taken place. Senior staff from the
MoFEP noted that the most-effective trainings ever provided to the staff of the ministry have been
the long-term trainings—staff returned with enhanced skills and have been the drivers of change
within the ministry. Most of the long-term trainings were funded by the government and a few

development partners. The AfDB is one of the development partners that has provided funding for
longer-term training for MoFEP staff in Tanzania, Kenya, and Uganda. So far, more than 16 staff
have been trained in taxation, financial management, and external audit. For taxation, there are 4
postgraduates, 7 diploma, and 2 certificate candidates all trained in Tanzania. For internal audit, 8
were sent and trained in Uganda and for financial management, a bigger number attended shorter-
term trainings of 7 to 14 days in Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa. All returned to their duty
stations.53
111. The SPS at the University of Juba was established in November 2014 and began
offering courses in 2015. Established and operationalized during the civil conflict, the SPS has
proved durable in the face of security and fiscal challenges. The program has a rigorous admissions
process and enrolls 51 professionals from across the country in its two-year MA program. The
faculty is composed of staff from South Sudan’s think tanks and academic community. Its courses
are adapted to the country context and are viewed as credible by local and international
stakeholders. Its operational costs are low and fit for purpose (for example, electricity is provided
through solar power as compared to other facilities that rely on expensive fuel). Tuition has also
remained relatively low (SSP 12,000 per year), though it may be increasingly difficult for students
to afford given the inflation.

3.7 Conclusions and implications

112. South Sudan has presented a challenging context for capacity building, one in which
progress is difficult to assess and punctuated by crises. This chapter explored the context and
legacies that have shaped efforts to strengthen the public sector. It has discussed the tensions faced
by stakeholders when trying to move the public sector toward greater effectiveness, setting out the
factors jointly influencing civil service capacity. As is clear from section 3.2.1, the actions taken
by the government and development partners have led to a messy and suboptimal, capacity-
building process.
113. Educational attainment remains low in South Sudan compared to other SSA and
fragile states—limiting the ‘pool of available civil servants’ from which to recruit. Those who
can afford to send their children for secondary school outside the country; however, there are no
data tracking the enrollment or completion rates for this group. There are five public universities
in the country. Even if a relatively high number of enrolled students graduate annually, it gives the
government very little scope to recruit, especially when taking into account competition from
employment with development partners, NGOs, and the nascent private sector.
114. While recruitment practices hold potential to improve the individual skills mix of the
civil service, the government has not been able to systematically maximize the use of potential
capacity. A key challenge in South Sudan has been a tension between supporting the political
settlement and fostering merit. Institutional arrangements that have sought to improve checking of
qualifications, enforce meritocratic recruitment processes, or limit hiring into the public sector
have not been able to resist pressures created by the use of the public sector for the management
                                                                                                       55 | P a g e
of political support. An early reliance on ‘legacy’ civil servants and former combatants, the large
size of the security sector as compared to other services, successive hiring freezes for the civilian
civil service, and the number of pensionable staff still on the payroll have contributed to the
currently perceived problem of ‘inability to employ and move up’ qualified younger staff, rather
than finding qualified graduates for the public sector (as explored further in particular in Chapter
5).

115. Initial hiring processes that appear to have been quite distorted are now difficult to
address. Initially very low educational attainment limited the pool of potential civil servants from
which South Sudan could recruit when the public service was created in 2005. Though educational
outcomes are gradually improving—and therefore increasing the pool of civil servants from which
to recruit—hiring into the civilian civil service has also slowed. To some extent, this has ‘locked
in’ the capacity which existed in 2005. Further, while many South Sudanese have and continue to
seek qualifications (secondary school, university degrees) outside of the country, the public sector
has not made as much use of the diaspora as other fragile and conflict-affected states. An additional
theme is that that institutional arrangements put in place to ensure greater checking of
qualifications and a more meritocratic recruitment process have not been able to limit pressures to
use the public sector for the management of political support.

116. Resources for carrying out assigned functions have been constrained, skewed toward
the national level, and skewed toward operational expenditures benefiting top-level staff
rather than actual delivery of tasks. For the central government, basic investments in
infrastructure to run a government have been made. However, operating budgets to purchase fuel
for electric generators and subscriptions to (mobile) Internet, as well as to maintain IT systems
have not always been available, and increasingly less so since the fall of oil prices in January 2015.
At the subnational level, investments in physical infrastructure to run a government have been
more limited, basic supplies to run an office are not consistently available in subnational capitals,
and facilities in the North of the country have been damaged by the civil conflict.
117. Systematic training has emerged only gradually and gaps remain. As is common in
postconflict countries, the government was not able to effectively coordinate and foster a coherent
approach to training. Linked to this, a good deal of the training delivered has been short term and
ad hoc. While some initiatives took a longer-term view, these produced strategies, policies, needs
assessments, curricula, and infrastructure that have not been fully used in practice. A further
question is whether stakeholders have tried to solve capacity problems through training that have
roots beyond the availability of individual skills. Some bright spots have emerged, but
understanding their impact is difficult in the absence of systematic M&E.
118. Reflecting on Figure 2.1 (Chapter 2), constraints exist across factors. Limited
education has reduced the pool of potential civil servants. Recruitment has been distorted by

                                                                                          56 | P a g e
security pressures (high allocation to security sectors versus other services) and the need to manage
political support. Pay was not initially a main issue—but on the one hand that has been because of
very good access to allowances, per diem, and other benefits for more senior staff—and on the
other hand is increasingly an issue due to inflation and the current macro-fiscal crisis. Performance
management has not been in place. Availability of resources has been constrained.

119. A key tension in South Sudan has been between supporting the political settlement
and fostering merit and efficiency. At the same time, development partners have tended to treat
capacity building as a technical issue which could be solved by delivering the ‘inputs’ to a more
functional state. Donor support has been unsystematic and fragmented, shaped by evolving
international commitments, shifting political objectives, and technical realities. While some
initiatives took a longer-term view, the time horizon of specific projects was limited by the project
cycle. They produced strategies, policies, needs assessments, curricula, and infrastructure that have
not been fully used in practice—some of which have been destroyed or made irrelevant by the
civil conflict.

4.     PFM Capacity in South Sudan - Rise, Leapfrog, Crash, and Beyond
120. Capacity in South Sudan with regard to PFM offers a mixed and in several ways
unexpected picture. It is easy to presume that South Sudan had ‘no’ capacity given decades of
civil war; very low literacy rates; and over the past 10 years, a leadership that has not been very
committed to development. However, as in any postconflict country, there was some capacity at
the outset, and investments in capacity were made with varying results. The years between 2006
and 2013 can be described as the ‘rise’ and of ‘leapfrogging’ in terms of PFM. From 2009 and up
to 2014, South Sudanese budget documents contained extensive information on ‘programs’, and
even reflected a review of what had been achieved relative to the programs and targets set in the
previous fiscal year in some cases. The 2013–2014 budget, running to 600 pages in total, contains
detailed information on major planned public investments, as well as detailed information about
aid allocations. Previous year outturns are provided throughout the specific allocations.

121. At the same time, PFM in South Sudan has remained affected by deep
dysfunctionalities, as the result of several key drivers. In line with the overall note, this chapter
focuses on capacity and hence cannot present a full picture of PFM systems. A key dysfunctionality
throughout the past decade has been the fact that reallocations during budget execution have
continuously been very substantial. Furthermore, available evidence suggests that public
investments carried out at a significant scale during the years of rapidly accelerating fiscal

resources were highly wasteful (cf. Country Economic Memorandum). External audit reports have
only ever been produced for 2005 to 2008.55 Most recently, the combined effect of renewed
conflict since late 2013, and the fiscal ‘firefighting’ since 2012, with the fiscal situation becoming
extremely difficult in 2015 and 2016, has led to something of a ‘system crash’ both at the national
and at the subnational levels.
122. Investments were made in improving PFM between 2005 and 2011. By 2012, systems
reached their relative peak efficiency, before declining again as the result of two macro-fiscal
crises and a civil conflict. As reflected in Figure 4.1, in 2012 at the peak, PEFA scores for budget
credibility, accounting, and reporting and control of budget execution were lower than the SSA
average, but were quite good for external scrutiny and audit, comprehensiveness and transparency,
and policy-based budgeting (Figure 4.2). Similarly, the country performed lower than a number of
other African countries emerging from conflict on accounting and reporting and control of budget
execution, but comparable to the Democratic Republic Congo.



4.1 The emergence of PFM capacities - 2005 to 2010
123. When the South Sudanese Government began to be formed following the CPA,
initially as a region within larger Sudan, it drew on pre-existing capacity as has been noted
above. Of the 3,096 staff categorized as ‘Finance and Economic Planning’ in the 2006 survey of
the civil service, 2,622 (85 percent) came from the CCSS and only 474 from the CANS (that is,
the civilian arm of the SPLM). This is the strongest balance in favor of CCSS as compared to
CANS staff across the eight functional areas which the survey considered. Regarding the
subnational level, the 2006 survey of the newly formed civil service rated one state (Upper Nile)
as having high capacity on PFM and one state (Central Equatoria) as average. All other states were
ranked as starting out with low capacity for PFM.
124. The CCSS Finance and Economic Planning staff were also relatively mature : 1,000 or
38 percent were 41 years and above, and a further 700 were in their 30s; among CANS staff, 36
percent (171 out of 474) were 41 years and above, and a further 138 in their 30s. A focus group
discussion carried out for this analysis in 2016 also confirmed that the accounting cadre often had
previous work experience reaching back to the 1980s and 1990s.

125. According to focus group interviews and other discussions, many of the CCSS
accounting cadre had been trained at the so-called Commercial Schools in Khartoum and
Juba,56 at Juba or Khartoum University, and some in the 1970s at the GATC in Juba. At the

 Reports for 2009 and 2010 are pending in the Legislative Assembly.
56
 Juba Commercial Secondary School was originally established in the 1950s. As the University of Juba, it moved to
Khartoum for periods of time during successive civil wars. There was also a separate Khartoum Commercial
                                                                                                   59 | P a g e
time, the UNDP had supported the development of a curriculum and the delivery of courses at the
GATC (see Box 4.1). One particular constraint resulting from this overall legacy is that many of
those with training in bookkeeping and accounting as well as in economics had primarily a
knowledge of Arabic rather than English.

126. However, most of the older generation of accountants and other PFM staff were
posted to line ministries, rather than to the Ministry of Finance, possibly due to the fact that
the MoFEP has been a core Dinka-held ministry, and hence preferred to hire new staff. SSEPS II
payroll data from February 2016 reflect the age of the MoFEP personnel—though a key constraint
is that the birthday of 28 percent of staff is recorded as January 30, 1901, that is, unknown.57 Figure
4.3 shows a large share of employees are under 40 (44 percent); and 27 percent are 40–59 years;
only 4 percent are shown to be past retirement—while this number could be larger in practice,
given that birthdates were least frequently registered for staff hired early in the state-building
process.

127. During the early years—ca. 2006 to 2008—the Ministry of Finance had only
rudimentary staff and offices, and many central finance agency functions were directly
carried out with the help of TAs and firms hired as agents for accounts and procurement.
During this period, office space was very limited in prefabricated buildings and national staffing
was largely limited to the top level (that is, Ministers, Deputy Ministers, and Undersecretaries) and
middle management (Directors General and Directors). Most directorates barely had any technical


Secondary School. Juba Commercial Secondary School still exists and was partially renovated in 2009 with funds
from USAID.

Procurement Agent for the government.

128. Technical staff started to be hired in larger numbers in 2008–2010, as the Ministry of
Finance moved to the newly refurbished ministerial compound, which also provided greater space;
reaching a total of 375 by 2016 for core public expenditure functions. The allocation across
functions has been relatively steady, with the strongest growth over time in the Directorate of
Accounts and in the Directorate for Administration and Finance (Figure 4.4).58 In principle, and
as is discussed further below, the substantial funding provided by development partners for PFM
strengthening should have been more than sufficient to provide training for such a number of staff.

129. In addition to the expenditure-related functions, on the revenue collection side, the
Directorate of Taxation has employed between 100 and 400 staff, and the Customs Directorate
between 1,100 and 1,600 staff.59 The setup and functions of the ministry have been relatively
traditional set-up with budgeting and treasury functions united in one ministry and integrated
revenue functions (customs only since independence). Planning and aid coordination are part of
the MoFEP’s mandate. While having comprehensive functions, the internal organization of the
ministry has been somewhat less clear. A Freebalance IT system was introduced in 2008. Use of

divergence between these figures. The Directorate for Administration and Finance also includes IT staff.

the system remained highly centralized at the national level, but the accounting and reporting
modules were rolled out to the initial 10 states.

130. One issue that has been lacking is an actual functional design and clear organogram
of the national Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning. A plan was made to hold a retreat
and develop a clear organizational structure for the ministry in late 2013. However, the retreat was
postponed and subsequently canceled due to the outbreak of renewed conflict. Thus, while the
structure of the ministry in broad terms is relatively ‘standard’, there are some areas for which
responsibilities are not entirely clear (for example, there are multiple Directors General for
different aspects of planning), and there are some functions which one would expect to have
dedicated directorates (notably debt management) that currently only exist as subordinate units.

131. Figure 4.5 shows the year of hiring of the MoFEP staff based on SSEPS II data.60 The
graph reflects the initial hiring ‘waves’ in 2006 and 2008, followed by recruitment of around 40
staff per year between 2009 and 2013, and dropping off thereafter, in line with the hiring freeze
due to the fiscal crisis.

132. A review of the SSEPS II payroll data shows that most MoFEP staff are ‘classified’.

reflects the distribution of MoFEP personnel between grades. According to SSPES II data, 72
percent of MoFEP personnel are classified (and make up 87 percent of the MoFEP wage bill).
Unclassified staff make up the remaining 28 percent of staff (and 13 percent of the wage bill). This
indicates that a much higher share of wage resources are being taken up by the professional-
technical cadre than by drivers, messengers, watchmen, and cleaners.61

133. As discussed for the overall civil service in Chapter 3, there is a question about
whether one can diagnose a ‘missing middle’ for the MoFEP. The staffing structure as shown
in Figure 4.6 reflects the fact that staffing is concentrated in levels 9 and below—at or below the
professional grades (1–7)—but nearly three-quarters of staff are registered as ‘classified’. Grade 9
staff are ‘assistant inspectors’ in Tax and other departments. This suggests that in principle the
ministry should have sufficient number and sufficient professional-level staff to operate and to
acquire capacity, in particular if initially junior staff were developed over time.62 Section 4.2 looks
further at the development partner support that has been provided in this regard.

134. There is a higher level of information about accountants in South Sudan thanks to
the USAID Accounting Staff Census and Skills Assessment for the Government of the Republic
of South Sudan carried out in late 2013. It surveyed 788 individuals involved in accounting tasks

61
  The ratio is higher than for the civil service overall (61 percent classified, 38 unclassified).
62
  Allen et al. (2015) includes a discussion of the range of staffing numbers in Ministries of Finance in OECD and
developing countries. With around 400 staff, South Sudan is in the same staff number bracket (200 to 500 staff) as
Chile, Moldova, and Nicaragua. Ghana, Uganda, and Mozambique have between 500 and 1,000 MoF staff
(excluding tax and custom collection staff).
                                                                                                        63 | P a g e
in the civilian and security sectors of the public service. For civilian central government MDAs
enrolled in SSEPS II, only 48 staff have a job with ‘accountant’ in the title. However, the 2013
Census found that misclassification of staff was common “including non-accounting tasks with
accounting titles or accounting tasks without accounting titles.” (USAID 2013, 10). Table 4.1
reflects the highest educational level of accountants surveyed in 2013. Of those surveyed, “89
percent of those with a diploma or degree had a specialization in subjects relevant to accounting.
Others had specializations in subjects including English literature, civil aviation, wildlife,
chemistry, education, and rural development” (USAID 2013, 10).

 Box 4.1. Key Findings from Accountant Census
        66 percent of accounting staff have completed a university diploma or higher; and the average staff
         member has 11.2 years of experience in government finance.
        30 percent of staff in the General List belong to organized forces and military; organized forces staff
         receive less training and were weaker in all areas assessed.
        Accounting knowledge is weakest regarding the Chart of Accounts, bank reconciliations, and preparing
         financial reports.
        Computer skills are uneven and still relatively weak, with 25 percent unfamiliar with Excel.
        25 percent of accounting staff have weak English language proficiency.
        21 percent of accounting staff are women, and there are few women in leadership positions.
        Training opportunities are not regularly scheduled or sufficient for performing duties.
        Accounting staff are not regularly transferred.
        Accounting staff often feel pressure to perform activities that test their adherence to ethics.
        Total staffing at spending agencies does not appear balanced.

135. Key findings from the USAID report that were also reinforced by focus group
discussions were that staff have rarely changed ministries in the recent 6–10 years, and that
training opportunities were felt to have been few and overly short. A further key issue raised
was the fact that accountants in line ministries have received less and less information about budget
execution in recent years, making it difficult to assess what level of funds to still consider as

                                                                                                     64 | P a g e
available for expenditures. Consistent with USAID findings, TAs have also observed that
accountants receive instructions that run counter to their professional standards.

136. Salary expenditures for the national Ministry of Finance have grown significantly
over the years, as have allocated operating expenditures (Figure 4.7). Following a rise in wage
allocations during the initial years, staff numbers and the wage bill ‘jumped’ from FY2012/13
onwards, when customs officials started being included, following South Sudan’s independence.
Furthermore, actual wage bill allocations were significantly higher than budgeted. Higher-than-
budgeted expenditures are mainly shown as having been spent by the Directorate of Administration
and Finance. Actual operating expenditures have also been significantly higher than what has been
budgeted (Figure 4.8). The greatest overrun in this regard occurred in 2008, and the gap has
gradually diminished since then, but still continues through the most recent year for which outturn
data is available.

137. It appears that the operating funds of the MoFEP have served as a de facto
contingency fund, in addition to the ‘official’ contingency line in the budget.63 While this
practice was gradually reduced up to 2014–2015, it seems to have resumed with full force in 2016.
For the first three quarters, the MoFEP’s operating expenditures exceeded budgeted allocations by
over 2100 percent, compared to an average overspending of 345 percent. While some
overspending is inevitable due to the differences in nominal figures following the devaluation, this
suggests that the MoFEP still spent about 100 percent more in real terms, while nearly all other
agencies had to dial back. It is also not entirely clear what expenditures are included, given that
power and Internet connectivity in the MoFEP—typical non-wage operating expenditures—have
also been reduced.

138. With regard to the subnational levels, state and county budgets are difficult to obtain
and are not uniform across entities, making comparisons more challenging. Figure 4.9 reflects
the number of people on State Ministry of Finance and State Revenue Authorities (SRA) at the
beginning of FY14/15 for nine out of ten states.64 The figures reflect that staff numbers are
substantial also at those levels. Significant technical assistance under the USAID CORE II

63
   For example, for the very large 2008 overrun, the 2009 budget states that SSP 50 million (~US$23.5 million) were
transferred to the SPLM as oil revenues that should have been sent to the SPLM in 2005 as well as SSP 30 million
for transport of Dura to the states. Net of the categories ‘specialized supplies’ and ‘donations’, the overrun shrinks
from over SSP 500 million (~ US$235 million) to (still substantial) SSP 26 million (~US$12 million) for 2008.
64
   Some state budgets combine staffing numbers and salary figures for the SMoFEP and SRA under one budget line.
For the sake of comparison across states, in states with two separate agencies, staffing numbers and salary figures
were combined. Lakes did not prepare a budget in FY14/15.
                                                                                                        66 | P a g e
program was provided to support state-level use of Financial Management Information System
(FMIS) modules. The withdrawal of this support as a result of the civil conflict revealed that state-
level staff were reliant on this TA to ensure accurate reporting, especially on the use of
intergovernmental fiscal transfers.

 Finance, Trade and Industry; Lakes did not prepare a budget in FY14/15.

139. At county levels, capacity has remained highly constrained. Beyond the cross-cutting
challenge of finding and retaining qualified staff, counties have been particularly constrained by
the availability of funding. Own resources are extremely limited, and intergovernmental fiscal
transfers have often gotten ‘stuck’ at the state level—either administered on behalf of counties or
diverted to other functions (World Bank 2015a, 2015b). As a result, local governments have had
only limited opportunity to ‘learn by doing’. Some officials express frustration about why staff
should spend time in training or invest in developing budgets if there are no resources to manage.

140. The right hand scale of Figure 4.9 reflects the PFM-related wage bill at the
subnational level.65 A clear oddity is the fact that while Upper Nile has by far the largest number
of staff, it shows as having the smallest wage bill. It is unclear whether this is related to the conflict


65
  Given the format of SSEPS II data for subnational levels, it is not possible to disaggregate the grade level or
classification of staff carrying out PFM functions for states and counties.
                                                                                                         67 | P a g e
or due to inaccurate accounting. The second most conflict-affected state, Jongelei, in contrast,
shows a high wage bill relative to staff, as does Unity State. The other states had broadly aligned
staffing numbers to wage bills.

141. With the creation of new states and counties since October 2015, capacities and PFM
functionality at subnational levels deteriorated. Given the withdrawal of support and the
deteriorating security situation, no detailed assessment is possible. The national Ministry of
Finance made some efforts to offer guidance and training to subnational staff in new states and
counties. As of late 2016, only 3 out of 28 states (Jonglei, Jubek, and Imation) were reporting their
expenditures through the FMIS. Additional efforts were made to enable new states not connected
to the system to use and submit manual expenditure reports.

4.2 Capacity strengthening support provided by development partners
142. Ministry of Finance and other PFM-related officials in spending ministries and at
subnational levels have benefited from significant efforts at strengthening capacity of the
various departments over the decade since 2006. Figure 4.10 provides a schematic overview of
the type of institutions and their main directorates which training efforts have targeted. The main
development partners contributing to PFM strengthening efforts have included the AfDB, DFID,
the European Union (EU), UNDP, USAID, the World Bank Group, as well as the bilateral donors
contributing to the CBTF.
143. However, these efforts have faced a number of challenges. Initially the needs were
overwhelming, and so various efforts started in different areas and seem somewhat scattered in
retrospect. Further, the timing of certain training posed challenges, as there were often expectations
that new legislation would be in place, which would then provide the standard on which the
training would be focused. However, all PFM-related draft laws experienced delays of several
years, and some laws, such as the Procurement Bill, as well as the implementing regulations for
the Public Financial Management and Accountability Act (PFMAA), still remain pending.

      144. Additionally, while it should have been feasible in principle to provide a substantial
      share of staff with training, there were limiting factors both on the government side and on
      the side of development partners. Even taking into account that some training would have been
      needed to ‘build basics first’ for staff with insufficient prior skills and qualifications, in principle
      the provision of training to address such shortcomings and then develop skills further could have
      been feasible. However, this succeeded at best partially. On the one hand, the government has had
      insufficient commitment to create the enabling conditions for such training to take hold and have
      an impact. The acceleration of revenues collected until 2011 (from the oil sector) dampened
      incentives to actually pursue good management of public funds. On the other hand, from the side
      of development partners, short funding horizons, volatility, fragmentation, and rotations made it
      difficult to stay the course with regard to supporting capacity.

      145. An important limiting factor from the South Sudanese side were the decisions to
      discontinue Sudanese legislation, combined with substantial delays in adopting new
      legislation—in a context of initially uncertain independence, as well as other factors. An
      organic budget law, the PFMAA, was initially expected to be adopted by 2008, to enable
      implementation on a clear legislative basis within semiautonomous Southern Sudan. De facto, the
      PFMAA was only adopted at independence in 2011, while implementing regulations still remain
      under development five years later. New procurement legislation to replace 2006 interim
      regulations still remains pending as of 2016.66


      66
        While the decision to discard Sudanese legislation is understandable, and in line with decisions taken by some
      other countries that won independence after a period of conflict (for example, Kosovo with regard to former
                                                                                                                69 | P a g e
146. Since independence, the national government initiated several steps to improve policy
and regulation for subnational governments, with support from development partners (and
specifically through the Local Governance and Service Delivery Project [LGSDP] and Budget
Support Initiative [BSI]). The adoption of the 2012 Local Government PFM Manual and Local
Government Human Resource Management (HRM) Manual provide clear guidance on how
systems are to be managed. In turn, this has helped harmonize donor partner training at subnational
levels including under EU technical assistance for sub-national capacity building in payroll and
public financial management (EUTAPP) and the LGSDP.
147. Sufficient resources were dedicated in principle: the initial JAM estimated a need for
support of US$53.9 million for PFM capacities between 2005 and 2011, and this amount was
subsequently exceeded de facto. Early assistance was provided by a Low-Income Countries
Under Stress (LICUS) TF, the MDTF-SS, the CBTF, and USAID’s CORE I project (see Table
4.2). Funding from development partners helped establish the initial physical infrastructure to run
a government in Juba, including refurbishing and putting in place new buildings, equipping the
Ministry of Finance with IT systems (hardware and software), starting a ministry website, and so
on. Assistance was provided under the MDTF-SS focusing on planning capacity, and on
procurement and external audit. Early support from the CBTF provided assistance with developing
initial financial statements and with an initial renovation of the GATC and trainings held there. In
addition to trainings provided at the GATC, staff were sent on trainings outside the country.

148. Some of the funding flowed toward ‘bridging capacity gaps’ through technical
assistants, rather than building national capacity. An Accounting Agent was used to prepare
the accounts of the government from 2006 until 2009; and a Procurement Agent was in place from
2007 to 2009. Both of those contracts were largely focused on directly executing the tasks at
hand—that is, regularly producing accounts and undertaking specific procurement processes—and
did not involve significant capacity transfer. Interviews with procurement TA who worked during
this period indicate that though knowledge and skills transfer was a part of the TOR at the time,
TAs were held accountable for ensuring rigorous and timely procurement, which often required
doing the work directly themselves. Interviews also revealed that counterparts at the time were not
well placed to absorb new skills; subsequently, a younger cohort of procurement specialists with
a better skills mix has been brought into the Ministry of Finance and has received additional
training; but in those years a key challenge was that very little procurement was carried out given
the shift from development to humanitarian assistance and the macro-fiscal crisis, and so staff were
unable to learn by doing.

149. There were significant challenges in coordinating support, particularly with regard
to reaping synergies, and in ensuring continuity of support for specific institutional aspects.
There was a broad division of labor—with USAID-funded assistance focusing on budget execution
and on revenue, Norwegian technical assistance focused on advice to the macro department
(including estimation of oil revenue), and BSI support focused on budget preparation and transfers
                                                                                                   71 | P a g e
to subnational levels. However, there was no mechanism to coordinate further what the support
across these functions was meant to achieve. Also, any disagreements—for example, how to focus
on basic systems rather than seeking to achieve more advanced functionalities and what this would
mean for individual directorates and processes—remained largely unaddressed.

150. One major project to support the development of PFM functions started in 2006, with
the USAID-funded CORE I project (2006–2013), followed by a second phase CORE II (2013–
mid-2015). The project had a volume of US$93 million, that is, going well above what the JAM
had estimated as ‘needs’ for PFM strengthening. A review of the project led to some changes being
made during the implementation period in 2010. USAID decided to continue this support in 2012–
2013, initiating CORE II. However, first it took some time for the second round to get off the
ground; and then implementation was disrupted by the outbreak of conflict in late 2013. In mid-
2015, CORE II was cancelled. This reflects how capacity-strengthening efforts in South Sudan
have been affected by stop-go support.

151. The development, sustained maintenance, and use of IT systems for PFM functions
has posed significant challenges. An FMIS was first installed in 2008 with assistance from
development partners. The selected package was Freebalance, which has also been used in a
number of other postconflict countries (Kosovo, Liberia, Timor-Leste). However, in parallel, a
different system for budget preparation (Budget Preparation System [BPS]) was developed by
members of the Deloitte team under USAID CORE II. There were some disagreements as to
whether the Freebalance budget module or the BPS should be the main software used for budget
preparation. Due to several factors, the BPS remained in use: no development partner committed
sufficient funding to technically roll out Freebalance to the line ministries, and as the
USAID/Deloitte team had to scale down their support, the BSI team decided to help the Ministry
of Finance continue the BPS as the relatively simpler solution. At subnational levels deploying
and maintaining IT resources (that is, computers, mobile Internet, generators, and fuel for
electricity, toner, and printer paper) has posed an even greater challenge.
152. A further limitation with the use of the FMIS has been that there was no political
commitment to ‘commitment control’. This is true at both the national and state levels. Thus,
the potential functionality of the system to limit commitments of spending agencies to their budget
allocations has never been put to use—something that the IMF as well as other partners have
repeatedly highlighted as a key shortcoming. Rather, the system was only used to record actual
expenditures and to generate monthly and quarterly expenditure reports. For some years,
developing timely and ‘cleaned’ expenditure information was supported through the Deloitte team.
However, this process slipped once the support ended. This is especially the case for state-level
reporting, which was eroded significantly by the withdrawal of CORE II.



                                                                                       72 | P a g e
153. For the Tax Directorate, the CORE projects sought to support the development of a
database of individual tax payments, which likewise faced significant challenges of continuity
after support ended. Programming information was not left with government counterparts. On
the government side, the ministry failed to acquire sufficient programming capabilities (either
through hiring IT staff or through contracting with a capable national or regional firm). While the
Ministry of Finance developed a small IT team within its Administrative Directorate, this is mainly
skilled in networking issues, that is, keeping existing functionalities running, but not in
programming. Programming skills are essential for addressing emerging software problems, as
well as for reconfiguring systems even in limited ways when any changes to processes or systems
are adopted—which can be quite frequently in a recently established system.

 Box 4.2. National Audit Chamber
 South Sudan’s Supreme Audit Institution is modelled on the Westminster model. In 2006, the South Sudan Audit
 Chamber (SSAC) was established under Article 195 of the Interim Constitution of Southern Sudan (ICSS) of 2005.
 Currently, Clause 186 (1) of the Transitional Constitution of the Republic of South Sudan, 2011, provides for the
 establishment of an independent institution to be known as the NAC. The constitutional provision was
 operationalized through enactment of the National Audit Chamber Act, 2011.

 The Multi Donor Trust Fund South Sudan (MDTF-SS) Core Fiduciary Systems Support Project which
 closed in March 2013 supported the NAC with External Audit Agents who were professionals and assisted in
 preparation of a strategic plan (for 2011–2015), manuals, training, and audit of government accounts from 2005 to
 2010.

 The World Bank subsequently supported the chamber through an Institutional Development Fund (IDF) titled
 Strengthening the Capacity of South Sudan National Audit Chamber. The core objective has been to strengthen the
 institutional systems and capacity of the SSAC and promote accountability in the use of public resources. This is
 done through South-South learning through support from regional Supreme Audit Institutions, and face-to-face and
 on-the-job training for the staff. It is intended that the NAC will effectively leverage on its limited financial and
 human resources, experience sharing, building sustainable capacity, and improving the quality of their audits.

 As of 2016, the chamber had about 100 national staff. Out of these, only 3 (Auditor General and 2 Deputies
 Auditor General) are professionally qualified. So far, the NAC has managed to audit and report to the President
 and Parliament on the national government accounts for the financial years ended June 2005 to 2008. Through the
 support of this IDF, the audit of the accounts of financial years ended June 2009 to 2013 have been completed
 awaiting but remained pending in the National Legislative Assembly (NLA).

 In principle, the NAC is responsible for auditing at national as well as subnational levels. However, it has lacked
 non-wage operating resources to actually visit subnational entities.

154. To create an in-country training platform, the government sought support for the
revival of the GATC from 2010 onwards, but with limited success (see also Box 4.3). First,
courses were offered for accounting staff from the MoFEP and from spending ministries in 2008

                                                                                                         73 | P a g e
(see Budget 2009: 46), and training courses delivered by external consultants using the GATC as
a venue since 2007. However, doing so effectively has proved challenging, and has also been
affected by stop-go engagement in recent years. There is a perception that many of the initial ad
hoc trainings offered at the GATC were too short—for example, only 5 or 10 days—and the
duration was insufficient to really absorb new ways of doing things;67 that trainings focused too
much on general principles, as well as on examples from other countries (for example, Kenya or
Tanzania) and not enough on specific processes as in place in South Sudan; and that they did not
offer certificates (Fritz and Ort 2015). Efforts to create a proper curriculum and syllabus were
initiated, but this process has struggled as most assistance went on hold in 2016.

 Box 4.3. Government Accountancy Training Centre (GATC)
 The GATC, originally called the Regional Accountancy Training Center (RATC), was established in 1978 by the
 UNDP. The UNDP and the University of Juba determined training standards and the center trained civil servants
 from Equatoria, Upper Nile, and Bahr el Ghazal. The UNDP handed the center over to the government in the 1980s
 when the war broke out and they were unable to operate it. The GATC operated during the war with only short
 interruptions, providing training in bookkeeping and accounting. Some courses lasted as long as several months.
 Trainees applied for training and were pre-screened by level of education. Training was provided for approximately
 four hours per day, and trainees were assessed at the end of the training and given certificates after passing exams
 administered by the GATC.

 Following the CPA, the first funding for the GATC was from CBTF-I through the HELM Corporation in 2006.
 HELM started delivering training in 2007. From June 2009, the AfDB funded HELM to continue providing
 trainings. This support ended after 12 months in June 2010. HELM training (largely delivered from the GATC) is
 often referred to as ‘GATC training’, but this is a misnomer; the GATC used to be an institution but became more
 of a venue.

 In 2010, the MoFEP began efforts to revitalize the GATC as an institution and transform it into a key resource for
 building PFM capacity among civil servants, including those from subnational levels of government. This effort
 was supported by the CBTF and the Joint Donor Team under a project which also provided for local trainees to
 attempt United Kingdom Association of Chartered Certified Accountants qualifications with the GATC serving as
 the examination center. However, out of the 50 national PFM staff who enrolled, most failed to achieve even the
 lowest ACCA qualification.

 The GATC operates under a GRSS steering committee headed by a Director General for Budget in the Ministry of
 Finance.

 Renewed support was provided under the Project Preparation Facility from the World Bank in 2015–2016. In
 collaboration with the University of Juba, the GATC developed a draft curriculum in 2016. The curriculum was
 peer reviewed by similar institutes in Africa, including Liberia’s Financial Management Training Program. A draft
 syllabus has also been developed by the GATC and is under review.68

 The Department of Accounts in the Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning has made requests to development
 partners on several occasions to revamp the GATC to make trainings homegrown. This could potentially reduce

 reasons. After the renewed outbreak of violence in July 2016, further support remains on hold.

155. Training was also provided for subnational-level staff, including on planning,
budgeting, and budget execution. Successful government initiatives to standardize systems and
train subnational staff managing public finances have been supported by development partners.
These include annual state budget workshops where budget ceilings are released and state officials
develop their annual budgets. A further innovation which was developed by the government and
has been funded by various development programs (LGSDP, State and Peacebuilding Fund [SPF],
EUTAPP, and BSI) has been ‘state mentoring teams’. Composed of an official from the MoFEP,
MoLPSHRD, Local Government Board (LGB), and a service delivery agency (MoH, MoE, or
MOWRI), these teams travel to state capitals periodically to coach staff on systems for PFM
(largely execution of and reporting on intergovernmental fiscal transfers) as well as payroll
management. However, at the subnational level, staff turnover and shifts have posed significant
challenges. This was then aggravated with the decision in late 2015 to create 18 additional states.

156. Capacity support activities also enabled government staff to undertake a number of
study tours and to participate in regional conferences. Generally, management-level staff in
South Sudan are well familiar with PFM practices in neighboring countries, including Uganda,
Tanzania, and Kenya. A consideration is the high level of per diem and travel allowances which
are associated with such trips. Given that these are seen as a way to compensate for low and
decreasing salaries, selectivity and careful design may be required to ensure that further tours have
an effect.
157. Alongside specific training activities, development partners funded a number of
budget and budget-execution related workshops—between the MoFEP and spending ministries
as well as between the MoFEP and state-level ministries. Efforts were also made to combine some
‘frontal delivery’ of training with on-the-job support/on-the-job learning. This was mostly done
by TAs who were resident or semi-resident, and who had a good sense of specific training needs.
158. The number of TAs who worked in different directorates and functions of the
Ministry of Finance alone is estimated as having grown to around 10 by 2009, and to around
40 at the peak in 2011–2012. This would correspond to around 10 percent of civil service staff.
As of 2016, the figure is again around 10, in particular following the closure of the CORE II project
in mid-2015.69 Some TAs have been resident in South Sudan, while others have been ‘peripatetic’

with varying durations of presence in the country. TAs report that they delivered both organized
training sessions and on-the-job training.

159. One important missing element of capacity-strengthening efforts for PFM is an
absence of monitoring. Given that ‘capacity gains’ are difficult to quantify or even to assess
objectively, few efforts in this direction have been made. This is an important lacuna. There has
been a mutual sense between the government and development partners that the results of capacity-
strengthening efforts remained unclear. TAs consulted as part of this analysis noted that
monitoring of ‘skills transfers’ remained limited; and the issues are also noted in various
evaluations for the key major projects that were undertaken (for example, for CORE I).70 While
not subject to easy fixes, Chapter 6 of this report seeks to set out some ideas of how monitoring
could be improved going forward. One important aspect in this regard is to ‘go beyond’ the narrow
monitoring between individual development partners and specific consultancy teams and to
develop a more holistic monitoring with regard to what improvements in capacity are being
achieved in the key functional areas; passing of exams for specific qualifications, and so on.
160. A further missing element—more from the government side—has been a lack of
attention to staff performance even in an elementary way. Staff are receiving their monthly
pay whether they are making an effort or not. Thus some staff receive pay even while rarely
actually undertaking work; and those who do engage in work have typically not received extra pay
or career opportunities. One TA noted that a key bottleneck to transferring knowledge was the fact
that they only met their counterpart six months into a yearlong deployment.
161. Related to attention to staff performance, turnover has been a challenge. The UNDP-
managed IGAD program which twinned over 1,000 regional civil servants with counterparts for
one to two years in national and subnational ministries found that turnover of subnational staff
made it difficult to transfer skills. Phase II of the program has adapted by twinning regional civil
servants with a larger number—between 4 and 16 twins—with the hope that at least some of the
counterparts will remain in place for the 1–2-year program.
162. Overall, one issue that stands out in South Sudan is the mixing of (most) basic
challenges with attempts at more advanced reforms. On the one hand, South Sudan started off
very limited capacities in 2005–2006, including an absence of staff, very low level of familiarity
with any form of IT applications, and so on. At the same time, at least for some years, South
Sudan’s budgets became fairly sophisticated in terms of reflecting programmatic information, and
even providing detailed information on planned investment projects in 2013–2014. Efforts were
being made to establish macroeconomic modeling capabilities in the Ministry of Finance, and to
develop a national development strategy. At the same time, on the ‘basics’ side, some initial efforts

                                                                                         76 | P a g e
were made to develop good enough cash management and accounting and reporting capabilities;
however, signs that progress in these areas was stagnating and then slipping emerged relatively
early on.

4.3 Main causes and symptoms of slippage in capacity since 2012
163. Since 2012, the quality of PFM in South Sudan has stagnated or slipped backwards
in several areas, with limited further progress in some. This deterioration was gradual in 2012–
2013, including some still hopeful actions taken in 2013, and then deepened since 2014.

164. With regard to budget preparation, efforts at including programmatic information
in the annual budget declined. Efforts in this regard peaked in 2011, and were reduced
subsequently. Following the restart of oil production in May 2013, 2013–2014 saw an attempt at
including greater information on key public investment projects, also linked to a top-level initiative
to introduce a greater performance orientation in the government. However, this was a one-off
attempt that was not continued the following year, when the country was already in conflict.
165. Also, from FY13/14, only the first six months of execution are reported in the annual
budget plans for the following year, reflecting a deterioration in the capability to produce
timely reports. Changes in assistance with generating budget execution reports on the one hand,
and greater challenges resulting from the austerity situation on the other hand, triggered a back-
slippage on the timely production and distribution of in-year expenditure reports.
166. From FY14/15 the situation worsened, and it has been less and less possible to actually
capture and record spending, as well as to develop budgets that had any realism even in
aggregate terms. With the drop in available resources relative to spending commitments, as well
as the continuation of internal armed conflict until August 2015, the ability and the commitment
to record expenditures in a meaningful way declined.

167. One of the few remaining areas of relative progress in 2012–2014 was the commitment
and efforts toward strengthening the systems for making subnational fiscal transfers and for
creating systems to obtain expenditure reports from subnational levels. New fiscal transfers
targeting service delivery were devised, and the government sought to honor these commitments
even after the outbreak of conflict in late 2013. However, the limited further progress that was
achieved in this area is likely to deteriorate in 2016 and beyond. On the one hand, there are barely
any transfers to be made following the devolution and the decline in revenues related to the fall in
oil prices. On the other hand, capacities have been disrupted significantly by the establishment of
28 states. The Ministry of Finance is seeking to shore up past gains at least somewhat by
distributing instructions on manual recordings and related forms.

168. As of 2016, deterioration in PFM capacities continues, with a particularly challenging
situation with regard to treasury functions. Many staff in the Directorate of Accounts who
                                                                                          77 | P a g e
previously received training have left for other roles, while the pressures and challenges on the
treasury continue to grow. Payment orders are being issued by the Treasury, but are not associated
with funds actually being transferred to the block account of spending ministries. Suppliers have
remained unpaid, and increasingly, salaries and operating costs are also in arrears, while the value
of salaries has collapsed.

169. The very large discrepancy between available resources and spending commitments
creates a widespread pressure toward circumvention of rules and formal processes. This
starts with the collection of revenue and with ensuring that such revenue actually reaches the
consolidated fund, and continues at all points along the expenditure chain.

4.4 Conclusions and implications for potential future support
170. Despite the substantial assistance provided over the past decade, PFM capacity
remains inadequate in South Sudan as of 2016, combining some limited improvements with
unresolved constraints, as well as backsliding in recent years. Some of these weaknesses are
not only due to the successive crises since 2012 (austerity, civil war, ongoing fiscal crisis), but also
due to reasons going beyond this crisis period. Regarding the latter, leadership and managers
throughout the system have not encouraged or may even have discouraged financial accountability.
This has put staff who have actually sought to apply their training into a difficult position, and
seems to have been associated also with the rotation of such staff.

171. Within the Ministry of Finance, capacity gains appear to have been stronger in the
budget directorate, and less so in accounts. The budget directorate currently has a larger number
of active staff. Those who have been involved as TAs over a period of time report increased
strategic capacities as well as of basic skills (for example, using Excel, PowerPoint, and so on).
Support from the Budget Strengthening Initiative has been concentrated on this department, and
over the years, staff who received degrees and work experience abroad (mostly East Africa) have
been added.
172. In part, operating a PFM system literally ‘under the gun’ has been a key constraint.
In South Sudan, the military side of government has continuously dominated over the civilian side
rather than vice versa. Moreover, the military has not been one coherent force, but comprises
competing groups. Thus, payment vouchers are being issued under a direct threat of violence, as
well as under the influence of rent-seeking interests who can—vaguely or more directly—also
resort to threatening violence.
173. The current crisis environment is aggravating capacity constraints. As of mid-2016,
the fiscal and forex crises have led to a situation where many ministries, including the Ministry of
Finance, only have intermittent power or Internet access. At the same time, the value of salaries


                                                                                           78 | P a g e
has dropped by 70 to 90 percent since the devaluations; and salary payments experienced delays.
Given this situation, attendance of staff at work has declined.

174. The acute fiscal crisis has led to a situation where control over cash management has
been lost. Payment vouchers are issued by the Ministry of Finance, but funds are then not de facto
available in the accounts of MDAs at the BoSS. As a consequence, payment orders are left pending
or need to be reversed and arrears mount. With only few TAs currently available in particular to
the Accounts Directorate, recording what payments are actually executed and which ones remain
pending has become rather chaotic; and this is overwhelming the capacities of staff.

175. To get traction on how capacity is strengthened and deployed going forward will
require some significant changes, as well as building on some fragmented foundations that
currently exist. Experience from previous TAs suggests that creating routines and systems that
everyone can follow and ‘grow into’ is an important asset for making and consolidating capacity
gains. This in turn is reliant on a sufficient number of TAs being in place to support establishing
systems and routines and to keep them robust for some time, and then to gradually scale back the
external support. It also requires a commitment that civil service staff will stay in place long
enough to adjust to routines and learn systems.

176. The risk of a ‘strong TA’ approach is that it just continues dependency rather than
involving real capacity transfer, but it is also important to see TAs more as an asset and a
source of information for the design of interventions. As past experience shows, to the extent
that TAs are required to produce results, they will often focus on getting the job done first and
foremost. At the same time, TAs have to be recognized as an important asset in a difficult context
as they often have more detailed information and ‘institutional memory’. A number of TAs have
remained far longer in country than the staff of development partners who rotate more frequently.
Thus, TA providers can potentially be an asset for identifying what has been tried to date, and how
support could be calibrated for any new interventions.

177. A further risk is that TA providers can face incentives to ‘keep quiet’ about problems,
such as those with better embedding the FMIS, as long as they face strong incentives to show
continuous progress to funding agencies. Approaching assistance to South Sudan with realism
and being frank about the fact that progress is being hindered by technical, financial, as well as
political reasons will be important going forward.

Specific further suggestions for how these challenges could be addressed are set out in Chapter 6
of this note.

5.       Capacity in the Health Sector
178. Decades of civil war and underinvestment have maintained South Sudan’s health
system in a chronic state of fragility. In spite of the external support, progress in health outcomes
has been modest over the past 20 years and outcomes remain among the lowest in the world while
in line with most conflict-affected states in the region such as the Central African Republic or
Somalia. Since the first Sudanese civil war in 1955, the health system has almost entirely relied
on humanitarian organizations. At the time of the CPA and independence, the key question facing
the government and donors was how to transition from a humanitarian-led health system to a
government-led one while fostering equity and quality services.

179. National human capacity71 in the health sector has been built very slowly and remains
highly insufficient but finding skilled people has been only one of the barriers to the
transition to a more nationally led health system. As highlighted in Chapter 2, it is important to
underline that other variables also are critical to the overall capacity to deliver services: health
infrastructure; inputs such as pharmaceuticals or medical equipment; robustness and equity of the
health financing structure (donors, government, user fees, and so on); and PFM (particularly
procurement and intergovernmental fiscal transfers). Core functions of the health systems depend
entirely on external financing such as the provision and distribution of pharmaceutical
commodities. Several stock-outs have been experienced since independence, highlighting the
vulnerability of the delivery system to the external health financing structure. Overall, more than
two-thirds of the health sector is funded by donors and humanitarian organizations.
180. Challenges have grown more daunting because of the civil conflict and the ongoing
macro-fiscal crisis. The amount of resources flowing to health, including for operating costs as
well as salary expenditures, has been reduced. As of June 2016, the Juba Teaching Hospital had
limited electricity and health worker salaries were delayed by up to three months, which has
directly affected the quality of care. The latest cycle of violence has led to looting and destruction
of health facilities, especially Upper Nile, Unity, and Jonglei, and health workers fled the conflict-
affected areas and the country. This compounds an already severe human resources shortage rooted
in an underperforming basic education system and professional training, recruitment, and retention
challenges. The proposed creation of new states and counties is putting an additional stress on
intergovernmental fiscal transfer and human resources systems that had—up to 2015—been
gradually improving.




71
  In the context of South Sudan, human capacity refers to the availability of skills to perform the core functions of
the service delivery system and achieve the quality of services set out in the Basic Package of Nutrition and Health
Services in 2009.
                                                                                                         80 | P a g e
181. Between 2005 and 2015, capacity shortages have been repeatedly highlighted in key
documents72 as a bottleneck and priority for improving the health service delivery system in
South Sudan. The policy recommendations formulated in these documents have focused on the
production of newly trained health workers. However, efforts to implement these
recommendations have suffered from (a) limited funding and attention from both government and
donors due to competing humanitarian needs and (b) from systemic issues outside the health sector
that weaken their feasibility, especially the poor general education system.
182. Government and donors’ efforts to produce newly skilled health workers have
achieved only limited results due to systemic challenges, especially in attracting, recruiting,
and retaining staff in public facilities. As public servants’ salaries are not paid regularly, and
facilities not equipped nor staffed with critical workers, the MoH and donors’ strategy to increase
the number of newly trained health workers—although necessary—will not produce the expected
outcomes in the expected time frame.

183. This chapter provides an analysis of the main capacity development challenges,
drawing the scarce data available in the country, previous reports, and interviews carried
out in May 2016 with government officials, health care workers, training institutes, students,
NGOs, UN agencies, and donors. It provides first an overview of the structure of the health
system and institutional capacity challenges, the resources flowing in the sector, and the
government responsibilities in human resources management before providing an analysis of the
availability, production, training, and recruitment and retention of clinical health workers.

5.1 Health status
184. South Sudan’s key health indicators have slightly improved over the past 15 years
while remaining significantly behind neighboring countries (see Chapter 3). Chronic exposure
to conflict, widespread malnutrition, low access to water and sanitation, and the overall
underperforming health system are key determinants of this situation.
185. Indicators strongly influenced by the availability of skilled clinical personnel seem to
have had mixed performance. Only 19 percent of births are attended by skilled personnel, far
behind the Sub-Saharan countries’ average of 49 percent and other postconflict countries such as
Liberia (61 percent). While huge disparities within South Sudan are noticeable (Western Bhar el
Ghazal reached 60 percent in 2015) (MoH 2015; LQAS 2015), this poor performance is partly the
result of human capacity shortages, particularly skilled midwives, obstetricians, and gynecologists.
While the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was one of the highest in the world in 2006 with over

Management and Training” in 2010, the Health Facility Assessments survey in 2011 and 2013 and the Health Sector
Development Plan 2012–2016, the strategy paper on “Scaling up Mid-level Health Cadre in South Sudan” in 2014,
and the National Health Policy 2015–2024.
                                                                                                  81 | P a g e
2,054 deaths per 100,000 live births,73 in 2015, model estimates suggest that the MMR in South
Sudan could have dropped to about 789 per 100,000 births, a level near the Central African
Republic, Burundi, Somalia, and Liberia. South Sudan’s MMR is still three times higher than
neighboring countries such as Rwanda (290), Sudan (311), or Uganda (343).74

5.2 Structure of the health system
186. Overall, the system is inefficient and vulnerable to financing shocks, but it is relatively
effective in maintaining a minimum level of services across the territory through the
combination of government, NGO, and private sector providers.
187. The structure of the health system is complex and reflects the leading role played by
humanitarian organizations in delivering services since the first Sudanese civil war. The
current system embeds three subsystems: the government system, the humanitarian system, and
the private for-profit system. Each system can be modeled using three variables: (a) Funding, (b)
Point of delivery, and (c) Staff who deliver services. Staff, funding, and medical inputs (especially
pharmaceutical commodities) flow across the subsystems’ boundaries which, in practice, creates
strong interdependencies between them. Health workers can be recruited by government,
nongovernmental, and private for-profit providers. The distribution of this resource among the
three subsystems is fluid and changes depending on the constraints and incentives that health
workers (salaries, conflict, geographical location, resources to carry out their duties, and so on).
Notably, some government health care workers are paid by donor-funded programs while some
humanitarian staff deliver services in both government and NGO facilities. Medical supplies are
provided by a combination of NGOs, donor programs, UN agencies, and, to a lesser extent, user
fees collected at the facility.
188. Donors’ support to service delivery is organized geographically through three main
programs. Since 2012, the Health Pooled Fund (HPF) covers service delivery in six states, while
USAID and the World Bank each support two of the remaining four states.75 This has created

73
   World Bank (2013). Based on the 2006 household survey, MMR was estimated at 2,054 per 100,000 live births
(2006 Southern Sudan Household Health Survey). In addition to significant statistical caveats, it is important to note
that this figure is a rough estimate of the MMR during the mid-1990s and not for 2006. Although there are no recent
robust estimates of MMR, for the 2007–2008 period, a 2013 World Bank poverty assessment put the figure at 2,000
maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and noted that this “updated estimate indicates that maternal mortality in 2007-
08 remained at a catastrophically high level, similar to that during the height of the conflict.”

maternal mortality: 1990 to 2015. Estimates by WHO, UNICEF, UNFPA, World Bank Group, and the United Nations
Population Division. Caution is needed in understanding the MMR estimates as the estimate points are also associated
with wide confidence intervals. For example, the confidence interval for the Sierra Leone MMR is 999–1980, and the
MMR confidence interval for South Sudan is 523–1150.
75
   USAID has been supporting the states of Central and Western Equatoria and the HPF has covered Eastern
Equatoria, Lakes, Warrap, Unity, Western Bahr-el-Ghazal, and Northern-Bahr-el-Ghazal, while the World Bank
supports Jonglei and Upper Nile States.

inequities in funding between states, coordination challenges for the MoH, and inefficiencies in
the health system, notably for the provision of pharmaceuticals, contracting of NGOs, and
monitoring. Some HR systems are linked to particular donor programs, which partially explains
incomplete geographical coverage. Among others, the Human Resources Information System has
been rolled out only to the states covered by the HPF, although there are plans to expand it to the
whole country. Capacity-building activities have focused mostly on national institutions and
County Health Departments (CHD), giving the State Ministry Of Health (SMOH) less attention
(mostly due to the key role of counties in delivering primary health care). The World Bank has
been the only program contracting the CHD instead of NGOs for service delivery while building
their management capacity.

189. The shortages of clinical capacity in health facilities and coordination and regulation
capacity in the government has raised some discussion about the model of service delivery
the country should aim for. The debate about the long-term balance between public and private

                                                                                                      83 | P a g e
provision of health services is still a matter for discussion in the country and this report does not
take a stance on what the long-term service delivery system should be in South Sudan. It rather
offers an analysis of the structural barriers to strengthening the overall capacity of the system and
providers to deliver the expected services with concerns for quality, accessibility, and
sustainability. Independently of the model that the country will aim to achieve, South Sudan needs
to fill the health human resource gaps to improve health outcomes and reduce the dependency and
cost associated with international health workers.
190. Filling such gaps domestically will take decades but South Sudan may be in the same
situation 10 years from now if the government and donors do not dedicate significantly
higher resources and efforts to capacity development in the short and medium term (see
recommendations section). Current systemic weaknesses in the public delivery system are de facto
contributing to the growth of private for-profit health providers in urban areas while rural areas
rely on donor-funded NGOs and government facilities, and humanitarian providers. Whether the
current cohabitation of the three sub-systems remains or the country shifts toward more private or
public delivery systems does not affect the need to strengthen the regulatory and coordinating role
of the government, which is currently lacking.

191. Given the multiplicity of actors involved in the financing, management, and delivery
of services, the coordinating and leadership role of the government should be essential but is
in practice limited by the low availability of skilled human resources in the MoH and by the
low share it has in the overall financing architecture of the sector. The country faces similar
coordination challenges as those often encountered in conflict environments. The fragmentation
of the different programs and divergence of interests between the government, development
partners, and humanitarian organizations remain a large source of inefficiencies in the service
delivery system.

192. At the national level, there is some human capacity to perform core functions but the
MoH’s leadership tends to rely on the relatively more efficient technical assistants. At
independence, there was almost no capacity in the MoH to perform PFM and budget-related tasks
nor to manage decentralization, and TAs were leading these activities. Several TAs have been put
in place after independence to build capacity in health institutions and, where it is lacking, provide
capacity substitution. Although the health system has been stressed by the civil conflict and macro-
fiscal crisis, longstanding PFM weaknesses have a direct impact on payment of salaries and
operational costs and thus on recruitment and retention of staff at the state, CHD, and facility
levels. Today, the MoH is leading these processes at the national and state levels. At the state level,
there are highly skilled staff who are constrained by the lack of skilled colleagues at all levels in
the SMOH.

193. Technical assistance has significantly reduced since December 2015, which has
translated in lower performance and slower response times but overall, core functions are
still being carried out. Anecdotal evidence indicates that 20–25 percent of TA time is dedicated
to providing capacity that is not available in the MoH, and 75–80 percent is dedicated to
performing functions that could be handled more cost-effectively by local staff (substitution
effect).76 Several TAs from USAID, World Health Organization (WHO), Liverpool Associates in
Tropical Health (LATH), and NGO Coordination Forum have ended, which has affected the
functioning of the system. For example, an embedded TA in the MoH supported the coordination
between the CHD, SMOH, and MoH for government grant application to support service delivery.
As the TA stopped, the coordination was interrupted and the CHD was not receiving information
or feedback on applications. The number of grant requests from the CHD fell to zero in January
2016 due to the lack of coordination and information. Another example is that the national
coordination with NGOs was almost entirely interrupted when the NGO forum staff who was
embedded in the MoH left. Without TAs, other functions would stop. For example, the district
health information system (DHIS) is technically managed by the HPF, although with more training
(which requires resources), MoH staff have the capacity to take over.77
194. Formal training for staff at the MoH and SMOH level has been scarce but those
dealing with daily activities are the most successful. Some capacity built with past TA remains.
For example, the MoH capacity to implement the HRIS to other states is fully owned by the MoH
and could be expanded to the remaining areas (security conditions and fiscal resources permitting)
in 2017 without the need for HPF technical assistance. After independence, the SMOH received
some basic training on leadership and management from the USAID-supported ‘Health System
Strengthening’ program. The SMOHs report that trainings such as ‘how to conduct meetings’ or
‘planning operating transfers to counties’ have been the most helpful and are still applied to carry
out their daily tasks. At the CHD level, the World Bank health rapid results projects have focused
on building basic management, M&E, HR, and PFM capacity in the CHD that had staff with some
skills. The pilot has been successful, was expanded to six counties in Jonglei and Upper Nile States,
and is under consideration by the HPF and MoH for replicating the approach in other parts of the
country.

195. The fragmentation of the state and county administration is increasing the need for
skilled public servants at the state and county levels, which is not fulfilled. Some core functions
(HR, PFM, M&E) need to be handled at the SMOH level and thus require new staff to manage
them in the 18 additional states. Given the current hiring freeze, the SMOHs cannot recruit to fill
these positions, leaving functional gaps in the new SMOHs. The gaps are compounded by SMOH

76
   Interviews indicate that MoH management tend to use TA resources because they respond faster than local staff,
even though local staff have the capacity to perform the functions.

staff leaving the institutions due to the lack of salary payment, or the salary differential with
NGOs or the MoH78 (the SMOH do not receive the infection allowance). At the county level, the
more than 200 counties envisioned by the government, in principle, require the creation of as many
CHDs, for which staffing will face the same supply and financial constraints as the SMOH. The
capacity shortages have created tensions between the former administrations and the new ones
concerning the management of resources. The newly created SMOH and CHD are not minimally
staffed and technically cannot perform basic functions but they claim their legal right to decision
making and resource management.79

5.3 Resources for health
196. A 2016 Public Expenditure Review in Health highlights the high dependency of the
health system on external funding. Government expenditure is only 14 percent of total
expenditure in Health. Development and humanitarian partners finance between 65 percent and 74
percent of the spending, while households’ out-of-pocket expenditure on health fills the remaining
gap (see Figure 5.1) (World Bank 2016b). With US$9 per capita (at purchasing power parity),
South Sudan had the lowest government expenditure per capita on health in the world.80 Since the
CPA in 2005, the government successively reduced the share of the health sector in overall
government expenditure, from over 7 percent in 2006 to 2 percent in 2015, reflecting the increasing
priority given to the security sector over social development (see Annex 8.1).

197. The combined level of government and donor expenditure is insufficient to cover
salaries, operational costs, and investment in health infrastructure, creating unfavorable
conditions to attract and retain health workers in health facilities run by government and
NGOS. Since independence, macroeconomic and fiscal shocks have limited the ability of the
government to finance the investments envisioned in the Health Sector Development Plan 2012–
2016, in particular those related to infrastructure and capacity building. Approximately two-third
of government expenditure goes to health finances salaries and one-third to operational costs
(although a significant share of operational costs seems to be actually used as salaries). In
2014/2016 and 2015/2016, the government did not dedicate any financing to the procurement of
pharmaceutical commodities, relying entirely on donors and humanitarian resources, which only
partially cover the needs (World Bank 2016c).
198. The quasi-permanent focus on resolving immediate humanitarian crisis and
compensating for the lack of government financing has limited donor financing for building
local clinical and institutional capacity. Almost all capacity-building activities are funded by
donors. Over the period 2012–2015, donors have allocated approximately US$30 million to human

resources development programs in the health sector, compared to over US$900 million to direct
service delivery, including humanitarian activities.81 Since independence, less than 4 percent of
the MoH budget allocated to HRD has been executed, totaling US$600,000 between 2012 and
2015 (see Annex 8.2).82

199. Given the current macroeconomic and fiscal context, the dependency on external
financing for paying health care workers’ salaries, operational costs and capacity building
activities is unlikely to change in the short term. The MoH needs to strengthen its ability to
monitor, coordinate, and regulate development, humanitarian, and private providers’ activities.
The link between training, recruitment, and retention of health care workers in public health
facilities must be strengthened for both the government and NGOs to avoid newly trained health
workers leaving the health sector to work in sectors not related to health.

5.4 Government distribution of responsibilities for human resource management
200. The responsibilities of the government in the health sector are divided among the
national, state, and local levels of government (see Annex 8.3). Counties are responsible for the
provision of primary health services while the national and state administrations are responsible

for delivering secondary and tertiary care, handling policy and monitoring functions, and
allocating resources and ensuring that they flow to frontline services.

201. The identification of staffing and training needs, the recruitment process, payroll, and
allocation of resources are shared between different level of governments and ministries and
they are not strongly linked. In theory, the MoH recruits staff for the three teaching hospitals and
Kiir Mayardit Women’s Hospital, the SMOH for state and county hospitals, and counties are
responsible for recruiting local health staff and paying them (PHCU, PHCC, and CHD) (GRSS
2014). At all levels, staff appointments are confirmed through the MoLPSHRD (for the national
level) and through the State Ministry of Public Service (SMOPS) for subnational levels before
being incorporated into the government payroll. In practice, there are overlapping HR functions
between the MoH and SMOH and between the SMOH and counties. The MoH recruits, deploys,
and pays some doctors, nurses, and lab technicians in state hospitals instead of the SMOH.
Similarly, although payroll is supposed to be split between states and counties, some counties’ HR
functions for the PHCC and PHCU are handled by the SMOH. Some CHDs identify staffing needs
and send requests to the SMOH which then provides provisional appointments before the SMOPS
confirms permanent appointment.83

202. Training of doctors is shared between the Ministry of Education and the MoH, while
training of mid-level health cadres is shared between the SMOH, SMOE, MoH, and MoE.
Post-graduate training is mostly managed by the MoH. The specific challenges associated with
HR are further analyzed in the rest of the chapter.

5.5 Current state of skills in the health sector
203. Skills shortages in the health sector has been chronic in South Sudan. During the
second Sudanese war (1983–2005), a significant number of skilled health workers left Southern
Sudan (formerly composed of the three regions of Equatoria, Upper Nile, and Bahr-el-Ghazal) to
neighboring countries. Before the CPA, Southern Sudan had the lowest availability of clinical
workers in the then Sudan, which is very low by global standards. In 2001, there were less than 2
physicians per 100,000 inhabitants and 8 qualified midwives in Southern Sudan (see Figure 5.2).
After the CPA, former soldiers were absorbed into newly created health institutions and were given
positions without having the necessary skills (mostly in the MoH and SMOH).84

204. At the time of the CPA, donor-supported programs attempted to bridge the gap
through quick-win strategies. Many health workers who had fled during the war came back to
Southern Sudan through a USAID-funded program but most of them did not stay due to the low
level of salaries. More than 2,000 South Sudanese were trained as Traditional Birth Attendants

(TBAs) and village midwives through a 9-month-long training and absorbed into the government
payroll with the goal of quickly deploying them throughout the country to reduce the catastrophic
MMR. Today, village midwives and TBAs remain mostly unskilled workers, sometimes
implementing harmful practices for the populations and creating tension with newly trained skilled
registered midwives and nurses. As they have poor levels of basic education and literacy, most
TBAs and village midwives cannot be upgraded to the level of a registered or diploma midwife.
The potential recruitment of newly trained skilled health workers into the government payroll is
made more difficult due to the existing TBA wage bill. 85

205. After independence, the estimated gap in health workers was estimated to be 15,000
(see table 5.2). The recruitment plan would have brought an increase in the number of
nurses/midwives from 2 to 3 per 100,000 people between 2012 and 2105 and the number of
physicians from 1.5 to 3 per 100,000 people.86 Filling this gap would have required a 650 percent
increase in clinical staffing within 4 years (2012–2016) across the whole sector. In addition, there
was a need to provide supplementary training to active health care workers whose skills were often

                                                                                                    90 | P a g e
that only 2.5 percent of PHCCs meet the MoH normal standards.87 The same assessment indicated
that even if we divided by 2 the minimum number of staff required in a facility and ignore the
certification requirements for nurses and midwives, only 13 percent of PHCCs would meet the
criteria (see Table 5.3 for disaggregate data by cadre). This is a slight regression compared to
earlier years: in 2011, 15 percent of PHCCs met that criteria, and although the difference may not
be statistically significant, it confirms that the situation had not improved since independence
(MoH 2013).
207. Partial data seem to indicate that while there has been some progress, there is still a
gap of more than 11,000 priority staff in public facilities (independent of whether they are
employed by the government or NGOs). The 2016 HRIS data indicate that there are
approximately 2,000 priority staff (as defined in Table 5.2) in 5 out of the 10 states (see Table 5.4)
and based on partial data, there could be around 4,000 staff in the remaining 5 states—Central
Equatoria, Western Equatoria, Jonglei, Upper Nile, and Unity.88

208. At the time of the CPA, the government and some donors were planning to
progressively absorb part of the South Sudanese health workers working for NGOs into the
government payroll while increasing the training of medical students to fill the human
resource gaps. The 2012 oil shutdown and recent macroeconomic and fiscal crisis hindered the
MoH ability to absorb more staff on the payroll. Given the persisting humanitarian needs and the
limited supply of newly trained local staff, NGOs have maintained their staff on their own payroll
and partially filled the gaps by attracting health workers from outside the country.

   This excludes TBAs and village midwives who are on the government payroll but not considered as ‘skilled’ workers
in the assessments (due to literacy problems and low level of training—no more than 9 months).

209. Based on the limited data available (see Table 5.4), foreign workers seem to be a
minority of health care workers (less than 4 percent)—but the HRIS is likely to
underestimate foreign staff. In the five states covered by the HRIS, only 69 workers are
foreigners, out of 1,989 clinical workers. About 77 percent of foreign clinical workers are
Ugandans. Almost all of them work at the facility level, mostly as nurses, midwives, clinical
officers, lab technicians and to a lesser extent, specialist doctors (anesthetist, gynecologist, and
surgeon). As there are no representative data from nongovernment providers, it is impossible to
quantify the extent to which the system is dependent on foreign health care workers for service
delivery (though they have a leading role in training and tutoring students; see section 5.6 on
training). While there are no comprehensive data on NGO staff, some examples seem to confirm
that foreign workers are a minority among health care workers. Médecins Sans Frontières currently
deploys a total of 3,000 South Sudanese staff and 330 international staff, indicating roughly a 1:10
ratio of national to non-national staff for both clinical and nonclinical workers.

210. The distribution of health workers across states is uneven and 40 percent of them
have their salaries paid by donors and NGOs.89 Western Bahr el Ghazal and Eastern Equatoria
have twice as many health workers as Lakes, Warrap, or Northern Bahr el Ghazal. These two states
also rely less on donor support. More than 50 percent of the staff in Lakes, Warrap, and Northern
Bahr el Ghazal are funded by the HPF while in Eastern Equatoria and Western Bahr el Ghazal,
overall, less than 20 percent of the staff are funded by the HPF (see Figure 5.3).

211. The plans to scale up training of health workers have focused entirely on the supply
side (that is, increasing the number of trained people), leaving recruitment and retention
issue unaddressed. In 2014, several HR development strategies and recommendations developed
since 2005 have led the MoH to order double the production of newly trained mid-level cadres
while upgrading certificates to diploma degrees (extending the period of theoretical and practical
training) (MoH 2014). This ongoing strategy foresees the increase of the number of classrooms,
qualified tutors, equipment, learning materials, access to facilities for practical training and
mentoring, and development of tracking mechanisms of graduating students. However, in practice,
only three or four donor-supported institutes have been able to dedicate enough resources to
implement the plan in a way that will produce the expected quality of training. While these
objectives face feasibility and financing challenges on the ground, they are necessary to fill the
capacity needs in the sector 20 or 30 years from now but will take even longer if actions to foster
recruitment and retentions of health workers and students are not undertaken.

5.6 Production issues
5.6.1 Limited pool of candidates for training

212. In South Sudan, the pool of potential candidates is limited due to the dysfunctional
and underfunded education system, as discussed in Chapter 3. In 2005, the JAM already
emphasized the severe capacity constraint in the health sector due to limited supply of secondary
school graduates. Such capacity shortage has been intrinsically linked to the state of the education
system in the country. As all clinical staff should have a minimum level of reading and writing
skills, as well as basic mathematical and science skills, a long-term capacity development strategy
in the health sector cannot be built without a performing education system, which is lacking today.


                                                                                                   93 | P a g e
213. Interviews with partners and training institutes confirm the difficulty enrolling
students with the required qualifications in the medical school at University of Juba and in
mid-level cadres programs. The most common challenges are (a) generally low level of literacy
and basic education; (b) lack of knowledge of English (primary and secondary education done in
Arabic, especially in the northeast); and (c) lack of mathematics and basic chemistry/biology
knowledge and more importantly ‘practicals’ (non-theory courses); for students coming from
South Sudanese schools compared to those attending schools in neighboring countries (see Annex
8.4); 4), the perception of the relatively low ‘social status’ associated with mid-level cadres.

5.6.2 Limited training capacity for clinical/medical education

214. Although most of the recruitment of students into medical schools and training centers are
based on a relatively good meritocratic basis, some enrollments are imposed through political
pressures exerted on educational institutions, resulting in unskilled students being enrolled and
compounding issues of over-enrollment in programs and crowded classrooms.
215. South Sudanese students trained in South Sudan attend pre-service training in health
training institutions (often called Health Science Institutes) for mid-level cadres and in South
Sudanese Universities for physicians. Mid-level cadres’ programs are mostly funded by donors,
faith-based organizations, SMOHs, and student fees. Medical school is mostly financed by the
MoE, MoH, and student fees. Those trained outside South Sudan study abroad mostly for high
cadres’ programs (mostly in Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, Ethiopia, and Egypt). These finance their
studies through their own means or to a lesser extent, through donor-funded programs (to Canada,
United States, or other African countries).
216. Building upon ten years of HR assessments and strategies, a 2014 Review of the Health
Training Institutions in South Sudan by HPF identified the following key barriers in HRH:

      Linkages between stakeholders in the system appear weak, which affects system
       efficiencies as well as the quality of training and service delivery.

      Duplication of ‘on-the-job trainings’ from different partners. The same workers are
       trained several times on the same topics, with limited impact.

      Resources currently provided to support health care training and health care systems
       are insufficient, especially in the areas of staff; teaching and learning materials (only 2
       Health Training Institutions [HTIs] had adequate student/textbook ratio);
       laboratories/demonstration rooms (only 2 HTIs had adequate structure); and health care
       facilities supplies. HTIs are underfunded and overwhelmingly financed by partners. Only
       3 HTIs are fully run by SMOHs and the MoH pays staff salaries in 3 HTIs but does not
       cover any other costs. Partners provide the remaining funding and technical assistance.

                                                                                      94 | P a g e
          There are not enough tutors, instructors, and qualified mentors, and their skills are
           limited. Faculty and clinical instructors need more support, supervision, and training to
           perform their roles more effectively and to transfer quality knowledge to students.

          Policy on attracting and retaining students and tutors and clinical instructors is weak
           (no visible career pathway for tutors; no system to link training and professional
           development to promotion or change in salary).

          Weak systems for identifying, recruiting, and training clinical mentors or preceptors.

          Saturation of clinical placements sites for student’s practical training (not enough
           health facilities to be trained at with appropriate mentor/student ratio), which affects the
           quality of training.

          Curricula for health care training, while strong in many aspects, need evaluation,
           revision, and standardization to align with national priorities and international standards.
217. In 2015/2016, the student intake doubled compared to 2014, and over 950 students
were admitted in mid-level cadre programs in 15 Health Science Institutes (or HTIs),
reflecting the fact that efforts to quicken the pace of ‘production’ are having some effect. One of
the institutes has been relocated to Uganda due to the conflict in Jonglei State. Nine of them are
concentrated in the Equatoria region while three are in Wau (see Table 5.5). At this pace, the skills
gap could theoretically be filled in 15 to 20 years.90 However, as in other countries, there are
concerns that ‘forcing up’ the numbers of trainees against quantitative targets ignores the need to
also scale up the capacity for quality instruction, related to the factors outlined just above.
218. The scale-up policy of the government and donors is not supported by the
corresponding level of resources (funding, tutors, classrooms, learning materials, and so on)
and the financing burden has been transferred to students and donors. Interviews in Juba
indicate that HTIs have been pushed to admit more students than they have capacity to manage,
creating overcrowded classrooms, with no equipment and learning materials available to students.
Although medical school is theoretically free, in 2015/2016, students had to sign a commitment to
pay a SSP 5,000 tuition fee “if the government could not pay”.91 In response to the lack of
government financing, the HTIs for mid-level cadres that are not supported by donors have
implemented tuition, which in Juba, is SPP 3,500 per student.

219. The lack of skilled professionals and tutors to train students constitutes a severe
bottleneck for scaling up health workers’ training. At independence, HTIs were
underdeveloped and there were not enough tutors to cover the training needs. In 2011, an estimated

90
     Assuming some degree of dropouts and trained staff leaving the sector, but without a more dramatic turnover.

number of 7 tutors were available in the country for a need of 533 (see Annex 5). Tutors are
considered ‘qualified’ if they have completed a diploma and a tutor training but as diploma
programs have started in recent years, in the short term, training and practical mentoring will rely
heavily on international professionals.92

220. Moreover, such a scale-up policy will increase the pressure on placements for
practical training, even though there are already not enough skilled health workers in public
facilities to mentor students. Partnerships with humanitarian NGOs and private providers could
be explored to distribute students more evenly across the 3 subsystems.

221. The production capacity of physicians is very low (around 60 students per year
compared to over 350 graduating students in Uganda and Kenya) and training is only
available for the few areas for which specialists are available in the country. To train as
physicians and specialists, students must study at the College of Medicine at the University of
Juba, which was relocated from Khartoum to Juba in 2007.93 Until 2015, graduating students from
medical schools had only one year of assignment in one of the three teaching Hospitals (Juba,
Wau, and Malakal),94 after which they would be recruited by the SMOH or NGOs. However, as
the MoH and health partners realized that doctors were not able to deliver the expected services
when they were deployed in county hospitals, PHCCs, and PHCUs, the college of surgeons and
physicians was created in July 2015 to provide the trainees with the skills to ‘perform basic
surgeries with confidence in remote areas’ (at the county and payam levels), extending the training
from one to two years.95

222. For Juba medical school, the limited pool of potential candidates graduating from
South Sudanese secondary institutions is complemented by South Sudanese students who
have studied abroad and are better equipped for university studies. For the cohort scheduled
that graduated in 2016, 14 out of 60 students had a foreign educational background (intake of
2008), mostly in Sudan and Uganda, and to a lesser extent in Kenya and Ethiopia. The different
education systems create significant knowledge and skill gaps between the students when they
enter medical school.

223. The challenges experienced by students during their pre-service training reduce the
likelihood of joining government facilities, foster dropouts, and also affect service delivery
in teaching hospitals. Scholarships to help students pay for transportation, learning materials, and
living expenses suffer from the same woes as government salaries (that is, delays and
nonpayment), forcing students to take up other jobs (mostly in security companies or as school
teachers) and leaving them with less time to study. In 2015/2016, most students did not receive
scholarships and interns (known as ‘house officers’) went on strike at the Juba Teaching Hospital
over unpaid ‘incentives’.96 Given their role in the referral and delivery chain, service delivery was

   In 1992, due to the war, the Universities of Wau, Malakal, and Juba were moved to Khartoum and merged into
one entity (for students and staff who were willing to go there). After the CPA, the universities came back to their
city of origin.
94
   Due to the December 2013 conflict, the only places to intern are Juba and Wau. Malakal hospital is not receiving
students for practical training.

   Although interns do not receive salaries per se, they are supposed to receive financial incentives from the
government as a compensation for their work in hospitals. In 2016, 61 interns worked at the Juba Teaching Hospital.
In 2016, a newly inaugurated HTI in Aweil was calling for donor support to finance SSP 400 monthly scholarships
to prevent student dropout (120 students intake 2015/2016), as well as to buy fuel for the generators.
                                                                                                      98 | P a g e
interrupted at the hospital. Accommodation reserved for students is—irregularly—occupied by
former doctors who are not working for the government but for NGOs or oil companies, creating
a housing shortage for students and triggering additional out-of-pocket expenses. Although no data
are available to assess the extent of the issue, these challenges seem to foster dropouts from the
health sector. As some programs in Kenya and Uganda offer up to US$1,000 (including free
accommodations) to intern in referral hospitals, all these issues reduce the capacity of South Sudan
to retain human capital in the country, affecting both public and private health providers.
224. On-the-job training for government and NGO clinical staff working in public
facilities is limited. On average, 81 percent of health care workers reported having received some
training over the past 12 months in 2013. This represents an increase of 9 points compared 2011
(see Table 5.6). However, each staff received occasional trainings covering very few different
areas. More than half of the staff received training related to malaria, which would reflect both the
priority given to malaria diagnosis and treatment by donors and by the government and the
relatively high level of resources allocated to its treatment. While it is difficult to isolate the staff-
related effect from other variables (availability of drugs, campaign outreach, and so on), we can
observe that the rate of treatment of malaria has improved over the past few years (see Annex 8.6).
However, the higher trainings in immunizations and antenatal care have not translated in higher
outcomes (see Annex 8.7).
225. In-service training is mostly funded and performed by donors and NGOs. On-the-job
training relies heavily on international staff contracted by NGOs (both doctors and mid-level
cadres). Although training is conducted on an ad hoc basis rather than following a planned
structure, skills seem to be transferred to local staff working for NGOs though limited by the
general weak educational background.97 In government facilities, similar skills transfer can occur,
where NGO staff work with government workers. However, in government hospitals, there is no
real training due to the lack of incentives, qualified tutors, resources, and the widespread apathy
rooted in the absence of salary payments and overall dilapidated public health system. Few doctors
from the diaspora are providing on-the-job training to local clinical staff on an ad hoc basis, with
great difficulty in finding ‘trainees to train’.98

226. The major training initiatives have focused on mid-level cadres with maternal and
reproductive health, partly due to the alarming MMR which was three times higher than most
African countries (2,054 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2006). Many partners have supported
trainings through HTIs with funding and technical assistance.

227. International programs for training tutors have very small intakes, they are partially
working and graduating tutors face the same disincentives as other health professionals. In

none of the students were trained in midwifery. For nine of them, the degree pursued was unknown.

5.7 Recruitment and retention challenges
228. Increasing the number of South Sudanese health workers can only increase the
capacity of the system if they are employed and retained by government, NGOs, and/or
private providers. Currently, the conditions for recruiting and retaining newly trained health
workers in the health sector are not met, mostly because too few scholarships are paid, government
health workers and tutors are not paid, and the resources to carry out their duties are not available
in most facilities (specifically medical inputs, equipment, accommodation, and security).

229. There is a disconnect between the supply and demand for health workers. Training
institutes and medical school do not have systems in place to track students who graduated. As a

result, there is no knowledge of whether students work in the health sector upon graduation or
what organizations they work for (government, NGOs, or private sector). The absence of feedback
mechanisms between training institutes and employers results in missed opportunities to know
whether employers are satisfied with the skills and training of the students and to improve the
curriculum accordingly. While the demand for newly trained health workers is high, NGOs and
government facilities are not coordinating with training institutions to link job seekers with the job
market.101 This disconnect seems to limit the effectiveness of the HR strategy as some students
remain unemployed upon graduation and health providers struggle to fill vacancies. The situation
for private providers is not known, though, since the localization in urban centers may reduce the
recruitment difficulties and linkages with graduating students.

230. The sector as a whole (NGO, private, government) does not face an absorption
challenge from the standpoint of risk of saturation. As described earlier, the needs for skilled
health care worker remain largely unfulfilled, especially in rural areas. In addition to vacant
positions, a significant number of personnel delivering health services in government facilities are
unskilled (especially TBAs), calling for either their replacement or their training (although limited
by the illiteracy rate). The government’s most important challenge is its financial capacity to
absorb new staff in the payroll given the 2012 hiring freeze and the current macro-fiscal crisis.
NGOs have greater financial capacity (although still limited) to absorb new workers and face
difficulties to attract skilled personnel (including foreign workers), especially to work in remote
areas.

231. Nonetheless, interviews with students and partners in Juba seem to indicate that
young graduates would prefer to work in public facilities than for NGOs or private
providers. The parameters influencing their decisions are the following:

          Pride and responsibility to serve the people of South Sudan.

          The problem of regularity of payment of government salaries is more important than the
           relative salary differential with NGOs and private providers (although the current
           magnitude of the gap seems to ease the decision process).

          Availability of support staff in the facilities (skilled nurses and midwives, administrative
           staff) to be able to carry out their duties.

          Minimum medical equipment available to carry out their duties.

          Availability of accommodations and water for facilities in remote areas.

          Security conditions in the area of duty.

232. Graduating students from the College of Physicians and Surgeons mention that
working in a region where they are not originally from is not a concern for them as long as
the working conditions and salaries are provided. However, other interviews indicate that
NGOs need to adjust the level of salary, benefits, and currency of payment to be able to attract
workers from other regions, especially to remote areas. While health actors in some regions (such
as Aweil) emphasize the difficulty to attract health workers, the figures seem to indicate that they
have a relatively high number of staff compared to other regions (see Table 5.2).
233. To reinforce the link between training and recruitment, some counties are funding
the clinical studies of students from their counties and hiring them as civil servants before
they start their programs. In 2015/2016, 30 students coming from Central Equatoria, Abyei, and
Pibor were sent by their counties to the Central Equatoria Health Science Institute. However,
counties report facing issues finding candidates with secondary education. Some graduating
students do not come back to the counties and go to work for NGOs or abroad due to the low
government salaries offered at the county level. So while in principle, it is a good idea to train
people on the initiative of their home community, there are still challenges on how to make this
work in practice, especially in the context of deeply eroded salary levels.

234. The nonpayment of government workers who are on government payroll has become
an increasing obstacle to attract and retain newly trained workers in government facilities.
For government workers, the problem has been recurrent since independence and is being
compounded by the recent macroeconomic and fiscal crisis. As already highlighted in 2010,
government health workers are not receiving their salaries regularly—if at all—which makes it
very “unlikely that the recommendations can be implemented and that any effort put into
strengthening the capacity of HR planners, managers and trainers will be useful.”102 By mid-2016,
health workers’ salaries had not been paid for at least three months. Interviews in Juba indicate
that in the absence of salary, some doctors and mid-level cadres on government payrolls are
working ‘part-time’ in private for-profit health facilities while remaining on the government
payrolls. In this case, while medical staff may remain in the country, without adequate regulatory
capacity, the growth of private providers increases access and equity issues. Moreover, while the
government put in place a ‘hardship allowance’ to attract health workers to rural areas, it has—in
practice—not been implemented mostly due to budgetary constraints. Few doctors join NGOs
since they usually do not recruit doctors to deliver services but rather offer temporary duties to
design public health programs and conduct training of lower levels of cadre.

235. Health workers on government payroll seek better income predictability by working
for NGOs, private health providers, creating their own clinics (for physicians only) or by

leaving the health sector to work in non-health-related businesses.103 Salaries paid by NGOs
and private sector providers are both higher than the government and workers are almost always
paid. In spite of several MoH efforts to harmonize salaries between NGOs and government health
workers, NGOs have kept using the U.S. dollar to pay the salaries of local health workers (or they
indexed SSP salaries to U.S. dollars) to compensate for inflation and attract and retain health
workers.

236. Up to October 2014, the SSP value of salaries paid by the government and by NGOs
was relatively close, making the reliability of salary payments the key difference; however,
since then the gap has widened significantly (see also Annex 8). Figure 5.4 shows that if two
nurses working for an NGO and in government received the same salary in 2012 (SSP 2,000
monthly or approximately US$450), in 2016, the real income of the nurse whose salary is tied to
the U.S. dollar was 2 to 4 times higher than the real income of the nurse working for the
government and paid in SSP. Competition among NGOs to attract scarce-skills workers (especially
clinical officers) and with private providers have fueled a process of one-upmanship that has
contributed to drive up salaries of the health workforce in the country and to a high turnover of
staff between the three delivery sub-systems.

237. To bridge this gap, the MoH put in place an ‘infection allowance’ that has been
partially implemented in 2015/2016. The infection allowance seeks to increase the salaries of
eligible government health workers to meet those of their NGO counterparts. The effectiveness of
such mechanism has been limited.104 The infection allowance should be regularly adjusted to
reflect inflation and exchange rate variations. As inflation and exchange rate rise and NGOs keep
paying in U.S. dollars, the infection allowance is requiring more and more financing to fully play
its compensatory role (see Annex 8.8 and Figure 5.4). While the exchange rate and inflation could
stabilize with a future peace process, the irregularity of salary payment combined with the
magnitude of the salary gap between NGOs and the government is preventing the government
from attracting newly trained health workers in the facilities.
238. An even more critical issue is that students graduating from medical school and HTIs
are leaving the health sector to work in private businesses such as trade or security
companies (interviews with students from Juba medical school refer to 50 percent of graduating
students). In such cases, the MoH and donors’ resources invested in developing capacity in the
health sector are not contributing to reducing the skills shortage. Both donors and the government

    Key issues relate to the rollout of key IT systems to be eligible. Primary health care workers must meet strict
criteria to receive the allowance, including a personnel file on the HRIS and appropriate qualifications verified by
the MOH at both the county and state levels, and be paid using the employee payroll system (SSEPS).

239. The South Sudanese diaspora has a role in providing highly skilled specialist doctors
for service delivery, building local capacity, and performing key managerial functions in
health facilities. South Sudanese diaspora with medical training are relatively few in number and
are often dual citizens. Local health workers recognize them as a key source of knowledge and
skills that can be transmitted. Even more so, they are also seen as having influence on political
processes and decisions that trigger changes and improve their work environment (funding for the
hospitals, provision of inputs, and so on). While some of them state that their motivation to work
in South Sudan is driven by their commitment to help their country, the sustained irregularity in
the payment of salaries weakens their incentives to stay in the country. Some doctors are also
concerned about staying disconnected from up-to-date medical knowledge (due to the lack of

 Box 5.1. Building a Health Sector Workforce in Timor-Leste (from Institutions Taking Root)
 “The health sector workforce was decimated by the withdrawal of Indonesian health personnel. Of 135 doctors who
 had been working in the region during the Indonesian occupation, only 30 remained, and low levels of qualified
 human resources are still a major constraint on the ministry’s performance. The rapid response of emergency health
 workers and NGOs to the referendum violence, together with the arrival of 230 Cuban doctors in 2004, gave the
 sector a critically needed boost. The MoH’s early and aggressive capacity building also made an important
 contribution to the MoH’s future development. According to the MoH, there are now 1,400 permanent employees
 and 300 vacancies in the health sector. But, with a fragmented and incomplete health information system, it is
 difficult to get a comprehensive picture of the size and structure of the health sector workforce.

 As of 2007, there were some 50 senior managers or directors (grade-level 6 or above) and at least 130 middle-
 management personnel at grade-level 5 or above (Asante et al. 2011, 3). Each of the ministry’s directors interviewed
 for this case study had been a nurse or a health administrator during the occupation, although management
 capacities were still weak after the referendum. Basic management skills further developed through steady and
 consistent empowerment and under crisis conditions. Several MoH and hospital directors, together with district
 chiefs, received training to sharpen their management capabilities, although funding gaps affected the functioning
 of these programs and management skills remain highly uneven.

 District health centers are still run by district health management teams, and these tend to be well resourced, but
 the staff often lack suitable skills. Resourcing sub-district health posts and clinics and staffing the SISCA are
 particularly difficult, and many services continue to be supported by NGOs and the Cuban Medical Brigade. District
 health centers propose candidates for recruitment to health posts and take recommendations from chefes de suco,
 but it is difficult to fill vacancies. The ministry has adopted a top-up policy to incentivize health professionals to
 work in more remote regions. The policy provides an additional 40 percent allowance for staff working in extremely
 remote regions, 25 percent for those in very remote regions, and 15 percent for those in remote regions—but the
 policy is failing to have a major impact. There are simply too few health professionals left in Timor-Leste to recruit,
 and when staff are sent abroad to study, their posts often remain unfilled.

 MoH partners have financed extensive professional development schemes, and these have produced mixed results
 but important lessons. The biggest complaints are that there is no follow-through, training is not linked to the
 allocation of posts or assignments, and there is no on-the-job mentoring. Emergency management of obstetric care,
 for example—a model rolled out by the UNFPA—trains midwives to perform normal deliveries and to recognize
 complications and the need for back-up or referral. But many deliveries are in private homes, and midwives rarely
 feel competent or confident to practice these skills in the absence of supervision or while working alone.
 Supervision is needed but, again, finding health workers willing to spend long periods of time working in remote
 locations is difficult, and the MoH is poorly equipped to support health supervisors on lengthy regional visits.

 With tight human resource constraints, the ministry has found a significant source of strength in its overseas
 professional development partnerships. In the early recovery period, while the European Commission and World
 Bank were revitalizing Timor-Leste’s critical health infrastructure, Australia, Cuba, and China sponsored their own
 health specialists to work in Timor-Leste. Australia and Cuba further financed two long-term overseas professional

 development programs to train cadres of skilled and specialized Timorese physicians. The Australian program was
 financed by the Australian Agency for International Development (AusAID). It was embedded in the National
 Hospital—Guido Valadares National Hospital— and staffed by the Royal Australian College of Surgeons. Based
 on a capacity substitution model, the initiative placed Timorese specialists in overseas training programs, while a
 rotating cadre of Australian surgeons provided specialized clinical services in Timor-Leste. According to
 respondents, the program did not follow conventional capacity development models, and yet it has proven vastly
 more successful than the conventional one-on-one adviser models adopted elsewhere in the health sector.

 Since 2004, Cuba has also deployed more than 200 doctors, known as the Cuban Medical Brigade, to deliver
 frontline health services in the sub-districts of Timor-Leste. Rotated every two years, these doctors have boosted
 health service delivery—including in the most remote parts of the country—and delivered in practicum training to
 returning Timorese doctors and nurses. The Cuban Medical Brigade was key to service delivery during the 2006
 crisis and is the product of a long and productive partnership forged between the governments of Timor-Leste and
 Cuba on Timorese independence. The Cuban and Australian professional development programs constitute an
 important and timely pipeline of skilled resources for the ministry, yet the deployment of new doctors and health
 professionals across the country will continue to test human resource management capacities for some time. (World
 Bank 2013, 3).”

240. Overall, there have been some hopeful signs and gradual steps in the right direction,
but these have taken a number of years to emerge. Thus, the number of people being trained in
the system is gradually being increased—but with major concerns about quality. Stakeholders in
the health systems—from local communities sponsoring medical training to the MOH, NGOs, and
development partners—have experimented with various options for increasing the number of
trained health workers.
241. However, efforts have not yet gelled into an effective system. The education of incoming
students remains weak or patchy, medical training itself faces a number of difficulties and
shortages, and the links between initial training, and then practical pre- or in-service training and
recruitments have been too weak and not sufficiently addressed.

242. Moreover, as of 2016, the system is backsliding and further improvements are
becoming an increasingly steep uphill struggle. As of 2016, the system is beset by several
coinciding challenges: the erosion in the value of salaries, combined with renewed delays in paying
salaries and similarly for scholarships, and the further scarcity of overall funding for the sector,
which makes any level of functionality increasingly difficult, combined with renewed and growing
insecurity.

243. If and when system rebuilding can resume, it will be important to build rapidly on
the lessons learned over the initial decade of state building in South Sudan, as well as on
lessons learned elsewhere, to begin to more quickly redevelop and scale up national health care
provision. Further specific implications in this regard are set out in Chapter 6.

6.     Key Findings and Recommendations
6.1 Summary of key findings
244. This paper has reviewed experiences with capacity strengthening in South Sudan over
the decade 2005–16. The note specifically focused on the civilian public service (only). The
overall size of security sector employment has affected the amount of resources available for other
areas of the public sector. During this period, the country experienced revenue booms and busts as
well as renewed widespread conflict since late 2013 and a failed effort to reestablish peace.

245. The way in which South Sudan came into being complicated capacity strengthening,
with six years of uncertainty over independence between 2005 and 2011. This experience is
not unusual relative to other recently newly independent countries such as Kosovo or Timor-Leste.
A key difference to these cases is that South Sudan did not go through a period of international
administration with its distinct impact on capacity development.
246. South Sudan moved toward independence with low human development and
extremely limited infrastructure but also with inherited staff. The newly formed government
had no formal administrative structures in place. However, the emerging country did not start
entirely from scratch. Staff joined the new administration from the SPLA/SPLM-managed CANS
and Khartoum-managed CCSS, as discussed in Chapters 3 and 4. In principle, there were also
educated members of the diaspora on which to draw.
247. Aid interventions in South Sudan started off with a high level of ambition in terms of
coordination and alignment as per ‘New Deal’ principles, but rapidly became more
fragmented. Some key achievements were made, as highlighted throughout this report. Yet, ex
post evaluations of capacity-building efforts supported by development partners have been very
critical, especially with regard to the short-term, stop-and-go cycles of support. At the same time,
aid efforts were constrained by limited government commitment to establish a functioning public
sector. Furthermore, the government sought to coordinate aid and insisted on the use of country
systems in ways that did not work in reality.

248. As in other countries emerging from conflict, a key tension has been the need to
support the political settlement on the one hand and to establish sustainability and a
minimum level of merit, effectiveness, and efficiency in the public sector on the other. Initial
hiring decisions were highly influenced by patronage and loyalty considerations, tied to coalition-
building strategies that brought powerful national and regional elites into the political settlement
through the distribution of benefits, including higher-level positions within government.

249. Efforts to foster a public sector focused on service delivery to citizens have been
constrained by several factors. Among these is the role of public employment as a social safety

                                                                                       107 | P a g e
net. Government jobs have been associated with the ‘peace dividend’ from the long civil war with
Sudan. A single civil servant may be the main source of income for an extended family, and those
in government feel significant pressure to deliver resources to their communities. An increasingly
large security sector has crowded out the availability of funds for staff and operating expenses in
service delivery sectors, notably for health. Renewal of the service has been hindered by staff being
unable to retire, as well as by hiring freezes for the civilian public service since 2012.

250. Broadly, the pool of educated citizens from which public sector staff can be recruited
remains limited but should in principle be sufficient to recruit adequately qualified
individuals. The magnitude of the ‘skills gap’ varies by sector and employment category. Though
no comprehensive survey is available, there is general agreement among stakeholders that lack of
academic qualifications is the not the most binding constraint on capacity of the civil service. In
PFM, for example, it was found that 89 percent of accountants surveyed in 2013 held a diploma
or degree relevant to accounting.

251. A key issue has been limited willingness and ability to seek more skilled staff.
Gatekeeping functions for selecting and recruiting capable staff into the public service have been
rather weak. Furthermore, South Sudan has a sizable diaspora, and families continue to send
children abroad for education. Yet, there has been reluctance to recruit from this pool.
252. Performance management has been a key issue as it can conflict with the wider
incentive environment as well as be affected by resource constraints. It has been difficult to
discipline and motivate staff who are hired based on relationships. Moreover, in the case of PFM,
some staff who sought to carry out their assigned role were transferred. A related issue is that
resources to carry out assigned functions have been adequate at the national level for main MDAs
but much less so at subnational levels. Furthermore, since oil prices began falling in January 2015
operational budgets are increasingly too tight to facilitate normal functioning.

253. The majority of capacity-building support provided over the past decade was
‘external’, that is, either involving sending civil servants abroad or having training delivered in
South Sudan by external consultants and facilitators. The latter included both regional consultants
and efforts, as well as non-regional ones.
254. As part of this, it is worth noting that South Sudan has been the focus of significant
South-South collaboration. Examples include the trainings provided by the Kenya School of
Government, both in Kenya and through Kenyan staff delivering training in South Sudan; the
IGAD initiative to send civil servants from neighboring countries (Ethiopia, Kenya, and Uganda)
to South Sudan; and numerous study tours to regional countries on various issues. These initiatives
have been overall beneficial but have also experienced constraints and problems. Similar to non-
regionally provided training, an important challenge is to ensure that content is relevant and
tailored to South Sudan rather than being based on rules and regulations in neighboring countries.
                                                                                       108 | P a g e
255. Several efforts have been made to make training ‘home grown’. The Ministry of Public
Service has sought to take a lead in identifying and meeting training needs. These efforts still
remain at early stages. University of Juba hosts a School of Management Sciences and since 2014
also a SPS, offering masters-level training. The Ministry of Public Service has sought to open a
Management Development Institute (MDI) and the MoF to revive the GATC. Renewed conflict
has halted the latter two efforts, while those at the University of Juba still continue albeit with
difficulty.
256. Evidence from regional experiences suggests a number of factors which influence the
effectiveness of these efforts. For example, it is important for the right people to be matched with
the right courses, for classroom learning to be matched with on-the-job training, for material to be
sufficiently tied to in-country policies and procedures, and for there to be some degree of
monitoring with regard to who has been trained and in what. A key criticism in South Sudan is
that development partner support to training has been too fragmented, too short and with short
funding time horizons (for example, not allowing the development of course content and
approaches over multiple years); that the right people are not always matched with the right
programs; that there have been very few efforts to monitor the system as a whole, as opposed to
outputs from a specific project; and that overall there has been too much focus on training as such
and not on the environment in which staff will be redeployed to apply what they have learned.
Moreover, ensuring lesson learning across development partners and TA providers has posed an
important and largely unmet challenge.

6.2 Emerging implications and recommendations
Find better ways to cope with a nonlinear state-building process which affects capacity
strengthening efforts in multiple ways

      Because achieving a political settlement in South Sudan has been and will remain very
       challenging, capacity strengthening support needs to find (better) ways to bridge periods
       of renewed conflict.

257. The environment is very likely to remain challenging and volatile. As set out in Chapter
2, fragile states rarely move along a linear trajectory from conflict to stability and global experience
reflects that even ‘rapid’ transformations can take 20 to 30 years. In South Sudan, the political
settlement has eroded rather than strengthened over the past decade, in particular since 2013. The
widespread withdrawal of development assistance and capacity-strengthening efforts during
periods of renewed conflicts has been associated with an erosion of coordination and backsliding
on efforts previously made.



                                                                                          109 | P a g e
258. Country volatility tends to re-enforce existing tendencies toward fragmentation and
stop-go provision of development assistance. However, to progress, capacity strengthening
requires establishing and subsequently embedding new systems, interlinked class-room based and
on-the-job training, investments in better primary and secondary education, institutionalizing
domestic post-secondary training institutions, as well as a sequencing of assessing needs,
developing strategies, and actually rolling out training efforts. All of such ‘sequenced’ steps are
negatively affected when the funding to sustain them is too short term, uncertain, or cancelled as
new crises erupt. While it will be impossible to completely avoid volatility in external support to
capacity strengthening, more should be done to reduce such volatility. This may also require some
agreements among the international community on how to react to crises.

      Development partners face a dilemma, in that the government has not demonstrated
       commitment to improve governance, but withdrawal of support will further weaken
       institutions.

259. As previous comparative studies (WDR 2011; World Bank 2012) have indicated, in
postconflict countries where government commitment to (demonstrating) better governance is
strong, significant progress can be achieved even within limited periods. However, this condition
has not held in South Sudan and is not likely to hold in the short to medium term. While especially
rapid or significant progress is not likely under these conditions, continuation of capacity
strengthening and technical assistance support, as well as calibrating humanitarian assistance in
ways that enable rather than undermine national capacity particularly in the health sector, remains
crucial to build gradual progress and to avoid deeper backsliding.
260. Some assistance can, in principle, be provided even during periods of heightened
insecurity. Curricula can be developed, externally advised on, and delivered by national staff even
during crisis periods and discussions on lessons learned organized, even when travel restrictions
are in place. As emphasized by the 2011 WDR on Conflict and Fragility, a complete withdrawal
of development assistance (‘stop and go’) can itself contribute to fragility.

      Development partners need to ‘up their game’ on coordination efforts, systematic lessons
       learning, and building on previous interventions.

261. Coordination poses tremendous challenges in particular in fragile states. Ministries
and departments are less able to lead on coordination, and development agency staff are especially
frequently rotated, often with little handover. In addition, regular coordination efforts lapse during
periods of renewed crisis. For new staff and teams, it can be very challenging to access what has
been done to date, who has benefited, and what are lessons learned, previously developed plans
for further work, and so on. Development partners can do much more to accessibly document and

                                                                                        110 | P a g e
     share (a) what has been done and with what effects; (b) lessons learned; and (c) materials
     developed—plans, curricula, training content, and so on.

           Prioritizing funding in a situation of deep austerity in the short and medium term while
            seeking to keep sight of longer-term goals

     262. Development partners have significantly less resources available than during the CPA
     period and feel the pressure to pursue firefighting to address immediate crisis-related issues.
     In this context, it will be easy to become exclusively focused on near-term priorities rather than
     continue to foster investments in the building blocks of a more capable state. But maintaining
     (also) a longer-term view of what steps need to be initiated or continued to not be in the same place
     in 10 or 20 years remains crucial.
1.   Facing extreme austerity in the short and medium term, the question of how funds should
     be prioritized arises, including potential funding from development partners. For example,
     one important trade-off that government has to make jointly with development partners is how to
     balance the alleviation of constrained operating funds as well as wage arrears and devaluations to
     keep existing civil servants functional versus funding for training or versus funding to put in place
     a pension system to facilitate generational renewal.
     Training on its own is not enough. Civil service reforms need to be brought into the policy
     dialogue while recognizing that simple ‘best practice’ approaches will not work.

           Civil service reforms are difficult but critical and should receive greater attention in the
            policy dialogue and development efforts.

     263. Civil service reforms are widely considered as difficult and risky and hence best
     avoided. The experience of relatively low performance of civil service reform projects (DFID,
     Irish Aid, and SIDA 2013; World Bank 2008) has tempted many development partners to avoid
     engaging in this area. However, improving those being recruited into government core and service
     delivery functions, ensuring that basic incentives to perform are in place, and stabilizing salary
     payments are essential elements of improving state capacity in a conflict-affected country such as
     South Sudan. Accordingly, these issues should receive more central attention both in the policy
     dialogue and in the programming of specific operational engagements.

     264. In contrast to the provision of training, civil service reforms tend to go ‘against the
     grain’ of government incentives, and hence there is also less demand from the government
     side. However, development partners can be much clearer in their dialogue that one is not useful
     without the other. Given that wholesale civil service reforms have been recognized as rarely
     successful, a potentially feasible approach to explore is to focus on specific sectors and government

                                                                                            111 | P a g e
and service delivery tasks. Highlighting positive experiences from other countries may also be
useful.

      To make at least some public sector reforms viable, there is a need to balance ‘best practice
       ambitions’ versus feasible, practical steps and gains that can be made during a foreseeably
       difficult short- to medium-term period.

265. Improving recruitment. Since the national Recruitment Board is weak in ensuring
compliance and decentralized recruitment is already ongoing, and since political commitment to
strengthening a central function will not be forthcoming in the context of a divided government, a
feasible approach might be to (a) invest more in making existing guidelines available and ensuring
that HR staff are well versed in these; (b) raise the profile of the importance of ‘good enough’
recruitment in the policy dialogue with government; (c) invest in the capacity of the Recruitment
Board and of state-level MoLPS to monitor compliance with the principle of recruiting qualified
staff and to reward as well as ‘name and shame’ MDAs that most egregiously go against such
principles; and (d) explore the feasibility of establishing complaints mechanisms that allow
individual applicants as well as internal whistleblowers to complain if they feel that rules regarding
recruitment have not been followed and that non-qualified candidates have been hired.
266. Improve HR record management systems. Beyond simple payroll verification, it is
important to track and monitor a wider set of essential HR-related information, such as the
qualification and experience of those in a particular position, and ideally also some basic
information about performance. Restarting earlier efforts of developing an HRIS is important once
the wider context stabilizes and will be an important complement to the electronic payroll system.
Ideally, the HRIS and SSEPS II would be linked, reducing the administrative burden (that is, data
collection and entry) and enabling better IT support.
267. Motivating performance. Staff must feel some urgency to perform their duties. This may
require making it somewhat easier for staff to be dismissed and some form of agreements on
performance at the leadership level. Better monitoring of what is being achieved and reporting on
performance may add value in incentivizing performance.

Training is not everything, but significantly more could be done to strengthen its quality and
impact

      Reconsider the design of training efforts.

268. Donors have taken an overall rather reactive approach to capacity strengthening,
providing funding for various groups in reaction to government demands as well as
perceived needs. This has frequently been done without taking a sufficiently deep look at whether

                                                                                        112 | P a g e
the absence of trained staff is the underlying key constraint, as well as how training provision will
work in giving weak and variable basic education, the need for institutionalizing the provision of
training, and for working with the government on how the use of available capacity can be
improved.

269. Training investments funded by development partners can be improved on a number
of dimensions. Investing more in institutionalizing training (and certification where relevant) and
less in ad hoc and one-off efforts; making training more specific to the day-to-day tasks officials
are expected to undertake, including usage of national rules and regulations, training on existing
IT systems, and so on; and a better linking of organized/classroom based training and the provision
of ‘handholding’ assistance through TAs, including through ensuring that TAs are aware of the
training efforts that are being made for staff in the units where they are posted. As set out above,
moving in this direction also requires improved access to lessons learned and to basic data on what
training has been carried out previously and who has benefited among development partners.

         Especially for shorter term training, it is important to focus on specific skills that are
          needed and immediately usable on the job and to select staff with ‘upgradable’ existing
          skills and performance.

270. For those short-term training efforts that continue, it is important to focus on specific
skills that are needed and immediately usable on the job. Given the low levels of individual
capacity coupled with the limited training budgetary allocation as noted in the findings, it would
be advisable to focus on developing skills directly relevant to delivering on the job, through
appropriate combinations of class-room-based and on-the-job training.

271. Furthermore, it is essential to establish the basic skill levels of participants as a precursor
to training through entrance tests. For example, staff lacking basic numeracy should not participate
in accounting training. To the extent possible, MDAs should also be encouraged more explicitly
to prioritize selecting those staff for training who show a general commitment to their work—in
terms of attendance, pursuing assigned tasks, and a demonstrated interest to improve performance.
It would also be advisable to continue and scale up invest in English language training given a
significant number of Arabic trained graduates106 who can contribute more toward greater capacity
if language limitations are reduced.

         Considering cost-benefit tradeoffs between national and foreign training, invest in
          strengthening domestic training institutions.


106
   Many have technical certifications in Arabic and could easily apply the needed skills in managing the public
service. The only thing needed is for them to learn and translate whatever is needed into English, which is the
official working language.
                                                                                                     113 | P a g e
272. There need to be some decisions taken about what training can best be provided in
country through national institutions and what training should be sought abroad and to
invest in the strengthening of domestic training institutions, drawing also on regional and
international linkages. Training that is needed by a large number of staff—including induction
training, training for tax auditors, and for basic accounting skills and similar basic skills—are
likely best provided in-country and at national institutions, given the greater cost-effectiveness and
a better ability to reach subnational staff. In contrast, for skills that only a few civil servants need,
as well as courses that are specialized or require special equipment (for example, for higher-level
medical training), training may best be sought abroad.
273. Once training that can best be provided in-country has been identified, it is important to
invest in domestic training institutions, including those geared to meeting sector needs for a future
workforce such as the universities’ specialized colleges, training colleges for medical and
educational staff, the U Juba SPS, GATC, HRTC, and so on. Developing and reviving these local
institutions creates a stronger foundation for continuous capacity, and once initial progress has
been made also provides some buffer, for example, against reductions of TAs due to renewed
crises.

       Development partners should consider provision of co-funding to and coordination with
        existing South-South collaboration which largely has run on ‘parallel tracks’ to training
        efforts sponsored by development partners and is more cost-effective than other modalities.

274. Several MDAs have concluded Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) with various
regional countries and further afield to send staff for longer-term training, and some of the
envisaged training was implemented successfully. However, development partner efforts have
largely been pursued separate from these types of initiatives. There is scope to provide additional
funding to regional teaching staff to come to South Sudan to provide training, as well as to efforts
of sending South Sudanese for pre-service or in-service training to regional institutions on
government initiatives, with a strong pull for such staff to return and assume positions in the public
sector. For example, the World Bank pipeline IDCBP has taken initial steps to enable continuous
collaboration between the HRTC and KSG.
275. At the same time, not all South-South collaboration has worked equally well. Again,
documenting and sharing lessons learned among those providing capacity strengthening support—
as outlined above—is crucial to ensure that the South-South potential can be used to the best effect.
Connecting the dots between training and overall development interventions in sectors

       Make TAs and NGOs more fully part of capacity-strengthening efforts


                                                                                           114 | P a g e
276. TAs and international NGOs can make important contributions to capacity-
strengthening efforts, but this potential has not been fully utilized. TAs often have a very close
knowledge of ‘who can do what’ in a given ministry, as well as of the specific training needs that
exist. Moreover, some TA providers and NGO staff have been far longer in the country than the
staff of development agencies. This inside knowledge can be utilized more fully in the design of
capacity-strengthening efforts. For the health sector, international NGOs that receive donor
funding to deliver health services could take on newly trained national staff for further practical
training, for example, for 6–24 months. This could make a significant contribution to upgrading
the practical skills of national medical staff.

      Better connecting training efforts and other investments

277. Staff who receive training need a functional working environment to actually use new
or improved skills. Government and development partners need to jointly commit to ensuring that
staff have at least basic equipment, such as desks, chairs, paper forms, or IT equipment, power,
and water (especially in hospitals and at least water in health posts), and basic pharmaceuticals
and medical supplies in the health sector. Ideally, the availability of such basic inputs should be
part of the joint information collection and monitoring efforts about the ‘what’, ‘how’, and ‘with
what effects’ of capacity-strengthening efforts. This requires effectively linking capacity-
strengthening efforts with overall development efforts made in a particular sector.

Improved monitoring and evaluation of capacity-building efforts is essential

      There is a dearth of information on who has been trained in what; the quality and impact
       of training received; how class-room learning has been coordinated with other avenues
       for capacity building; and the overall contribution to effectiveness.

278. Better information is an essential basis for knowing what was done, assessing what works,
and improving on practical challenges such as matching newly trained staff or staff who have
upgraded their skills with recruitment or promotion opportunities.
279. Keeping track of relevant training efforts will need to be done sector by sector but must
move beyond being ‘within projects’ only. Monitoring efforts will need to be as simple as possible,
matched to the incentives and institutional capabilities on the ground. The Ministry of Public
Service may play a role with regard to providing inputs on how this can best be done, as well as
aggregating information from various sectors for higher-level monitoring of progress and gaps.
For many core and service delivery functions it will require collaboration between key
development partners and the relevant government MDAs.



                                                                                      115 | P a g e
280. Ideally, information to be collected should include feedback on how training can be
improved, as well as feedback from units recruiting newly trained or the staff of which received
in-service training on improvements in performance. Even limited efforts to improve information
gathering and availability can contribute to significant positive impacts in terms of better training,
and better matching.

281. Moreover, to provide aggregate monitoring and to coordinate and channel external
support, it would be beneficial to have a stronger hub in the Ministry of Labor Public Service
and Human Resource Development (MoLPSHRD). In principle, the MoLPSHRD’s directorate
for HRD has this responsibility, but it has been a rather weak directorate in recent years. The
MoLPSHRD overall also has potentially an important role to play in linking capacity-
strengthening efforts and pursuing reforms of the civil service which are crucial for capacity
strengthening to have an impact.
Additional priorities for sector specific actions: PFM
282. For PFM, key areas to focus on are the following : (a) in-service training (job-focused
class-room based linked to ‘on-the-job’) with a view to strengthening the capacity of the existing
cadre, (b) a policy-level agreement to better use existing capacities and to dial back political
interference and undue pressure, (c) initiate long-term training of new cohorts to be able to replace
staff over time and ensure that they meet a contextually relevant public sector accounting
qualification scheme. Furthermore, these actions need to be combined with sustained investments
in the functioning of systems—the availability of rules and regulations, availability of forms,
ability to communicate between levels of government, and sustaining and improving existing IT
systems.
283. Technically, the upgrading of skills and of achieving improved overall capacity is easier,
and more achievable within a short- to medium-term (3–5 year) time frame, compared to capacity
in the health sector, where the sheer gap in numbers is much larger. However, improvements of
capacity for PFM is particularly affected by political commitment to use (or not use) existing
capacity toward achieving progress on this core state function.

Additional priorities for sector specific actions: Health
284. For the health sector, producing, recruiting, deploying, and retaining more qualified staff
will remain a crucial challenge for at least another 10 years and probably beyond. To begin
narrowing this gap, a first key action is to revisit earlier recommendations and commitments
and to identify which of these can be funded and implemented, in particular those of the 2014
HPF/MoH HR report.



                                                                                        116 | P a g e
285. Furthermore, to avoid an erosion of the current baseline and a loss of efforts already
made, donors should pool funding for capacity building and implement the following priority
actions:

   (a) The first priority is, as soon as possible, for the government to return to paying
       salaries of public health workers and teaching/training staff and finding ways to pay
       scholarships of current trainees to prevent dropouts. Once staff and students leave the
       country or leave the public for the private sector or for employment outside the sector,
       motivating them to return becomes difficult. As a consequence, past investments made in
       the medical training of such staff and students have been and are still being lost for the
       entire health system.

   (b) Second, it will be important to revisit options for bringing public sector and NGO-
       paid salaries into closer alignment again while a long-term solution necessarily
       requires macroeconomic and fiscal relative stability. Given the ongoing slide of the SSP
       versus the U.S. dollar, this is an uphill battle as of 2016, but it will remain a critical issue
       for retaining health workers not only in the public facilities but in the country in general.
   (c) Third, develop a platform to facilitate matching graduates to vacant positions, and
       establish better monitoring and tracking of the absorption of trainees into the sector.
   (d) Fourth, systematize practical training of students/future national staff in NGOs’
       structures, at least in those that receive donor funding (and potentially all
       international NGOs). This would contribute to better link college and university-based
       training with the needs of frontline service provision and explore options for bringing
       NGOs into practical pre-service and in-service training.
286. Technically, strengthening capacity in the health sector is more challenging than with
regard to PFM, given the large discrepancy between available staff and sector needs, as well as
the challenges associated with training large enough numbers of medical staff to a sufficient level
of quality.
287. Politically, in principle, capacity strengthening should be easier for service delivery
sectors compared to PFM, given that even relatively poor governments typically perceive some
need to provide services to citizens so as to retain legitimacy and as having more doctors and
nurses has no direct relationship to containing rent-seeking interests. However, as the analysis
has also indicated, the ‘dual exit option’ of relying on internationally funded provision for
citizens and of accessing health care services abroad for elites has significantly reduced the
incentive and the revealed commitment to allocate sufficient funds for upgrading and
expanding the sector, even during the time when fiscal resources were available. If and when the
political and fiscal situation improves, it will therefore be important to (a) have a frank dialogue

                                                                                         117 | P a g e
on these political constraints, (b) consider options for incentivizing greater domestic fiscal
commitments, and (c) raise awareness among nongovernment stakeholders about the policy stance
as one option to develop a greater demand for change and for increasing commitments as a
proportion of the available resource envelope.

Annex 1: Chapter 2 - Multiple Factors Shaping Civil Service Capacity
From Fritz and Ort 2016:
With regard to the overall ecosystem, a first factor is the availability and quality of basic,
secondary, and tertiary education, which shapes the capacity of the pool of potential civil
servants (‘1’ in Figure 2.2). This pool does not necessarily need to be very large, given that a civil
service only makes up 2–3 percent of the adult population. However, governments in postconflict
contexts often have to compete with an influx of NGOs, development partners, and private sector
activities—from banks, to hotels, to breweries—as well as with continuing opportunities for
migration or remaining in the diaspora. The smaller the pool of educated citizens, the higher the
risk that the government cannot recruit or retain staff with sufficient general or specific
qualifications across MDAs and levels of government, and also that patronage-based hiring results
in staff without skills entering the service.

Further crucial factors for civil service capacity are the recruitment function—decisions
about who from the general pool applies for and is selected into the civil service (‘2’), pay
(‘3’), and on-the-job experience (‘4’). In principle, governments should seek to develop a
relatively small civil service that is reasonably well paid,107 recruit the best and the brightest they
can attract, and retain those that perform so as to develop institutional memory and experience.
Yet, in many postconflict countries, factors such as political affiliation/association with military
leaders, regional considerations, legacies of who was or remained employed during conflict, and
family or community linkages play a significant role and shape how the recruitment function takes
shape in practice.

The degree to which this weakens capacity relative to what would be feasible for a country
depends on the distance in qualifications—and motivation—between the pool of potential
applicants and those who actually are selected into the public service. The nature of the
postconflict situation and a country’s legacy will determine whether initially there are many or few
civil servants with longer experience—which can be both a boon and a burden.108 Once
postconflict rebuilding begins, it is in principle valuable if newly recruited civil servants remain in
post for some time to build essential ‘on-the-job experience’—provided that they have some
incentive to perform. Furthermore, where a public sector pension scheme is missing (as is
frequently the case for some time into postconflict settings), a share of positions may be held by




107
    There is a growing literature on the levels of pay for public servants, with partially contradictory findings about
adequate levels of pay. Here we just take the basic assumption that in principle pay needs to be sufficient to compete
with alternative options in postconflict environments especially for higher-level professional and managerial cadres.
108
    For a discussion of contrasting legacies see Srivastava and Blum (forthcoming); for example, while Sierra Leone
had a central civil service that was largely intact at the end of the conflict, Timor-Leste is an example where almost
the entire service had to be newly recruited.
                                                                                                       119 | P a g e
‘legacy’ civil servants in their late 60s, 70s, and even 80s; and the scale of this problem can grow
as time passes without a retirement scheme in place.

Related crucial factors for civil service capacity are overall organizational and management
factors. An overall environment of expecting performance and an ethos of integrity, and whether
civil servants are motivated to perform the tasks and duties assigned (overall blue area and ‘5’)
plays an important role. Political decision makers, ministers, governors, and county commissioners
at subnational levels, and senior civil servants ‘set the tone’ with regard to what is expected of
individual civil servants. This can take the form of deliberate ‘performance management’ or be
more informal. Decisions about promotions are an important way for signaling whether
performance in the public interest is expected, or whether other criteria dominate. If many staff are
not recruited on meritocratic criteria, this can also (negatively) affect performance as staff recruited
based on connections may feel protected from potential disciplining or dismissal for
nonperformance.

In most conflict countries, overall organization and the incentives set by policy makers are
not optimal, not least due to the pressures prevailing in a ‘fragile limited access order’ as
characterized by North et al. (2012). There is, however, substantial variation—with a greater
emphasis and true focus on performance and integrity in some environments, and much less so in
others.109 When political leaders and senior managers signal that a given public sector unit must
deliver on assigned functions, this can provide crucial incentives to ensure that good staff are
promoted or placed in key positions, and to shed the most incompetent recruits, leading to
improvements over time.

Training and learning (‘6’) is a factor that most often comes into play after recruitment
decisions have been made for core civil service cadre, but can also take the form of pre-
service training based on a selection into a specific program.110 Structured civil servant learning
can take a range of forms, including on-the-job mentoring and twinning arrangements with more
experienced civil servants or technical assistants; secondment and action learning; as well as
classroom-based training. More informal learning also occurs when civil servants absorb the norms
and behaviors encouraged by the presence (or absence) of performance management systems as
discussed above.111

In addition to how staff are selected, managed, trained, and paid, the availability of resources
(‘7’) also plays a role, and in many postconflict and other poor countries this poses a

109
    To some extent, this is a ‘common pool’ problem. If a single political appointee hires some relatives, he or she
gains local standing, while the cost is borne by society overall and the effect on the public administration of a single
instance is limited. However, if many hiring managers behave similarly, and much of the hiring into the public service
is affected, then the overall system becomes dysfunctional.
110
    Different, for example, from teachers or nurses who typically attend training colleges first and then may be offered
jobs at publicly funded schools or health centers.
111
    See for example, Rosemary Harrison’s Learning and Development 2009.
                                                                                                        120 | P a g e
challenge. While resources (operating and capital budgets) need not be ample, a minimum is
needed to fulfill tasks. If civil servants are not provided with required forms, basic office
equipment, or electricity, they will often struggle to do what is expected. Especially during early
postconflict periods and for subnational levels of government, even basic infrastructure such as
office space or desks may be missing or may need to be used by multiple staff. A lack of minimal
resources, or the fact that these are only available intermittently reduces capacity and can also
affect motivation negatively. This can entail a negative circle: the lack of basic resources affects
the public service, and in turn, efforts at collecting taxes and ensuring that public funds are well
managed suffer.

Annex 2: Evolution of Aid Architecture and Support to Capacity Building
In South Sudan, the architecture of international assistance has been the result of evolving
international commitments, shifting political objectives, and technical realities. Development
partners also face a set of incentives when engaging in South Sudan and other fragile contexts (as
discussed in Chapter 2). A key feature is that relatively high revenue during the early years placed
the government in a fairly stronger negotiating position relative to development partners when
compared to more aid-dependent countries with regard to use of countries’ systems and the
acceptable level of intrusion on or supervision of core functions. Though initially harmonized
through a pooled fund, development assistance including to human resource and financial
management has gradually become more fragmented. A more recent feature is the stop-and-go
nature of aid, with many initiatives suspended or withdrawn as a result of the 2013 crisis.
The following discussion of the evolution of aid architecture and support to capacity building
is organized into several historical periods. The lead-up to the CPA and early CPA years
characterized by a focus getting basic core government functions up and running (2004–2009); the
run-up to independence during the late CPA years during which some of the initial optimism
around donor coordination began to fade (2010–2011); and the independence period (2011–2016)
which experienced at least two major shocks, the shutdown of production in 2012, as well as the
civil conflict and macro-fiscal crisis from late 2013 onward.

Lead-up to CPA and early CPA years (2004–2009)

In the lead up to the signing of the CPA, the international community began planning to
scale up assistance to Southern Sudan, and to shift its focus from food aid and basic service
delivery through NGOs to state-building objectives. With the participation and endorsement of the
GoSS and SPLM, the World Bank and UN carried out a 12-month JAM in 2004–2005 to plan for
the post-CPA period. The JAM set out a framework for peace, development, and poverty reduction
between 2005 and 2011 in the northern and southern regions.
The JAM proposed an ambitious set of public sector outcomes to be achieved by 2011, estimating
the total cost of achieving capacity building and institutional development outcomes at US$1.6
billion from 2005 to 2011 (see table 3.6). These targets were not reflective of experiences in other
postconflict countries where decades were required to achieve progress in the best-case scenarios.
Notably, the JAM envisioned a lean public service and a sustainable wage bill for South Sudan
(JAM Vol 3. 9)
The cost of the initial 2005–2007 phase of the JAM was estimated at US$7.9 billion for which
US$2.6 billion would require external finance. Following the publication of the JAM, 60
countries and international organizations pledged over US$4.5 billion to Sudan and South Sudan.
In line with the SPLM views on the use of country systems to strengthen national capacity, donors
                                                                                       122 | P a g e
and CPA parties committed to a ‘recipient-executed’ aid architecture early in this process. The
establishment of an MDTF was negotiated, and was viewed as a primary channel through which
both national and international funds would be channeled for CPA implementation. Pledges of
US$2 billion were made toward JAM objectives and US$500 million were made toward two
MDTFs (for the north and the south). Remaining pledges were made toward the operations of the
UN and the African Union (AU).112 Public sector support was initially concentrated in multi-donor
funds. The MDTF-SS was initially the primary donor-funding mechanism accounting for 89
percent of donor commitments in 2006. The GoSS committed to establish itself as the largest
MDTF contributor for the south by channeling oil revenues into the pooled fund.113

Beginning during this period, a ‘parallel public service’ was less prevalent in South Sudan
relative to other postconflict countries, notably Afghanistan (Srivastava et al.; Bhatia and Prasad
2015). Given that the government rejected the idea of establishing a single large PIU within the
MoFEP to manage MDTF-financed programs, it was decided to use government systems (and
staff) to manage the program, but with specific technical support ‘contracted in’ to the MoFEP.
The MoFEP and other ministries have received significant technical assistance. No count has been
undertaken of how many TAs were employed.
The coincidental timing of the 2005 Paris Declaration on Aid Effectiveness with the post-
CPA planning process established South Sudan as a case study in the application of
principles of national ownership, alignment, and harmonization. The GoSS Ministry of
Finance set out an Aid Strategy establishing broad principles and specific structures for
coordination, borrowing language directly from the Paris Declaration and OECD discussions of
aid effectiveness (Davies et al. 2009; Larson 2013, 7). Also in line with the Paris Declaration
Principles, donors established a Joint Donor Office (JDO) in 2006, a partnership between the
Netherlands, Norway, Sweden, the United Kingdom, and later, Denmark and Canada. The JDO
was intended to serve as a single office through which donors would implement their respective
assistance programs and coordinate on pooled fund management.
However, implementation of this streamlined aid coordination system proved to be
challenging, as increased ODA flows were not matched by on-the-ground operational
capacity to monitor and implement programming. The MDTF-SS took longer to establish than
foreseen, and given the fund’s reliance on government systems, national capacity constraints
increased costs and directly affected the speed of disbursements.115 Without a contracted service
provider to design, procure, and manage projects, the MDTF-SS was initially reliant on weak
government systems, slowing delivery and raising costs. Further, the World Bank was not able to
mobilize staff resources required to implement a functional trust fund. With no functional country
office, implementation lagged. As an additional constraint, the GoSS was unable to meet its targets
to match donor funding for capacity-building initiatives under the MDTF as oil revenues were
lower than expected and public sector employment costs exceeded projections.
By mid-2007, the international community perceived that their commitments to the GoSS and the
larger CPA process were not being kept, and that this had an impact on the stability of the CPA

itself.116 Under mounting pressure to deliver a peace dividend, development partners began to
mobilize increased funding outside of the MDTF-SS mechanism, including other pooled funds and
direct bilateral support.117 This left the MDTF-SS accounting for 11 percent of donor commitments
by 2008 and just 2 percent of commitments by 2010. Projects funded by individual donors became
an increasingly important source of financing, particularly from the United States which did not
participate in pooled funding arrangements.

A key further issue was the limited coordination of support to public sector capacity building.
On the donor side, the objectives set out in the JAM were not accompanied by a common plan to
build capacity—to establish training centers, job descriptions with skills requirements, a common
curriculum, a training baseline, trainers, or funding responsibility. While some efforts sought to
support these type of activities (such as the Skills for South Sudan and CBTF projects) they were
limited in scale and duration. Training was provided on an ad hoc, project-by-project basis with
short-term planning horizons. On the government side, after absorption of the CANS and CCSS
personnel the GoSS budget was primarily allocated to the wage bill rather than investing in
building skills of the new public services.
By 2008, it became clear that the JAM targets would be more difficult to achieve than initially
envisioned. In a presentation to a donor conference at the end of the first phase of the JAM in
2008, Southern Sudan’s Minister of Finance noted public sector capacity progress and
challenges—budgets had been prepared and executed, central and state planning mechanisms were
in place, CANS and CCSS had been integrated, the national and state legislatures were established,
and national ministries and commissions were established and equipped. However, he also noted
that the JAM had underestimated the contextual challenges, including “the difficulties of
establishing a civil service and institutions to deliver services from scratch.”118

Later CPA period and lead-up to independence (2009–2011)

From 2009 onward, the GoSS and development partners focused on a more limited set of
priorities. In 2009, South Sudan faced an economic shock as oil prices dropped significantly
following the global financial crisis, reducing GoSS’ budgetary resources by nearly two-thirds and
reducing funds available for national development projects. The approach of the 2011 referendum
prompted urgent, prioritized action by donors and the GoSS to capacity challenges through the
GoSS Priority Core Governance Functions Action Plan. Developed in 2010 in the pre-referendum
planning, it outlined functions “absolutely essential to the sustainability of the GoSS after the

referendum.”119 Where the JAM was ambitious, the Core Functions exercise was realistic. Deeply
concerned about the operationality of a new government post-independence, donors and GoSS
outlined 19 priority core functions across six priority areas. The document identified the
responsible GoSS ministry and the donor or program that would provide support to deliver these
functions. With limited scope, clear GoSS responsibility and pre-identified sources of technical
assistance, the Core Functions exercise effectively guided capacity-building efforts in the lead-up
to independence.
At the same time, the GoSS and donors embarked on a longer-term planning exercise to map
out government and international priorities in the SSDP, which was completed shortly after
the referendum that established the Republic of South Sudan in January 2011. The SSDP initially
targeted the 2011–2013 period and was later extended to 2015. As a more traditional National
Development Plan, the SSDP outlined a grand vision across the pillars of Human and Social
Development, Economic Development, Governance, and Conflict Prevention and Security. The
SSDP has been criticized as being driven by the donor community, which provided external
consultants to write much of the document, seeking government endorsement after the document
had been largely completed. The coordination mechanisms established under the 2006 Aid
Strategy were also widely criticized as non-functional, as line ministries lacked the capacity to
manage multi-stakeholder meetings and donors continued to pursue new projects that did not align
with government priorities. Even sharing basic data on project expenditures in AIMS proved to be
a major challenge (Larson 2013).
The SSDP and the accompanying MTCDS120 provided a capacity-building plan for post-
independence (see Annex 1). The MTCDS sought to build the institutional capacity to implement
the SSDP and to align donor support from 2011–2013. The strategy covered all of the sectoral
pillars of the SSDP as well as ‘cross-cutting’ capacity-building needs, providing an extensive list
of ambitious objectives without clarity on responsibility within GoSS or the donor community to
finance or operationalize these tasks.
The SSDP noted that coordination had become increasingly challenging, with donors
establishing diverse new projects that did not align with government priorities and did not
use pooled funding mechanisms. By 2010, the OECD noted that 109 PPIUs had been officially
established (OECD 2011). As set out in the SSDP, the percent “going through pooled mechanisms
dropped from 34 percent in 2009 to 24 percent in 2010” with a proliferation of separate projects.
For example, in 2010 there were 91 separate projects in health and 65 projects in education, many
of which used PPIUs outside of ministry systems (SSDP 2011, 360). Donors had also begun to

establish independent bilateral missions in South Sudan following independence. The role of joint
mechanisms such as the JDO was gradually reduced until the closure of that office in 2013 and
repurposing of its facilities as a common campus for separate national embassies.

Independence period (2011–2016)

The GoSS joined the G7+ group of fragile states in 2011, joining the ‘New Deal’ framework
on peace and state- building. Under this framework, focus was to be narrowed from the
accomplishment of all MDGs (as called for in the SSDP) to five peace and state-building goals
related to politics, security, justice, the economy, and revenue/services. Under this approach, South
Sudan called for increased budget support from donors to support a proposed four-page compact
with a limited set of benchmarks. While state consultations were held on developing a compact,
the process was never completed.121
The return of large-scale internal conflict in late 2013 and significant political tensions
between the GRSS and the international community led to a rupture in the aid architecture,
as donors dramatically reduced use of government systems in favor of a return to humanitarian
assistance. In many ways, the aid architecture was reversed to the pre-2005 system of humanitarian
support through the UN and NGOs, with the cluster system serving to coordinate the humanitarian
response. The signing of the ARCISS and the formation of the TGNU had signaled the possibility
of creating a platform for discussing renewed engagement from a position of considerably less
trust on the part of both development partners and the government. A further consideration is that
given the macro-fiscal crisis and low oil prices, South Sudan is likely to be far more aid dependent
than it had been in previous periods.

Lessons learned and results (2003–2016)

Looking back at development partner support to institutional development and capacity
building from 2003–2016, an important reflection is that stop-and-go financing limited
donor-financed capacity-building efforts. For example, while the CBTF spanned a 10-year
period, it consisted of multiple two-year funding envelopes with no certainty of extension. Design,
approval, and procurement processes further reduced the possible duration of training programs.
Rather than a long-term strategic approach to building training institutions, curriculum and
trainers, interventions have been bound by near-term priorities. A multi-donor evaluation of
support from 2005–2011 noted short-termism by donors reluctant to commit to longer-term
programs in the context of state fragility.122 A key finding from a recent evaluation of the CBTF
is the need for capacity-building efforts to reach the state government and to coordinate with

Further, it was recommended to improve monitoring of baseline capacity, as well as midterm and
endline outcomes to allow for midcourse corrections and better tracking of overall progress.

 Box A2.1. Multi-donor Evaluation of Support to Conflict Prevention and Peace Building Activity in
 Southern Sudan 2005–2011: Key Findings in Relation to Capacity Building
 “In general, donors misdiagnosed the capacity building needs of Southern Sudan and failed to develop a vision
 which consisted of a coherent, well-funded approach supporting state building and its key functions. In detail:

        Donors had a piecemeal approach to capacity building and their efforts were uncoordinated and random.
         Donors have had so much experience in capacity-building programs over the past decades, yet it was only
         in 2009 that they started a coordination working group to improve coordination.
        The severity of the context was not taken as a starting point.
        Capacity building is more than training and this has not been fully understood by both donors and the
         GoSS.
        Programs are too scattered, too short and underfunded to have a lasting impact in the medium to long term.
        The process of capacity building is too slow due to a piecemeal approach and not well targeted.
        Investment in the private sector would have had a positive effect on creating a labor market and would
         have improved access to jobs. This might have contributed to stability in the sense that those retrenched
         from the public sector would have had alternative employment.
        Investment in the private sector would have stimulated economic growth and created a limited number of
         jobs in the formal sector but, more importantly, in the informal sector.”

The results of investments in public sector capacity building are difficult to measure in the
absence of a coordinated M&E framework. While individual projects measured training inputs
and outputs (such as the number of civil servants trained), the overall impact of these programs is
unknown. Programs have supported basic operations of the government in the context of a fragile
state in its first years of independence—technical assistance to build basic institutional
infrastructure (that is, buildings and IT), generate oil revenues, prepare and execute budgets, and
count and pay employees. In the context of ongoing emergency, the establishment of a robust
M&E framework based on comprehensive national data was a comparatively low priority.
Nevertheless, progress can be observed. Key public sector management systems have been
developed, and legislative frameworks have been established. For example, a basic budget
planning cycle is in operation, supported by an IFMS and a public sector payroll system is in place
to track and pay civil servants. The MoLPSHRD developed a National Master Curriculum,
outlining modules of curriculum for public servants. Although not all modules have been
developed, the document provides a strategic starting point for donors developing training
materials in specific areas. Beyond the national curriculum, many key operational manuals have

1 - Planning for Peace
The international community supported Sudan and the SPLM in the negotiation of the CPA and planning for the establishment of the GoSS, establishing the
broad parameters of the state—highly decentralized, with initial recruitment of civil service based on SPLM/CANS service.
2003–2004              ‘Tent City’                       Established a temporary civil administration complex for the SPLM Core Team.
                       Norway/United States              The Core Team developed the broad strategy of a decentralized GoSS drawing
                                                         heavily on SPLA/CANS personnel.
Jan 2005               Signing of the CPA
                       SPLM/GoSS agreement to end civil war, share oil revenue, set a timeline for independence referendum

2 - Multi-Donor Funds
Ambitious MDTFs were created to finance the human and physical infrastructure the GoSS required to establish a basic government administration. Funding
for public administration was initially pooled (building on the 2005 Paris Declaration), but became more fragmented as donors established their own bilateral
programs in the new country.

Annex 4: Composition of the Civil Service: Detailed Analysis
The following detailed analysis is summarized in Section 3.3.

Number of staff and distribution between tiers of government

Estimating the number of staff in South Sudan requires putting together data from multiple
sources, as there is currently no single budget or single payroll system that gives a complete picture
public employment across sectors and tiers of the government. According to the FY15/16
Approved Budget, the national budget provides for 347,018 central government and 118,023 state
government employees (a total of 465,041 government personnel).127 This includes employees
servicing in the military, organized forces and civilian civil service. States have the ability to hire
additional staff paid for through block grants or own-source revenue, but given that copies of state
budgets are not widely available, it is difficult to estimate the number of additional staff planned
for at this level. County personnel are not reflected in the national budget and limited access to
county budgets makes it difficult to estimate the number of staff planned for at this level. Thus, it
is expected that subnational employment is higher than reflected in national budgets.

Public employment has increased since 2005 when the GoSS administration first formed.
Figure 4.1(a) reflects the number and distribution of civil servants and organized forces between
the central government and 10 states in 2005 after the CANS and CCSS administration were
merged (data does not include national military). According to the civil service survey completed
at the time, the total number of staff was approximately 62,172—though not all civil servants
returned survey forms and so the total number is likely to have been somewhat higher.128 During
this initial period, state government employees outnumbered those assigned to the central
government, with Central Equatoria, the regional capital, having the highest number of public
employees. The 2005 JAM report proposed keeping central and state governments relatively lean,
with the bulk of staff in service delivery functions at the county level.129 While it predicted the
necessity of a “large amount of recruitment to meet the needs of the various levels of government,”
the JAM also envisioned a cap on employment at 100,000.130
According to approved national budgets, by FY12/13, government employment in the civil
service and organized forces had increased well beyond the proposed JAM ceiling to 163,000,
and by FY15/16 the figure had increased to 169,842, with substantial additional subnational staff

not reflected in national budgets.131 This expansion was funded by growing public revenue from
oil resources.132 As reflected Figure 4.1(b), employment has increased across tiers of the
government (though as noted above, data from the FY15/16 budget only provides a partial picture
of subnational employment); with civilian and organized forces in central government increasing
from 1,102 in 2005 to 51,819 in FY15/16.

Distribution of staff between sectors

Though the main focus of this note is on the civil service, a key feature of government
employment has been the relatively high number of staff allocated to security functions,
including Defense, National Security Service, Veterans Affairs, and the Organized Forces (Police,
Prisons, Wildlife, and Fire Services). According to the FY15/16 Approved Budget, security sector
salaries make up roughly 47 percent of national government expenditures and 76 percent of the
national wage bill (see Figure 4.2).134 Just over 85 percent of central and state government

    Initially, South Sudan experienced relatively abundant (but volatile) revenue from oil resources. At independence,
public expenditure reached levels well above the East African region: over US$300 per capita, as compared to US$100
or less in Kenya, Rwanda, Uganda, Liberia, Sierra Leone, and Ethiopia. Yet as noted above, oil revenue declined with
the shutdown in production during FY12/13 and again as a result of the civil conflict and falling oil prices in the
subsequent fiscal years.
133
   As noted in the report, “The survey covered all serving public service personnel in the classified grades, including
in the organized services (police, wildlife, prison, and fire services), and personnel seconded to nongovernmental
organizations by the CANS, initially established in 1996 as an organ of the SPLM, and the CCSS. Personnel at all
three levels of government – ministries and central agencies, states, and counties – were surveyed.”

employees are engaged in security-related functions, as compared to 7 percent of staff engaged in
the education sector and 2 percent in health (see Figure 4.3).135 These figures only capture
subnational staff being paid through conditional salary transfers. State and county governments
hire additional staff using own-source revenue and block transfers, but it is difficult to estimate the
number or how they are allocated between sectors.

                          Assuming a total population of 10.8 million (as per World
                          Development Indicators) for South Sudan for 2012.

With regard to the current (civilian) civil service, there are two sources of information about
the distribution of employment between sectors: the FY15/16 Approved Budget and payroll
records. According to the FY15/16 Approved Budget, Ministry of Higher Education, Technology
and Science; MoFEP; the Judiciary of South Sudan; and the Ministry of General Education show
the highest levels of employment. During 2015, the MoLPSHRD rolled out an upgraded SSEPS
II. By February 2016, about 80 percent of civilian central government MDAs had been enrolled in
SSPES II—a key MDA still missing was Ministry of Education.136 According to this data, Ministry
of Health shows the highest level of staffing; followed by Ministry of Finance and Economic
Planning; Ministry of Information and Broadcasting; Ministry of Justice. The South Sudan Relief
and Rehabilitation Commission and the South Sudan Urban Water Corporation also have relatively
higher levels of staff than other MDAs.
With regard to the civilian civil service at subnational levels, state-level budgets are generally
unavailable and payroll data from SSPES II is incomplete with some key agencies not fully
enrolled making comparisons of distribution of staff between sectors difficult. Figure 4.5 reflects
the distribution of county staff between health, education, and public administration for the 17
counties fully enrolled in SSEPS II. When the new system was rolled out, staff not assigned to
service delivery functions (that is, health and education) were mapped to public administration,
which helps to explain the relatively high number of staff in this category. The relatively low
number of staff mapped to the health sector may be related to the fact that humanitarian assistance
and NGOs provide a large share of health services in South Sudan. Education is handled more
directly by the state (see Chapter 5 on health).

Distribution of staff between grade levels (‘Size of the professional cadre’)

In South Sudan, the professional cadre of civil servants appears relatively small compared
to the cadre of ‘unskilled’ support staff and takes up a relatively smaller share of the wage
bill. However, data constraints make it difficult to understand the full picture. In principle, the
professional cadre is made up of public offices in grades 1 through 7; with grades 8 through 17
making up support staff. In practice, there is evidence to suggest that grading has not been carried
out systematically so as to ensure a consistent match between the responsibilities associated with
a grade level and the experience and qualifications of staff.137 For example, there are grade 10
accountants and drivers, as well as grade 15 cleaners and nurses. This makes it difficult to interpret
data on the distribution of staff between grades and the size of the professional cadre of civil
servants in South Sudan.
Figure 4.6 reflects the distribution of central government civil servants between grades as captured
by payroll data from February 2016. On the one hand, the data presented in Figure 4.6 do not
reflect the ‘missing middle’ typical in many fragile or postconflict environments. On the other


137
  For example, grading during the merger of the CANS and CCSS administrations was reportedly haphazard and
random with ‘frequent self-appointments to high-level positions regardless of qualifications.’ See Srivastava and
Blum, South Sudan Case Study, page 20.
                                                                                                                                                                                       146 | P a g e

distribution of skills across the civilian civil service.

In addition to a division into grades (which are linked to eligible salary levels), civil servants
are also divided into two ‘classifications.’ The professional cadre of public officers is known as
‘classified staff’—positions include, for example, director general, inspector, human resource
officer, IT officer, clerk, store keeper, and receptionist. Unclassified positions include drivers,
mechanics, messengers, and cleaners. One would expect this typology to be linked to grading, but
this seems not to be the case. Within the payroll, ‘classified’ versus ‘unclassified’ seems to be
more accurately and consistently applied than the grading system—though there are
inconsistencies.

According to payroll data, 61 percent of civilian public officers in central government are
classified and make up 71 percent of the wage bill; 38 percent are unclassified and make up 27
percent of the wage bill (the remaining 1 percent are ‘constitutional post holders’).138 For the

138
  Constitutional post holders are generally graded as classified staff, though not in all cases. For this calculation, all
constitutional post holders were treated as ‘professional’ staff.
                                                                                                                                       147 | P a g e
subnational level, available payroll data for a sample of four states shows the distribution between
classified (55 percent) and unclassified (45 percent) staff to be more even.139 Similarly, payroll
data from a sample of 17 counties enrolled in SSEPS II indicates that 52 percent of staff are
classified with the remaining 48 unclassified.140 This does suggest a somewhat high share of
‘unclassified staff’, that is, of overemployment. However, it also indicates that there should be
rather sufficient professional-level staff overall to operate a public administration and publicly led
service delivery.

Qualifications and relative experience of staff

Data on qualifications and skills remains extremely constrained. The most recent survey of
public servants and organized forces was that carried out in 2005 (the Survey of Serving Public
Service Personnel). Given the expansion of the public service and ongoing capacity-building
efforts, this is unlikely to provide an up-to-date reflection of qualifications and experience, but can
provide a useful baseline against which later and much more partial findings can be compared. In
late 2015, the MoLPSHRD initiated a Skills Assessment covering a total of 616 respondents from
the MoLPSHRD, MoRB, MoE, and MoH at the national level and state level.141 A draft report was
completed in April 2016 and provides a more up-to-date picture of a small sample of civil servants,
with results discussed further below.
A further consideration is that central government agencies have not established records of
staff credentials. In part, this is related to the fact that many South Sudanese have been trained in
other countries. As a result, public officers may hold academic or professional qualifications that
are not uniform or easy to verify. Within the civilian public service, MoLPSHRD developed an
excel-based HRIS with assistance from USAID to capture information from paper records. In
2013, the ministry piloted an upgraded HRIS system with support from the CBTF. This was rolled

out to select ministries to record basic information such as date and place of birth, as well as
degrees or other credentials held.142 Other ministries have also initiated sector-specific HRISs. An
EMIS has been rolled out to the education sector. The Ministry of Health has also begun
development of an HRIS system, which has been rolled out to five states—this data is analyzed in
Chapter 5 on health. Notably, neither system has been implemented in close coordination with
MoLPSHRD.
With regard to educational attainment, the 2005 Survey of Serving Public Service Personnel
found that 42.5 percent of civil servants had attained early education only; 29 percent reached
secondary or post-secondary education; 6 percent had a university degree (23 percent did not
specify educational attainment).143 The central government had the highest ratio of graduates to
non-graduates. Though there are some indications that qualifications have improved over the past
decade, data for different points in time is unavailable or not fully comparable.
The 2015 Skills Audit sample was composed of directors general, directors, deputy directors,
assistant directors, inspectors, HR officers, head teachers, engineers, IT officers, and nurses.
Of this group, 98 percent of respondents had completed secondary school; 21 percent had a BA
and 3 percent had a MA. Educational attainment was somewhat higher at the national level, with
100 percent of central government respondents completing secondary school; 34 percent had a
BA, 10 percent a MA, and 2 percent held PhDs. The Skills Audit also collected data on the highest
professional qualification obtained relevant to civil servants’ current post: 25 percent of
respondents had no professional qualifications at all and 5.3 percent had non-relevant professional
qualifications; 52 percent of respondents had obtained basic relevant qualifications and 17 percent
had relevant higher qualifications.

With regard to language skills, a key challenge for capacity development has been the switch
from Arabic to English as the main language of the government. A key implication for the
civil service has been a need to distinguish between gaps in technical versus language skills (for
example, a certified accountant who could not read government documents in English). The 2005
survey found that roughly 60 percent of central government employees had ‘good’ or ‘excellent’
English speaking and writing skills. English skills varied for employees of state government
administrations from 18 percent (Northern Bahr el Ghazal) to 48 percent (Western Equatoria).144
Those serving in the CCSS or Khartoum administration were more likely to be fluent in Arabic

    Initially eight computers were provided as part of CBTF funding, though all but one have been damaged or stolen.
Further, as of early 2016, the HRIS system faces IT challenges which make it difficult to access or analyze the
underlying data; resolving these issues requires IT support from the firm which originally designed the system, but
resources to do so are unavailable.

than English. Some efforts have been made to invest in language training through the ‘Skills for
Sudan’ effort in the late 2000s.

With regard to job experience, a majority of staff have been recruited within the past decade;
while roughly 20 percent of staff in the national government and 30 percent of staff at the
subnational government have been in post for over 10 years.145 Payroll records from 2015 include
data on the date of appointment for 69 percent of central government civil servants (see Figure
4.9), that is, for 31 percent the length of service remains unclear.146 The distribution of
appointments since 2005 suggests a mixed length of experience. Interactions with individual civil
servants with a period of service reaching back to the 1980s and 1990s suggests that there was a
more organized system in place at the time in the locations where they worked, but the relevance
of this legacy is now limited.
The 2016 Skills Audit also collected data on years of service. It found that 5 percent of respondents
from the national ministries surveyed had been in their current position for less than a year; 41
percent for 1–5 years; 33 percent for 6–10 years; and 21 for more than 10 years. It also found that
nearly 6 percent of respondents across levels of the government were serving in their role in an
acting capacity.147 Two-thirds of national government respondents had no work experience outside
of the public sector, though 21 percent had worked with another ministry.
At the state level, the 2016 Skills Audit found that 12 percent of respondents had been serving in
their current position for less than a year, 35 percent for 1–5 years, 22 percent for 6–10 years, and
32 percent for more than 10 years. The distribution by state is reflected in Figure 4.10. With regard
to previous work experience, only 17 percent of those surveyed had worked outside of the public
sector and 60 percent had only worked for their current ministry.

    A key caveat on these figures is that date of employment reflects the date on which an official appointment letter
was attached to the employee’s HR file; given delays issuing and receiving such letters, this is not always the same
month or year that staff were hired into the civil service.

With regard to age, the 2005 Survey of Serving Public Service Personnel found that roughly 42
percent of government employees in the civil service and organized forces at the national and state
level were in the ages 16–35 years. It found that 3 percent were 60 years or older—that is, at or
past retirement age with the bulk of these in the organized forces, health, or education. The report
estimated that 14 percent of government personnel surveyed at the time would be at retirement age
by 2016. More recent data from SSPES II is significantly constrained as 34 percent of records do
not contain an accurate birth date; records without birth dates are more likely to reflect older staff
who do not have an updated national identification card; and SSEPS II only covers civilian staff.
Of the civil servants in central government with a birth date in their records, 49 percent are 39
years old or younger; 8 percent are 60 or older (and so above the retirement age).

The 2016 Skills Audit found that 38 percent of respondents from national ministries were 39 years
of age or younger; it found that 34 percent were at or beyond the retirement age. For the state
ministries covered in the 2016 Skills Audit, 10 percent were between 30 and 39 years, 28 percent
between 40 and 49 years, 23 percent between 50 and 59 years, and 34 percent were 60 years or
older.148 Figure 4.12 reflects the distribution by state. Thus, this most recent, but also small-
scale assessment indicates a (potentially) substantial problem with employment of ‘over age’
staff.

Annex 5. Overview of University System in South Sudan
Public universities rely heavily on government funding and have very limited budget of their own
or other sources of funding and income. This has affected them negatively with regard to not even
affording payment of operational costs of the institutions. In May 2016, all lecturers across the
state universities went on strike because of nonpayment of salaries and allowances for over three
months. The lecturers were then given a salary equivalent to a month and asked to resume work.
Many have been demoralized and have quit the universities. The nonpayment of salaries are a
reflection of the fiscal challenges the country is faced with following the December 2013 conflict.

In the assessment of academic staff and current status of South Sudan universities undertaken by
the Ministry of Education in 2012, the report identified the challenges facing the universities as
follows:
   (a) There was an acute shortage of qualified academic staff in all the disciplines in the five
       public universities. As a result, the universities have been compelled to hire retired civil
       servants or use part-time staff whose qualifications to teach at the university at most times
       is questionable.
   (b) All the universities suffered the legacy of mass expansion in higher education which took
       place under the National Salvation Government of Sudan, with the exception of the
       University of Rumbek and Dr. John Garang Memorial University of Science and
       Technology. This led to the stretching of a small pool of qualified academic staff to serve
       in many institutions; lack of funding to match expansion; recruitment of unqualified staff;
       acceptance of weak students to fill up universities by lowering admission level and
       production of low-quality graduates (proficient only in Arabic).
   (c) The legacy of using Arabic as the medium of education is still lingering in the three
       Universities of Juba, Bahr el Ghazal, and Upper Nile. Some academic staff are unable to
       teach in English and many students are unable to learn English. This has led to
       confrontations between the students and administration.
   (d) Contact hours in the universities are very high, as much as over 3 hours per week. This
       makes the total number of credits for the award of a degree too high, thus not in conformity
       with international standards. There is also a disparity in the total number of credits among
       disciplines in the same college/faculty, resulting in high contact hours per week for some
       students and lower ones for others.
   (e) All universities have no budget allocated for teaching, research library. All libraries are
       dependent on donations of books, resulting in some acquisitions that are irrelevant to the
       academic programs.

                                                                                      156 | P a g e
       (f) All universities do not have programs for academic advising, career guidance, and
           counselling of students

       (g) All universities lack sufficient infrastructure—lecture halls, laboratories; student and staff
           accommodation, staff offices and so on.
Overall, the report recommends a complete reform of the existing systems to achieve international
standards and produce the right quality of students who will contribute to the future pool of public
and civil servants for the country.
So far, there are two postgraduate colleges in the University of Juba—the Center for Peace and
Development Studies and the SPS. The SPS, which was opened more recently focuses on building
the capacity of civil servants in various public administration and policy areas. As the country
considers embarking on the public sector reform agenda, the school could potentially be an
important contributor toward achieving the requisite results. Below is detailed case study of the
school.
In addition to the state universities, South Sudan witnessed a mushrooming and proliferation of
private universities in 2009 and by 2010, there were about 36 private universities.149 The Higher
Education Act 2012, provides for the establishment of private and foreign institutions of higher
education. In 2012, the Ministry of Higher Education, Science and Technology commissioned a
study of these universities to assess whether they satisfy the conditions of providing education in
the country. The study revealed that none of the private universities qualified for registration with
General Directorate of Private and Foreign Higher Education. A ministerial order was issued to
close all of them with the exception of two, that is, St. Mary’s College in Juba and Mikese College
in Yambio. These had the physical infrastructure and the relevant requirements for a higher
learning institution.150 While the active private universities are relatively few, they have
contributed to increasing the pool of trained and certified South Sudanese. These also have
affiliation to other universities outside South Sudan, for instance, the Catholic University of East
Africa.

Note: a. Accreditation refers to a process of control and guarantee of the quality of higher education, through
which, as a result of inspection and/of assessment or of both, one recognizes that an institution or its programs
satisfy minimum standards.
b. Letter of no objection refers to prior approval to start laying the ground for operations as due diligence is being
undertaken. Should results not be favorable following the due diligence, then accreditation is not awarded.

Annex 6. Recruitment: Evolution of Recruitment Board and Overview of
Regulatory Framework
Evolution of the Civil Service Recruitment Board

Initially, in June 2006 a CSC was established, modeled on the example of other CSCs in the East
Africa region. Its mandate covered the civilian civil service. However, it lacked the political
influence to put a check on irregularities in the hiring and selection process. In July 2008, the CSC
functions were moved to the MoLPSHRD.

The Civil Service Recruitment Board, which sits under the MoLPSHRD, was established on
November 20, 2008 and charged with the responsibility of overseeing all civil service recruitment.
The initial activities of the Board included drafting of a recruitment policy, which was completed
in 2009, the same year the mandate of the Board came to force. A manual to give guidance on
recruitment procedures was also approved by the Council of Ministers and distributed to the
government ministries and establishment officers who double the work of human resource
managers in the MDAs. The establishment officers were taken through orientation on the
procedures of recruitment within public service.
The Board was established as a five-member entity with a secretariat of three members. Currently,
only the Chair and the Secretary of the Board are the ones remaining—the other three members
left. The current structure has the Board reporting independently to the Minister of LPSHRD
through the Chair. The Chair assumes the position of Director General, the Secretary is at Director
level with three Grade 9 staff including two IT personnel. Between 2008 and 2012, there were
monthly Board meetings. However, following the departure of some of the Board members, the
meetings stopped being conducted because of lack of quorum. The Board faces enormous
challenges ranging from limited political support to having no office space to run the recruitment
processes and house the Board Secretariat. The Board has budget to hire staff but no space or
furniture to seat them.
The 2016 Draft Civil Service Selection and Recruitment Manual is under preparation, and
identifies steps to be followed in the recruitment process. According to these regulations all vacant
positions from the various MDAs should be submitted to the Recruitment Board and budget
checked to ascertain the availability of funds. Once the budget lines for the positions are confirmed,
TORs should be drafted by the respective MDAs and sent to the Board. The Recruitment Board
would then prepare and advertise the post. Once the applications are collected, the Recruitment
Board convenes a committee of three to five members depending on the number of applicants per
position. Long-listing is done according to TORs and the qualifications. A candidate is then
selected to a short list from a minimum of three applicants and a maximum of five applicants. The


                                                                                        159 | P a g e
list is submitted to the Chair of the Board, who after confirmation of due process, submits the short
list to the Undersecretary and Minister within the MoLPSHRD.

An approval letter would then be drafted for the recruitment process to commence. The committee
then designs an oral and written interview guide, selects the days for interviews, notifies the short-
listed applicants and conducts the interviews. Scoring is done by averaging scores of individual
panelists. Based on these results, the Chair of the panel would submit a report to the Chair of the
Recruitment Board to verify that due process was followed. Once this has been ascertained, the
Chair of the Recruitment Board writes a cover letter to the MoLPSHRD with a list of the successful
interviewees recommending their appointments. The MoLPSHRD provides this list to the
concerned MDAs. A personnel file, Form 40 would then be submitted to HRM for provisionary
appointments and entered into the payroll. This is followed through by a permanent appointment
following a successful probation period (ranges from 12 months and more depending on
performance).
Recent discussion with key stakeholders highlight serious concerns about the extent to which the
selection processes applied by MDAs are aligned with these regulations. Findings from interviews
with officials from the Directorate of HRD and HRM indicated a high disregard for the national
norms and standards for recruitment. According to the Secretary of the Recruitment Board, poor
management at the MDA level affects the compliance with recruitment procedures. HR officials
sometimes get bulldozed by Heads of Units, Ministers or Undersecretaries to hire without
following the due process. This results in individuals being hired without the right qualifications
since little screening is done at the MDA level, affecting performance. It is common practice to
find compromises entered into to hire relatives, friends, and tribal affiliations of officials in the
different MDAs into grades without due consideration for the requisite requirements.
The 2016 Draft Civil Service Selection and Recruitment Manual, currently under preparation,
envisions a central role for the Board in recruitment including participation in all hiring decisions.
It is another effort to strengthen the MoPSLHRD’s influence over recruitment procedures and to
effect a more meritocratic process. It closely mirrors previous processes which have been quite
rigorous on paper, but not been followed in practice. A key question going forward may be how
the MoLPSHRD can adopt international or regional best practices (as foreseen in the draft manual),
but adapt these models to the political-institutional realities in South Sudan so that they have a
practical impact on the ground. For example, current draft regulations may be overambitious in
providing for recruitment board involvement in every hiring process from start to finish—which
is ambitious for a small Board, especially if hiring happens in ‘waves’ rather than continuously,
for example, once the hiring freeze is officially lifted.

Civil Service Act 2011 (Legislation)

The South Sudan Civil Service Act 2011 provides for the regulation and governance of the Civil
Service of the GoSS. It includes the following provisions:

      Section 28 (1) states that recruitment or promotion is a procedure through which a selected
       person is appointed to a vacant post in the Civil Service, for the performance of the duties
       of a civil servant, official, or employee.

      Section 28 (2) states that recruitment or promotion shall be exclusively dependent upon
       the applicant’s suitability for the post and shall not be decided on grounds of race, creed,
       sex, or religion, unless specified otherwise by the constitution, relevant government policy
       on gender, or any other law.

      Section 28 (4) states that appointment whether by recruitment or promotion shall only
       occur after the decision by the relevant Head of unit that recruitment or promotion of staff
       to a vacant post in necessary. For a post to be filled it must be vacant, have funds allocated
       to it in the budget, and be in the approved nominal roll.

      Section 31 (1) states that, where the selection is opened to competitive promotion across
       the civil service or recruitment from outside the civil service, the selection process shall
       take into account the principles of freedom to apply, equal conditions and opportunities for
       all applicants, and fair procedures.

      Section 32 sets out the selection criteria in descending order of importance in all
       promotion, recruitment, and selection processes. The criteria are as below:
           o Year of experience in the post (or its equivalent) to be filled or service in the SPLA;
           o Satisfactory reference or another assessment of past performance (for example,
             service in the SPLM/SPLA);
           o Relevant education (as appropriate to the post to be filled);
           o Gender balance;
           o Functional literacy in English;
           o Geographic balance; and
           o Computer literacy
       Under relevant education specified above, key areas of consideration in descending order
       are: University/higher institute degree; Diploma; vocational training; secondary school
       certificate; primary and informal training.
                                                                                       161 | P a g e
      Section 33(1) states that, no appointment, promotion, or terms of service for any
       appointments at any levels above grade 2 shall be effective before the insurance of a formal
       letter of clearances and appointments by the Ministry of Public Service.

      Section 33 (4) notes that before a formal letter of appointment is issued, the Ministry of
       Public Service shall verify whether the selection process has followed the approved
       selection criteria or not. The Internal Audit section of the MoFEP shall be served with a
       copy of the letter of appointment

Manual of Public Service Procedure 2007 (Public Service Procedure)

The Manual of Public Service Procedure 2007 sets out the overall administration and public
service policies and procedures of the GoSS. It includes the following provisions:
(a) Guiding Principles:
Section 1.(2) (i) provides that recruitment, appointments, or promotion should only take place after
a careful assessment of the need to employ or promote such permanent or contract staff has been
made, and deemed to be absolutely necessary.

Subsection 2.2 stipulates that, where possible, vacancies should be filled by internal departmental
transfer or promotion. Where no suitable candidate(s) is available, all vacant posts must be
advertised through available public media.
Subsection 2.4 provides that, recruitment will be related solely to the applicant’s suitability for
the post and will not be influenced by race, creed, sex, or religion, unless specified otherwise by
the relevant laws in force.

(b) Selection and Appointments:
Subsection 1.3.5 indicates that promotions and appointment to the post of Secretary General,
Undersecretary, and other special category positions will be subject to special requirements or
qualifications, experience, and suitability for variety of assignments.
These positions will be appointed by the president of the Republic of South Sudan after
recommendations by the ministerial subcommittee for the appointment and promotion of super
grade posts of the GoSS under the Chairmanship of the Minister of LPSHRD.
Subsection 3.6 further notes that appointments to ordinary super grade posts shall be made by the
approval of the Council of Ministers of the GRSS—upon recommendation of the ministerial
subcommittee for appointment and promotion working in consultation with the concerned
ministries.


                                                                                       162 | P a g e
In subsection 3.8, appointments to the positions of administrative and professional staff are the
responsibility of the concerned ministries/institutions subject to endorsement by the MoLPSHRD.
The endorsement will be confirmed based on whether the concerned ministry or institution
followed the procedures and criteria for selection.

(c) Intra-ministerial Recruitment Board:
Before the appointment, and where the vacancy can be filled through internal promotion, a
ministry appointment board must be formed to undertake the selection process. The board shall be
chaired by a senior staff member of a grade above the post being filled.
Subsection 3.10 of the manual stipulates that selection will be confirmed by the concerned minister
and the undersecretary or head of department who will forward the papers to the MoLPSHRD for
final approval of the appointment.
In case of recruitment and appointment of new employees, subsection 3.12 provides that the
ministry or departmental recruitment board will conduct interviews of short-listed candidates
derived from an evaluation of responses to advertisements, provided by the labor department or a
list provided in the context of demobilization of the SPLA. The departmental recruitment board is
usually composed of three to five persons of whom at least one is a knowledgeable person from
outside the recruiting institution.
In addition to that, subsection 3.16 of the Manual of Public Service Procedures prescribes that all
new employees must undergo the induction course or program before taking over posts. And,
subsection 3.16 states that new employees must initially serve on probation for a period of three
(3) to twelve (12) months depending on the levels of positions filled in the unit/institution. Where
necessary, the probationary period may be extended for a further period as directed by the
respective supervisor in consultation with the head of relevant department/unit.

Annex 7: Training: Strengthening the Skills of Civil Servants in South Sudan
University of Juba, School of Public Service

Establishment. The SPS of the University of Juba was established on November 4, 2014 after
approval by the University of Juba Dean’s board. The establishment of an in-country institution to
spearhead capacity development in public administration followed a 2011 Council of Ministers
Resolution to establish an Institute of Public Administration. At that time, Patricia Powers
Thomson, the founding Director of the SPS submitted a proposal discussing the merits of an NGO
and Public Service Academy which was later refined into a call of action in consultation with the
Ebony Center’s Development Policy Forum, a leading national think tank, for the establishment
of the SPS. In 2014, a Board of Advisors was established to finalize the school’s formation. The
SPS began offering classes during the 2015–2016 academic year.
With regard to accreditation, during the inception and design stages of the structure of the School,
20 of the best schools in public service in the world were benchmarked. The School is currently
undergoing an international accreditation process to enhance linkages with other schools. There is
usefulness in promoting study trips to the region, that is, Kenya, Ethiopia, and South Sudan and
support visiting scholars to the school, there is strong emphasis on this to promote visibility. Within
South Sudan, the School hopes to create avenues for financial aid, endowments, and funding for
students.
Rationale for establishment. From the perspective of the SPS leadership, the international
development community’s approach to capacity building in South Sudan had been constrained by
a focus on short-term trainings that failed to address the underlying issues affecting the South
Sudan public service. The SPS was established with the belief that a critical mass of well-trained
public service personnel nurtured over the long term would create a solid foundation upon which
other capacity-building efforts could be layered. The School of Public Service hopes to achieve
this goal by pursuing a course of learning that captures the depth and intensity required to develop
skills that can change mindsets and create transformational leadership.
Management arrangements. The SPS is a public institution that is a part of the University of
Juba and is situated at the Customs Campus. With a central location, the campus sits on an
expansive stretch that also houses the School of Law and the University library. The faculty
building constructed with funding from the Norwegian Government is a modern structure with
facilities, lecture rooms, and offices, fully equipped to create a conducive learning and working
environment for the students and the staff. Electricity is delivered through solar power.
Salaries of the faculty and other operational costs are catered for by the government. The School’s
Director is in charge of the day-to-day management of the school focusing both on the academic
and administrative functions. The Director reports to the University Administration as well as a
                                                                                         165 | P a g e
Board of Trustees that provide oversight and strategic direction. As of February 2016, staffing at
the school comprised of eight academic staff and three administrative staff.151

Programs, faculty, and student enrollment. For the 2015–2016 academic year, the School is
offering a two-year Master’s degree in Public Administration.152 There are also plans in place to
roll out certificate courses and other customized courses over time. Eventually, the school aims to
establish an undergraduate program.
The Master’s Degree is a two-year program with at least 40 credit hours per a semester. The
program is designed for professionals already employed by the public sector, NGOs, development
partners, or the private sector; 65 percent of MA candidates are civil servants; 19 percent employed
by NGOs and international organizations; and 15 percent by the private sector. Enrollment for
2015–2016 stood at 51. By training mid-career professionals, the SPS enrolls those in a position
to apply transformational skills in their day-to-day work

Courses cover a range of material (see Box A7.1). The MA program targets skills for managing
and leading people and processes as well as using data to make evidence-based decisions.153
Courses are offered during the day for those who are available, as well as in the evening for those
with full-time jobs. Courses are administered through seminars, group work case studies, and
plenary. The classes have not more than 33 students each. In 2017, it was anticipated that
applicants would double and in the event, the School will take up to 60 students and run two tracks
simultaneously. The School leadership has noted improvement in students’ communications,
presentations, and critique skills; as they tackle business problems and real problem/issues
affecting their lives.
The SPS has vast experience in public policy and administration; 80 percent of full-time staff at
the SPS are South Sudanese; as of February 2016 this included eight faculty members and three
administrative staff. Faculty have degrees from well-regarded international universities including
Harvard, Oxford, Stanford, and Syracuse (Maxwell).
Furthermore, the University of Juba is leading the establishment of a transformational leadership
institute that will focus on enhancing women’s leadership skills while providing life skills, basic
numeracy, and literacy training in English where possible and in the local languages of South
Sudan. This presents a good partnership opportunity for the School with respect to reaching to
women in public service.
Fees and financing. A full tuition for the Masters in Public Administration for the pilot year was
SSP 6000 per year. Tuition this upcoming year will be SSP 12,000 per year (US$200 per year and
US$400 per year respectively, at the exchange rate of 30). The majority of students are self-funded,
though some scholarships are available for NGO candidates sponsored by USAID’s SUCCESS
project. Table A7.1 sets out the SPS annual operating costs, which amounted to SSP 1.9 million
in early 2016 (though may now have changed because of inflation).

Partnerships and accreditation arrangements. Partnerships with the University of Juba and
development partners have enabled a smooth transition for the School into the newly constructed
university campus. The funds for the construction of the Law School building, where the School
is located, came from Norway and the United States. In 2016, USAID’s SUCCESS project run by
Democracy International provided scholarships covering tuition and materials for students
working with civil society/NGOs in the pilot year of the MPA.
The leadership of SPS has expressed openness to partnerships with other training institutions inside
the country that share a complementary vision in supporting public administration capacity
development such as the MoLPSHRD HRTC.

MoLPSHRD HRTC

The HRTC was established by MoLPSHRD between 2009 and 2013, but has not been fully
operationalized. While still part of Sudan, public servants in the Khartoum administration received
in-service training in clerical and secretarial work through the South Sudan Multi Training Center
(MTC).154 As set out in Chapter 3, with the signing of the CPA, the government grappled with the
challenges of forming a civil service composed of former CCSS and CANS staff. It was felt that
an in-service training center should be revived to support the capacity development of this new
public service. In addition, the establishment of a centralized institute under the MoPSLHRD was
seen as an avenue for coordinating the ad hoc training taking place in the county. The newly
independent region saw an influx of uncoordinated and haphazard training initiatives. In particular,
the lack of adherence to a Master Curriculum in development partner training was seen to be at
cross-purposes with the formation of a unified system for public administration in the country.

In parallel with the establishment of the HRTC, as discussed in Section 3.6, the CBTF supported
the development of a Master Curriculum, finalized in 2012. The intention was to teach this
curriculum at the HRTC, and use it as a mechanism to coordinate training offered to national and
subnational civil servants. With this objective, the MoLPSHRD selected a total of 55 civil servants,
5 from each of the 10 states and 5 from national institutions that were then taken to Nairobi in
2005 for a 3-month training. A number of these civil servants have become instrumental in leading
MoLPSHRD efforts at different levels to undertake its mandate. The HRD directorate intends to
update the current master curriculum, merge it with the curriculum developed with support from
the Regional Capacity Building (RCB) program. In the future, the HRD aims to focus on delivering

long, intensive trainings that will have sustainable impact on the performance of the South Sudan
Civil Service.

The HRTC sits under the MoLPSHRD Directorate of HRD. Overall responsibility for the center
sits with the Director General HRD; in principle a director for training and a director of the center
are also appointed and report to the Director General. Recruitment and deployment of staff to the
HRTC has not commenced due to lack of funding. In the interim, staff of the Directorate of HRD
have undertaken tasks at the HRTC.
Between 2005 and 2013, the MoLPSHRD received support from development projects including
Skills for South Sudan; LICUS; CABIHRD-World Bank; MDTF; CBTF; and Kenya School of
Government. A key trilateral partnership was the RCB project. The RCB project was a partnership
project initiated with funding from the CIDA designed to support capacity development in
postconflict countries through peer support, institution building, and training. The aim of this 5-
year project was to build the capacity of the MDIs of Rwanda, Burundi, and South Sudan to
improve public service practice and service delivery. Critically, civil conflict in 2013 and
subsequent return to violence in July 2016 has greatly reduced donor support to the MoLPSHRD
capacity-building efforts, including the HRTC.

It was initially envisioned to establish an MDI at the national level and one training center in each
of South Sudan’s 10 states. With the support of the AfDB, construction of an HRTC facility was
completed in 2013, just outside of Juba. It included the infrastructure for Internet connectivity and
was equipped with computers. There are no dormitory or dining facilities. A constraint on
operationalizing training at HRTC has been the absence of vehicles and fuel to transport civil
servants from Juba to the center. A borehole to provide water was constructed with the support of
the World Bank IDCBP in 2014. Though the facility was not initially damaged by the 2013 civil
conflict, it has since been looted and is no longer functional. Training facilities were also
constructed in state capitals, but information about whether they have been used for their intended
purpose or have been damaged by ongoing conflict is unavailable.
The HRTC facility has been used as a venue for training delivered by partners. In 2014, through
an MOU signed by Kenya and South Sudan, the Kenya School of Government agreed to provide
courses at HRTC. KSG would provide faculty to teach, as long as MoLPSHRD covered the
operational expenses of holding classes. Given the period of austerity, the Ministry has not
consistently been able to provide fuel for transportation to the center, fuel to run the generator, or
meals to trainees.
With support from the IDCBP, operational costs were covered for a period in 2015, enabling 836
staff to receive in-service training on a range of topics including Supervisory Skills Development;
Electronic Records Management; Public Relations and Customer Care; Performance Appraisal;
Public Financial Management; Secretariat Management; Conducting meetings/Writing minutes;
                                                                                        169 | P a g e
Report writing skills; Change management for effective reforms for senior managers; Human
resource management. Importantly, stakeholders from the MoLPSHRD have expressed frustration
that the material taught is not well adapted to the South Sudanese context nor necessarily
contributing to a more needs-driven approach to training. Going forward, the MoLPSHRD is
interested to directly provide training to its civil servants rather than rely on external actors.

Government Accountancy Training Center

Establishment. The GATC was established in 1978 as an RATC to support the administration and
development needs of the then self-governing regional government of the Southern Region of
Sudan. The southern regional government was established as result of the Addis Ababa 1972 peace
agreement signed between representatives of the Sudan Government and the South Sudan
Liberation Movement.155
The RATC was born out of the need to train accountants and public finance professionals from the
Southern region to work in public departments and agencies including public enterprises and other
parastatals in Southern Sudan. During this period, there was regional-centric curriculum designed
for students that had completed secondary school. After completing training at the center, they
would then join the civil service at various government institutions. In 1982, when the second
Sudanese civil war broke out, training at the RATC came to a halt.
The center started being revived more than 20 years later following the signing of the 2005 CPA.
It was renamed the GATC to reflect the new status of the region as a semiautonomous state. Within
this new context, the intention was for the center to reassume its previous mandate and to deliver
training for civil servants in Southern Sudan in the areas of Accountancy and PFM.
The facility was established as a directorate within the MoFEP. It was renovated and refurbished
to commence its functions as the PFM capacity development arm of the ministry. The center is
located centrally in Juba, within easy reach of the ministries complex. It has learning facilities
consisting of five classrooms, one large conference hall, and a computer laboratory. Despite some
investments, the facilities remain in need of further rehabilitation and equipment.
Rationale for revitalization. As a result of over two decades of war, South Sudan was faced with
a huge challenge of transforming a workforce that is an amalgamation of civil servants from
various background across the capacity spectrum, some with extensive knowledge and experience
in the Sudan PFM systems, others straight from the fighting fields with very limited experience in
civil service work and others that fall somewhere in the middle. Faced with this challenge, the
MoFEP sought to revive the institution as a center for transformation of the human resource at its

disposal into public accountants and finance officers who are well conversant with applicable
standards to support administrative and financial management needs of public institutions.

Management arrangements and funding. The governance structure at GATC remains
inadequate due to an undefined and complex arrangement with the MoFEP.156 Channels of
communication between the parent ministry and GATC are not clear and aspects critical for GATC
to operate effectively including an organizational structure, the recruitment of qualified staff to run
the center and train students, and sufficient budget for operations have not been prioritized in a
context of scarce resources for civilian functions. As for some other areas, there is a mismatch
between the policy vision and actual prioritizations. A new Director General for the center was
appointed in 2013, signaling some greater commitment toward achieving a revival of the center.
Course, curriculum, and accreditation arrangements. Since its reopening, the GATC has not
directly delivered any training and GATC staff do not have experience in designing curriculum.157
Instead, in the first few years after the reopening, the facility was used as a venue to host trainings
for civil servants funded by development partners. These trainings were typically short, one to four
weeks in duration with externally designed curricula, administered by external consultants. These
series of short-term trainings have further contributed to a disjointed atmosphere at GATC relative
to its mandate to lead the capacity-building agenda for PFM for civil servants in South Sudan.
While initial trainings were short term and exclusively delivered by external consultants, a second
round of support (funded by the CBTF) focused on very ambitious professional accountancy
training in ACCA and CIPS. Results were poor, as students lacked the prerequisites to succeed in
the training. In addition, professionalization was difficult, as the required on-the-job hours could
not be done in South Sudan (as there were no ACCA accountants to provide mentoring).

  Interview with the GATC Training Director.
                                                                                         171 | P a g e
In the years after the reopening of the GATC, the staff were not engaged in any way in the trainings
or in the delivery of the courses run by external entities although according to the GATC training
director, international consultants did struggle when explaining concepts to students and it would
have been more effective to engage local tutors capable of translating into local Arabic and
applying the concepts to the realities of South Sudan.
In response to these initial experiences, and under new leadership, more recently the GATC has
sought to actually itself design and roll out longer-term courses of at least 9 months focusing on
day program teaching, while still relying on development partner funding to support this process.

From within the institution, a process was started to develop a curriculum in collaboration with the
School of Management Sciences at the University of Juba and with the support of the World Bank
IDCB project. The aim was to design a curriculum that is adaptive to the unique characteristics of
the civil service base in South Sudan targeting the Accounts and Budget Officers in PFM and
Procurement units within the civil service. The work on curriculum development continues as the
leadership at the GATC has sought to add key components to the training such as the English for
Finance course to address the problems associated with the use of English as the primary tutoring
language which a significant proportion of civil servants are not proficient in.

The curriculum development process will also take into account the fact that the GATC unlike the
RATC does not train students from universities, they train civil servants already hired and working
in the public service. As part of the strategy, once established and fully functioning, the GATC
seeks accreditation internationally to become globally competitive as an institution of PFM
training.
Staffing. As per the structure outlined by the MoFEP, the staffing at the GATC, which is a
directorate under the ministry, is comprised of a Director, Deputy Director, Assistant Director, and
clerical staff. The leadership at the GATC have a minimum qualification of a Bachelor’s degree.
A proportion of current staff are above the retirement age.
The debilitating economic crisis has led to the loss in value of the South Sudan currency. As a
result, the government salaries have shrunk drastically. This is a demotivating factor for the
qualified staff at the GATC, who when presented with other options may have chosen to leave the
civil service. As such, it is not clear if all the positions at the GATC currently remain filled.
Students and enrollment. According to the GATC director, most of the training participants to
date have been from the states and the criteria for participation have been set by the development
partners which funding the training. These do not reflect the GATC strategic direction or interests.
Fees and financing: All trainings conducted at the GATC are supposed to be free of charge for
civil servants and the departments where they are employed. However with the insufficient support
received from the MoFEP for running the GATC, development partners have had to cover the
                                                                                       172 | P a g e
training costs while the facilities of the center were provided for free, save for operation costs such
as fuel for the generator.

Partnerships and nature of engagement: The GATC has hosted numerous trainings designed
and funded by various partners of the MoFEP; however only as a training facility, not as a lead
capacity-building institution for the civil service. Typically, partnerships are arranged with the
MoFEP directorate of training as the primary government counterpart and this limits the ability of
the GATC to engage directly with partners.
The GATC’s experience reflects the struggle to establish or reestablish functioning national
training institutions which are critical to the longer-term capacity of the public service, and the
reproduction and renewal of capacities over time. During the early postconflict years, neither
development partners nor the government had a clear vision or strategy for how to revive the
institution; and training was only delivered ad hoc and without laying a foundation for the
institution itself. This was followed by an overambitious attempt to bring ACCA training to South
Sudan; which again did not involve an institutional anchoring. Building on these lessons and with
a new leadership appointed in 2013, attention has begun to be channeled toward re-developing the
GATC as an institution. However, this process has been slowed and disrupted by renewed conflict.

English Language Training in South Sudan

Windle Trust International is a U.K.-based charity registered in 2002 with offices in Sudan, South
Sudan, Uganda, Kenya, and Ethiopia. It was previously known as the Hugh Pilkington Charitable
Trust and registered in Kenya in 1977. Windle Trust International was set up to support people in
countries affected by conflict in Africa and invests in higher education and training through
scholarship programs at universities and colleges in Africa and the United Kingdom to develop
the knowledge and skills needed by young professionals to positively contribute to development
of their communities and countries. Through this investment, Windle Trust aims to build their
potential as future leaders in their field of expertise and to be positive role models in their
communities. The Trust also engages in providing intensive English programs to improve
proficiency in working in English.
In South Sudan, English is the official language as well as the medium of instruction from Primary
4. Apart from the formal institutions of instructions; Windle Trust is a primary English language
training provider in the country. It has not only provided trainings to teachers but also to
government officials in the Ministry of Justice, Finance and Economic Planning, Ministry of
Labor, Public Service and Human Resources Development, LGB as well as to students158. The
trainings are delivered using the Common European Framework of Reference for Language
(CEFR). The CEFR is an internationally recognized framework that describes six levels of

language ability from A1 for beginners up to C2 for those who have mastered a language. The
CEFR is used by organizations all over the world as a reliable benchmark of language ability.
Since 2009 to date, Windle Trust has trained a total of about 616 government officials in English
language with funding from CBTF and USAID (Winrock) mostly at the national with minimal
coverage at the subnational level. The subnational level trainings were in Wau, Torit, Kuajok,
Aweil, Bentiu.159 See Annex 4 for a more detailed overview of Windle Trust.
Windle does an entry assessment covering reading, writing, and speaking, and then groups the
learners as beginners, pre-intermediates, intermediates, and advanced. Learners are assessed
regularly throughout the training, and take a test at the end of the six-month training; if their
achievements (as demonstrated by their score) are not high enough, the learner is not allowed to
advance to the next level of training. Each level is taught a minimum of 160 hours.160
Through funding from Global Partnership for Education, Windle Trust supported the development
of the English language policy to improve the teaching and learning of English in South Sudan’s
primary schools.161
