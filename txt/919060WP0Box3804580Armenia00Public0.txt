THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Apply and obtain architectural-constructional assignment (АПЗ)

        The company submits an application form to the Architectural and
        Urban Development Department of the Yerevan Municipality with the
        following information: the purpose of usage, building type and address,
        and the name(s) and license number(s) of the design firm(s). As part of
        this process, the owner receives technical conditions from appropriate
        authorities for drawing, building, and using the building’s engineering
        substructures. The fee and time line are determined by the agreement
        with the company.

        For BuildCo to obtain a building permit, the municipality awards an
        architectural design assignment to a licensed building design firm,
        upon receiving the application and the drawings. The design firm
        prepares the drawing(s) with information on technical, urban, and other
        necessary conditions. The architectural drawing undergoes a review
        performed by the Chief Architect at the Municipality. The drawings are
   1    then approved by the Yerevan Municipality, citing the duration of the        15 days           no charge
        construction. Until May 2008, an architectural design assignment and
        building permit would not be issued without contributing AMD 3 -- 5
        million to a charitable ”Yerevan Fund” designated by the municipal
        authority. There was no specific law or norm about this fund. However,
        the Mayor of Yerevan abolished this requirement through a municipal
        decision. This came as result of order by Prime Minister of Republic of
        Armenia on January 15, 2008 (Cabinet Meeting Protocol #2-2).
        Companies are no longer required to pay this fee. To further enforce
        the implementation of the decision, the Mayor’s Office launched a
        public campaign among construction sector, following allegations of
        recurring use of this contribution.

        According to legislation the official time limit to issue the APZ is 15
        days. However, because the technical conditions are obtained
        individually from each agency, the APZ is issued after receiving all
        technical conditions from utilities.

      days.

                     requirement for shareholder approval of related-party
 DB2013              transactions, requiring greater disclosure of such transactions

                    Armenia reduced the time required for trading across borders
                    by encouraging greater competition in the banking and
DB2010              transport sectors and customs brokerage service industry and
                    by reducing the number of goods requiring inspection and the
