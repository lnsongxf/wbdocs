Executive Summary

   1. Isolated by nature, and recovering from a period of historically low growth during the
      eighties and nineties, Paraguay faced many economic and social challenges at the beginning
      of the twenty first century. By year 2000, Paraguay GDP per capita was only 50% of the
      Latin American average and 34 percent of its MERCOSUR partners. High poverty and
      inequality were an inherent characteristic of the country.
   2. Yet, between 2003 and 2013, Paraguay has performed substantially well, seeing a reduction
      in moderate and extreme (monetary) poverty. This is essentially the result of a period of
      average significant growth combined with a reduction in inequality.
   3. This report explores the factors associated to the observed improvements in welfare
      and inequality, and investigates the challenges facing their sustainability, given the
      historical structural problems of Paraguay to maintain growth and improve social
      indicators. The underlying question is indeed whether the growth model and reduction in
      inequality are consistent with a positive social dynamics, taking a comprehensive definition
      of equity, which includes sustainable elimination of absolute poverty, enhancing equality of
      opportunity and strengthening agency for all groups.
   4. Given that a significant proportion of the improvements in welfare were only experienced
      after 2011, the analysis considers two periods: 2003 to 2011, when extreme poverty remained
      stable despite per capita GDP increasing by 22 percent, and 2011 to 2013, when extreme
      poverty almost halved. At the core of the explanation of the differential evolution is the role
      of inequality, access to markets, and food prices.



Introduction


   5. Paraguay’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) reached its highest value in history in
      2013 – though still remaining at just over half of the regional average. While this growth has
      been pro-poor, with the bottom 40 percent experiencing a slightly higher growth than the
      top 60 percent, inequality remained stubbornly high – particularly in the rural parts of the
      country – until 2012. The Paraguayan economy depends increasingly and significantly on
      agriculture. Yet, two-thirds of the extreme poor live in rural area and rely heavily on this
      volatile sector.
   6. As poverty almost halved, the size of the middle class has been growing and represents the
      largest socioeconomic group in the country. Yet, as in the beginning of the decade, one in
      four Paraguayans remains economically vulnerable to falling back into poverty.
   7. However, there are signs of some structural and lasting changes to poverty as extent of
      deprivations in non-monetary dimensions (such as access to key goods and services) fell
      throughout the decade even in periods when monetary poverty did not decline as much such
      as between 2003 and 2011. It is important to note, however, that though access has
      increased, quality of these services may remain a challenge.

                                                                                                   5
First pillar: Mobility out of poverty

   8. Between 2003 and 2011, while both growth and distribution were contributing to a
      significant increase of the income of the poor, food prices were rising at a higher rate than
      general prices in the economy, mitigating to a significant extent the reduction in extreme
      poverty that would have otherwise resulted. In contrast, all three forces –growth, inequality
      reduction and decreasing food prices-- have been working in the same direction since 2011.
      Disproportionately high income growth among the less well-off and especially in rural areas
      is a strong factor behind the recent improvement in poverty. In both periods, rising labor
      incomes have been the driving force both because of increased earnings and increased
      number of earners. Meanwhile non-labor incomes such as public transfers only started to
      play a significant role in the past two years –perhaps due to important increases in coverage
      of the main social programs.

   9. The role of labor income: Economic growth in the past decade has been driven in large
      part by the two largest sectors in the economy: agriculture and manufacturing. However,
      these gains in output have not translated into significantly higher employment growth in
      these activities, particularly for the less skilled. Indeed, while agriculture remains the primary
      sector of employment, especially for the low-skilled, between 2003 and 2013 the proportion
      of the low-skilled employed in this sector fell. Similarly, manufacturing still represents the
      largest sectors in terms of output (around 25 percent of the total economy) and yet,
      continues to account for only 10 percent of total employment. In fact, output increases in
      agriculture and manufacturing have been accompanied by falls in low-skilled employment,
      suggesting a replacement of low-skill labor. Instead, other sectors, occupations such as
      construction and services have become more relevant and, with higher wages than
      agriculture, present improved labor opportunities for low-skilled labor, and thus helped
      families moved out of poverty in both rural and urban areas.

   10. The importance of the rural sector. Agriculture is the main source of income of the
       extreme poor living in rural areas, but most are self-employed or unpaid (especially women),
       cultivating few crops for both home consumption and a few for market. With inadequate
       irrigation systems and agricultural practices and limited access to markets, small farm holders
       are excessively exposed to exogenous shocks, such as droughts, floods, price fluctuations
       and infestation and diseases. In the absence of good access to financial markets (both
       insurance and credit), and a limited role of government, agricultural families are excessively
       vulnerable to falling (further) into poverty, as reflected in the 2009-10 drought when
       incomes of the bottom quintile experienced a significant drop. In this context, income
       diversification becomes essential, both in terms of types of crops cultivated (or cattle
       raising), and of labor and non-labor income sources. Indeed, in recent years, there has been a
       movement towards wage employment, both agriculture (larger farms) and non-agriculture
       (mostly construction, transport and public and private services), generating alternative

                                                                                                      6
       sources of income which could be more profitable and stable. In addition, non-labor
       incomes have played an important role in alleviating extreme poverty as a diversification
       strategy (largely, family transfers and informal lending and to a lesser extent, public transfers
       such as tekopora and adultos mayores), as well as a strategy to cope with adverse shocks.



   11. The role of urban labor markets. The halving of urban poverty corresponds to significant
       changes in the urban labor market between 2003 and 2013: a fall in the unemployment rate,
       increases in employment in the higher-paying large firm sector (particularly in construction
       and public and private services), and rising income for the self-employed and small firm
       workers. Nonetheless, like the rural poor, the urban poor remain exposed to household
       income volatility through high unemployment rates and high shares of self-employment. To
       a significant degree, low-skilled and unskilled labor –the workers most likely to be in poverty
       – remain unprotected by the minimum wage legislation.
   12. Despite the trend observed throughout the decade of increased employment in higher
       paying large firms, year-to-year transitions show that mobility into this sector is limited for
       the self-employed and workers in microenterprises –less than 3 percent of those in either of
       these categories is able to transition into large firm wage employment by the following year.
       But once in the large firm sector, then only a small proportion change type of employment a
       year later. The self-employed, rather than becoming small business persons, they typically
       transition into employment in a micro firm or leave the labor force. Indeed, the proportion
       of low skilled workers that are employers is almost negligible. Finally, while unemployment
       rate has steadily declined, the persistence of unemployment for those that are unemployed is
       particularly alarming: one in five of the unemployed between 2010 and 2012 remained
       unemployed one year later, suggesting that part of the population experiences either chronic
       or frequent spells of unemployment.



Second Pillar: The pursuit of opportunities for all

   13. One of the greatest structural barriers to equity, a challenge that Paraguay faces today is the
       high and persistent level of inequality in terms of opportunities for different groups, as
       defined by their circumstances of birth, including family background. This poses challenges
       to the sustainability of the recent improvements for future generations. While access to
       services for children has increased throughout the decade, there remain significant
       differences across circumstance groups. Coverage rates for access to flush toilet or tap water
       are quite different for poor and non-poor people, but also discrepancies are higher taking
       into account urban or rural location. Similarly, educational attainment is highly correlated
       with location and socioeconomic status, which in turn, will impact intergenerational mobility.
       Indeed, inequality of opportunities in the labor market has been rising in recent years, where
       place of birth (combining both rural/urban area and department), language spoken at home


                                                                                                      7
       and gender play an important role. This suggests inadequate access to opportunities in
       childhood can have significant impacts on inequality in the labor market and thus influence
       the next generation’s outcomes.
   14. One factor that can be associated to the observed persistence of structural inequities is the
       fact that social policies are not effective enough to counterbalance these inherited
       inequalities. Paraguay’s fiscal system –including the overall role of the system of taxes and
       transfers-- is among the weakest in the region, incorporating a regressive tax system and
       limited redistribution through spending. On top of this, institutional and operational
       inefficiencies e.g. weak civil service system, and/or the lack of an effective monitoring and
       evaluation, may enfeeble the deprived social service delivery.

The third pillar: strengthening Agency

   15. The third dimension where the country still has room to make progress towards an equitable
       society relates to the strengthening of agency, understood as the capacity of people to be
       actors in their own development, establishing and pursuing effectively life plans they have
       reasons to value. This pillar has manifestations in different realms and dimensions. There is,
       however, one aspect that is salient and can be analyzed with existing data: the economic and
       social role of women. Paraguay has made progress over the last decade in promoting
       women’s empowerment and gender equality. Improvements have been particularly strong in
       women’s endowments, in terms of sexual and health indicators, as well as educational
       attainment and achievement. In recent years, there have also been important improvements
       in the legal framework to provide for gender equality. Despite these improvements,
       challenges remain in the areas of labor markets (particularly in terms of youth
       unemployment, job quality and segmentation), domestic violence, and teenage pregnancy.
       These manifestations of agency reflect, to some extent, the country’s social norms, as
       reflected in perception surveys.



Conclusions

   16. Paraguay has made substantial progress in the last decade in improving its people’s
       welfare and reducing inequality. There are some reasons for optimism related to
       increased labor productivity in agriculture and improved employment opportunities,
       suggesting potentially long-lasting transformations.

   17. Still, the country faces challenges that can threaten the sustainability of the observed
       improvements. A key obstacle Paraguay faces today is the fact that a large share of the
       population faces a volatile economic environment. A second space of concern relates to the
       still high and persistent lack of opportunities for all groups: Even though inequality in
       income has fallen, some aspects related to the structural determinants of inequity remain.


                                                                                                   8
    Finally, the relevance of strengthening agency and autonomy, particularly of women in their
    participation in markets, community and relationships, is at the core of an equitable society.


18. To reduce structural inequities in monetary and non-monetary outcomes, it will be
    essential to address their structural determinants. This requires promoting well-
    functioning and accessible markets that are able to provide all segments of the population
    with well paying, high productivity jobs; enhancing risk management at the macro and micro
    levels to protect households falling back into poverty in the presence of shocks; ensuring
    equitable, efficient and sustainable fiscal policy to guarantee a solid fiscal position that allows
    for redistributive fiscal policy; improve fairness and transparency of institutions in the
    provision of high quality public goods without excluding any segments of the population
    and; design policies to expand women’s opportunities in the labor market and enhance their
    agency, self-esteem and aspirations.

Introduction

Isolated by nature, and recovering from a period of historically low growth during the eighties and
nineties, Paraguay faced many economic and social challenges at the beginning of the twenty first
century. By year 2000, Paraguay GDP per capita was only 50% of the Latin American average and
34 percent of its MERCOSUR partners. High poverty and inequality were an inherent characteristic
of the country.

Yet, between 2003 and 2013, Paraguay has performed substantially well, seeing a reduction
in moderate and extreme (monetary) poverty. This is essentially the result of a period of average
significant growth combined with a reduction in inequality. Given that a significant proportion of
the improvements in welfare were only experienced after 2011, the analysis considers two periods:
2003 to 2011, when extreme poverty remained stable despite per capita GDP increasing by 22
percent, and 2011 to 2013, when extreme poverty almost halved. At the core of the explanation of
the differential evolution is the role of inequality, access to markets, and food prices.


Between 2003 and 2011, economic growth in Paraguay was both high and volatile, and while
moderate poverty declined, extreme poverty was more persistent, and income inequality has
improved modestly. Per capita GDP grew by 33 percent over the time period, but experienced a
major dip during the 2009 drought and global financial crisis when it fell by 5.2 percent from the
previous year [




                                                                                                 10
Figure 1]. While moderate poverty rate declined by 12 percentage points between 2003 and 2011,
extreme poverty rate only fell by 3 percentage points. Using comparable numbers, Paraguay reduced
moderate poverty and extreme poverty by less than LAC and lagged behind the Southern Cone by
6.5 percentage points in the reduction of moderate poverty and 3.5 percentage points in the
reduction of extreme poverty. As of 2011, 32.4 percent of Paraguayans still lived in poverty and 18
percent lived in extreme poverty. Income inequality fell merely 0.03 points since 2003 and remains
high at 0.53 as of 2011.


In the last couple of years, however, there are significant signs of improvement. Between
2011 and 2013 the economy grew 12 percent despite the dip in 2012, per capita income was 8.5
percent higher and extreme poverty as well as inequality finally showed to be responding to this
growth. By 2013, 10 percent of the people fell below the extreme poverty line (24 percent below the
moderate poverty line), and the Gini coefficient went down 0.04 points placing it at a historical
minimum.2

from the report.

This report explores the factors associated to the observed improvements in welfare and
inequality, and investigates the challenges facing their sustainability, given the historical
structural problems of Paraguay to maintain growth and improve social indicators. The
underlying question is indeed whether the growth model and reduction in inequality are consistent
with a positive social dynamics, taking a comprehensive definition of equity, which includes
sustainable elimination of absolute poverty, enhancing equality of opportunity and strengthening
agency for all groups.

The conceptual framework is based on a tripartite definition of “equity” - the equity
triangle. The first dimension of the equity triangle, the elimination of absolute poverty, entails that
all members of a society are guaranteed a well-defined minimum standard to survive with dignity. All
individuals must have sufficient access to goods and services such that they are able to achieve well-
defined outcomes. The second dimension, fairness—or independence from original
circumstances—lies in the notion that the initial background characteristics of individuals outside of
their control (such as gender or area of childhood residence) should not limit the set of
opportunities available to them and dictate their achievement. Finally, equity is also about agency
(process-freedom), which is about strengthening of the individuals’ capacity to make choices and
transform those choices into desired outcomes. Thus, an equitable society promotes mobility out of
poverty, delinks background from socioeconomic achievement and empowers citizens by providing
them with voice and autonomy. The present study will provide a diagnosis of these three elements as
well as propose key policy changes to improve equity while enhancing the virtuous cycle of shared
prosperity.

Based on this framework, and to answer the broader question on whether the recent improvements
in equity are indeed signs of a more sustainable equitable society, this report explores the following
specific questions:

     1. Why did growth have a limited effect on reducing extreme poverty until 2011, and
        what explains the recent reversal of this relationship? What is the role of labor

          markets, as well as public and private transfers in driving poverty reduction? To what
          extent have non-monetary dimensions of well-being improved throughout the
          decade? (Section 2)
       2. To what extent do conditions at birth determine Paraguayans’ access to basic
          services and opportunities throughout their lifetime? (Section 3)
       3. What are the challenges that remain in terms of individual autonomy and voice,
          particularly with regards to women? (Section 4)
       4. What are the key policy lessons that can be drawn from the above analysis to improve
          equity while fostering growth? (Section 5)


The next section provides a brief description of the main features of the growth, poverty and
inequality processes in Paraguay since 2003. Importantly, persistent high income inequality is
highlighted as a key obstacle to eradicating extreme poverty and achieving significant reductions in
poverty.



1. Growth, poverty and inequality: Stylized facts

This section describes the main stylized facts of the Paraguay economy in the past decade
in terms of growth, poverty and inequality, concluding with a description of the
demographics of poverty. The analysis begins in 2003 to ensure comparability of the estimates that
are drawn from the Permanent Household Survey (Encuesta Permanente the Hogares - EPH) and
includes the recently released 2013 data but not the 2012 data released only as preliminary.
Paraguay’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) reached its highest value in history in
2013 – though still remaining at just over half of the regional average. According to the World
Development Indicators (WDI), Paraguay’s per capita gross domestic product (GDP) reached in
2011 its highest value in history:3 $5,448 in PPP (constant 2005 international prices), decreasing to
$5,290 in 2012. This placed the country well below the average in Latin American and the Caribbean
— though higher than countries such as Nicaragua, Honduras, Guatemala, Guyana and Bolivia [




Figure 2]. Over the last decade economic growth in Paraguay has been high but volatile. Between
2003 and 2013, per capita GDP (constant 1994 US$) grew by 33 percent; but it experienced a major
dip during the 2009 drought and global financial crisis, when it fell by 5.2 percent from the previous
year. Yet, record growth of 11.2 percent in 2010 more than compensated for the loss [

The bottom 40 percent has benefited from economic growth4, with this group experiencing
higher growth than the top 60 percent. Between 2003 and 2011, above-average income growth
raised the incomes of the poorest 40 percent of Paraguayans (at 4 percent per annum) above the
mean income growth of the population (at 3.3 percent per annum) [Figure 3Error! Reference
source not found.]. Using comparable figures, Paraguay’s performance for the bottom 40 percent is
close to that of the LAC region as a whole, but still lags behind it and neighboring countries such as
Uruguay, Argentina or Brazil. 5 But in the two subsequent years, the rate of growth of the bottom
two quintiles was two and a half times higher than that of the mean –14 percent compared to 5.6
percent annually.

4 Within the World Bank’s twin goals of ending extreme poverty and boosting shared prosperity, the latter has been
defined as “expanding the size of the pie continuously and sharing it in such a way that the welfare of those at the lower
end of the income distribution rises as quickly as possible” (World Bank 2013e). Promoting shared prosperity has thus
been enunciated as fostering the income growth of the bottom 40 percent of the population.

While this growth has been pro-poor, inequality remained stubbornly high – particularly in
the rural parts of the country – until 2012. During most of the past decade, the Gini coefficient
fluctuated around 0.51 and 0.52 [Figure 4Error! Reference source not found.], placing Paraguay’s
inequality among the highest in LAC – itself the most unequal region in the world. Until 2011,
jointly with Brazil, Paraguay was the most unequal country in Southern Latin America. In a period in
which the region has shown significant improvements in inequality, Paraguay’s performance paled in
comparison with other countries such as Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru.6 Nevertheless, since 2011
the country appears to have caught up with these countries by showing a significant decrease in the
Gini index from 0.52 in 2011 to 0.48 in 2013. Inequality is also considerably higher in rural areas
than in urban ones and the gap up until 2011 has been growing —by 0.06 percentage points since
2003. In 2011, inequality in urban areas was 0.10 lower than in rural areas (0.47 versus 0.57). By the
year 2013, however, the rural Gini index had fallen 0.08 points, halving the gap between these two
areas. Rural inequality continues to be higher than in urban areas, and one of the highest in the
region, but still it sits below 0.50. In section 2.1 some factors behind this noteworthy improvement
are explored.

The Paraguayan economy depends increasingly and significantly on agriculture and, as a
consequence, has become more volatile. By the end of the decade, more than 20 percent of total
GDP came from this sector [Figure 5]. In comparison, the importance of agriculture in the region is
below 5 percent. The high levels of volatility of this sector due to weather shocks and fluctuations in
commodity prices and external demand, combined with a significant reliance on few export products
and export destination, have a dramatic impact on the total economy.7 Macroeconomic volatility, in
turn, has adverse effects in terms of welfare and equity in most developing countries.8 Section 2.3 in
this report explores the extent to which volatility in agriculture is reflected in variability in
households’ incomes and their strategies to cope with it.

Despite the increasing reliance on agriculture, and the substantive decline in poverty in
recent years, two-thirds of the extreme poor live in rural areas and rely heavily on this
volatile sector. By 2013, approximately 138,226 thousand families were not able to meet the cost of
a basic food basket; and 68 percent of those families lived in rural areas [Table 1]. The incidence of
poverty in rural areas is nowadays three times as high as in urban areas [Figure 6].

Both urban and rural areas benefited from this decade’s growth in terms of reducing
moderate and extreme poverty, although the decline in rural areas was more recent than in
urban ones. 12 of the 14 percentage point reduction in rural extreme poverty between 2003 and
2013 happened in the last two years. In urban areas, instead, 40 percent of the reduction was
observed in the first 8 years of analysis9.


Discrepancies in poverty incidence are not only between urban and rural areas, but also
across geographic areas. More than a fifth of the population is not able to satisfy their basic food
requirements in San Pedro and Caaguazú, whereas in Asunción and Central less than 5 percent of
the population is in this situation [Figure 7]. At the same time, these latter two departments
concentrate 20 percent of the extreme poor in the country. It is worth noting that the largest
concentration of extreme poor is in the category “Rest” (excluding Boquerón and Alto Paraguay).

9 2006 poverty estimates are not strictly comparable with the rest of the series since important budget constraints forced
the DGEEC to postpone data collection until March 2007 while in all other years data collection was performed in the
months of August to December of each year (World Bank 2010).

                                                                                                                          17
As poverty almost halved, the size of the middle class (and above) has been growing and
represents today the largest socioeconomic group in the country. Between 2003 and 2013, the
proportion of the population earning more than 10 dollars a day per person grew by over 20
percentage points, representing in 2013 half of the total population of the country.10 The rate of
growth of the middle class experienced by Paraguay is similar to the one the whole region, which
also grew by 50 percent.11
And yet, as at the beginning of the period, still one in four Paraguayans remain
economically insecure (the vulnerable), with a sizeable probability of falling back into
poverty. In a context of a highly volatile environment such as that of Paraguay and with the recent
sizeable improvements observed, it will be more important than ever to seek mechanisms to ensure
that the gains obtained in the good periods are not quickly reversed when the winds change.




10 The threshold that separates the vulnerable and the middle class is set at $10 a day per person (2005 PPP terms),
following the definitions in Ferreira et al. (2012)

Households that are in poverty are headed by significantly less educated individuals than
those currently in the middle class or higher [Figure 9]. Indeed, household heads in the middle
class have four more years of education than the poor and at least two more than the vulnerable.
Similarly, middle class families tend to have less than half the number of children than poor families
(on average 1.2 as opposed to more than 3) and largely reside in urban areas. Finally, and in relation
to opportunities available to different groups, only a small minority of the extreme poor speak only
Spanish at home, in contrast to a third among middle class families.

Despite the sizeable proportion of people that are still moderately poor or vulnerable to fall
into poverty, there are some signs of some structural and lasting changes to poverty as the
extent of deprivations in non-monetary dimensions fell throughout the decade even in
periods when monetary poverty did not decline as much such as between 2003 and 2011




                                                                                                                                                       19
[Figure 10]. Unlike monetary measures, which rely on cut-offs based on income or consumption,
non-monetary indicators of poverty measure the share of the population deprived of a key good or
service using defined standards.12 The proportion of Paraguayans that are deprived in at least four
out of seven key non-monetary dimensions of well-being, including education, housing quality,
water, sanitation, electricity, and assets, has gone down from a third of the population to less than a
tenth.

While important progress in non-monetary dimensions have been observed in both urban
and rural areas, the country still faces challenges especially in rural areas. Between 2003 and
2013, Paraguay has successfully brought down the degree of deprivation to less than 5 percent in
terms of access to electricity, education attainment and enrolment in secondary education. At the



12Countries are increasingly adopting multidimensional poverty approaches to assess their progress. One of the pioneers
in Latin America is Mexico, see:
http://www.coneval.gob.mx/rw/resource/Metodologia_Medicion_Multidimensional.pdf.

                                                                                                                    20
national level, the amount of people who did not own at least two key assets (e.g., TV, telephone,
transportation device, refrigerator) decreased from 69 percent of the population in 2003 to 32
percent in 2013 [Figure 11]. Similarly, the proportion of people who lived in dwellings without piped
water or toilet facility decreased by 23 percentage points and 22 percentage points respectively.


Improvements in non-monetary dimensions of well-being during this period suggest also a
lower level of chronic poverty. While chronicity refers to the persistence of poverty over time, in
the absence of nation-wide data that reflects individual-level income over time, the chronic poor are
identified as those who are both income poor and are also deprived in at least three non-monetary
indicators.13 This relies on the idea that multidimensionally poor individuals are more likely to have
been monetary poor in more than one period.14 With both the improvement in monetary and non-
monetary poverty in the last decade, there has been a sizeable decrease in the share of the population
considered chronically poor, falling from 14 percent in 2003 to less than 3 percent in 2013 [Figure
12]. At the same time, the percentage of people who were not poor across either dimension (the
better off – blue area) rose by 25 percentage points, reaching 85 percent in 2013.

In sum, in the last decade Paraguay has experienced substantial increases in individuals’
well-being. Today, the majority of the country has reached a level of income that is regionally
considered as the middle class threshold. The improvements in non-monetary dimensions also
suggest that the advances might be long-lasting. However, the challenges remain. A sizeable
proportion of the population, while not poor, remains vulnerable to falling back into poverty, and
the large bulk of the monetary and non-monetary deprivations are concentrated in rural areas -
intrinsically dependent on the highly volatile agriculture sector.

The following section will dig into the drivers behind the trends in poverty and inequality described
above. Due to the essentially rural nature of the poverty in the country, the analysis will be done
separately for the urban and rural extreme poor.

2. First Pillar: Mobility out of Poverty

The present section analyzes the factors behind the observed changes in poverty and inequality in
the last decade. As described in the next subsection, growth, redistribution and food prices all play
an important role in explaining the both the stickiness of extreme poverty until 2011 and the
sizeable improvement since then. Since labor incomes represent a driving force behind the
improvements in well-being, subsections 2.2, 2.3., and 2.4 focus primarily on the role of the labor
markets, first at the national level linking evolution of output and employment, and then by
deepening into the specific factors in rural and urban areas, respectively.



2.1 Main factors


Three factors explain changes in poverty rates between two years: (1) changes in the
position of the poverty line, (2) changes in position of the distribution (growth), and (3)
changes in the shape of the distribution (redistribution). In the case of Paraguay these three
factors have been at play in explaining both the stickiness of the extreme poverty headcount
between 2003 and 2011, as well as the impressive decline in poverty between 2011 and 2013. This
sub-section explains the role that these three factors had in explaining the observed evolution in
poverty and income inequality. Sub-section 2.2 digs deeper into the link between macroeconomic
growth and households incomes. Finally, sub-sections 2.3 and 2.4 explore the role of labor markets
as a means towards exiting poverty in rural and urban areas respectively.

Extreme poverty fell significantly between 2011 and 2013 after stubbornly fluctuating around
18 percent between 1997 and 2011 despite periods of impressive economic growth. While the
extreme poverty rate fell only slightly between 2003 and 2011 by 3.2 percentage points, it fell by 7.85
percentage points between 2011 and 2013 [Figure 13]. This impressive drop in the extreme poverty
rate was driven by two factors: 1) the continuing effects of growth and redistribution and 2) a
decrease in food price inflation. As the extreme poverty line is determined solely based on the price
of a selected basked of food, increases in food prices generated sizeable increases in the extreme
poverty line.

Between 2003 and 2011, while both growth and distribution were contributing to a
significant reduction in poverty, food prices were rising at a higher rate than general prices

                                                                                                                                         24
in the economy and thus mitigated to a significant extent the reduction in extreme poverty
rate. This can be seen by comparing in Figure 14 the shift to the right and widening on the income
distribution between 2003 (dotted green line) and 2011 (dashed red line), as at the same time the
extreme poverty line moves to the right. Quantifying the effects of these three forces, growth and
improved income distribution contributed to a decline of 9.48 percentage points in poverty between
2003 and 2011, while rapid increases in the price of the food basket (relative to general prices)
increased poverty by 6.28 percentage points [




                                                                                               25
Figure 13]. The net effect was minor poverty reduction in spite of the sizeable economic growth and
gains in redistribution of that period.

In contrast, since 2011 all three forces have been working in the same direction. The
deceleration of the increase in food prices between 2011 and 2013 means that, in real terms, the
extreme poverty line (updated using food prices from Central Bank of Paraguay) was marginally
lower in 2013 than the line in 2011. As a consequence, prices play a limited (but positive) role in the
decrease in extreme poverty rate, whereas a better distribution of incomes –reflected in the widening
of the distribution (solid blue line in Figure 14 - is behind 65 percent of the total change in the
headcount (5 percentage points out of close to 8), and average income growth – the shift to the right
of the distribution - explains the remaining 35 percent of the fall [




                                                                                                    26
Figure 13].

An additional contributing factor that is behind the sensitivity to food prices and the
extreme poverty line is related to the fact that a large proportion of Paraguay’s population
has household incomes very near the extreme poverty line [Figure 14]. Due to this clustering
near the extreme poverty line, even slight shifts in the poverty line can have noticeable impacts on
the observed poverty rates.

In the case of moderate poverty, food prices played a less crucial role in explaining the
observed fall in poverty throughout the decade. Increases in the moderate poverty line
associated with rising food prices have limited the reduction in moderate poverty between 2003 and
2011, but to a lower extent, because the basket used to define the line contains also non-food items
[Figure 15]. Growth have been the driving force in this first period, while changes in the distribution
have contributed substantially to the equally impressive fall in moderate poverty between 2011 and
2013.

Box 1. Food prices and the extreme poverty rate


Between 2006 and 2011, food price inflation outpaced overall inflation in Paraguay resulting
in higher extreme poverty [Figure B1.1]. Following the traditional approach to measuring income
poverty, the extreme poverty line is based on a basket of basic food items as determined using the
1997/98 Household Income and Expenditure Survey. The value of the basket is annually adjusted
according to the increase in the Food Consumer Price Index (from Asunción, constructed by the
Central Bank of Paraguay). Therefore, increases in food prices in the past decade, which were larger
than the price of the overall basket, led to a sizeable appreciation of the extreme poverty line, rising
almost 30 percent from 270 thousand Guarani in 2003 to 343 thousand Guarani in 2011 (both
expressed in 2011 prices).

If food prices had increased at the same rate as overall inflation poverty would have fallen
substantially between 2006 and 2007, from 20.7 to 17.6 percent, a year when it actually fell by
less than one percentage point [Figure B1.2]. That is, gains in the income of the poorest were
largely absorbed by the increases in the price of the basic food basket. As the poorest spend most of
their budgets on food, this captures not just a mathematical relationship but an actual stagnation in
their food purchasing ability. As food prices remained relatively high, poverty hovered around 18
percent between 2008 and 2011, roughly 5 percentage points higher than it would otherwise have
been. In 2012 and 2013, however, food price inflation fell to closely trend overall CPI [Figure B1.2].
As a result, 2012 and 2013 saw significant drops in extreme poverty as income gains among the
poorest overtook the increase in the prices of food.

Disproportionate income growth for the less well-off is a strong factor behind the observed
improvements in poverty. As mentioned above, average per capita household income grew more
strongly between 2011 and 2013 than in the previous eight years, but quite crucially, the growth in
the recent years was disproportionally stronger among those at the bottom of the distribution. The
Growth Incidence Curves [Figure 16] depict the annual per capita household income growth rates
by percentile of the distribution. Three features emerge. First, annual growth rates are significantly
lower between 2003 and 2011 than in the 2011-2013 period (see change in values of the vertical
axes). Second, the latter is considerably more progressive than the former. Finally, in contrast to the
first part of the period, income growth has been everywhere higher in rural areas than in urban ones
in recent years.

Rising labor income has been the driving force behind the reduction in both extreme and
moderate poverty. Income from labor is not only the main source of income for poor families –
representing two-thirds of incomes of the bottom quintile-, it is, in fact, the factor that has led many
to move out of poverty [Figure 17]. This is both (and in similar proportions) because of increased
earnings and due to an increased number of earners. The prominent role of labor income in
reducing poverty is consistent with the trends observed for LAC as a whole: labor income accounts
for 70 percent of the reduction of poverty in recent years in the region.15

In the case of extreme poverty reduction between 2003 and 2011, the changes over time of
the non-labor components of income—including pensions and transfers—were regressive.
For rural households the negative effect is largely arising from pensions – or rather, their lack of
access to pensions - whereas in urban households it is equally divided between transfers from family
and pensions. It is worth noting that, according to household data, government transfers such as
Tekopora, which are included in the “other non-labor income” category, have had very little impact
on poverty, which may be explained by its still low coverage during this time period. Also interesting
is the role of family transfers (contributing to poverty reduction in rural areas, while opposing it in
urban), suggesting that low income rural households are net recipients of private transfers (from
abroad and nationally), while worse off urban households have seen a fall in private transfers. The
role of transfers to cope with income fluctuations among rural poor is further explored in Section
2.3.

Between 2011 and 2013, however, all labor and non-labor income components contributed to
the reduction in extreme poverty. While labor income continues to be the main force behind the
improvement, public transfers as well as “other incomes” (which include, notably, property value in
the form of imputed rents) play a significant role as well [Figure 17]. While public transfers represent
at the end of the period a larger share of total family income, they still account for less than 5
percent of the total at the national level and less than 10 percent in urban areas. It is also important
to highlight that private (family) transfers continue to be benefiting the rural poor, while the
opposite is true for the urban poor.

As in the case of poverty reduction, almost 80 percent of the improvement in equality in the
last decade – a 7 Gini points fall—is driven by rising labor incomes. This is both because of
increase incomes of earners as well as a rise in the proportion of people working. Public transfers,
while to a lesser extent, contribute to 7 percent of the decline in inequality observed in both periods,
though in recent years these became more effective [Figure 18]. Interestingly, private transfers
(remittances as well as within country transfers) had an equalizing effect between 2003 and 2011 but
ceased to be so in the following two years. Finally, an important contributor to the decline in
inequality in the last few years is represented by the “other non-labor income” component, which
includes property value as well as capital income and rents.

Fiscal Policy: Results from the Commitment to Equity Project

The limited role of public transfers in reducing poverty and inequality brings the question of
the importance of fiscal policy from a broader perspective, including taxes and government
expenditures in transfers as well as public services. The Commitment to Equity (CEQ) project,
a joint initiative of Tulane University and the Inter-American Dialogue, 16 produced a comparative
analysis of a few countries in the region, including Paraguay, on the degree of progressivity of the
countries’ fiscal systems.

In line with other LAC countries, Paraguay’s tax collection is low relative to the OECD
average and relies more heavily on consumer taxes. In 2010, Paraguay’s tax revenue was only
16.5 percent of its GDP, compared to an average of 34 percent in the OECD [Figure 19].17 Lower
tax revenues imply less fiscal space for social investments, such as improved education and
infrastructure. Furthermore, while a quarter of the OECD’s tax revenue was derived from pe rsonal
income tax, a typically progressive tax, Paraguay did not enact personal income taxation until 2012. 18
Instead, Paraguay relies heavily on the Value Added Tax, which alone accounted for 48 percent of
tax revenues in 2010.19 This type of consumption tax is disproportionately paid by low-income
consumers who spend a higher proportion of their income on necessities.

Paraguay’s fiscal system is among the weakest in the region. Using comparable methodology
and harmonized data for a set of Latin American countries, Paraguay is the least effective of the
seven countries (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Guatemala, Mexico, Paraguay, Peru, and Uruguay)

analyzed at mitigating inequality through fiscal policy [Figure 20Error! Reference source not
found.]. 20 The Gini coefficient for market income, earnings before all taxes and transfers, in
Paraguay is 0.50 – similar to most of the other LAC countries analyzed. Direct taxes and transfers
reduce the Gini coefficient by less than one percent while indirect taxes reverse this progress: the
post-fiscal income Gini coefficient is slightly higher than the market income Gini meaning that
income inequality is slightly greater after transfers and taxes are taken into account. Finally, the
provision of public education and public health services decreases the effective income inequality
somewhat to 0.48. Though slightly lower than the initial Gini of 0.50, Paraguay’s decline of 0.02 Gini
points through fiscal policy is the smallest reported.

The combination of taxes and transfers in Paraguay results in every income decile being a
net payer to the fiscal system – the only country of those included in this analysis in which
this happens. 21 [Figure 21]Error! Reference source not found. reports the average share of
market income either paid in tax or received in direct transfers or in-kind transfers (such as public
education). The bottom deciles, though largely impoverished, report paying direct taxes. This differs
from many countries, where typically the poor do not pay any direct taxes. In addition, the bottom
decile pays a significant share of their market income, an average of 43 percent, in indirect taxes

poverty from 14.4 percent based on Disposable Income (Market Income minus direct taxes plus
direct transfers) to 16.2 percent, as measured by the international poverty line of $2.50/day. While
direct taxes are progressive (that is, those with more income pay a higher share), indirect taxes are
regressive. As indirect taxes are a larger share of all taxes collected, the net effect is a slightly
regressive tax system.22

Only four out of ten individuals living on less than $4 per day (including a quarter of those
living on less than $2.50 per day) were recipients of any direct transfer programs in 2010. 23
While the spending was well targeted with 47 percent of expenditure reaching the extreme poor
(measured at $2.50 per day) and a total of 68 percent reaching those living on less than $4 perday,
the low coverage rate suggests expansions of these programs could result in significant poverty
reduction gains. Furthermore, the transfers received are not large enough to raise households out of
poverty. For those living on less than $2.50 per day who received any direct transfer, the amount
received was on average $0.38 per day.

Though the Commitment to Equity analysis paints a stark picture of the fiscal policies
found in Paraguay in 2010, several recent policy changes have been enacted to address these

concentration coefficient minus the market income Gini coefficient. A regressive tax has a negative Kakwani coefficient.
The Kakwani coefficient in Paraguay 2010 is -0.02 (Higgins et al 2014). For comparison, the Kakwani coefficients
reported in the other countries included above are as follow: -0.13 in Bolivia, 0.04 in Brazil, 0.11 in Mexico, 0.08 in Peru
and 0.07 in Uruguay (Bucheli et al. 2014, Higgins and Pereira 2014, Jaramillo 2014, Lustig and Pessino 2014, Paz Arauco
et al. 2014, and Scott 2014).

shortcomings. As mentioned above, direct personal income taxation was introduced in 2012.
Additionally, a tax of 10 percent on income from agriculture was passed in 2013. These taxes should
have the effect of reducing the regressivity of the country’s taxation. On the other hand, these
changes are also accompanied by a new VAT on agricultural and livestock products and an
expansion of the current VAT on most products – potentially decreasing the progressivity associated
with higher direct taxation. On the spending side, the Government’s Sembrando Oportunidades poverty
reduction plan aims to fight poverty by targeting a quarter of a million families living in extreme
poverty. This plan involves the expansion of cash transfer programs (such as the Tekopora, Tekoha,
and Propais II), both in terms of coverage and amount of benefits. Adultos Mayores has also been
expanded. Additionally, the FONACIDE law passed in 2012 by Congress regulates the spending of
extra revenue from electricity sold to Brazil on infrastructure projects, including investments in
educational infrastructure.



2.2 Economic Growth and the Labor Market

As in other economies in Latin America and the Caribbean, improvement in labor market
outcomes, both employment rates and wages, has fueled much of the poverty reduction
seen in Paraguay since 2003. While agriculture remains the primary sector of employment for
Paraguay’s poor, other occupations, particularly traditionally male-dominated sectors such as
construction have become more relevant and, with higher wages than agriculture, present improved
labor opportunities for low-skilled labor. This section explores how macroeconomic growth has
translated into improved labor market opportunities and the sectoral shifts underlying these changes,
particularly for those at the bottom of the skills distribution.

Economic growth in the past decade has been driven in large part by the two largest sectors
in the economy: agriculture and manufacturing. Though the manufacturing sector consistently
dominated the Paraguayan economy in terms of output during this period, accounting for 29 percent
of national output in 2003 and 26 percent in 2012, a significant proportion of this output is based on
agricultural inputs [Figure 22]. The two largest manufacturing subsectors in 2012, for example, were
meat products (2.38 trillion Guarani) and beverages and tobacco production (1.58 trillion Guarani).

However, these gains in output in manufacturing and agriculture have not translated into
significantly higher employment growth in these activities, particularly for the less skilled.
Though agriculture remains the largest sector of employment, accounting for 26 percent of
individuals’ main occupations in 2013, this sector showed minimal employment growth between
2003 and 2013 [Figure 23]. Given the employment growth in other sectors, today total employment
is much less reliant on agriculture than it was at the beginning of the decade, when it accounted for a
third of total employment. Similarly, manufacturing still represents the largest sectors in terms of
output (around 25 percent of the total economy) and yet, continues to account for only 10 percent
of total employment. The fastest sector of employment growth has been construction– more than
doubling between 2003 and 2013 from 98,000 to 214,000. Still, in 2013 only 7 percent of total
employment is concentrated in construction.

employed men and 32 percent of low-skilled employed women [Figure 24]. The low-skilled,
here defined as adults with only a primary education or less, are disproportionately more likely to
live in extreme poverty, accounting for two-thirds of all adults living in extreme poverty in 2011.
Between 2003 and 2013, low-skilled men moved away from agriculture, with employment in
agriculture falling from 55 percent in 2003 to 43 percent in 2013 among this group. At the same
time, employment in construction increased from 9 percent to 16 percent. Low-skilled women
slightly increased their attachment to agriculture throughout the period, though employment
patterns in agriculture and services (including domestic services) suggest a high degree of mobility
between the two sectors for low-skilled women. – no structural change in employment for women.

Not only did employment in agriculture for the low-skilled loose preponderance during the
data, but also hourly wages continued to be lower and have not grown as much as in other
occupations [

Figure 25]. It should be noted that, as agriculture is particularly dominated by self-employed
workers, hourly wages may be more difficult to estimate and prone to misreporting. However, the
same pattern is observed in monthly income, suggesting that the hourly wages reported are accurate.
While the other sectors saw their monthly income grow to a median of about 1.25 million Guarani
per month, monthly income from agriculture remained flat at 600 thousand per month (in 2005
Guarani). Instead, agricultural workers reported significant income from other employment (their
secondary job), accounting for 40 to 50 percent of reported monthly income for low-skilled
agricultural workers.

Public administration and defense, on the contrary, represent a niche for low-skilled men
with the highest hourly wages (averaging 9,300 Guarani in 2005 terms) and with the biggest
gains in employment – a gain not shared with similarly educated women [Figure 26]. This is
particularly the case for men who finished secondary school but have no post-secondary training.
For this group, the median earnings increased from 1.5 million Guarani (2005 constant prices) in
2003 to 2.5 million in 2013. Instead, women who completed secondary schooling and work in public
administration or defense saw their median real earnings fall – from 1.6 million Guaranis to 1.2
million during this period.

Source: Authors’ calculations based on EPH and National Accounts data. Wages are measured as median hourly wage in
the main job for men with only primary schooling or less and who are employed.

Wage elasticities remained flat and close to zero during this period, suggesting that changes
in output are not reflected in the price of low-skilled labor. This may suggest that
adjustments to low-skill labor demand are made along the extensive margin (employment
level) rather than in price of labor. While overall employment elasticity remained positive in the
agriculture and manufacturing sectors [Box 2], employment elasticity for low-skilled men was
negative in both periods for agriculture and in the later period for manufacturing [Figure 27]. This
suggests a replacement of low-skilled labor in these two sectors, potentially with new technology and
higher skilled labor. On the other hand, employment elasticity of low-skilled men in construction,
though falling between the two periods, remained at 1.21 in the second period meaning that labor
demand for low-skilled men grew faster than output in that sector.




Box 2. Productivity gains over the past decade

In three of the most important sectors of employment – agriculture, manufacturing, and
construction – employment elasticity was lower in the period between 2007 and 2011 than it
had been in the previous four year period, suggesting increased productivity [Figure B2.1].
Positive employment elasticity means that, on average, increased output was associated with
increased employment. However, an elasticity lower than 1 means that output grew faster than
employment, attributable to increased productivity and/or increases in the product prices.
Employment elasticity lower than 1 was found in agriculture in both periods, suggesting that recent
gains in agricultural output are driven by productivity (or price) gains rather than increases in
employment. While manufacturing and construction gains in the first period were associated with
significant increases in labor, the second period elasticities suggest productivity gains and, as a result,
a relative decline in demand for labor.

While recent employment and output trends suggest increases in labor productivity,
Paraguay’s level of total factor productivity (TFP) remains relatively low [Figure B2.2]. As of
2011, Paraguay’s TFP was 35 percent of that of the United States, showing a slight increase from its
recent low of 31 percent in 2000; this is a level comparable with Bolivia’s TFP (38 percent), but
lower than Brazil’s (43 percent) and Uruguay’s (56 percent).

The increase in construction and public sector jobs for low-skilled men may be having an
effect on the skills premium, which has fallen slightly since 2003 [Figure 28]. Compared to

men who did not finish primary, the wage premium for post-secondary schooling fell from 1.19 in
2003 to 1.10 in 2013. Similarly, compared to men who completed primary but did not complete
secondary schooling, the wage premium fell from 1.14 to 1.07 in 2013. Interestingly, the wage
premiums for women in these two schooling groups did not fall as wages for women remained fairly
constant in real terms. This highlights the important role of increasing earnings opportunities for
low-skilled male labor in sectors like construction and defense and a lack of similar opportunities in
sectors with significant female employment.

Overall, the growth seen in Paraguay since 2003 has two features in terms of employment:
first, output increases in agriculture and manufacturing have been accompanied by falls in
low-skilled employment, suggesting an increase in labor productivity which was not
reflected in higher hourly earnings; second, there is a shift to other better paid sectors
representing increased employment opportunities for the low-skilled, such as construction
and public administratio. Even in sectors that are not male-dominated, such as employment in
private households, restaurants and hotels, low-skilled men have seen a sharper increase in their
earnings than similarly educated women. These improvements in employment opportunities for
people with moderate education can potentially help families moved out of poverty in both rural and
urban areas.

2.3 Drivers of rural poverty

Rural poverty in Paraguay is defined by dependence on highly volatile income sources –
particularly agricultural self-employment. Due to limited access to financial markets and
infrastructure, households face limited opportunities to diversify or insure against income volatility.
Instead, reliance on informal lending and family transfers are important strategies used by the rural
poor.

Agriculture is the main source of income of the extreme poor living in rural areas, but most
are self-employed or unpaid (especially women), cultivating few crops for both home
consumption and a few for market. On average, 77 and 57 percent of household labor income in
rural areas below the extreme poverty and moderate poverty lines, respectively, comes from
activities in agriculture, cattle or fishery [Figure 29]. In contrast, the share of agricultural income of
non-poor rural households is around 40 percent. Family agriculture tends to cultivate a few crops for
both consumption and a few for market. 24 For many of these families, agriculture is fairly basic,
with insufficient irrigation systems, inadequate agricultural practices and low use of technology. They
also have limited access to markets, especially in a context of low connectivity. 25

The rural extreme poor are more likely to be self-employed or unpaid workers than the
moderate poor. In 2013, 82 percent of the rural extreme poor who were in the labor force were
either self-employed or unpaid workers (typical of family farms and microenterprises), including
production for both home consumption as well as for the market. While those living in moderate
poverty were also substantially linked to self-employment and unpaid labor, nearly one in three were
wage earners working in equal proportions in small and large firms, the latter of which are associated
with higher wages and less employment volatility.

Reliance on a single source of income leaves many rural households exposed to poverty
shocks. This is particularly true when this source itself is volatile, such as rural self-employment.
Yet, over a third of rural households in poverty receive over 75 percent of their total household
income from self-employment [Figure 30]. These households face volatile earnings year to year,
largely dependent on factors outside of their control such as weather conditions and market price
fluctuations. A more diverse household portfolio would result in greater shelter from these
exogenous shocks.

loss equivalent to a 5.4 percent of the agricultural GDP26 and affect not only the large producers but
also can put at risk the food security of families. This is related to the sector’s exposure to
international commodity price fluctuations and climate shocks.27 For family agriculture, pests and
diseases are can also have a large impact on their production. On the other hand, these risks could
be manageable, with the appropriate programs for mitigation, transference and reduction of risks.28
Despite this volatility, less than 2 percent of agricultural workers purchased agricultural insurance in
2011.29

The 2009 drought exemplifies the disproportionate impact on the poor. Households in rural
areas were severely affected under the phenomenon but the impact was not equally distributed. 30
Between 2008 and 2009, families in the bottom quintile (which coincide with the pool of extreme
poor) saw large decreases in their income, in some cases with negative growth rates of 10 percent [
Figure 32]. At the other end, households in the top 10 percent of the distribution in rural areas
actually experienced income growth—in some cases close to 10 percent—possibly due to their more
intensive use of irrigation methods and the higher level of diversification of their sources of income.

In this context of highly volatile agriculture sector, income diversification becomes essential
for the rural poor, both in terms of types of crops cultivated (or cattle raising), and of labor
and non-labor income sources. Indeed, in recent years, there has been a movement towards wage
employment, both agriculture (larger farms) and non-agriculture (mostly construction, transport and
public and private services), generating alternative sources of income which could be more
profitable and stable.



While working their own farm remains important for the rural poor, this group has also seen
an increase in wages, both from agricultural and non-agricultural work [




                                                                                                47
Figure 33]. Households in the bottom decile saw increases in agricultural wage of the same
magnitude as those of self-employment income between 2010 and 2013. But, for households most
likely to have exited extreme poverty (the second through fourth decile), the main source of labor
income growth came from increases in wages, particularly from agricultural work. Increases in wage
income reflect the decreasing reliance on own agricultural production for the rural poor and
improved opportunities for income diversification as outside employment opportunities increase. It
is notable that many of these opportunities are occurring in other agricultural work, potentially from
larger farms. This may indicate the gradual reallocation of rural labor from less productive small
farms to more productive agribusinesses.

Over the past decade, differences the self-employed have become increasingly more likely to
live in extreme poverty than those with wage employment. Even among families living below
the moderate poverty line, those in which the head was self-employed had odds almost three times
higher of living in extreme poverty than those in which the head had wage employment in 2013.
This represents a significant shift from 2003 rural poverty, in which those who were self-employed
were only slightly more likely to be extreme poor than the wage employed.31


Though agriculture remains the main sector of employment for the rural population, the
past decade has seen an increase in employment opportunities in other sectors. While in
2003 agriculture accounted for two-thirds of all rural employment, this share had fallen to only 50
percent ten years later [




31Based on a logistic regression controlling for gender of the household head, dependency ratio, agricultural worker
indicator and household head’s educational attainment. The odds that a self -employed household head was living in
extreme poverty were 287 percent higher than households with wage employment in 2013 and 89 percent in 2003.

                                                                                                                       49

2013, jobs available to rural families in construction and transportation/communications had more
than doubled while jobs in public and private services (including defense and private households)
grew by 90 percent. As these sectors grow, they can provide the rural households with the possibility
to further diversify their labor income portfolio.

Addressing labor income volatility
Family transfers play an increasingly important role in reducing rural extreme poverty,
representing one strategy used by rural households to manage risk. Figure 35 reports how
much higher extreme poverty would have been if no family transfers were received.32 For instance,
in 2003, without family transfers (domestic or from abroad), rural extreme poverty would have been
4 percentage points higher (the equivalent of a 15 percent increase in the poverty rate). Through
2009, family transfers increased in importance in reducing rural poverty. Without this type of
income, rural poverty would have been as much as 6.6 percentage points higher (or, 20 percent
higher than the observed poverty rate). Instead, extreme rural poverty increased only 2 percentage
points during 2009, a drought year. Family transfers have continued to reduce extreme rural poverty
by between 15 and 20 percent since 2010 even as poverty rates have fallen during this period.

The elderly and female headed households receive significantly larger family transfers,
suggesting migration as a household income diversification and coping mechanism. 33 In
2011, for example, households with older members received an average of 235 thousand Guarani per
month per capita (compared to 212 thousand Guarani for other households). Female headed
households with children received an average of 218 thousand Guarani per capita per month versus
84 thousand Guarani for male-headed households with children. These results suggest the
importance of intergenerational transfers in mitigating elderly and childhood poverty in Paraguay.
They may also suggest a household risk management strategy via family migration, wherein family




32 This exercise should be taken as an upper bound as it assumes no behavioral adjustment by the household. In fact,
family transfers and remittances may be used as substitutes for labor income.
33 The comparison of family transfers received by households with members over the age of 65 and female headed

households with children controls for the variation in annual trends across rural and urban areas. These results are based
on a log-linear regression of total family transfers received on household composition and year and place fixed effects.

members with higher earnings potential migrate to areas with higher wages and remit earnings back
to the family.

The conditional cash transfer program Tekopora (originally designed for the rural poor
only) provides a second mechanism to help reduce household income volatility associated
with agriculture, though it has its limitation. For those households that receive the transfer, it
represents a significant share of family income, but very few are covered. On average, in 2013 the
Tekopora accounts for 20 percent of household income for the 6 percent of rural households living
in extreme poverty that received it [Figure 36]. This amounts to an average of over 200 thousand
Guarani per month for these households. Four percent of households living in moderate poverty
also received Tekopora; for them, the Tekopora accounted for an average of 12 percent of their

Limited access to credit and banking limits the ability of households to smooth
consumption in the face of income volatility. Only one out of every five Paraguayans aged 15
and over reported having an account in a formal institution in 2011, less than half the LAC rate of
44 percent.34 This lack of banking is particularly felt among the rural population, where only 10
percent reported an account. However, only 3 percent of the country’s bottom 40 percent reported
having an account. Though figures for formal financial access for the rural bottom 40 percent are
unavailable, it is clear that formal banking is rare, if not completely absent, among the rural poor.
Additionally, the savings rate (formal and otherwise) is exceptionally low among the rural
population: only 7.4 percent reported any savings from the previous year. This combination of low
savings and low access to formal financial institutions can prove a challenge in the event of a
household shock.

In this context, informal lending represents an important third mechanism that rural
households employed to cope with potential shocks. Despite a lack of access to formal financial
markets, nearly a third of rural Paraguayans reported having a loan in 2011 [Figure 37]. For rural
families, the main reasons for requesting loans are either to cover a health issue or other emergency
or to pay school fees [

Figure 38].35 These loans were often obtained from friends and family (21.5 percent of the rural
population). Given their insufficient savings and limited access to formal banking and credit, rural
households rely on their family and social networks to address negative household shocks.

35Similarly, 17 percent of the bottom 40 percent of the country’s population (including both rural and urban) reported
having a loan for a health or other emergency. Though cross-tabulations are unavailable for the rural bottom 40 percent,
this population probably had higher rates of borrowing to address emergencies.

In sum, agriculture continues to be the main source of income of the extreme poor living in
rural areas, exposing families to excessive vulnerability. In recent years, there has been a
movement towards wage employment, both agriculture (larger farms) and non-agriculture
(mostly construction, transport and public and private services), generating alternative
sources of income which could be more profitable and stable. In addition, non-labor
incomes have played an important role in alleviating extreme poverty as a diversification
strategy (largely, family transfers and informal lending and to a lesser extent, public
transfers such as Tekopora and Adultos Mayores), as well as a strategy to cope with adverse
shocks.

2.3 Urban Poverty


The halving of urban poverty corresponds to significant improvements in the urban labor
market between 2003 and 2013: falling unemployment, increases in employment in higher-paying
large firms (particularly in the construction and public and private services sectors), and increased
labor income for the self-employed and workers in microenterprises. These changes had positive
effects on those most likely to be poor – the lowest skilled. For them, self-employment earnings
grew by 46 percent and wage earnings from microenterprises grew by 23 percent between 2003 and
2013 [Figure 39]. As noted in section 2.1, the growth in employment opportunities for the low-
skilled in sectors like construction played a significant role in raising earnings and decreasing
unemployment.

Nonetheless, like the rural poor, the urban poor remain exposed to household income
volatility through high unemployment rates and high shares of self-employment. Though
unemployment has been steadily falling throughout the past decade, it remains exceptionally high
among those living in poverty: The extreme poor are four times more likely than the non-poor to be
unemployed, and the moderately poor more than twice as likely as the non-poor to fall in that
situation [

Figure 40]. In part, the increase in the unemployment rate of the extreme poor in the last three years
reflects the lower propensity to be poor for those who are employed - as earnings and employment
opportunities have increased in recent years, many have exited extreme poverty leaving the
unemployed to become a larger proportion of the extreme poor. In other words, as the proportion
of urban poor halved from 10 percent to 5 percent in the last three years, extreme poverty is more
than before associated with not having a job.

Self-employment (mostly in commerce and agriculture) and small firm employment,
relatively informal types of labor attachments, are the most dominant employment sector
among the urban poor. A third of the extreme poor are self-employed, and a quarter is employed
in microfirms, whereas a quarter of the moderately poor are self-employed, and 15 percent of them
are small firm employees. Yet, wage employment in large (higher paying) firms are far more
common among the urban poor than the rural poor, particularly among the moderately poor. Jobs
in larger firms are not only better paid but are also less volatile and provide more job security and
benefits. Specifically, 70 percent of urban workers in large firms have a formal contract and 54
percent have access to a pension or retirement system. Small firms, on the other hand, rarely provide
pensions or contracts, at 8 percent and 15 percent respectively. The self-employed have very limited
access to pensions, being nonexistent for the low-skilled self-employed and only 6 percent for the
skilled self-employed and employers.

In spite of more wage employment opportunities in cities, over a third of urban households
in extreme poverty rely largely on incomes from self-employment [Figure 42]. This is a similar
share to that seen among the rural poor. The urban moderate poor, on the other hand, are less
reliant on self-employment than the rural poor, with only a quarter drawing more than 75 percent
income from this source. As in the case of unemployment, the recent increase in the proportion of
household deriving more than 75 percent of their income form self-employment in recent years, is
in part reflective of the fact that increased employment opportunities in urban areas is associated
with the halving of extreme poverty in the period.

The households most insulated from extreme poverty were those in which the household
head was a wage earner in a firm with more than 5 employees. Among these households, the
propensity of living in poverty the following year was only 4 percent [


                                                                                                                      57
Figure 43]. On the other hand, households in which the head was self-employed, unemployed or out
of the labor force had a 16 percent likelihood of falling into extreme poverty – that is, these
households were four times more likely to fall into poverty than households with employment in a
large firm. Interestingly, households in which the head was self-employed were more similar in terms
of poverty outcomes to households in which the head was not employed than households in which

status in the initial year. The lines around the point estimate represent the 95 percent confidence interval.

To a significant degree, low-skilled and unskilled labor – the workers most likely to be in
poverty - remain unprotected by the minimum wage legislation [Box 3]. Nearly two of every
five full time wage workers in the private sector earn less than the monthly minimum wage [Figure
44] – including 70 percent of unskilled labor. In fact, among unskilled laborers, one in five earns less
than half of the minimum wage. On the other hand, over three quarters of the workers in the
highest skilled occupations – management, skilled professionals, and midlevel professionals and
technicians – earned more than minimum wage.

Box 3. An international comparison of minimum wages in Paraguay and selected Latin
American countries


At 6 percent of GDP per capita, Paraguay’s minimum wage in 2013 was in line with
minimum wage legislation throughout Latin America. The majority of countries in LAC (10
out of 18 of those selected) have minimum wages that are 4 or 5 percent of their per capita GDP.
There are a number of outliers, including Mexico, where the minimum wage is 1 percent of per
capita GDP, Uruguay and El Salvador at 2 percent, and Guatemala and Honduras, with minimum
wages of 10 and 19 percent respectively. A proposed increase of 25 percent to Paraguay’s minimum
wage would raise it to 7 percent of its 2012 GDP per capita – pushing Paraguay’s minimum wage
slightly higher than in most Latin American countries.

Despite the trend observed throughout the decade of increased employment in higher
paying large firms, year-to-year transitions show that mobility into this sector is limited for
the self-employed and workers in microenterprises –less than 3 percent of those in either of
                                                                                                                                               60
these categories is able to transition into large firm wage employment by the following year. A
matrix of the five-quarter transition of employment sector reveals evidence of limited mobility from
high volatility low-wage sectors to employment in a large firm [Table 2]. Not surprisingly, wage
employment in larger firms is the most persistent of the employment sectors. A full 91 percent of
wage workers in larger firms report working in a large firm the following year. To some degree, this
reflects the higher employment stability and improved labor outcomes associated with larger
employers.

Rather than becoming small business owners, the self-employed typically transition into
employment in a micro firm or leave the labor force. Indeed, the proportion of low skilled
workers that are employers is almost negligible. The majority of the self-employed (60 percent), the
employment sector most associated with extreme poverty, remains self-employed one year later..

Microenterprise employment is also very persistent with 4 out of 5 workers in small firms
remaining in a small firm five quarters later. While employment in microenterprises is a
destination for some self-employed or formerly unemployed workers, there is minimal transitioning
between small and large firms. That is, while employment in small firms could potentially serve as a
stepping stone to large firm employment by providing opportunities for building experience and
human capital, this does not seem to be happening. Instead, these one-year employment transitions
suggest the existence of two distinct labor markets in urban Paraguay: workers in large firms (largely
covered by minimum wage legislation) and workers with more employment uncertainty who may
transition from tenuous employment situations (unemployment and self-employment) to
microenterprises.

The persistence of unemployment is particularly alarming: one in five of the unemployed
between 2010 and 2012 remained unemployed one year later [




                                                                                                                    62
Figure 45]. This indicates that part of the population experiences either chronic or frequent spells of
unemployment. Additionally, a significant proportion of the unemployed have exited the labor force
one year later, potentially as discouraged workers. This tendency has fallen since 2010 when over a
third of the unemployed dropped out of the labor force. By 2013, only 20 percent of those who had
been employed the previous year had exited the labor force. The most likely outcome for the
formerly unemployed, however, is increasingly becoming finding employment in a small firm. While
less than a third of the unemployed in 2010 reported being wage employed in a small firm a year
later – by 2013, more than half of those who had been unemployed the previous year were now
working in a small firm.



In sum, through increased employment opportunities and earnings, labor markets played an
important role in reducing the incidence of both extreme and moderate poverty in urban
areas. The challenges remain twofold: self-employment and unemployment are still prevalent for
the worse-off, leaving them exposed to fluctuations in the economy and largely untouched by
minimum wage legislations. In addition, and despite the trend observed throughout the decade of
increased employment in higher paying more stable jobs in large firms, year-to-year transitions show
that mobility into this sector is limited for the self-employed and workers in microenterprises, even
in good periods for the economy, such as in recent years. These challenges can threaten the
sustainability of the country’s recent improvements.

3. Second Pillar: The pursuit of opportunities for all

Among the greatest challenges that Paraguay faces today as a structural barrier to equity is
the high and persistent level of inequality in terms of opportunities for different groups. An
equitable society in one in which socioeconomic achievement and access to opportunities should be
unrelated to circumstances of birth upon which individuals have no control, including family
background. When inequality in one generation affects the life chances of children, it transmits the
existing pattern to the next generation. A growing literature shows that deficiencies in nutrition,
education and health at early stages in life can have long-lasting effects. In Paraguay, differences in
living standards across the country are significant in many dimensions of well-being, and expressed
at various points throughout the life cycle.


3.1 Equality of Opportunities

Equality of opportunities for children in Paraguay have been improving since 2003, in line
with the findings is Section 1 regarding improvements in non-monetary dimensions. The Human
Opportunity Index (HOI) measures inequality-adjusted access to services for children, according to
circumstances at birth, which are beyond their control such as ethnicity, the socioeconomic level of
their parents, place of birth or gender.36 The evolution of the index for Paraguay shows that while
overall inequality of opportunity has been rising, the penalization due to unequal access today is
larger than it was at the beginning of the decade [Figure 46].

Access to basic services still depends to a large extent on whether the child is born in rural
or urban areas, and to a lesser extent (although still significant) on the socioeconomic status
of the family. Half of the children born in rural areas have access to flushing toilets inside their
home, while almost all of those in urban areas do, particularly among the non-poor households
[Figure 47]. The situation is significantly worse for those born in extremely poor households: only
one in five children in poor families will have proper sanitation—and slightly less if the family only
speaks Guarani at home. A similar, although less pronounced situation is found with respect to
access to water in the dwelling. A child born in rural areas has a 76 percent chance of having tap
water in her home, whereas if she had been born in a city her chances would increase to 97 percent.
Chances are not much better is she was born in a non-poor household in the rural area (81 percent).

While differences in school enrolment are less pronounced, quality of schooling varies
significantly across groups, particularly between urban and rural areas. While the coverage
rate of school enrolment for children ages 7 to 15 is quite high, the extreme poor in rural areas have
markedly lower likelihood of attending school than non-poor children living in urban areas (89
percent compared to 99 percent), although this trend has been improving over time. School quality
in Paraguay at the elementary level is extremely low by Latin American standards. According to the
2006 Second Regional Comparative and Explanatory Study (SERCE) carried out by UNESCO,
Paraguay is in the bottom five countries out of the 17 Latin American countries included.
Additionally, there are noticeable differences in the performance of the Paraguayan children who
reach sixth grade, depending on where they live and the level of education of their parents. Children
from high socioeconomic status in rural areas perform only marginally better than socioeconomic
kids from low socioeconomic status in urban areas [Figure 48]. In addition, an urban child from a
high socioeconomic background obtains a similar test score as the average Brazilian child (whose
country placed sixth in the Latin American distribution), whereas a poor rural child is likely to have a

Republic, Ecuador and Guatemala – the three lowest performers.

Significant differences are also found in the completion of grades on time, another indicator
of school quality. The grade on time indicator aims to capture the capacity -- of the education
system in general and of the schools in particular -- to deal with children from different
backgrounds, and the ability to guide them to complete their studies without desertion or grade

socioeconomic group in both the completion of sixth grade and in finalizing secondary education.
While the noon-poor group in urban areas has a completion rate of around 90 percent in sixth grade
and over 70 percent in secondary, the extreme poor in rural areas lies below 55 and 20 percent,
respectively [Figure 49]




3.2 Equality of Opportunities in the Labor Market

Inequality of opportunities in the labor market has been rising in recent years. Inequality of
opportunities is measured by the differences in mean income between groups based on
circumstances not governed by choice or efforts (such as, language spoken at home, rural or urban
area, and region of birth). Whereas total inequality has fluctuated, ultimately dropping between 2003
and 2013, the proportion of that inequality that is accounted for by differences in individuals’
circumstances increased from 18 percent in 2003 to over 22 percent in 2012, and has recently gone
down to 19 percent in 2013 [Figure 50]. This worsening in inequality driven-by-circumstance, which
is found at the national level, is also observed in rural areas. Indeed, the inequality of opportunity
index in rural areas increased by 50 percent between 2003 and 2013.

of opportunity is measured as the between- group inequality relative to overall inequality, where groups (types) are
defined by language spoken at home, place of birth (rural vs. urban, and region) and gender.


Location of birth and its related language spoken at home are important factors associated
with the observed inequality of opportunities in the labor markets [Figure 51]. This is in line
with the finding that 75 percent of the people who remained in poverty in both 2003 to 2013 only
speak Guarani at home. While the vast majority of the population is bilingual, the language of choice
among the population is highly correlated with economic outcomes. Additionally, gender has
become an increasingly important factor in explaining opportunity inequality: while in 2003 gender
did not appear as a factor, by 2011 it appears as a contributor to between-group inequality.

3.3 Challenges in the Delivery of Social Services
Addressing income inequality and boosting intergenerational mobility require both
inclusive growth and the implementation of effective policies to foster future gains among
those not directly benefiting from growth. Access to basic childhood opportunities is low and
inequitable in Paraguay. Good delivery of social services and sustainable fiscal policy can play a
significant role in reducing inequality and providing access to opportunities. Increasing the fiscal
space for investments in expanding access to and the quality of basic opportunities is one essential
element for increasing fairness. As seen in section 1, Paraguay has still substantial room for
improvement in terms of progressive taxation policies combined with well-targeted transfer
programs reduce income inequality and alleviate poverty, providing essential safety nets to weather
the fluctuations of any well-functioning labor market while reducing the effects of inequality on
childhood access to basic services. Of course, key to well designed and implemented social service
delivery is appropriate fiscal policy and social spending. The shortfalls in both delivery of social
services and fiscal policies go a long way in explaining the inequality of opportunities and of
outcomes seen in Paraguay.




                                                                                                                                      68
Though Paraguay saw a significant increase in social expenditure from $95 per capita in
2003 to $584 in 2010,37 basic and key social services, such as access to improved sewage
systems and running water, continue to be relatively low. The coverage of these basic services
that is provided, additionally, is inequitable as shown above through the Human Opportunity Index.
To some degree, the persistence of extreme poverty through 2011 despite economic growth can be
attributed to ineffectual social services delivery. This paradox of increasing social spending and
stubbornly low service delivery can be explained by at least three reasons:

          i)        Ineffective allocation of resources
          ii)       Institutional and operational inefficiencies, and
          iii)      Lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation system.


     i)          Ineffective allocation of resources


Although there is a process of allocation of resources for social programs included in the
Government’s poverty strategy 38 based on socioeconomic indicators at geographic level,
there are some resource allocations at sector levels that show a regressive allocation. A recent
study in education, for example, shows that the public investment in education is not only low (and
decreasing) compared to other Latin American countries, but also that investment in new
classrooms is concentrated among the schools within the top quintile of the Classroom Availability
Index (CAI)39, while lower levels of investment are made where the need is most urgent among
needier quintiles [Figure 52].40

should be available so that a value of 100 means that the school has exactly the number of classrooms it needs given its

Other relevant social services such as water and sanitation, electricity and health also show
an inefficient process of resource allocation. In the case of water and sanitation, a recent study
finds that while access to treated water is relatively high at 86 percent (including 66 percent of the
rural population), particularly in urban areas, reliability and quality is lacking especially for rural areas
and for poor households. About 40 percent of the population does not have home connection – as a
result, it takes an average of 16 minutes to provide water to household members (by an adult woman
in 49 percent of the cases). Even among those with a home connection, only 73 percent have
continuous 24 hour service without interruptions at the national level. In the case of sewerage the
problem is twofold, coverage and quality: Less than 10 percent of the population is connected to
sanitary sewers, and basically none have water treatment.

Health insurance coverage is low at approximately 24 percent of population and less than 3
percent of the extreme poor [Table 3]. The poorest quintile is the most underserved with a
coverage rate of only 1 percent, sharply lower than the 52 percent coverage rate in the richest
income quintile. Unemployed and informal workers receive services by the health care network of
the Ministry of Public Health and Welfare (MPHW) which delivers priority programs including the
prenatal and child health program, the HIV/AIDS program, the non-communicable disease
program and the reproductive health program.41 Although health services in the public network are
provided for free at the point of delivery, the supply of drugs and medical supplies are not always
sufficient to meet demand.

      ii)        Institutional and operational inefficiencies

Social services are not fully delivered in a timely, continuous, quality controlled and
coordinated manner. This can be traced back to four reasons. The first is the weak national
planning system and specially the lack of tradition of a strong national development plan that aligns

                                                                                                              70
agencies to strategic goals at national, sectoral and territorial levels. Secondly, there is a lack of
integration among the planning and programing processes developed by the public and the
budgeting processes. This situation prevents public managers from tracking social expenditure
linked with the delivery of good and services in a successful and timely way. Thirdly, although the
Social Cabinet has been strengthening the coordination among agencies delivering social services,
there is still lack of fully efficient fiscal, strategic and managerial coordination between executive
agencies, departments and municipalities, and there is still no quality control for the delivery process.
Finally, the civil service system is weak. This weakness is expressed in high attrition of public
servants, the absence of a formal training system, resulting in public servants’ high instability and
lack of professional skills. At the same time, there has been a significant increase in the number of
public employees: in the last seven years almost 70,000 public sector jobs were included in the
budget from both centralized and decentralized public agencies, implying a 32 percent increase
[Figure 53].

       iii)     Lack of an effective monitoring and evaluation system

A final obstacle facing service delivery in Paraguay is the lack of a regular and efficient
monitoring and evaluation system for assessing the timeliness, quality and cost of projects.
There is no integrated inventory of beneficiaries of social programs, and no national initiative to
integrate the few initiatives of monitoring and evaluation in a system to measure the performance of
public sector management 42 with consequences in accountability, improving the management of
public programs and influencing the budget allocation process. As there is no mechanism for

assessing the quality of service delivery, identifying optimal policies and strategies is made even more
difficult.




In sum, while the country has improved the access to basic services to families, there are
still high and persistent inequalities for different groups, as defined by their circumstances
at birth, such as place of birth and socioeconomic status, to which the individual has no
control over. Similarly high level of inequalities is observed in terms of quality of education,
and later in life, in the labor market. This poses challenges to the sustainability of the recent
improvements for future generations. Social policies are not effective enough to
counterbalance these inherited inequalities. In addition to a weak fiscal system, institutional
and operational inefficiencies e.g. weak civil service system, and/or the lack of an effective
monitoring and evaluation, may enfeeble the deprived social service delivery.

4. Third Pillar: Strengthening agency

The third dimension where the country still has room to make progress towards an
equitable society relates to the strengthening of agency, understood as the capacity of
people to be actors in their own development, establishing and pursuing effectively life
plans they have reasons to value. This pillar has manifestations in different realms and
dimensions. There is, however, one aspect that is salient and can be analyzed with existing data: the
economic and social role of women. This section describes the improvements in gender outcomes in
the last decade, the challenges that still remain, particularly in the labor market, and in three specific
manifestations of lack of agency.



4.1 Improvements in gender outcomes in endowments

Paraguay has made progress over the last decade in promoting women’s empowerment and
gender equality, particularly in terms of women’s endowments in health, education and
legal framework.

Specifically, sexual and reproductive health indicators have improved over the last decade,
though Paraguay still lags behind the LAC region in some areas. Both women’s and men’s life
expectancy at birth has increased three years (from 71.4 years in 1996 to 74.4 for women in 2011,
and for men from 66.90 in 1996 to 70 in 2011).43 More pregnant women receive prenatal care (from
94.2 percent in 2004 to 96.3 percent in 2008) and they are more likely to be attended by skilled
health staff at birth (from 77 percent in 2004 to 82 percent in 2008), thought still below the average
for the LAC region (90 percent in 2010).44 As a result, the Maternal Mortality Rate (MMR) has
shown a clear improvement in the last decade: Paraguay presented a MMR of 180 deaths per
100,000 live births in 2002 versus a 100 deaths per 100,000 live births in 2010, 20 per thousand
deaths more than the average in the LAC. 45

Girls now outperform their male counterparts in educational attainment and achievement.
While the female to male ratio in primary enrollment has remained almost the same for the last
decade at 0.96, the gender gap reverses in favor of girls as level of schooling increases (1.07 and 1.27
for female to male ratio in secondary and tertiary education for 2010 respectively). The percentage of
girls finishing primary school was higher than the percentage of boys (83.8 percent and 81.4 percent
respectively in 2010). Though lower than ideal, this is en par with the LAC region. Finally, the rate

of male repeaters is higher than female repeaters in primary school (5.7 percent versus 3.6 percent in
2010 respectively) and secondary (1.3 percent versus 0.5 percent in 2010 respectively).

The legal and institutional framework in Paraguay has improved such that the stage is set
for equal rights for women and men in the country. Paraguay has ratified major international
human rights instruments to protect and promote women’s rights and gender equality in the
country. 46 For instance, the country ratified The Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of
Discrimination against Women (CEDAW), a key international women’s rights bill adopted by Law
No. 1215 on November 28th, 1986. On June 21st, 1995 Paraguay ratified by Law No. 605/95 the
Convention on the Prevention, Punishment and Eradication of Violence against Women (Belém do
Pará) promoted by the Organization of American States (OAS) and its Optional Protocol ratified by
Law No2396/04.

Over the past decade laws have been amended and new laws have been implemented by the
Paraguayan government to promote women’s empowerment and gender equality in the
country.47 Under Law No. 496/95, which amended and updated the Labor Code Law No. 213/93,
women and men enjoy the same rights and duties without discrimination in the workplace, including
special protections for maternity. It also determines that sexual harassment is a justified cause for
termination of employment and that wage discrimination based on sex is prohibited. Law 834/96 of
the Electoral Code sets a quota for minimum female participation of 20 percent in the list of
candidates, and establishes penalties for parties that do not comply with this requirement. The law
also contains an explicit prohibition of discrimination on the grounds of gender in electoral and
political campaigns. Finally, Law 1600, passed in 2000, and the Penal Code are the legal instruments
to address one of the key problems in Paraguay: domestic violence.

Furthermore, to promote women’s empowerment and gender equality, Paraguay created the
Ministry of Women (Ministerio de la Mujer) as a public body by Law No. 4.675/2012,
elevating the Women’s Secretariat of the Presidency of the Republic (Secretaría de la Mujer de la
Presidencia de la República – SMPR) to a Ministry level.


4.2 Limited economic progress for women
Despite these improvements, challenges persist in achieving gender equality particularly in
the labor market. The female to male labor force participation ratio remains low at 0.65 for
Paraguay, indicating a persistent gender gap in labor force participation. Female unemployment is

higher than male unemployment (6 percent versus 4 percent in 2012), especially among youth (18
percent for girls vs. 10 percent for their young male counterparts).48

Men’s and women’s jobs differ greatly across sectors, industries, occupations, types of jobs,
or types of firms, and thus earnings. Women are more likely to work in the informal sector than
men (51 percent for women in the labor force compared to 44 percent of men), particularly among
the rural population (72 percent of all women in the labor force compared to 63 percent of men).49
Informal workers typically lack the social protection afforded to formal workers, such as worker
benefits and health insurance, tend to work under irregular and casual contracts and are paid lower
wages than in the formal sector.50 Indeed, women in Paraguay have lower earnings than men and the
gender wage gap has remained constant over the last decade - women earn around 70 percent of
their male counterparts.51 The female-male earnings gap does not necessarily reflect discrimination
but tends to be primarily due to differences in the types of activities and jobs done by the two
genders. Women tend to hold lower level positions in firms –only one in every five firms has a
female top manager (2011)—and only 1.5 percent of women in the labor force are employers,
compared to 7.7 percent of men in the labor force in 2013. Furthermore, women tend to work in,
not only less productive sectors, but also less productive activities within these sectors: forty percent
of female workers in the labor market work in public and private services, many of whom are
domestic workers in private households [Figure 54].

4.3 Manifestations of the lack of women’s agency in Paraguay

Given the progress reported in women’s endowments, why are they still trailing men in
labor market outcomes? “Investments in health and education -human capital endowments- shape
the ability of men and women to reach their full potential in society. The right mix of such
investments allows people to live longer, healthier, and more productive lives.” 52 The quality of
women’s participation in the labor market might be affected by a combination of different factors,
including their human capital endowments, the opportunities available to them, their preferences
and goals as well as other societal factors such as social norms and gender roles pushing for a
specific division of labor between the genders. In Paraguay, and throughout LAC, women continue
to hold primary responsibility for childcare and domestic work – this has consequences for the
distribution of work outside the home where women are considered secondary earners while men
are the primary breadwinners.

The lack of women’s agency, understood as the capacity of individuals to make effective
choices and transform them into desired outcomes, is one of the missing catalizers keeping
women from fully utilizing their human capital endowments. 53 Increased agency enables
women to use endowments and make use of economic opportunities, fostering gender equity. While
it is very difficult to measure agency with quantitative methods, it is possible to look at certain
manifestations of the lack of agency. Concretely, low political participation and voice, high
prevalence of domestic violence, and high rates of teenage pregnancy are considered to be such
manifestations of the lack of women’s agency.

While political participation of women in ministerial position at the central level has
increased in recent years, it is still low in parliament and at local levels. One way in which
women’s lack of agency is manifested is through the lack of political participation at all
levels of government. Women’s representation in ministerial positions has increased significantly,
from 14.3 (2008), to 27.8 (2010) and 30 percent as of today (2013).54 Still, they occupied only 12.5
percent of total parliamentary seats, and the percentage of women mayors continues to be low (at
7.5 percent in 2011)

Despite Paraguay’s recent measures to protect female victims of domestic violence, it
remains a serious problem. In recent years, the first shelter for victims of domestic violence has
been created and several provisions for comprehensive services for victims of this crime have been
established, including six specialized police stations equipped to receive complaints about violence
against women, children and adolescents. However, these measures are insufficient to fully protect
victims of these crimes. One in five women in Paraguay has acknowledged experiencing physical or

sexual violence by their partners at some point in their lives, and 8 percent in the last year [Figure
55]. And yet, only 12 percent of those turned to institutions for support. Women cited many reasons
for not seeking institutional help, including shame, fear of retaliation, not knowing where to go, and
not believing that anyone would help. Institutionally, there is a lack of a coordinated and coherent
system for collecting data on gender-based violence and the need for further trained medical
personnel to properly treat women.55

A third manifestation of lack of agency in women is represented by the rate of pregnancy
among teenagers. As throughout LAC, adolescent fertility in Paraguay is higher than expected
considering GDP and primary school completion rate. The rate of adolescent fertility has decreased
since 2000 from 86 (births per 1,000 women ages 15-19) to 68 in 2011, slightly below the regional
average of 69. However, Paraguay’s rate is still higher than the average for lower-middle income
countries (49 percent). While adolescent fertility has decreased over time, as has the rate of older
ages, the fall has been slower and thus the contribution of adolescent fertility to total fertility actually
increased from 10.5 percent in 1987 to 1990 to 12.8 percent between 2005 to 2008.56

Teenage pregnancy is higher in rural areas than in urban areas and among teenagers of
lower socioeconomic status. While the fertility rate was 85 for rural teenagers in 2008, it was only
47 for urban teenagers [Figure 56]. Similarly, socioeconomic status and the level of education of
young women are inversely proportional to the probability of experiencing at least one pregnancy.

Box 3. Teenage pregnancy and lack of agency: Key results from a mixed-methods study in
Paraguay57

A mixed-method study was conducted in 2012/2013 to understand the risk factors and social
circumstances related to adolescent parenthood in Paraguay. This study consisted of semi-
structured in-depth interviews and mini focus groups for the qualitative component, and a
standardized survey distributed to 1,000 boys and girls in the target age group (15-19 years) for the
quantitative component. The goal of this study was
    1) to gather comprehensive information about perceptions, attitudes, knowledge, values and
        concerns, and
    2) to illuminate significant contextual information such as peer effects and cultural and social
        norms.




 This study was implemented by SER (Sociedad de Estudios Rurales y Cultura Popular), led by Daniel Campos Ruiz
57

Díaz, María Celsy Benavidez, and Pedro Amado de Llamas Granada.

                                                                                                                 78
This study found that lower levels of agency and its enablers (such as aspirations and
empowerment) 58 are associated with a higher risk of becoming a teenage mother. 59
Concretely, a girl may get pregnant because she lacks the capacity to take control over her life
projects – instead, life (including pregnancy) just ‘happens’ to her. Furthermore, the context in
which adolescent mothers grow up might not provide them with positive role models to help them
identify concrete educational and occupational goals to achieve and the steps necessary to achieve
them. Additionally, social norms might favor female passivity within relationships, communities and
the society – which in itself is contrary to exercising agency. Finally, multiple factors at the
relationship and community level may disempower young girls and thus hinder them from taking
decisions and engaging in the necessary steps to implement these decisions.

Both the qualitative and the quantitative parts of the study showed that one of the key
constraints to making meaningful choices and taking decisions to shape one’s own future
faced by teenage mothers is related to their capacity to aspire. Adolescent mothers have lower
expectations with regards to the quality and the remuneration of the jobs they will be performing in
the coming decade when compared to their peers who do not have children in adolescence. When
asked about their educational aspirations, adolescent mothers interviewed for this study generally
agreed with the importance of education, but this appreciation reveals to be very generic: the
acknowledgement of the value of education does not come accompanied by a clear plan of concrete
steps to take to improve their own educational outcomes. Furthermore, when asked about their
visions for their own lives, they express little clarity in general – and no concrete mechanisms
available to them to shape their own future. This lack of control over their life projects is reflected in
their pregnancies: the in-depth interviews conducted in the context of this study showed that
pregnancy occurred neither completely intended – nor completely unintended in the vast majority of
the cases observed. Most interviewees do not mention an explicit and conscious motivation to their
pregnancy – but at the same time, the pregnancy does not seem to interrupt careers or planned life
paths. Thus, pregnancy ‘occurred’ to most of these girls without them showing signs of control or
conscious decisions as to this life event.

Context-related factors can limit or strengthen adolescent girls’ agency: Not only family
environments, but also peers and society are influencing the way these adolescent girls see
themselves, how they imagine themselves in the future, and if and how they are enabled to
take meaningful decisions regarding their present and their future. Aspirations are also shaped
by observation, thus it is quite striking to note that a smaller share of adolescent mothers described




58 Following Lopez-Calva and Cord (2013), this study groups enablers of agency as follows: i) internal enablers
(aspirations, self-drive), ii) context-related/environment enablers (norms, informal and formal institutions – enabling or
preventing you from ´doing´) and iii) empowerment (economic, political and other conditions to make others act in
one’s own interest).
59 The results described below are correlations, and do not show causal effects.


                                                                                                                        79
their families as providing them with some form of role models compared to their non-pregnant
peers (75 percent versus 89 percent). 60 Similarly, several results from the qualitative and the
quantitative components of the study indicate that role models amongst teenage mothers’ peers are
not very common: Teenage mothers are more likely to know male peers that engage in risky
behavior, such as violence and gang activities, compared with non-mothers. Teenage mothers also
reported earlier sexual debut among their friend group. Gender norms can limit the options an
individual sees for herself in terms of behaviors, occupations, roles, for example. Interestingly, the
survey shows that teenage mothers agree with stronger gender stereotypes compared to their peers
that are not mothers.61

Girls in several social and cultural contexts lack ‘power’ to influence the behavior of others –
which can turn them into passive figures in relationships, in families or in communities.
Limitations of access to information are motivated to a much higher extent by constraints such as fear,
economic issues, and shame among teenage mothers than non-mothers (40 percent of teenage
mothers declared these to be the reasons why they did not access relevant information compared to
29 percent of non-mothers). This suggests that adolescent mothers are not empowered to receive
the information they need and want, while non-mothers lacked access mostly due to choice (no
necessity or no interest were more common responses). Having access to accurate and complete
information is an essential basis for decision-making processes. 62 Finally, the age gap between
teenage mothers and their partner (if in a relationship) was double the age gap as that for non-
monthers in a relationship (six years versus 3). Significant age gaps can result in higher constraints to
women’s decision-making as a result of the power imbalances within the couple. Some adolescent
mothers also depended financially on their partners and several interviewees mentioned that their




60 Teenage mothers are more likely to have witnessed psychological violence between their parents (concretely:
screaming and insults): 31 percent of teenage mothers report this behavior by their parents versus 23 percent of not-
pregnant girls.
61 Teenage mothers responded in a way that reflected more gender stereotypes to the following questions: The woman

should not work, should be devoted to the home and the children; The man should be the economic provider of the
household; Men should not cry; Studying in university is more important for men compared to women; When jobs are
scarce, men should have more rights to a job compared to women; Generally, men are better political leaders compared
to women; To be a man it is necessary to have at least one child; To be a woman it is necessary to have at least one child.
This extended to sexual behaviors: they tended to respond in a more biased way to statements that reflected traditional
gender stereotypes with regards to sex, such as female submission and male domination. The survey included the
following questions: The woman is the one who should use contraception during sex.; Condoms are difficult to use.;
People who use condoms have sex with lots of people.; I feel very ashamed to buy contraceptives.; My partner does not
like to use condoms.; The majority of men do not like to use condoms.; It is not necessary to use condoms if one knows
one’s partner.; If I use a condom my partner will be suspicious of me.; If a girl goes out with a guy for a long time a nd
does not want to have sexual relations she does not love him.; The majority of my friends has lost their virginity.; If my
first sexual experience will be (or was) much later tan for my friends – they will make fun of me.; Losing her virginity is
an act of love for a woman.
62 Furthermore, effective contraceptive use is an important factor in a woman’s control over her body and fertility. Not

surprisingly, teenage mothers also show lower self-efficacy in contraceptive use in their current relationships compared
to non-mothers (66 percent of girls that are not mothers responded they were either very or somewhat secure that they
would not have sexual intercourse if their partner would not want to use any birth control method, compared to 55
percent of teenage mothers.

                                                                                                                        80
decision-making capacity is limited by their partners. Even more so, a higher proportion of teenage
mothers reported some form of controlling behavior from their partners (47 percent for non-
mothers versus 76 percent of teenage mothers).


4.4 Perceptions and social norms

To some extent, the challenges faced by women are related to social norms, as enablers of
agency.63 According to the ENDSSR 2008 survey, Paraguay comes third in the region regarding
women’s agreement that wife-beating is sometimes justified (23 percent) [

Figure 57].64 A third of interviewees believed that the wife must obey her husband regardless of
whether she agrees with him, one in four thought that the man must show his wife that he is the
boss, and 8 percent believed that having sex is a wife’s obligation, even if she does not want to.

Almost 40 percent of Paraguayans believe that in times of job scarcity, men should have
more rights to paid work than women [Figure 58]. Men were more likely to agree with this
statement. Interestingly, when comparing the extreme answers (very much disagree – very much
agree) to its neighboring countries, Paraguay shows more stereotypical attitudes with a fairly lower
proportion of both men and women strongly disagreeing with the statement and a slightly higher
share strongly agreeing with it. Attitudes such as these are reflective of favoring men as economic

In sum, Paraguay has made progress over the last decade in promoting women’s
empowerment and gender equality, particularly in terms of women’s endowments in health,
education and in strengthening the legal framework to promote gender equality. Despite
these improvements, challenges persist in achieving gender equality in the labor market where
women tend to not only participate at a lower share compared to their male counterparts (thus
having reduced capacity to earn an income of their own) – but also occupy less productive sectors
and positions, typically lacking social protection more frequently than men and having lower
earnings. One of the dimensions of gender equality where Paraguay seems to still be significantly
lagging behind is women’s agency. Women in the country continue to show very low rates of
political participation, high prevalence of domestic violence and higher than expected adolescent
fertility rates. The lack of women’s agency is not only important as a development outcome of its
own – but also it is one of the missing catalyzers keeping women from fully utilizing their human
capital endowments. Thus, by effectively promoting women’s agency it is likely that development
outcomes in other dimensions will be positively impacted as well.

Conclusion

Paraguay has made substantial progress in the last decade in improving its people’s welfare
and reducing inequality. There are some reasons for optimism related to increased labor
productivity in agriculture and improved employment opportunities, suggesting potentially long-
lasting transformations. Still, the country faces challenges that can threaten the sustainability of the
observed improvements.

A key obstacle Paraguay faces today is the fact that a large share of the population faces a
volatile economic environment. Both the rural and urban poor rely on volatile earnings streams,
leaving them exposed to labor market and macroeconomic risk. While the urban poor face limited
job prospects, leading to high rates of unemployment and self-employment, the rural poor
disproportionately depend on agriculture for their income, exposing them to macroeconomic price
fluctuations and local risks such as bad weather and agricultural pests. Therefore, large segments of
the population who have escaped poverty remain vulnerable to falling back, and seem unable to join
the ranks of the middle class.

A second space of concern relates to the still high and persistent lack of opportunities for all
groups: Even though inequality in income has fallen, some aspects related to the structural
determinants of inequity remain. Territorial inequalities persist, and access to good quality basic
services, such as safe water and education is limited to those from better off background and living
in urban areas. These inequalities are related not only to the lack of productive capacity but also
institutional weakness to deliver high quality services.

Finally, the relevance of strengthening agency and autonomy, particularly of women in their
participation in markets, community and relationships, is at the core of an equitable society.
Paraguay’s women continue to show very low rates of political participation, domestic violence
seems to be a highly prevalent issue of concern and, while adolescent fertility decreased significantly
since 2000, it continues to be higher than the average for lower-middle income countries and it now
contributes more to total fertility compared to 20 years ago. It is not only important to address each
of these manifestations of the lack of agency directly, but furthermore, and considering the
catalyzing effect of agency on other development outcomes, it is essential to strengthen women’s
agency which will most likely show positive effects on other development outcomes, such as for
instance their opportunities and outcomes in the labor market.



Policy Options to strengthen the links between economic growth and equity

The objective is to reduce structural inequities in monetary and non-monetary outcomes, by
addressing their structural determinants, namely: i. Improving the effectiveness of policies
to protect those vulnerable to falling into poverty in the face of shocks; ii. Enhancing

                                                                                                     83
equality of opportunities; and iii. Increasing the capacity of all individuals to have agency
and voice in society. Equitable dynamics in those dimensions constitute a pre-condition towards
ensuring sustainable and shared growth. The following are suggestive policy areas for Paraguay in
the coming years:


First Pillar: Mobility out of poverty

      Well-functioning and accessible markets are required to support the ability of all segments of
       the population to procure well paying, high productivity jobs. For instance,
       a. Promoting activities aimed at increasing the productivity, income generation and asset
           accumulation of families who have been able to leave poverty but who remain vulnerable
           to the risk of downward mobility will facilitate economic security and the growth of the
           middle class. These include the expansion of benefits to small firm and self-employed
           workers, including minimum wage coverage for low-skilled wage labor, access to public
           retirement savings plans (or continued expansion of non-contributory pensions), and
           access to unemployment insurance. As the poor are largely self-employed, the provision
           of adult training programs and microcredit could lead to increased productivity for this
           sector.
       b. While strengthening value chains linked to the dynamic sectors of the economy and
           emphasizing value added in the service sector will require high investments in human
           capital and is important for all areas, investing in connectivity and human capital in rural
           areas will allow rural households to diversify their income sources and benefit from more
           dynamic markets.

      Enhanced risk management at the macro and micro levels can protect households from
       shocks. Particularly,
       c. As highlighted by a recent World Bank report (2013d), to help prevent, cope, and
          mitigate agricultural risks faced by poor families in rural areas, it is crucial to ensure
          diversification of crops (including those less affected by droughts and with short cycles
          such as sesame) as well as good practices for irrigation and pest control, and promoting
          the commercialization of their products to incorporate them into value chains
       d. Increasing access to formal financial markets and insurance instruments (both health and
          agricultural) can help households mitigate their exposure to income volatility.
          Additionally, it could be relevant to consider the creation of contingency funds for
          families affected by weather shocks.
       e. Additionally, broadening the coverage and enhancing the responsiveness of targeted
          programs—such as CCTs (Tekopora) and Temporary employment programs—can also
          help households cope better with price shocks and both systemic and idiosyncratic
          shocks in general (in the absence of integrated social safety nets).
       f. Longer-term risk management policy can engage in second-generation reforms to the
          social protection system, including elements of social assistance for the poor and social


                                                                                                    84
           insurance for the large vulnerable population who can easily fall back into poverty were
           the external environment to deteriorate, such as wide-coverage unemployment insurance
           programs for the informal sector and temporary food assistance for needy families.

      Equitable, efficient and sustainable fiscal policy can ensure a solid fiscal position that allows
       for redistributive fiscal policy. Specifically,
       g. Increase tax revenues through progressive taxation policies to create fiscal space for
           more effective redistribution via diversification of assets holdings of the poor and the
           establishment of social safety nets, as well as enhancing targeting mechanisms to reduce
           ex-post inequality in income distribution in the short run.


Second Pillar: The pursuit of opportunities for all

      Ensuring the fairness and transparency of institutions in the provision of public goods
       requires the use of credible, stable institutions to deliver high quality services without
       excluding any segments of the population, and enhance equality of opportunities for all. In
       particular,
       a. Conditional targeted programs can continue to promote better and more access to
           healthcare and education for children, resulting in enhanced equality of opportunities
           and inter-generational mobility
       b. Improved quality of services for all will require both infrastructure and human capital
           investment
       c. Improved service delivery will imply improving the fiscal and strategic coordination
           among the central government, departments and municipalities, as well as integrating
           planning and programing processes with the budget process in order to track progress in
           social delivery.
       d. Additionally, it will be crucial to design a monitoring and evaluation system to track
           progress in social delivery, results and impacts, developing tools for targeting these
           towards the segments of the population with most urgent needs.


Third Pillar: Strengthening agency

      Policies to expand women’s opportunities in the labor market will not only reduce labor gaps
       (employment, earnings and quality) but also will enhance women’s agency, self-esteem and
       aspirations. To achieve this, it is necessary to
       a. Strengthen and expand systems that support women’s inclusion in the labor market
           through, for instance, access to childcare and professional training.
       b. Improve labor conditions in typically female sectors, such as domestic services, by
