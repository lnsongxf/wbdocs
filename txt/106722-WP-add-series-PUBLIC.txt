WSP’s technical assistance sought to strengthen reform
efforts initiated by the management teams at LWSC and
GVWC by improving the utilities’ ability to sustainably
fund their operations. Three aspects of cost-recovery were

    In Sierra Leone, the Guma Valley Water Corporation
    (GVWC), responsible for supplying the capital Freetown
    with a population of approximately 1.2 million, billed
    less than 20,000 accounts (NestBuilders Int., 2015), and
    managed to cover only 15 percent of its total costs (including
    capital depreciation) from tariff revenues (Harris, et al.,
    2012, p. 12).

    As a result, the company has for long been in “a critical state
    – only kept together through occasional emergency cash
    injections from central government and donors” (Harris, et
    al., 2012, p. 15).

    The low access to piped water perpetuated by the institutional
    crises of LWSC and GVWC has major health implications
    as it forces the vast majority of the urban population to
    rely on point sources such as hand-dug wells (WHO /
    UNICEF, 2014, p. 55), which are unsuitable for a dense
    urban environment, even if they have been included as
    “improved” sources in MDG tracking definitions. A WSP-
    funded study of the water quality of “improved” point
    sources in Monrovia found a majority contaminated with
    E. Coli bacteria (UHL & Associates, 2011). WASH-related
    diseases such as diarrhea are common, and cholera remains
    endemic. Liberia experienced an outbreak of over 34,000
    cases in 2003 and has consistently reported over 1,000
    cases a year up to 2011 (WHO, 2012) and Sierra Leone
    experienced a major outbreak in late 2012 that infected
    over 20,000 and killed 392 people.                                     Illegal connections in Freetown, Sierra Leone.

carried out an in-depth review of the current meter reading
process at LWSC to identify weaknesses and propose
improvements.

The core weakness of the current metering method lies
in a combination of multiple, manual steps carried out
without effective supervision or error-checking. At
LWSC, the metering cycle has at least four such manual,
unsupervised steps: First, meter readers visit customer
locations and write the current consumption figures into
a field notebook. As there is no reliable (for example,
photographic) evidence of the reading, and readers operate
on their own, it is easy to make errors or commit fraud
such as by taking a bribe to record a lower reading, by
claiming a meter is broken to allow the customer to pay a
cheaper flat-rate, or, indeed, to ignore illegal connections                     such as Nairobi City Water and Sewerage Company. WSP

       Box 1: Procuring Billing Systems for Utilities in Fragile States

       WSP provided technical assistance to GVWC for the diagnosis of their existing billing system and procurement of
       a replacement, with financial assistance from DfID.

       Assisted by ASPA utilities, WSP visited and studied a number of utilities in fragile states1 to take stock of the sorts
       of billing systems they had in place, their particular constraints and gain insight into how (and if) the numerous
       challenges of a weak governance environment were overcome. WSP also visited a number of small utilities in Kenya
       and Uganda, where various small-scale computerized billing systems had been successfully implemented.

       The first striking finding was that the utilities strongly preferred paying for locally-supported and adapted software
       rather than having donors provide generic applications. The ability to tailor and support the software locally was highly
       valued but this often came at a relatively high cost, was single-sourced and depended on a single developer.

       The second key finding was that identifying providers of utility billing software is not simple. A search leads one
       to a plethora of small providers who appear to be offering variations on bespoke applications developed for
       municipalities. Drawing on the World Bank and ASPA’s experience with major utilities in both developing and
       industrialized countries, a list of known software brands used by large urban utilities was prepared. Finding the
       actual providers of the software was complicated by the fact that software brands frequently change name,
       are upgraded, phased out, bought and sold between different IT service providers, and are merged into other
       systems. Also, many utilities either used “in house” software (Veolia, Suez), or regional providers (the case of the
       UK and Australia), used bespoke systems, or used billing modules of highly sophisticated Enterprise Management
       Systems (EMS) such as SAP. There appeared to be few truly international utility billing software providers.

       The lessons from the visits, as well as the diagnosis of GVWC’s current billing system, were used to develop a
       strategy for procuring the new billing system for GVWC. To ensure maximum participation in the procurement
       process, as well as advertising the contract on dgmarket.com, identified potential providers were directly
       contacted. Ten companies expressed interest in the project, of which five were shortlisted.

       A challenge was the scope of the billing system. These can vary enormously between providers, some of whom
       propose simple MS Access-based systems of the sort GVWC already had in place, or C++ stand alone, single PC
       type systems, through to very sophisticated web-enabled EMS. From our site visits, it was known that utility billing
       systems often claim to perform a large number of functions, making assessment of quality difficult in a tender
       evaluation where there is a very wide range of prices (from $2,000 to $50 million).

       GVWC had a specific budget constraint, and it was felt that unless bidders had some idea of the budget, such
       a wide range of prices (and scope) risked that the “quality” weighting of the procurement would be entirely
       outweighed by the price weighting, leading to the cheapest product being selected even if we had misgivings
       about the quality. It was therefore decided to announce the budget, and to some extent remove price competition.
       The terms of reference noted that the budget was a “maximum”, which allowed competitive pricing, and also
       included minimum software, hardware, support and service requirements, as well as optional items to be priced
       separately. Ongoing costs had to be made explicit, so that some consideration could be given to the effect on
       GVWCs operating budget. Services included a training component and three years of support from a local partner
       as well as two visits per year from the international partner if requested by GVWC.

       The three tenders submitted were of good quality, although the bidders proposed different hardware scope,
       which necessitated some adjustment to allow a like-for-like price comparison. Bidders also included different tax
       assumptions which needed to be equalized to allow a fair comparison. The company that won the tender worked
       closely with GVWC and persevered during the very difficult circumstances of the Ebola outbreak. The billing
       system finally went live in March 2015.

iv)	Reducing Commercial Non-Revenue Water
                                                                                   Images 2-4: Example of illegal water point
While improving the billing and collection process is an                           behind a gate (Monrovia, 7th Str.)
attractive area of intervention due its comparatively low cost
and rapid impact, revenue losses also are attributed to non-
revenue water, that is, water that is produced and distributed
but never even billed. The two principal causes are physical
losses in the dated, low-quality network infrastructure, and
commercial losses in the form of illegal connections.

At GVWC, non-revenue water was estimated at 45 to 50
percent of water production in 2012 (Harris, et al., 2012),
while at LWSC non-revenue water is believed to be as high
as 80% (World Bank, 2014, p. 39). It is not possible to
determine exactly how much of these enormous losses are
due to illegal connections and how much is due to leakage
from the old and damaged piped network, however, both
causes are likely significant.

The water supply system in Freetown was designed some
60 years ago and has seen very limited maintenance since
the 1980s (Harris, et al., 2012). Similarly, much of the core
infrastructure and piped network of LWSC dates back to
the 1950s and 1960s.

As the corporate audit noted in 2012, LWSC does not
even have an up-to-date database of its own distribution
network, which is “in disrepair and has extensive leaks” with
the company “not equipped, both in terms of manpower
and equipment [to] implement a leak detection program”
(GBSI / Government of Liberia, 2012, p. 38). It should be
noted that these network inadequacies not only cause direct
physical losses, but reduce service regularity and quality to
existing customers, thus lowering their willingness to pay.
While steps such as establishing district meter areas (DMAs)
would help detect leaks and is part of WSP’s next round
of proposed support to LWSC, addressing physical losses
in a fundamental way will ultimately require additional
substantial infrastructure rehabilitation investments that go
beyond just technical assistance.                                                example,. informal “spaghetti pipes” leading away from
