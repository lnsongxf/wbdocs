1.	Introduction
            Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are often not equipped to absorb the economic effects
            of losses climate change may bring. Investment in climate smart MSMEs, as well as investment that
            encourages rural MSMEs to become climate smart, is therefore needed to adapt and build resilience of
            rural communities, as well as to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from rural areas. .

    1.1	 OBJECTIVE – ENABLING POLICY ­
    	    FRAMEWORKS FOR CLIMATE SMART ­	
    	    FINANCING FOR RURAL MSMES

    Rural MSMEs are vital to the health of the rural economy
    and global food security. These MSMEs, which include
    primary producers, processors and traders, face increasing
    income and asset loss risks due to the changing climate in
    general and more frequent disasters in particular. They
    are often not equipped to absorb the economic effects of
    losses climate change may bring. This affects not only the
    families themselves, but also the communities within
    which they operate, the buyers and processors and con-
    sumers, and the food security systems in general.

The paper is structured as follows: Chapter 2 focuses on
the need for addressing climate change and measures for
risk reduction that rural MSMEs must adopt. First, it sets
the stage by addressing the issues surrounding rural and
agricultural MSMEs and constraints they face for finance
and investment. It then assesses the gaps for climate
smart MSMEs. The following section describes climate
smart adaptation and mitigation solutions for MSMEs. It
does this by highlighting some of the current understand-
ing of the climate financing problem as well as relevant
lessons learnt from the sustainable energy financing area,
followed by potential ways forward with discussion and
policy implications.

Chapter 3 follows a similar format but with a focus on the
opportunities that can be realized from new technologies
and efficiencies that can be gleaned from “green” finance
and investment. It then addresses the financial bottle -
necks inhibiting scale-up of this adaptive investment.
Chapter 4 also presents examples of promising solutions
that have been implemented or initiated, along with the
policy implications.

Chapter 5 presents a summary of policy analysis method-
ologies and applications in a number of cases and exam-
ples. The final Chapter 6 provides a policy assessment
and outlines how policy can promote financing and
investment for MSME climate smart adaptation. This
­
includes catalytic insurance solutions for rural MSMEs,
­
opportunities for innovation and areas for public support,
such as education, raising awareness and data improvement.
These policy options are then summarized into a Policy
Toolbox with applications and examples to facilitate policy
discussion.

Annexes of eleven case studies are presented in Chapter
7 to illustrate and more comprehensively explain examples
of implementation of climate smart financing and the
policies and stakeholders involved.

     		 climate smart solutions
                With climate change, 100 million persons are expected to fall into extreme poverty due to
                more disasters and changes in production due to climate. Micro, small and medium enterprises
                (MSMEs) are among the hardest hit.

It should also be highlighted that in addition to domestic
policies and instruments, international public finance also
plays an important role to catalyze additional resource
mobilization from other sources, public and private, as
noted in the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which consti-
