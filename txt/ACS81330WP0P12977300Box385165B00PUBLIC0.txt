Africa Development Forum Series

           The Africa Development Forum Series was created in 2009 to focus on issues of signifi-
           cant relevance to Sub-Saharan Africa’s social and economic development. Its aim is both to
           record the state of the art on a specific topic and to contribute to ongoing local, regional,
           and global policy debates. It is designed specifically to provide practitioners, scholars,
           and students with the most up-to-date research results while highlighting the promise,
           challenges, and opportunities that exist on the continent.
              The series is sponsored by the Agence Française de Développement and the World Bank.
           The manuscripts chosen for publication represent the highest quality in each institution
           and have been selected for their relevance to the development agenda. Working together
           with a shared sense of mission and interdisciplinary purpose, the two institutions are com-
           mitted to a common search for new insights and new ways of analyzing the development
           realities of the Sub-Saharan Africa region.

Note: These findings refer only to students who have stayed in school. Those who have dropped out—who would have scored even lower
on these assessments—are excluded from these calculations. The many primary school dropouts who lack the most basic skills, including
simple numeracy or literacy, are largely young people who will find work in agriculture and HEs.

High fertility and declining mortality rates have led to a very young population in
most Sub-Saharan African countries. The region’s labor force is expected to increase
by 11 million people per year over the next 10 years. Most of this increase will be new
entrants seeking their first job. While the younger generation is better educated than
their parents, they often lack the means to translate that education into productive
employment. Today, most work is in nonwage jobs on farms and in household
enterprises. Even if greater economic activity were to create the conditions for robust
growth and economic transformation, the private modern wage sector in low- and
lower-middle-income countries could not absorb all the applicants. This report focuses
on how to improve the quality of all jobs and to meet the aspirations of youth. It
emphasizes that building a strong foundation for human capital development can play
an important role in boosting earnings, and it argues that a balanced approach focused
on building skills, raising productivity, and increasing the demand for labor is necessary.


Youth Employment in Sub-Saharan Africa notes that many youth employment challenges
are problems of employment in general. However, youth is a time of transition, and
young people face particular constraints to accessing productive work. The report brings
together original analysis of household and labor force surveys; it reviews the experience
of a number of promising interventions across the continent; it draws from qualitative
studies in several countries; and it surveys the most up-to-date evidence from rigorous
evaluations of policies and programs. From this information base, the report provides
guidance to policy makers on how to intervene along two dimensions—human capital
and the business environment—and in three priority areas—agriculture, household
enterprises, and the modern wage sector. The ultimate goals are to increase productivity,
improve livelihoods, and multiply opportunities for young people.
