Overview of the Caribbean Region


Although the Caribbean is often viewed as part of the greater Latin
American region, the regional economy of the Caribbean is distinct from
the rest of Latin America in numerous and important ways. Broadly
speaking and despite their diversity, national economies within the
region can be grouped into three different types, albeit with significant
overlap: (1) commodity exporters3 (i.e., natural resources and agricultural
goods); (2) service-based economies4 (i.e., tourism and financial



services); and (3) microstates (i.e., Eastern           the worldwide downturn, and it has recovered

Sizing the Diaspora Population17


Since the mid-20th century, the Caribbean region has been the source
of one of the largest emigrant populations in the world. Although this
population is diverse, in terms of both demographics and destinations,
according to the World Bank’s 2011 Migration and Remittance Factbook,
relative to other global Diaspora groups, a distinctively large portion of
Caribbean migrants consists of individuals who are both highly skilled
and well educated. Within the Latin American and the Caribbean (LAC)



region, the Dominican Republic and Jamaica rank as        Table 6: Total Migrant Stocks (2013)

of emigrants. According to the United Nations                                                            Percent of

Billionaire entrepreneur Richard Branson has

any entrepreneur in the Caribbean although it is
physically hosted in Jamaica. The fragmented
geography of the Caribbean, atomized populations
of potential entrepreneurs, and poor transport links
have required most initiatives to take a regional
hub-and-spoke approach, hence the decision to
house these initiatives in Jamaica, a large regional

alleged, however, that there are inconsistencies
in the issuance of long-term work permits. These
generally fall into two categories: (1) a permit is not
granted to an official of a company that is competing
with a local firm or (2) the authorities threaten not
to renew a permit because a foreign firm has not
done enough to train and promote a national into
the position. Some executives of smaller companies
have found that their work permits are approved
only if they form joint ventures with local firms or
set up formal training programs.

specific regulations regarding U.S. companies.
There are no exchange controls on foreign
currency and securities. The repatriation of capital,
