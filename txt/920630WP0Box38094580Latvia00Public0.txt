THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practic e or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.

        Obtaining the architectural planning conditions from the Municipal
        Building Board is a prerequisite for the commencement of building
        activities, such as preparing the architectural design. The architectural
        planning conditions contain the main requirements for the intended
        building and list the agencies and institutions from which additional
        technical requirements must be obtained.

        to be submitted at any Sadales tīkls AS Customer Service Centre. Any
        Customer Service Centre provides detailed information on the procedure
        of the document submission and getting a new connection. In order to
        speed up the connection procedure the application may be sent by e-

        Procedure of Establishing Connection with Electric Facilities and
        Construction Design are also available electronically on Sadales tīkls AS
        homepage at www.sadalestikls.lv and can be filled in and if necessary

      The customer needs to hire an electrical design firm that prepares the
      design of the external connection works (electrical installation designer,
      certified expert-electrician). The electrical design firm is getting the
      design approved by the utility and by other stakeholders, for example

      After the connection agreement has been concluded and the connection
      payment made, Sadales tīkls AS organizes the connection construction
      works up to the borders of the belonging of the customer's electrical
      installation. The utility hires an electrical contractor. In order to do so, the
      utility is organizing a public tender to award the external connection
      works to a private firm. The utility usually has all material on stock and
3     gives the material to the firm that does the connection works. The utility 30 calendar days     EUR 34000
      can have material for a better price, as they buy the material in large
      quantities and keep stock for about a year. The customer is paying the
      cost for the works and the material directly to the utility. Once the
      connection works are finished, the electrical contractor makes some tests
      of the connection and sends the results to the utility for approval.
