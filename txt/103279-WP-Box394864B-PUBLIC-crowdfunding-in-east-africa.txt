In the past 10 years crowdfunding – raising monetary              (2012-2014)

The total crowdfunding market in the developing world is
projected to be about $327 million for 2015 – about 2 percent
of the global total.3                                                               1.0

Despite its slow adoption in developing economies,
crowdfunding has been heralded as an opportunity to
                                                                                                    22%
expand access to capital for entrepreneurs. In 2013, the
World Bank published a report, Crowdfunding’s Potential
for the Developing World, which estimated a $96 billion                             2013
crowdfunding market in the developing world by 2025.                                                      12%

Developing countries in Africa are among the lowest
performing in the world in terms of utilizing crowdfunding.
In 2015, the African crowdfunding market will total about
$70 million, which accounts for less than half of one percent
of global crowdfunding activity and about 21 percent of                           1.7%    3.0%
emerging market activity. Of that $70 million, about 54 percent
was generated by peer-to-peer lending platforms, such as                6.9%                          12.0%

“lifestyle” businesses rather than the creative, technological                                         8.2%
or infrastructural projects typically launched by high-growth
potential entrepreneurs in other crowdfunding markets.                               2014
These statistics suggests that crowdfunding for African
entrepreneurs in these sectors is still in a nascent stage.
Low African adoption of crowdfunding by entrepreneurs
can be attributed to a number of factors, including                    68.3%
national regulatory environments that are not conducive
for crowdfunding of equity and debt and technological
