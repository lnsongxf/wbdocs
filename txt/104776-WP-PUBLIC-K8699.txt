iv	                 Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
                   Preface

                   In 2015, the world took landmark steps to address some of the most difficult chal-
                   lenges of our generation. The Paris Agreement on climate change, the Sendai
                   Framework on Disaster Risk Reduction, and the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable
                   Development are all promises for a future that aims to leave no one behind. Together
                   they represent a remarkable affirmation of the power and potential of multilateral-
                   ism. Delivering on these agreements requires a revitalised global partnership to
                   reach those most in need, first and foremost in conflict-affected and fragile countries.
                      Signed in 2008, the Joint Declaration on Post-Crisis Recovery Planning and
                   Assessment established a common platform between the European Union,
                   United Nations System, and World Bank Group for such a partnership. Calling
                   for action to harmonize and coordinate our response, the declaration mobilized
                   our institutions and established a common framework and methodology to assist
                   national stakeholders as they assess need and define a strategy for recovery and
                   peacebuilding. As representatives of these institutions, we are, therefore, pleased
                   to share with you the first independent review of experiences of these efforts.
                      Commissioned by the three organizations, with support from the UN-WB
                   Partnership Trust Fund, this review looks back on eight years of collaboration
                   on planning and implementing support to countries recovering from conflict.
                   Drawing lessons from Georgia (2008), Lebanon (2013), Libya (2011),
                   Myanmar (2013), Pakistan (2010), Ukraine (2014–15), and the Republic of
                   Yemen (2012), the review concludes that joint assessments have and should
                   form a critical part of the international system’s toolkit in response to con-
                   flicts, but that modifications are required to respond to increasingly complex,
                   crowded, and at times insecure environments. To enable a more effective
                   response, the review proposes practical changes that would enable earlier,
                   faster, and more flexible, joint assessments and responses.
                      We are grateful to Donata Garrasi and Ross Allen for having produced such
                   a rigorous review, and to all those colleagues who contributed time and
                   insights to help shape and refine the recommendations.
                      In 2016, senior representatives of the European Union, United Nations, and
                   World Bank Group endorsed the conclusions of the review and formed a
                   High-Level Advisory Group to guide implementation of its conclusions.

vi	             Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
Executive Summary
Since its introduction in 2003, the Post-Conflict Needs Assessment (PCNA)
methodology has been used by the World Bank (WB), United Nations (UN),
and the European Union (EU) to frame multilateral assessments in more than
10 countries. In 2008, the partnership among the three organizations was
strengthened under the Joint Declaration on Post-Crisis Recovery Planning
and Assessment (Joint Declaration), which formally commits the partners to
work together on planning and implementing support to countries suffering
from crises. Prior to signing the Joint Declaration, a major review was com-
missioned in 2006 to improve the relevance and effectiveness of the PCNA
framework. It led to a revised Joint Guidance Note on Post-Conflict
Needs Assessments and Transitional Results Frameworks (2007), which are
currently used to guide PCNA.
   The current review, which was commissioned following the “Review of
the WB-UN Partnership in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Situations” (2013), is
conducted under the stewardship of a World Bank-UN-EU Reference Group
and is concerned primarily with the process and practice of PCNA and related
exercises since 2008: Georgia (2008), Lebanon (2013), Libya (2011), Myanmar
(2013), Pakistan (2010), Ukraine (2014–15), and Republic of Yemen (2012).
The ongoing joint assessment in Gaza, and the recently completed Ebola
Recovery Assessment (ERA, 2014–15), were also considered.
   This review proposes practical changes that would enable earlier, faster,
more flexible, and more effective joint assessments and responses. The
findings, analysis, and recommendations are based on a review of core
documents relating to PCNAs and similar joint assessments and extensive
desk-based consultations with headquarters and field staff from the three
organizations as well as some national partners involved in joint assess-
ment processes.
   The review finds that PCNAs are considered a valuable approach to pro-
moting a joint multilateral assessment and response to crisis and post-­
crisis contexts. The changes that have occurred in the institutional and
operational environment for PCNAs since they were initiated, however,
have an impact on their strategic role and added value. Also, it appears that
PCNAs are still perceived as supply-driven, heavy, technical exercises that
are difficult to manage and coordinate. Furthermore, they have not consis-
tently delivered clear outcomes. Institutional commitment to the Joint
Declaration partnership is at times uneven and driven by different incen-
tives among the stakeholders. Results of PCNAs are not always clearly
articulated and delivered.
   Experience suggests that joint assessments, when effectively designed,
managed, and supported by senior-level leadership from the partner organi-
zations and national partners, are an efficient approach to providing unified
assessment and response to crisis and post-crisis situations.



Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	               1
  With this in in mind, the review has identified the following objectives to
enhance the effectiveness of PCNAs:
••   Clarifying the strategic role of PCNAs and strengthening the underpin-
     ning partnership framework
••   Ensuring effective and flexible design and management, including through
     different typologies, clarifying management arrangements, enhancing
     synergies with other processes, and simplifying the methodology
     ­
••   Ensuring focus on implementation through a variety of outcomes
••   Promoting inclusive national ownership and leadership
   The recommendations outlined in this report aim to address these objec-
tives and their underlying issues in hopes of improving the effectiveness of
PCNAs—to enable earlier, faster, more flexible, and effective assessments and
responses in crisis and post-crisis contexts.
   They suggest the need to renew the institutional commitment to the part-
nership and to joint assessments in crisis and post-crisis contexts, including
by clarifying governance and decision-making mechanisms, creating a stand-
ing support structure, forging links between disaster and conflict assessments,
and broadening the partnership to conduct joint assessments before a conflict
is over. They also propose options on typologies of PCNAs, emphasizing
phased, iterative, and fast approaches; on management mechanisms; and on
the need to further simplify the methodology.
   The recommendations also suggest the need to consider multiple options
for implementing the outcomes of a PCNA and for financing, bearing in mind
that such joint exercises are increasingly part of broader recovery and peace-
building contexts, to which they can contribute in different ways.




2	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
Introduction
The Context of the Review
Since their introduction in 2003, Post-Conflict Needs Assessments (PCNA)
have been used to conduct multilateral assessments in more than 10 coun-
tries. Other joint assessments have been conducted in a diverse range of crisis
contexts, and some are ongoing.1
   The methodology, approach, and processes have been revised to strengthen
the relevance and effectiveness of PCNAs, notably through the global review
in  2006–07. The partnership framework for multilateral collaboration on
crisis recovery and planning, including on PCNAs and Post-Disaster Needs
­
Assessments (PDNAs), was formalized under the 2008 Joint Declaration
on  Post-Crisis Recovery Planning and Assessment (hereafter the Joint
Declaration) signed by the United Nations (UN), World Bank (WB), and the
European Union (EU). The PCNA Advisory Group was established in 2009 to
support the implementation of PCNAs.
   This review follows the “Review of the WB-UN Partnership in Fragile and
Conflict-Affected Situations” conducted in 2013, which agreed that PCNAs
remain an important vehicle for engagement in crisis and post-crisis contexts
but suggested that a light review of the methodology was required to improve
its relevance and flexibility.



The Scope and Objectives
This review examines lessons learned, opportunities taken, and challenges
faced with PCNAs and other joint assessment exercises in crisis contexts con-
ducted by the three institutions since 2008. It identifies specific areas for
improvement and suggests ways to strengthen the relevance of the PCNA
process, approach, and methodology (hereafter the process).2 The aim is to
help improve the flexibility and effectiveness of PCNA—to enable earlier, faster,
more flexible, and effective assessments and responses.3
  As a “light touch” review, the recommendations are focused primarily on
practical changes that can improve the current PCNA process. Given the
complex nature of the process, the context, and the institutional partnership
for PCNAs, the review has identified some substantive issues that would
require further reflection by the Joint Declaration partners. These are also
outlined in this report.
  In line with the review’s terms of reference and as a desk-based review, this
exercise has not assessed whether the joint approach works better than alter-
native options. The decision to retain PCNAs as an important vehicle for
engagement in crisis and post-crisis contexts assumes that the partners
agree that the approach is relevant and have committed to it (as referenced in
the third paragraph of the “Introduction”): this is the starting point for this
review. However, given interest expressed by informants during the review in

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                    3
articulating the role and relevance of PCNAs, the review team has tried to
highlight PCNAs’ added value and show how this can be enhanced, based on
the evidence provided and consultations held. Whether these or other pro-
cesses are ultimately the right response for the three institutions individually
or collectively depends greatly on internal political considerations, including
what the partners are willing and able to invest in such approaches to make
them effective.



Review Methodology
To identify key issues and recommend the changes required to strengthen
PCNAs, the review explored the role and added value of PCNAs; the context
in which PCNAs are likely to be undertaken in the future; the key results
achieved and challenges encountered in conducting PCNAs since 2008; and
PCNA processes and the methodology and the institutional framework
around PCNAs. The review analyzed available documentation provided by
staff at the World Bank, EU, and UN and available online. It conducted exten-
sive consultations with key staff from each organization at headquarters (HQ)
and in field as well as interlocutors from the League of Arab States (LAS), the
g7+ secretariat4, the government of Sierra Leone, the government of Pakistan,
and the government and donor community in Myanmar. The review did not
include field visits.
   This review considered the following PCNAs and other joint assessment
processes:
••   Georgia, Joint Needs Assessment (JNA, 2008)
••   Lebanon, Joint Economic Impact and Social Assessment (JESIA, 2013)
••   Libya, Coordinated Needs Assessment (preparatory work, LCNA, 2011)
••   Myanmar, Joint Peacebuilding Needs Assessment (preparatory work,
     JPNA, 2013)
••   Pakistan, Post-Conflict Needs Assessment: Khyber Pakhtunkhwa,
     Federally Administered Tribal Areas (PCNA KP, FATA, 2010)
••   Ukraine, Eastern Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment
     (RPA, 2014/15)
••   Republic of Yemen, Joint Economic and Social Impact Assessment
     (JSEA, 2012)
   The review team held consultations with colleagues engaged in the ongoing
joint assessment in Gaza and the recently completed Ebola Recovery
Assessment (ERA, 2014–15), although it is acknowledged that both examples
are not formally recognized as PCNAs and are not formally case studies for
this review.
   This review is being conducted in two phases. Phase one has focused on
reviewing the case studies and conducting consultations, and these results are
presented in this report. The review team will present an options paper out-
lining key strategic decisions required to enhance the PCNA process for the
consideration of senior leaders in the World Bank, EU, and UN.

About This Report
This report outlines the findings and recommendations of the first phase of
the review. Following this introduction, the section “PCNAs and the Evolving
Environment” explains the role and added value of PCNAs and considers
the implications of a changing the international and policy environment in
which PCNAs are conducted. “Ensuring Effective PCNAs: Lessons and
Experiences” then summarizes the issues needing attention based on the
experiences, ­lessons, and challenges observed with PCNAs and other joint
assessments since 2008, highlighting areas for improvement. This reports
ends with “Recommendations,” which call for further discussion. The appen-
dixes to this report provide background information on the review and the
cases examined and further develop the recommendations.




Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	               5
PCNAs and the Evolving
Environment
What Are PCNAs?
The Joint Declaration and PCNA guidance describe PCNAs as “assessments
conducted jointly by multilateral agencies and national stakeholders to pro-
vide a prioritized and costed assessment of needs in a post-conflict situation”
in view of informing a coherent recovery strategy.
   Since PCNAs were first initiated, they have evolved from one-off exercises
that produced an assessment and Transitional Results Matrix (TRM).
Normally, PCNAs have been undertaken in relation to a donor conference
through processes that delivered different outputs in a phased or iterative way
and/or contributed to ongoing recovery and a peacebuilding process. This is
well reflected in the variety of objectives, approaches, and methodologies that
have been adopted in PCNAs and other joint assessment exercises since 2008
and that are illustrated throughout this report. Box 1 presents a brief overview
of the “evolution” of PCNAs since they were initiated.



The Changing Environment
Since PCNAs were launched, the contextual, operational, and institutional
environment around them has evolved. Some of these changes have implica-
tions for the rationale, scope, and impact of the assessments. In the future,
PCNAs will be conducted and likely mobilized in complex, crowded, and at
times insecure environments, where they will be one of a number of processes
contributing to crisis recovery and the peacebuilding response. This context
requires an even more adaptable and flexible approach to PCNAs and how
they and other joint exercises are conducted. The following paragraphs out-
line some of the major changes that have an impact on the way PCNAs are
positioned and conducted.
   The evolving conflict and peacebuilding environment. The range of countries
considered conflict affected or fragile is increasingly broad and diverse. At the
same time, recovery and peacebuilding are now better understood as long-
term processes requiring a mix of immediate, medium-, and long-term
responses rather than linear events (for example, peace accords post-conflict).
PCNAs and joint assessments are being mobilized in a growing number of
highly volatile and/or middle-income countries (for example, Lebanon, Libya,
and Ukraine) where resources may not be a primary concern, and a key aim
is to support a nationally led recovery strategy before there is a formal end of
hostilities. Assessments are being conducted and interventions planned in sit-
uations of protracted and repeated crisis where windows of opportunities are
seemingly narrow (for example, Republic of Yemen) and in situations of com-
plex and overlapping crisis, including at the regional level, where the ability to
mobilize capacities and resources quickly on a large scale is critical and could

Box 1  The Evolution of PCNAs
PCNAs conducted before 2008 were comprehensive planning exercises, designed and conducted
to provide a comprehensive sectoral assessment of needs in post-conflict, post-peace agreement
contexts. The Transitional Results Matrix (TRM) translated the assessment into costed recovery
priorities and actions and served as a basis for a national recovery plan to mobilize support at a
donor conference (for example, those held in Liberia and Sudan).

These assessments were broad in scope, involved great efforts and capacities, and were often
lengthy and resource intensive. The findings were not systematically followed by effective
implementation. Their conflict sensitivity and contribution to national peacebuilding efforts was
­
in most instances poorly articulated. These are some of the challenges that the 2006–07 Review
of PCNAs identified and the 2007 Joint Guidance Note attempted to address.

The most recent guidance rooted PCNAs in understanding the core nature of conflict in order
to establish key priorities in support of peacebuilding processes, while recognizing that PCNA
outcomes can be linked to broader goals, such as achieving Millennium Development Goals.
Situations where joint assessment and recovery planning were considered relevant include the
following:
•	 A sudden breakthrough in a peace or political transition process, requiring a clear plan and
     budget to support the process
•	 A peace or political transition process at a stage where it is useful for parties to focus on
     practical transition planning
     ­
•	 A later transition requiring a new process to confirm national priorities
•	 A political, security, economic, or social crisis requiring reevaluation of priorities and
     ­recovery plans

Since 2008, the partnership and joint assessments have been mobilized in the context of com-
plex crisis and peacebuilding processes, and the reports have varied in length and scope (see
appendix C). Greater flexibility and adaptability to the context, enabled by the revised methodol-
­
ogy and underpinned by a considerable body of practice, experience, and lessons learned, enabled
faster and more versatile assessments.



                                                                                      ­ xample).

               and manmade disaster simultaneously also have implications for PCNAs
               and  suggest a greater need to adapt the approach and seek synergies with
               Post-Disaster Needs Assessments (PDNAs).
                  Growing insecurity. The trends just highlighted have also meant that
               multilateral organizations have found themselves operating—and have been
               ­
               requested to engage in PCNAs processes—in increasingly insecure or difficult
               environments where access is constrained. That was the case in Libya, Eastern
               Ukraine, and Republic of Yemen, for example, and in the Ebola-affected coun-
               tries. This may be an issue if joint assessments are conducted in areas of the
               Middle East, such as Syria, and such countries as the Central African Republic,
               Mali, Northern Nigeria, and Somalia. Implications include a requirement to

analysis, place greater reliance on local staff, deploy small multidisciplinary
teams of essential staff, outsource field work, revise security protocols, and
apply adapted citizen feedback mechanisms.
   The many processes within the evolving peacebuilding architecture. The peace-
building environment, in particular the UN peacebuilding architecture
(under review at the time of this writing), has evolved significantly since
PCNAs were initiated. On the UN side, the Peacebuilding Commission (PBC)
and the Integrated Mission Planning Process and Needs Assessment Missions
were expected to facilitate a coherent international response in crisis-affected
situations.5 The recent review of UN Peace Operations concluded that the UN
system must pull together in a more integrated manner in the service of con-
flict prevention and peace. Increasing attention to conflict prevention and
peace implies greater importance attached to joint planning processes, expec-
tations for ensuring links between assessment processes (humanitarian,
peacebuilding, and development), and more emphasis on coordination
between UN partners at the highest levels in the UN system and with member
states.6 Other approaches to assessing needs and planning are used by multi-
lateral and bilateral agencies. These include the New Deal; Economic and
Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs); UN Consolidated Appeal Process
(Humanitarian Resource Mobilization); and a range of conflict sensitivity and
analytical tools (for example, Conflict Related Development Analysis). More
than 40 PDNAs have also been undertaken in the past five years, including
some in conflict-affected contexts.7 In this complex environment, the rele-
vance of PCNAs needs to be repositioned within the broader peacebuilding
architecture as a key existing framework for joint multilateral assessments
that can deliver a shared narrative for peacebuilding. Greater attention will be
required to understand and use the specific added value of PCNAs and flexi-
bility will be needed in determining what type of processes are most useful
and politically viable, particularly for the partner organizations. (For exam-
ple, should the focus be broadly strategic and/or political or narrow and
focused on costing and financing of physically destroyed infrastructure).
   Peacebuilding and statebuilding goals. Increasingly, national and interna-
tional actors have acknowledged the need to focus on peacebuilding and
statebuilding priorities as complementary to the Millennium Development
Goals in conflict-affected situations. This means a shift from traditional devel-
opment sectors and outcomes to priorities related to inclusive political settle-
ments, security and justice, and economic revitalization as foundations for
peacebuilding. The expectation is for these priorities to inform assessments
and responses in conflict affected situations. To remain relevant, it will be
important for PCNAs to consider peacebuilding and statebuilding goals as
part of the analytical framework for joint assessment processes, and  to be
­
flexible enough to adapt the needed methodology and process, including
the  skills and capacities, required for the exercise. The new Sustainable
Development Goals and the inclusion of a peace-related dimension may cre-
ate new opportunities for joint approaches to crisis assessment and planning.

   Political and operating environment. The principles of country ownership
and leadership of processes of transition from conflict and fragility con-
tinue to be upheld, including through the voice of such groups as the g7+.
Country ownership, leadership, and engagement have increasingly preoc-
cupied joint assessment exercises. Recent PCNAs have endeavored to
include all relevant actors, including nonstate groups, and to build broader
partnerships. (Examples include consultations with subnational actors in
Lebanon and Pakistan and efforts to determine local ownership by ethnic
armed groups for a PCNA in Myanmar.) However, engaging with national
authorities or nonstate actors that may not be perceived as legitimate may
present particular challenges. Further attention and development of best
practices on how to engage with national actors may be increasingly neces-
sary in the future.
   The institutional context. Since the Joint Declaration was signed, the
World  Bank, EU, and UN have undergone significant transformations that
have strengthened their roles independently in conflict and post-conflict
situations:
••   The World Bank has consolidated all work in fragile and conflict-affected
     states into a new Conflict and Violence Cross-Cutting Solutions Area,
     thus elevating the agenda at the corporate level and across sectors and
     regions.
••   The creation of the European External Action Service in the EU, with its
     comprehensive approaches to conflict and crisis and its extensive net-
     work of delegations around the world, have enhanced the EU’s ability to
     play a central role in delivering and coordinating dialogue, action, and
     support as well as in the implementation of external assistance.
••   The UN has move moved toward more integrated political, security,
     and development operations in crisis countries of the UN and a stronger
     focus on peacebuilding through the strengthening of the Peacebuilding
     Architecture. At the same time, the capacity of main UN coordinating
     body for planning and coordination—the Development Operations
     Coordination Office (DOCO)—has been reduced.
   These changes and evolving institutional incentives and interests have
had an impact on organizations’ capacity and willingness to engage in joint
assessment processes. They have raised questions about the partnership
that require substantive discussions, including on the value of PCNAs. They
also point to greater challenges in designing processes that are effective
in  complex environments and can contribute to broader recovery and
­peacebuilding processes.
   The country experiences examined for this review highlight a number of
 good practices and a degree of innovation in adapting to the operating
 context, which can be built on and further developed to ensure PCNAs and
 joint exercises are more relevant to the Joint Declaration partners. They
 also show an evolving understanding of the need to reposition PCNAs as a
 contribution to broader processes of crisis response and peacebuilding.

Ensuring Effective PCNAs:
Lessons and Experiences
The consultations undertaken for this review suggest that PCNAs continue
to be considered by the partners as a critical framework for pooling expertise
and resources and for coordinating a unified response to a crisis. The partners
have improved and adapted the way these exercises are conducted, specifi-
cally, to take account of past lessons and respond to specific crisis contexts. At
the same time, the high transaction costs and ambiguity surrounding outputs
and results have in some cases put into question the utility of PCNAs. The
lack of a shared, clear vision for the exact role of PCNAs in today’s recovery
and peacebuilding environment is a major challenge to cementing a partner-
ship that consistently delivers, and it needs to be addressed.
   Overall the review findings confirm that the trilateral commitment under-
pinning PCNAs need to be reviewed to reenergize the process and clarify the
role of PCNAs. The process and methodology need to be further simplified
and systematized, and the value of PCNAs must be articulated more clearly
within the new institutional realities for the three partners in order for PCNA
to regain its role as a strategically useful tool for dealing with complex envi-
ronments. The following areas were identified as those in which most of the
challenges exist and where key improvements should occur:
••    Strategic role of PCNAs and effective partnership: Further define the
      strategic positioning of PCNA and renew the institutional commitment
      and support to PCNAs and to the partnership approach, broadening it as
      useful.
••    Effective design and management: Simplify and systematize the process
      and methodology, while ensuring it is flexible and adaptable.
••    Implementation and results: Ensure that outcomes are clear and
      delivered.
••    National ownership and leadership: Consider options to enable owner-
      ship by national authorities and other national stakeholders.
  The recommendations at the end of this report propose concrete ways to
address key issues in each of these areas.



Finding 1: Strengthening the Role of PCNAs and
the Partnership
The case studies and the interviews suggest that institutional commitment to
conducting joint assessments in crisis and post-crisis contexts has not been
consistent across PCNAs and other joint processes since 2008. This appears as
a major factor hampering the value-added of the process. The governance and
decision-making processes around PCNAs (which were often referred to as
burdensome during this review) need to be systematized to professionalize

the process and ensure strategic coherence. An effective support capacity is
required to better embed the PCNA process within the respective institutions
and to enable effective coordination and collaboration. And broader partner-
ships, in particular with regional organizations, could help make PCNAs and
the tri-partite partnership more effective.

1.1 The Added Value and Strategic Role of PCNAs
The review found broad agreement within and between the World Bank, EU,
and UN that the main role and added value of a PCNA is its capacity to lever
the comparative strengths of each of the institutions to provide a unified
assessment and platform for response in a crisis context. Based on the find-
ings from the interviews and the case studies, four key advantages of joint
assessments were identified and can be summarized as follows:

i.	 Joint approach: PCNAs are the only agreed institutional framework for
      the World Bank, EU, and UN for joint assessment and response to ­     crisis
      situations. Comparative advantages (for example, expertise, political
      clout, staff and financial capacity, country presence, and so forth) add
      value and produce richer analytical processes than possible in individual
      institutions.
ii.	 Strategic potential: Working collectively provides significant poten-
      tial for having a major positive impact on a crisis situation, including in
      regional environments. Collective effort spreads risk and is an enabler for
      engaging on sensitive peacebuilding and statebuilding issues, particularly
      in highly political environments.
iii.	 Normative obligation: Joint assessment and responses are less taxing on
      national governments (each PCNA has been conducted at the request of
      a national authority), in particular as they reduce transaction costs on
      national authorities. A joint approach is in line with the aid and develop-
      ment effectiveness agenda, to which the three institutions subscribe, and
      best practice for engaging in conflict-affected environments.
iv.	 Quality: PCNA enables qualitative and quantitative approaches required
      for conflict environments. They can provide quick, high quality product
      to meet urgent requests
   Figure B.1 in appendix B shows how staff interviewed for this review under-
stand the benefits for and contribution by each institution to joint assessments
and their perceived added value.
   The Ukraine Recovery and Peacebuilding Assessment (RPA) is a strong,
recent example of the added value of the joint approach to engaging in volatile
contexts (with a mandate to deliver quick result). The RPA seems to have
benefitted greatly from each institution’s inputs at different times during the
assessment, as well as of a strong coordinating team and the availability of
senior expertise. The EU played a key role in navigating a complex political
environment at the outset of the assessment, leading to a relatively targeted
set of assessment priorities. The UN quickly mobilized a strong team with
peacebuilding, gender, and displacement experts to ensure social resilience

issues were addressed in a comprehensive, human-rights-based approach
across the assessment. The World Bank mobilized expertise to finalize the
economic analysis, after having led the infrastructure and social services
component. On a practical level, the Republic of Yemen Joint Social and
Economic Assessment (JSEA) relied heavily on UN and EU infrastructure to
facilitate a World Bank–led in-country assessment, which included ensuring
that key meetings could proceed. The EU security capacity and protocol also
meant that its staff could conduct market assessments to validate data, which
the review understands the UN and World Bank staff were unable to under-
take at the time of the assessment. Other examples, such as Lebanon Joint
Economic Impact and Social Assessment (JESIA) and the preparatory process
for the Myanmar Joint Peacebuilding Needs Assessment (JPNA) show that
the value of a joint approach can be upheld even when the three institutions
may not be able to engage at the same level as the other partners for a range of
political, capacity, and logistics reasons.
   However, despite the positive experiences, at the strategic level consensus
about the role of PCNAs going forward, including where and when they
should be mobilized, is missing, which makes it difficult to maximize the col-
lective approach. The PCNAs and joint assessment examined for this review
do not reveal any specific pattern that helps clarify where and when to mobi-
lize PCNAs or provide evidence to easily identify the triggers for doing so. In
addition, evidence suggests that PCNAs and joint assessments have not been
used consistently in crisis and post-crisis environments, as shown in figure 1,

               support of peacebuilding and recovery: Pakistan and Republic of Yemen. Only

               Assessment (ERA) in 2015. Box 2 summaries common questions that were

               much greater mobilization of PCNAs in a number of high needs environ-

               UN Mission countries and countries facing subnational conflict (for example,
               Burundi, the Central African Republic, Mali, Nigeria, and South Sudan).
               Whereas joint work is being considered for some of these countries (Mali,

Box 2  Illustrative Questions Raised during the Review on the
Role of PCNAs and Related Institutional Incentives
The role of PCNAs
•	 What is the role of PCNAs in the context of broader peacebuilding and statebuilding
    processes?
•	 Isn’t a PCNA the job for the UN peace and security architecture, which uses other approaches
    (e.g., integrated assessment for mission planning)?
•	 Aren’t PCNAs designed for post-conflict situations, as the name suggests? Can they effectively
    work during a conflict, in stabilization and peacebuilding and statebuilding contexts?
•	 Should PCNAs be undertaken where they seem to be most needed (e.g., Central African
    Republic)?
•	 Should PCNAs not have been replaced by the fragility assessments proposed in the New Deal?

Institutional Incentives
•	 What do PCNA’s contribute to each partner organization, to the partnership, and to the client
     that cannot be provided otherwise? Isn’t it easier to do assessments alone?

such opportunities as well as consider circumstances where a PCNA is not a
suitable approach.
   The evolving practice with PDNAs was mentioned repeatedly as a good
example of how to address some of the challenges just outlined and may offer
some useful lessons for PCNA processes moving forward. The growing suc-
cess of PDNA processes can be attributed to extensive efforts to develop a
clear and predictable approach to them, which is outlined in two volumes of
recently published guidance material. Based on interviews with World Bank
and UN staff involved with PDNA and PCNA, it appears that the PDNA
process has improved significantly due to a shared understanding among the
­
Joint Declaration partners of the vision and guiding principles for PDNAs: a
focus on government ownership, a clear understanding of objectives, effective
analytical tools required to assess needs, and sustained collaboration among
PDNA focal points in the World Bank, EU and UN. Most interlocutors noted
that the PDNA is not perfect and faces common challenges, such as ensuring
government ownership and linking assessment outcomes with finance, but
many acknowledged a positive forward trajectory and strong commitment to
this joint process.9 The relationship between PCNAs and PDNAs is explored
at under section 2.9 “Synergies and Collaboration” in this report.

1.2 Institutional Commitment and Governance
The review team noted that most interlocutors pointed to different institu-
tional interests, incentives, disincentives, and interinstitutional dynamics
as key enablers and/or disablers for effective and strategic PCNAs.10 Senior
officials from the three institutions mentioned that the high level political
commitment expressed in the Joint Declaration has not materialized into
                                                                       ­ artner
consistent senior and political leadership and engagement by the three p
organizations or into concrete changes by the three institutions in their
approach to working together in crisis-affected environments. Despite the
Joint Declaration and multiple past PCNAs and other joint assessments, the
World Bank, EU, and UN have all struggled to internally anchor the respon-
sibility for driving PCNAs and the tripartite partnership forward. This has
had negative consequences for PCNAs as explored through this report,
including the inconsistent capacity provided to assessments and the weak link
between assessment findings and subsequent allocation or reallocation of
programs and funding.
   Institutional interests were frequently presented as a core challenge for
cooperation. For example, the World Bank is often perceived to engage in
PCNA as a way to expand presence and own loan operations. Such comments
were made in regard to the processes in Republic of Yemen and Libya. The
UN’s engagement is perceived to depend often on the context and driven by
high profile, programming, and funding opportunities, as well as the need to
respond to the pressure of the various departments, program, and funds. The
UN mobilized for Ukraine and Ebola recovery but was slow to respond on
Republic of Yemen, where limited new funding opportunities were antici-
pated, often exerting pressuring to ensure the inclusion of several agencies,

14	                 Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
sectors, and experts. The EU is perceived as taking a careful approach in many
instances, although overall providing generous financial support and valuable
political clout. The EU had a clear interest in Republic of Yemen, for instance,
for substantiating its existing program through the joint assessment, but it
was less involved in other contexts where it had major established portfolios
and political engagement.
   Some interlocutors raised concerns about the conflict of interest in institu-
tions undertaking assessments with programming in mind. This applies
particularly to UN agencies, funds, and programs, and to a lesser extent the
­
World Bank, that usually require funding for implementing core programs in
new crisis situations. This was mentioned as a key driver behind pushing PCNA
and the tendency to take a broad-brush (many sectors) approach to assessments.
The distortionary effects of this conflict of interest are discussed in the first para-
graphs of “Finding 4: Promoting Nationally Owned and Inclusive Processes.”
   The extent to which the institutions want and expect governments to be in
the driver seats of joint assessments was not openly raised by interlocutors
and did not appear as a main issue in the case studies. This may be because
the  three organizations are institutionally committed to working with and
through their clients, and the issue of national ownership seems to be
approached in terms of degrees and modalities rather than a stand-alone
issue, as explained in the last finding of this report. (See “Finding 4: Promoting
Nationally Owned and Inclusive Processes.”)
   Several interlocutors also mentioned a culture of mistrust in each party’s
institutional capacities, technical competences, political imperatives, and
overall relevance in regard to commitment to this agenda. Such comments
were made for each of the post-2008 joint assessments. Whereas at the tech-
nical and/or the individual level, and in some instances also at the senior level
(for example, Ukraine, Lebanon, and Georgia), the relationship between the
institutions may work, there does not seem to be a consistent commitment to
or in some instances interest in the joint approach.
   Internal institutional challenges are equally important:
••   EU: Post-2008 engagement by the EU, a complex political entity that has
     to contend with a wide agenda and engagements on behalf of its member
     states (including geopolitical and trade concerns), complicates its posi-
     tion and role in the partnership and PCNAs.11 With a strong financial and
     political capacity to engage bilaterally, an extensive field presence through
     its delegations headed by senior political representatives, and strong
     engagement in other processes and partnerships (for example, on the
     New Deal and resilience agenda), interlocutors questioned why the EU
     should continue to spend its funds and political capital on laborious pro-
     cesses that do not always deliver clear results. Internal governance
     arrangements need to be clarified, and at the time of the writing discus-
     sions at this regard were ongoing, including on the role of the European
     External Action Service and of cross-EU governance arrangements.
••   World Bank: Internal World Bank dynamics and the questioning by some
     parts of the organization of the value of time-consuming partnerships and

      processes and of engaging with issues and partners with significantly
      different mandates and capacities affect the organization’s capacity to
      ­
      present a unified front on PCNAs. A few interlocutors commented that
      ­
      while the commitment to and responsibility for the partnership is clearly
      with the Fragility, Conflict and Violence Cross-Cutting Solutions Area,
      they have not yet been institutionalized like other standard World Bank
      assessment processes.
••    UN: Internal challenges include the existence of a complex peace, political,
      and development architecture, which makes it at times difficult to under-
      stand which part of the UN can best facilitate the organization’s involve-
      ment in joint assessments and responses. The coordination role formerly
      played by DOCO was eroded by the dramatic reduction of the office’s
      capacities and mandate and has not been fully replaced, according to UN
      officials interviewed for this review.12 Officials also commented that it would
      be useful to have greater clarity on the role of PCNAs and on way the whole
      UN system—including such key departments and offices as the Department
      of Political Affairs (DPA), the Department of Peacekeeping Operations
      (DPKO), and the Peacebuilding Support Office (PBSO)—can engage.

   The following paragraphs outline some of the experiences in addressing
these internal and interinstitutional challenges. In particular they suggest the
need for senior-level commitment and leadership in HQ and in country,
clearer internal and cross-institutional governance and decision-making
mechanisms, and an effective support capacity. Good preparation and man-
agement mechanisms also appear as keys to overcoming institutional differ-
ences and enabling effective collaboration. (See “Finding 2: Streamlining
Design and Management of Joint Assessments.”)
   Post-2008 experiences with PCNA and other joint assessments show that
there is a strong correlation among ownership, consistent senior-level engage-
ment, and effective processes. When strong commitment, senior-level leader-
ship, and effective decision making have been a feature of PCNA or similar
processes, assessments have been well received inside the respective institu-
tions and the required mechanisms to transform assessments into action have
been established. Pakistan, Georgia, Ukraine, and Lebanon present good
examples of assessments that were supported by high-level institutional
engagement. (See box 3 for a summary of lessons from these processes.)
   Building on these experiences, interlocutors, including senior representa-
tives of the institutions, highlighted the need for an open internal and
cross-institutional conversation about the individual institutional interests
and what they are willing to contribute to take the partnership and PCNAs
forward. This would appear as particularly relevant, as it was noted that the
Joint Declaration lacks details to define mutual commitments and other stra-
tegic and operational aspects of the partnership, including specifics about
decision-making mechanisms and capacities required for managing the part-
nership and PCNAs at the strategic and operational level—a situation that has
left space for the ad hoc engagement by partner organizations, according to
their own institutional interests. Equally necessary, given the institutional

Box 3  The Importance of Senior Commitment in PCNA
Joint assessment                                       What worked
Pakistan, PCNA KP,    Extensive preparatory work and strong leadership were critical in framing and
FATA 2010             delivering a delicate PCNA exercise aimed at contributing to a government-led
                      peacebuilding strategy for the country’s frontier region. This process seems to
                      have worked because consistent leadership and oversight from HQ and the
                      country offices informed decision making in areas fundamental to the process
                      and supported the efforts of country teams. It enabled building trust between the
                      institutions and facilitated strategic communication among donors, government,
                      and stakeholders in the crisis-affected areas.
Georgia, JNA, 2008    This is considered an example of a timely, quick, and well-managed assessment.
                      This was possible in part because decision making was effective and clear
                      processes were followed. Early conversations about “triggering” a PCNA,
                      while sparked by technical staff in the anchor units of the EU, World Bank, and
                      UN-DOCO, were quickly transmitted upward to the decision makers in both
                      HQ and country offices of each institution. This enabled “reaching up and out,”
                      avoiding disconnects within each institution. Leadership was ensured by the
                      proactive engagement of the EU-World Bank-UN and other international financial
                      institutions and partners, which helped ensure senior management buy-in and
                      full participation in the JNA.
Ukraine,              Interviews noted that effective governance bodies backed up a strong
RPA, 2014–15          institutional commitment. In particular, a steering committee composed of the
                      ­
                      government of Ukraine, the World Bank, EU, and UN was highly effective at
                      ­
                      the outset of the review. EU senior leadership in-country played a key role in
                      managing difficult political discussions with the government. Strong World Bank
                      and UN engagement ensured high-quality institutional inputs at the start of the
                      exercise and, particularly for the World Bank, capacity throughout the exercise.
                      The UN leadership helped to streamline UN engagement, although it still
                      featured a large team.
Lebanon, JESIA,       The JESIA had strong support from national leadership (for example, the prime
2011                  minister and a steering committee of advisors to the prime minister and director
                      general of the ministry of finance) and international partners (for example, the
                      World Bank country director was involved on a daily basis with the coordination
                      team and sector directors and the regional vice president was engaged). This
                      senior-level engagement and clear leadership arrangement (with the World Bank
                      leading the process) appears to have been important factors to the success of
                      the process.




               changes that have already been highlighted, is a conversation about the inter-
               nal and cross-institutional governance mechanisms that would best enable
               effective engagement.
                  At the country level, experiences point to the need to consider a systematic
               mechanism for the partner organizations to meet at the senior level and focus
               on operationalizing the partnership, including possible engagement with
               joint assessments. In most contexts a variety of coordination mechanisms and
               channels exist for the World Bank, the UN, and the EU to cooperate.13 Regular
               senior-level meetings on strategic cooperation prior to PCNA, however, have
               not been mentioned as a feature in the country experiences reviewed.
               Ultimately, the partnership should come alive at country level. Based on
               consultations conducted for this review, any future effort to enhance or insti-
               ­
               tutionalize trilateral engagements under the partnership will require a strong
               push from headquarters to ensure leadership in the field.

               Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                                17
   The review noted the lack of reference in any of the case studies to standard
procedures for communication and decision making, although some exist.
Examples of multiple and parallel communication lines within and among
institutions, between HQs and the field, were, on the contrary, mentioned
repeatedly. Consistent and predictable communication between HQs and field
teams leading up to PCNAs and between teams during the assessment was
recognized as a key ingredient for success (for instance, in the Georgia and
Ukraine assessments). Standard communication protocols have been a feature
of the positive transformation in the application of the PDNA methodology.
   A clear and consistent process for deciding to initiate a PCNA appears to be
missing or is inconsistently applied. The most consistent trigger to date is a
request from a national authority or an opportunity identified by one of the
three institutions, at times in competition. The current ad hoc approach does
not seem conducive to good planning and often undermines efforts to
strengthen the partnership. In Ukraine, for example, multiple request letters
sent by different government agencies to individual institutions brought the
World Bank, EU, and UN together at the country leader level to consider
undertaking a joint assessment. For the Myanmar JPNA, the request to under-
take a PCNA was received by the government of Norway and only reached
the EU, UN, and World Bank later when the letter was circulated to the Peace
Donor Support Group. For the Libya LCNA, not all partners were aware that
the PCNA approach was being taken forward in Libya until just before the
initial planning meetings. A well-documented agreement and process for
triggering PCNA would be beneficial to both strategic decision makers look-
ing to strengthen joint efforts to promote peace and security, and technical
staff responsible for operationalizing PCNAs. A number of UN interviews
highlighted that more transparency in the decision-making process would
help to strengthen the partnership within the UN system.


1.3 Support and Capacity
There is currently no dedicated support mechanism available to the Joint
Declaration partners to provide constant and effective support for PCNAs,
including taking care of basic organizational processes. For example, for the Libya
LCNA, effective coordination would have ensured that the EU had ­adequate plan-
ning time to approach initial PCNA planning meetings. For the Myanmar JPNA,
the World Bank and UN deployed experts early in the process, whereas the EU
was initially reluctant to participate, deploying an expert only in the latter stages
of development of the assessment methodology. Overall, best practice support,
lessons learned from previous exercises, and up-to-date templates for planning
PCNAs are sourced individually by team leaders and thematic coordinators
through networks, but these should be on hand to facilitate planning process.
   PCNA focal points within each organization do not have an institutional
support mechanism. DOCO used to play a key role both for the UN and
in support to the partnership and PCNAs, but it no longer has the capacity.
The PCNA Advisory Group was created in 2009 specifically to oversee a
PCNA project to strengthen and further develop tools and capacities for

18	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
implementation of PCNAs. Following the completion of the project, it was
agreed to continue the Advisory Group to promote implementation and insti-
tutional commitment, share information and draw lessons learned, as well as
address policy and operational gaps. The Advisory Group has not been used
actively for country-specific PCNA exercises, and as it is not a strategic
decision-­ making body it is unclear how it links to formal decision-making
structures of each institution.
    The absence of dedicated support capacity has also meant that corporate
information on the Joint Declaration and PCNAs is not easily available to the
partner organizations themselves and national partners. Existing corporate
material is not up-to-date and there is no systematic follow-through on
­lessons learning.14 While the range of materials and tools to guide PCNAs are
extensive, most reviews’ interlocutors seemed largely unaware of their
existence or their application by practitioners.
­
    Critically, this applies to country representations that are or could be
involved with PCNAs. Interlocutors noted a lack of awareness of PCNAs at
the level of country senior leadership of the partner organizations (for exam-
ple, the UN resident/humanitarian coordinator or UNDP country represen-
tative, World Bank country director, EU head of delegation). In contrast, the
PDNA management is systematic; for example, senior country level staff
receive joint communications from the three partner organizations following
a disaster to inform their offices that the tools and expertise are available
should they be required. The PDNA process is also benefiting from a rollout
of the methodology that was updated in 2014, including methods for promot-
ing the tool with high-risk countries.
    Most interlocutors also noted that joint assessments require high-caliber
capacities with the right skills set and a sustained commitment to ensure that
these are available throughout an assessment. Georgia, Pakistan, and Ukraine
were mentioned as good examples in this regard. A consistent commitment to
providing capacity, however, remains a major challenge. High-profile assess-
ments have been oversubscribed, while staffing less visible exercises, such as
that in Republic of Yemen, was described as like “pulling teeth.”
    Interlocutors involved in a range of joint assessments in the past few years
highlighted that senior, experienced, and skilled staff are often mobilized for
the first few days or weeks, but thereafter a mix of consultants and less expe-
rienced staff take over. This has been a contributing factor in slowing the
Ukraine assessment. The World Bank has been consistent in mobilizing key
resources from HQ, the region, and country of the assessment in most recent
assessments (for example, in Ukraine, Lebanon, and Myanmar). The UN sys-
tem engagement has been patchy and at times overwhelming in numbers
(Ukraine and ERA). The limited staff capacity and field presence of the EU
means that it although contributing significantly to the partnership and to
joint assessments, may continue to rely on framework agreements to provide
external consultants to support its assessment contribution.
    The inconsistent approach to mobilizing institutional expertise causes ten-
sion in the partnership and directly relates to perceptions of PCNA processes
being heavy and unwieldy. This situation was mentioned repeatedly during

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  19
interviews as hampering effective and efficient PCNA processes. For example,
while it was difficult to mobilize the UN for the Republic of Yemen assess-
ment, seven UN gender advisers were mobilized for the Ukraine RPA.
Previous attempts to increase the availability of qualified experts to include on
the PCNA roster have not been successful and are now redundant.15 Several
interlocutors also expressed reservations about training and placing staff on
rosters, in particular because this exposes the organization to losing good staff
to assessments when they provide vital services in their regular positions.
   The case studies and interviews conducted for this review pointed to few
good practices to mobilize national expertise (for example, national experts,
local staff of partner organizations, and national civil servants) and to the
need to make more efforts in this direction, particularly in high-capacity con-
texts. The Ukraine and Pakistan assessment teams went to great lengths to
ensure government engagement, and the World Bank mobilized local and
regional staff for the assessment. Interlocutors agreed that more effort should
be made to recruit local capacity to support assessments on short-term con-
tracts in high-capacity areas and that the partners could develop a modality
for doing this. The ERA process may provide some useful lessons about mobi-
lizing national capacities strategically—for example, by mobilizing former
government officials and senior local consultants. Although a main reason for
making an extra effort to engage national capacities for the ERA was the par-
ticularly difficult environment with very limited international presence and
an extremely urgent time frame to deliver the assessment, it provides some
useful transferable lessons.
   The issue of training and capacity development was initially addressed
through an HQ-based training approach, targeting staff directly or potentially
involved with PCNAs. These efforts were described as heavy and costly and
seem to have delivered limited returns because trained staff rarely made it to
a joint assessment exercise. Staff rotation and availability and a reluctance to
train staff for fear of losing them, also hinder capacity. Good practices devel-
oped more recently, in Pakistan and Ukraine, for example, have focused on
in-country training and thorough briefings before the assessment process.
Moving forward, several interlocutors pointed out that training should focus
on imparting key experiences from previous assessments and team-building
practices. It should also focus on the methodology. Interlocutors suggested
that partners have paid little attention to educating senior country-based
leaders on the Joint Declaration and joint assessment processes and should
focus on integrating this background as part of briefing heads of delegations
and country offices during in-briefings on the partnership.


1.4 Broader Partnerships
Recent PCNA experience suggests that working in partnerships with a
broader range of organizations, in particular regional organizations and
banks, in complex regions where multilateral organizations have not had
major footprints, could be an important feature of future engagement.


20	                 Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
   Broader partnerships have been a significant feature of well-run joint
assessments in Georgia, Pakistan, and Republic of Yemen. In Georgia, the
broad involvement of the international financial institutions enabled access
to a much greater range of capacities and allowed the stakeholders to develop
a unified multilateral perspective to bilateral donors who would (eventually)
fund recovery and development. (These institutions included the
International Monetary Fund, European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, the European Investment Bank and the Asian Development
Bank, the International Finance Corporation.) In Republic of Yemen, the
LAS provided significant awareness of the regional context to the assessment
process and played a significant cultural and communicative role with
Yemeni counterparts. The participation of the Asian Development Bank was
critical in the Pakistan assessment, given its long-standing relationship with
and deep knowledge of the country.
   The new partnership on PCNA that is being explored with the LAS is both
strategic and necessary. For Joint Declaration partners, it could facilitate
greater access to regional knowledge and key players and add greater legiti-
macy to future assessment exercises in complex and unfamiliar political
environments. It could also contribute to the sustainability of the engage-
ment beyond an assessment. For the LAS, partnering on PCNAs with estab-
lished multilateral institutions provides access to a wealth of knowledge and
expertise on undertaking assessment processes as the number and variety of
complex crises increases. A close partnership with the LAS would help inter-
nal LAS efforts to build a pan-Arab crisis resolution network, covering crisis
response, early warning, and aid operations. It is understood that the next
phase of the EU-LAS partnership could focus on building the latter’s capac-
ity on joint assessment processes, following the March 2014 familiarization
workshop in Cairo. Transferring knowledge to and building the capacity of
regional bodies to approaches and models that have been experienced else-
where should also be seen as common objectives of the Joint Declaration
partners.16



Finding 2: Streamlining Design and Management
of Joint Assessments
Experiences show that good preparatory work, flexible design, and effective
management arrangements shape good joint assessments, even under urgent
deadlines. The current PCNA methodology and recent practice recognize the
need for substantive preparatory work, flexibility, innovation, and greater
focus on strategic priorities as opposed to sectors, all of which have been pur-
sued with varying degrees of success since 2008. Further streamlining of the
methodology, considering different typologies of PCNAs and management
arrangements and enhancing synergies with other processes from the outset,
are required for PCNAs to be attractive and manageable for Joint Declaration
and national partners.


Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  21
2.1 Focus on the Pre-Assessment Phase
Experiences with post-2008 PCNAs and joint assessments show that, although
at times a sense of urgency may prevail and may lead to quick deployment of
assessment teams and processes, ultimately it is more important to plan well
than to act fast. This tension, and striking the right balance between the need
to respond to urgent recovery priorities while considering longer-term needs
and between strategic versus comprehensive assessment, are difficult dilem-
mas to manage and require good preparation and flexibility. Several interlo-
cutors commented that substantive preparatory work had been completed for
the processes they were involved with; a roughly equal number of people said
there should be more focus on this critical phase.
   Dedicating enough time and resources to the pre-assessment phase
was ­recommended by the 2006–07 review and was a key component of the
PCNA Joint Guidance. This has proven to be a valuable and a successful strat-
egy in assessments conducted in the past few years and was so considered by
this review. Good pre-assessment preparation in some of the case studies
enabled (i) defining the scope of and setting clear objectives and priorities for
the assessment (including cross-cutting issues and synergies with other
processes); (ii) agreeing on core analytical work to be undertaken (including
­
undertaking or considering existing conflict analysis and data gathering by
using techniques that do not require field presence, such as satellite imagery,
to assess damages in ongoing conflicts); (iii) conducting the necessary
­
consultations to promote national ownership; and (iv) identifying the most
appropriate approach.
   A range of documents (or documented discussions) should normally be
considered and systematically taken into account during the pre-assessment
planning for a PCNA. Conflict analysis, in particular, should be the funda-
mental basis for designing the overall exercise and informing the identifica-
tion of priority areas for the assessment.17 If these resources are not available
they should be commissioned, either in-house or using external expertise.
The review team has found little evidence to suggest that conflict analysis
have been key drivers in assessment processes (Pakistan aside). Rectifying
this lapse in the process should be a core task and help the institutions to
develop clear strategies and approaches for future PCNAs.
   The review team heard concerns on a number of occasions that meeting
requirements to fulfil all of the documentation at the start of an assessment
would make assessment processes more burdensome.18 But this should not be
the case. The key to faster future processes will be not to reinvent the wheel
every time an assessment is considered. In most instances, a wealth of existing
data and analysis is available or could be accessed within and among the Joint
Declaration partners, including conflict analysis, up-to-date awareness of
political developments, and awareness of key actors and national capacities.
However, analytical processes to understand available material have been
overlooked in favor of undertaking work in field. Skipping this step misses a
major opportunity to strategically define assessment scope and objectives,
which would make assessments lighter and more targeted. Existing data

should be processed to develop clear strategic rationale for PCNAs (for exam-
ple, to promote peacebuilding or support reconstruction). It could form a
reconstructed baseline built on existing sources, allowing stakeholders to
address identified gaps and due diligence with national partners to form the
basis of fieldwork. Capitalizing on existing data would be an efficient use of
previously generated knowledge and enable the partners to start developing
the analytical frameworks far before fielding assessment teams. This is a crit-
ical step in ensuring better links among humanitarian, political, security and
development action.
   Clearly understood and presented evidence would enable senior leaders to
engage in strategy discussions at the institutional level and make informed deci-
sions about institutional engagement and better managed processes. At  the
technical level, investing in clarifying the picture upfront will reducing the orga-
nizational burden of fielding large missions. Box 4 explains the key analytical
processes during pre-assessment that are designed to ensure strategic PCNAs
and some of the readily available internal sources of information that could be
exploited to help PCNA teams to understand context and plan effectively.
   Preparatory work was critical in Pakistan to frame and deliver a sensitive
exercise at the national and subnational levels. Extensive community and
stakeholder consultations during the pre-assessment phase informed a con-
flict analysis, which helped to identify the strategic objectives and priorities
for the PCNA, including cross-cutting issues. Without sufficient preparation
and consultation it would have been difficult to reach a consensus within the
national government and among subnational authorities and communities
on sensitive issues in the context of a localized conflict.
   In Republic of Yemen, the pre-assessment period determined that a detailed
nationwide needs assessment approach was unfeasible and enabled the part-
ners to focus on a lighter methodology based on existing data sources, quali-
tative and quantitative methods to describe impacts and trends and map
causal relationships, and rapid assessments to fill information gaps. This
emphasis on doing as much as possible with available resources proved suc-
cessful in delivering against tight deadlines.
   The pre-assessment work in Myanmar helped the partners to understand
the potential scope and limitations for a Joint Peace Needs Assessment at a
delicate point in the peace process in 2013. Based on extensive consultations
with stakeholders in the peace process, the team recommended setting the
model against a clear set of risks to the peace process and identified mitigat-
ing threshold conditions—such as the requirement for consensus among key
actors, ownership, and engagement of government and of armed groups—for
the JPNA process to begin. Ultimately, differences of opinion between the key
actors identified as critical players for the JPNA (the Myanmar Peace Centre,
state and regional government entities, national line ministries, and armed
groups) and lack of ownership by ethnic armed groups related to broader
tensions in the peace negotiations prevented the process from moving for-
ward. The absence of the JPNA, with the high risks identified of doing more
harm than good for the peace negotiations coming quickly to fruition, under-
scores the importance of the pre-assessment process.

2.2 Simplified, Flexible, Adaptable Methodology,
Approach, and Management
Flexible methodologies have been a feature of post-2008 PCNAs. The meth-
odologies include modular and phased assessments and iterative and rapid
assessment processes. Some interlocutors commented that not enough
guidance was available through the PCNA toolbox to help process design and
­
that the methodology outlined in the PCNA guidance was heavy and rigid,
but experiences show a good degree of innovation and adaptability of the
PCNA approach. Most assessment exercises undertaken since 2008 have

24	                          Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
indeed taken the Joint Guidance and adapted it to the context, including
applying tools from the PDNA methodology (for example, in Lebanon,
Myanmar, Ukraine, Republic of Yemen, and ERA).
    Pakistan, Ukraine, and Georgia also had specific, subnational geographical
focuses within the framework of a nationally led peacebuilding and recovery
strategy. The methodology for the Pakistan PCNA enabled a geographic focus
while at the same time addressing nationwide issues. In Ukraine, the assess-
ment focused on the Donbas region while considering the broader implica-
tions of internally displaced populations across the country. The ERA is the
only assessment so far that aimed for a regional focus. It will be important to
draw early lessons from this exercise, given the regional character of some
ongoing conflicts.
    A key lesson, therefore, from these experiences is that the current method-
ology is flexible and is being used accordingly. It is also important to note
that  while it is useful to capture different experiences and propose options
(for example, typologies of PCNAs), the design of a specific assessment pro-
cess is best defined on a case-by-case basis through consultative processes
with national stakeholders, as the examples of Pakistan, Ukraine, and Lebanon
illustrate.
    More than a new set of guidance tools, a more systematic capturing and
sharing of lessons and more accessible information about other useful assess-
ment methodologies and tools were mentioned as being of value to help
institutionalize greater flexibility and enable lighter approaches to PCNAs.
­
(In particular, the PDNA tool for calculating damages and losses to infrastruc-
ture and livelihoods was mentioned.) Several interlocutors specifically
welcomed the application of the damage-and-loss assessment tool in the
­
recent Ukraine exercise as providing a welcomed structure and rigor to eco-
nomic  recovery and infrastructure and services costing, and they suggested
­standardizing the tool for PCNA analysis, as has been the case in PDNA. In the
 view of the review team, a standard approach to costing recovery elements for
 PCNA would increase predictability of outputs and build confidence among
 the ­partners. The partners could also explore whether it is possible to develop
 a standard methodology for costing other key post-conflict needs, such as
 peacebuilding activities or core government capacities.
    The different types of approaches pursued in post-2008 PCNA and other
 joint assessments are summarized in appendix B, figure B.3. An overview of
 the main approaches in provided in box 5.
    Flexibility and different partnership modalities have also been applied to
 the leadership, management, and engagement approaches by the partner
 organizations and have been key to avoiding some of the most common prob-
 lems quoted in relation to PCNAs and mentioned in the previous section and
 throughout this report (for example, the risk of PCNAs becoming inefficient,
 heavy, and at times counterproductive processes).
    The Lebanon JESIA demonstrates that it is possible for one institution to
 lead an assessment based on its comparative advantage, with other partners
 contributing based on their situation and capacities. This can produce highly
 efficient results but requires careful negotiation beforehand to ensure that all

                partners agree to the approach. The UN took a lead of the ERA (partly helped
                by the fact that it was mandated by the UN secretary-general) while working
                in close collaboration with the World Bank and the EU. In Ukraine, a tripar-
                tite management and coordination mechanism seems to have worked and
                took advantage of each institution’s comparative advantage.
                   In recent assessment exercises (Ukraine and Republic of Yemen), institu-
                tions have been assigned overall coordination responsibility for delivering
                sector analysis and report writing. This approach is well received across the
                three institutions and welcomed in particular for reducing some of the coor-
                dination challenges associated with joint leadership arrangements at the
                technical level (such as for writing processes in Pakistan). Learning from the
                Ukraine assessment, it is important for the institutions to think carefully
                about assigning lead roles and to ensure that the right level of technical
                expertise is applied to analytical work to avoid writing and rewriting, which
                can significantly delay deadlines. Experiences shared by interlocutors
                involved with PDNAs or hybrid exercises indicate that this division of labor
                is established practice for other methodologies.
                   Despite some good examples, experiences emerging from case studies and

participation in PCNAs. The Joint Declaration partners would benefit from
­
reaching a clear agreement on options that enable partners to engage fl    ­ exibly,
depending on the context and their own situation and capacity. While equal
commitment to a process was mentioned as critical for the partnership, this
appears to have been interpreted to mean equal participation or representa-
tion in assessments, which is problematic for designing light and nimble exer-
cises and for the EU, in particular, which does not always have available
in-house capacity. As experiences suggest, and the practical reality of the
partner organizations and the context in which PCNAs are undertaken or
considered determines, equal participation by all partners may simply be
neither possible nor desirable.
­
   Regarding the methodology, the 2007 Joint Guidance captured many of the
good practices that emerged from the pre-2008 PCNAs and reappeared dur-
ing this review, in particular the need for flexibility and adaptability. The lim-
ited knowledge of the methodology and what it entails among key stakeholders
in the partnership and in PCNAs, however, suggests that it should be better
communicated within and across institutions and to external partners.
   Interviews conducted and country material analyzed for this review did
not identify major flaws in the key steps of the methodology or tools, and no
interlocutor suggested the need for a substantive review of the methodology.
On the contrary, many informants acknowledged that complex analytical
processes are inherently extensive and require significant planning and
review when involving multiple institutions. The different approaches taken
and outcomes from assessments in the countries reviewed show that the
methodology can be applied differently depending on the context. Apart
from the Georgia JNA, no one process has taken a linear approach to imple-
menting the methodology and not all of the steps have been followed in
every case. Assessment timeframes have ranged between two months
(Lebanon) and 11 months (Pakistan). The Georgia JNA, which seems to be
the most comprehensive assessment process to date, was completed in three
months, between August  2008 and October 2008.19 This suggests that effi-
ciencies will not be found not by cutting back on the methodology and tools,
although streamlining and updating could help, but through addressing the
way processes are approached and handled.


2.3 Synergies and Collaboration
All the joint assessments examined during this review took place in contexts
where other assessments and planning processes were being carried out indi-
vidually or jointly by international partners (multilateral or bilateral) and in
some instances national actors. These include humanitarian assessments, EU
comprehensive approaches, UN strategic assessments and planning in UN
integrated missions and engagement by the PBC, and a range of conflict,
political economy, and risk analyses. There are also traditional development
planning processes and related analytical and assessment work (for example,
Poverty Reduction Strategy Papers, UN Development Assistance Frameworks,

28	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
country strategies) and individual assessments undertaken by agencies to
design their own country strategies, programs, and financing portfolios.
The  New Deal fragility assessment is promoted by the g7+ group as the
country-­  owned and -led exercise to assess fragility, and increasingly partners
are engaging with resilience as a key approach to address situations of vulner-
ability, including in countries where PCNAs have been conducted. PDNAs
have also taken place where PCNAs or similar joint assessments were con-
ducted, and the demand for greater complementarity between the two pro-
cesses is likely to grow, as an increasing number of countries and regions are
likely to be exposed simultaneously to both natural disasters and conflict.
   This review has found little documented evidence to suggest a systematic
effort to bring coherence among different assessment and recovery planning
processes in the case study countries. Nor is greater collaboration across
humanitarian, peace and security, political, and development communi-
ties pursued by or promoted through PCNAs. Interestingly, some ­interlocutors
were surprised that objectives such as streamlining or aligning assessments and
cross-community collaboration should or could be pursued through PCNAs.
   This being said, experiences with PCNAs and PDNA point to a range
of options for enhancing synergies between the two processes, as explained
in box 6.
   In some instances, links and synergies were promoted through individually
driven engagement, built on preexisting coordination mechanisms or were
enabled by the high profile of a crisis and the related political drive of
stakeholders to work together. Strong government leadership and ownership
­
of the process may also be a factor that favors synergies. Some good practice
examples on promoting greater synergies include the following:

••   Georgia: An integrated assessment approach in Georgia promoted links
     between humanitarian and recovery or development planning processes.
     The JNA was undertaken at the same time as the revision of the
     Humanitarian Flash Appeal, allowing each process to complement the
     other and creation of an integrated JNA budget that gave donors the full
     picture of the required financing for humanitarian, recovery, and devel-
     opment activities. Several activities were undertaken bilaterally prior to
     the deployment of the JNA, including an economic mission by the World
     Bank (in conjunction with the International Monetary Fund) and a dam-
     age assessment, which included satellite imagery by the European
     Commission. A dynamic process between the JNA partners allowed them
     to incorporate the findings of these activities in the JNA and in turn feed
     the JNA process back into their work.
••   Ukraine: There was regular contact between RPA and humanitarian
     actors leading up to the deployment of the RPA team and during the early
     stages of the assessment. However, it remains to be seen whether human-
     itarian interventions will be reflected upon in a future RPA results
     strategy.
••   Lebanon: Regular, senior-level coordination between the JESIA team,
     led  by the World Bank and the UN, including humanitarian actors,

  Box 6  Existing and New Synergies between PCNAs and PDNAs
  Synergies between PCNA and PDNA methodology already exist:
  •	 The PDNA model, which many interlocutors described as well designed and well managed,
      derives from the 2007 PCNA guidelines and mirrors many of its process steps and manage-
      ment mechanisms (albeit, guidance is contemporary). These include the Damage and Loss
      Assessment tool for thematic sectors and a commitment to producing a simple recovery
      framework (the Transitional Results Framework), for example.
  •	 Approaches that borrow from both PCNA and PDNA methodologies have been pursued, for
      instance, in Lebanon, for the ERA, and to an extent in Ukraine. In these cases the PDNA
      approach to assessing sectoral needs, which has been instrumental in establishing predict-
      ability around PDNAs, was useful, which suggests that it could be usefully applied to other
      conflict environments. In Pakistan the PCNA built to a great extent on the experience with
      PDNA, in terms of both methodology and acquired capacities, in particular of national staff.

  The cases studies and the interviews suggest some very practical options to enhance
  complementarity:
  •	 Where the two assessments are not conducted at the same time in a crisis-affected situation
     or when hybrid approaches are not chosen, there is scope for PDNA to borrow qualitative
     assessment methodologies and conflict-sensitive approaches used for PCNA, which can pro-
     vide an in-depth understanding of the underlying causes of fragility and risk factors in coun-
     tries that face sudden onset disasters or multiple stresses (for example, Ebola-affected
     countries). Conflict analysis could also be useful in developing a disaster recovery framework
     in conflict environments to ensure interventions “do no harm” (for example, the 2014 Bosnia
     and Serbia PDNA considered protection issues, usually PCNA territory) or to ensure consid-
     eration of how special groups in a conflict environment have been affected by a disaster.
  •	 Building on the positive examples of Ukraine and the ERA, PCNA could more systematically
     consider using damage and loss assessment tools for the quantitative components of an
     assessment.
  •	 There were several suggestions about how to bridge the divide between “conflict people” and
     “disaster people” and to identify concrete and practical ways to enhance synergies between
     the two processes:
     •	 Promote cross-learning through joint sharing of lessons and best practices
     •	 Provide joint training for staff with experiences in the two approaches
     •	 Hold regular HQ-based interactions between the teams in charge of the two processes
     •	 Systematically deploy mixed teams



      in  a  high-profile crisis situation with strong government leadership
      enabled the building of synergies and complementarity among different
      assessment and planning processes. The JESIA, for example, provided the
      basis for follow-up assessments, including the resilience and humanitar-
      ian assessments, and for planning by the government and the UN around
      displacement and livelihood issues, among others.

  Some interlocutors commented that promoting synergies may also mean
deciding not to undertake a PCNA (for example, if there is a nationally

30	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
owned and led fragility assessment in line with the New Deal approach)
or to undertake a PCNA only when there is a clear added value. Such value
could be, for instance, adding a quantitative and costing element to other
qualitative assessments (for example, conflict analysis, fragility assessments)
or covering new and/or emerging areas of interest that were not covered by
other exercises (such as assessing some economic aspects of a crisis).
   If, as most interlocutors suggested during this review, the key added value
of PCNAs is its ability to provide a unified and coherent assessment and
response in conflict-affected situations, and if the recommendations of this
report for greater, more strategic, and preventive use of joint assessments in
countries most in need are taken forward, it will be even more important to
ensure that PCNA fits with other country-level processes and vice versa, and
when possible it will provide a platform for different efforts to come together.
In addition to some good examples highlighted previously, feedback received
during this review suggests that opportunities exist to push in this direction.
On the UN side, DPKO, PBSO, and Office for the Coordination of
Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) expressed interest in further discussions
about better links between PCNA process and mission, peacebuilding, and
humanitarian planning, respectively. The g7+ secretariat, the key promoter
on behalf of g7+ countries of the New Deal’s country-led fragility assessment,
“one vision and one plan,” also expressed the need to ensure that greater syn-
ergies between PCNAs and similar joint assessment processes and their own
efforts to assess fragility in g7+ countries. It was suggested that this could
include looking at aligning PCNAs and the approach proposed by the New
Deal in g7+ countries, exploring options for combining methodologies or
interoperability between tools.
   On a practical level, and based on experiences examined during this review,
ensuring synergies and coordination with other assessment processes will
depend on good design and management of a joint assessment process, in
particular on a good pre-assessment phase, which should include a mapping
of existing or ongoing assessment.


Finding 3: Ensuring Implementation and Results
PCNAs have had mixed success in producing concrete outcomes, and there is
limited evidence to suggest that they influence individual or cross-system
strategies and funding decisions. In some instances the challenges of sustain-
ing the momentum to implement an often broad range of priorities once the
assessment is over has undermined follow-up. In reality, the context has by
then changed, and implementation can take different forms. PCNA and other
similar joint assessments, for instance, have been used to provide specific
contributions to broader recovery and peacebuilding processes. TRMs may at
times be useful mechanisms and compacts or mutual accountability frame-
works could help bring partners together around the implementation of a
peacebuilding strategy to which a joint assessment contributes. Although the
link between assessment and financing should be considered flexibly, a more
systematic use of existing funding instruments for crisis response could be

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  31
considered in the contexts of PCNA implementation. Partner organizations
could do more to align their own programs and funding to reflect the
outcomes of joint assessments.
­
   Before 2008, the expectation for joint assessments had been to deliver a
coherent and strategic plan for post-conflict interventions managed through
the TRM or similar coordination mechanisms. Historically, results frame-
works have been linked particularly to the need to support national authori-
ties in defining priorities and aligning international assistance (especially in
low-capacity, post-conflict settings) when waiting for a traditional govern-
ment-implemented national plan would be impractical. Results matrices
seem to have been abandoned, for reasons that include their lack of capacity
to prioritize and mobilize adequate funding.
   As mentioned in the Joint Declaration and by most interlocutors inter-
viewed for this review, joint assessment processes should do the following:
••    Provide inputs to national recovery and peacebuilding strategies and
      plans
••    Improve and/or align existing individual or cross-system strategies,
      programs, and funding of international partners
      ­
••    Develop new initiatives and funding to support the implementation of
      the findings of a joint assessment (for example, pool funding)
••    Enhance aid and development effectiveness by promoting better-­
      coordinated and coherent donor engagement in crisis and post-crisis
      contexts, including through joint programming.
   Overall, this review has found limited documented evidence that recent
PCNAs or similar joint assessments have consistently had this level of impact,
although efforts in that direction have been made. The Georgia JNA is the
most comprehensive example, resulting in a funded and monitored recovery
strategy. This, and experiences from the Pakistan PCNA, Lebanon JESIA, and
Republic of Yemen JSEA are summarized in box 7.
   The main shift that could be observed is toward promoting models that
enable conducting assessments and implementation in a phased or iterative way.
The Ukraine RPA, for instance, was designed to enable a rapid assessment
of the most urgent needs and the design of immediate responses, while leaving
the space for a more thorough assessment and the identification of and support
to longer-term reform agenda. In Myanmar the JPNA was conceived as a pro-
gressive exercise that would accompany the progress with the peace process,
making available resources to deliver peace dividends at a time where limited
funding and support were available.
   The impact of assessments on the World Bank, EU, and UN country-­
specific programming has also been difficult to determine. Consultations on
the ongoing Ukraine RPA and the Republic of Yemen JSEA were able to point
to specific influences of assessment on individual institutions but not a com-
prehensive picture of how assessments shape programming and funding. The
review noted that pooled funding mechanisms have been established or are
being considered in most instances where a joint assessment was conducted.20
More details on each case study are provided in box 7.

32	                 Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
Box 7  PCNA Implementation
The Georgia JNA recovery and reconstruction program was strongly supported by donors.
Following a donor conference in October 2008, two progress reports were published (June 2009
and 2010). The development of a macroeconomic framework and identification of external financ-
ing and fiscal needs were undertaken to frame the JNA and create realistic expectations. JPNA
partners also remained in close dialogue with principal donors and bilateral partners to maintain
their support for the outcomes. The reports indicate that the partners and donors were success-
ful in coordinating support to address key issues affecting stability: for example, resettlement
of internally displaced persons, infrastructure restoration, and service delivery. Approximately
50 percent of donor pledges had not materialized by the second progress report. The review has
not seen progress reports relating to phase three of the recovery program (2010–11).

The Lebanon JESIA was designed to provide a rapid analytical framework and findings for social
and economic needs for presentation at the 68th UN General Assembly in September 2013. The
report was followed by the Stabilization Roadmap in October 2013, which identified sequenced
areas, programs, and projects required to mitigate impacts of the Syria crisis as identified in the
JESIA. A Multi-Donor Trust Fund was completed in December 2013, but so far grants received
have been small compared to the needs identified, which has limited the ability of partners to
implement the roadmap.

The Pakistan PCNA produced an extensive, 12-page framework in support of a govern-
ment-owned peacebuilding strategy. Although the review has been unable to obtain a final TRM
and/or progress reports on implementation, it understands that a follow-up PCNA is being
                                                                                   ­ epresents a
planned. Some interlocutors pointed out that the framework is so extensive that it r
compendium of agency-pushed recommendations and not a strategic set of selective interventions.

The Republic of Yemen JSEA was intended to measure the social and economic impact of the cri-
sis in Republic of Yemen and to identify opportunities for alignment between partners in the con-
text of multiple assessment processes under way concurrently, including the Joint UN Framework
to Support the Transition in Republic of Yemen (2012), UN Yemen Humanitarian Response Plan
(2012), and UN Development Assistance Framework 2011–2015). The assessment had the clear
objective to provide inputs (fill gaps) in the nationally led peacebuilding plan. Others saw in
it an opportunity to realign their programs and funding. Following the JSEA, the World Bank
produced an Interim Strategy Paper outlining its engagement priorities in support of Republic of
Yemen, and the EU reported that the assessment underlined that its programming for Republic of
Yemen was “on track.” It was not possible to determine whether the JSEA had any bearing on UN
system programs or processes in Republic of Yemen.

The Ukraine assessment team is aiming to deliver a budgeted results framework, although agen-
cies report difficult negotiations on priorities. The World Bank indicated that it is planning a mid-
term review of its country portfolio following the final RPA and that the document is being used
to inform its Ukraine lending program. Similarly, the EU indicated that project ideas have been
identified by the EU delegation for implementation and may be under development. A key test
of the Ukraine process will be whether a joint action plan is developed between the partners and
coordinated on the ground through the first phase of the assessment.




               Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                              33
   The review notes that there is not a central body for tracking implementa-
tion or progress of implementation, which makes the task of monitoring per-
formance and determining value of the joint approach inherently difficult.
   Across all three institutions, interlocutors lamented the poor track record
in focusing assessments. The inability of the partners to address priority needs
related to the conflict, develop appropriate responses, and translate them into
action (focusing on outcomes instead of sectors) was consistently raised as a
key concern. The major challenge remains being able to focus an assessment
specifically on a core set of issues that are critical to peacebuilding and state-
building rather than on broad, traditional sectors aligned with Millennium
Development Goals. (See appendix C for an overview of the scope and level
of prioritization of joint assessments examined for this review).
   The review team was not able to identify any current example of a process
or mechanism that enables good prioritization in regard to translating find-
ings of an assessment into action. Anecdotally, there is still too much focus
on “who does what” and protecting institutional turf—in spite of the spirit of
cooperation outlined in the Joint Declaration and the specific modalities for
cooperation between the UN and World Bank.21 Interlocutors discussing the
Ukraine exercise, for example, noted that while the phased approach was
entirely relevant, the focus for the phases was ultimately still very broad
and  not entirely reflective of what is achievable given the fragility of the
situation.
   Besides suggesting that prioritization must be based on clear objectives
established at the outset, the review team, based on the evidence provided,
has identified the need for a political-level negotiation rather than a techni-
cal process to establish priorities. Based on best practices suggested by,
for instance, the OECD–Development Assistance Committee (DAC) transi-
tion financing guidance and the New Deal, a compact or mutual account-
ability framework-like mechanism may be an interesting way to approach
the issues of implementation and of prioritizing implementation of the
findings of PCNAs.
­
   Material reviewed and consultations point to an overall fatigue with assess-
ment process as being a key barrier to further collaboration among Joint
Declaration partners beyond assessments. In other words, there seems to be
little energy and time available for complex discussions about further collab-
oration to address needs following assessment processes.
   More attention to financing and availability of resources at the start of
assessment process is required. In line with the current methodology, financ-
ing strategies and availability of resources to support assessments have not
been considered as part of early planning of PCNAs conducted since 2008.
Understanding the budget envelope before starting an assessment would help
the Joint Declaration partners make strategic decisions about the focus of a
joint assessment and approach it with a realistic sense of achievable outcomes
and priorities. To emphasize the point, having a clear understanding of the
macroeconomic environment and availability of resources was critical to the
delivery of the Georgia JNA team’s ability to deliver an assessment and recov-
ery framework within three months. On the Ukraine assessment, the review

34	                 Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
was informed that work on financing did not start until the last day of the
substantive process in December 2014.
   In general, starting difficult negotiations late in any process allows little
time to address complex issues, and it is easy for partners to walk away from
the negotiating table. Specifically for PCNAs, the end of a process is when
the institutions are tired from working with each other. Early thinking and
senior engagement are desirable and even necessary given the potentially
high-risk implications for the partner organizations and for national part-
ners: for example, the risk that recovery and peacebuilding strategies remain
unsupported or that significant changes may be required in the engagement
by partners.
   Several interlocutors raised concerns that focus on financing can distort
the incentives of national and international partners. For example, national
partners may engage with the sole objective of getting funding, or UN agen-
cies may see joint assessments as fund-raising opportunities. Importantly, it
can obscure urgent needs such as technical and advisory support, which
might be equally or more valuable than financing. This is particularly the case
in middle-income contexts, where resources are not the most critical deficit
for the host government. The Libya LCNA and early exercises in Iraq, for
example, overlooked the fact that the government did not require financing
for medium- to long-term reconstruction, but rather needed immediate tech-
nical assistance and limited funds to address urgent priorities, such as focus-
ing immediately on the demobilization of militia in Libya. Some interlocutors
commented that delinking the assessment from funding may lead to more
genuine and effective assessment processes, as it would reduce the engage-
ment of those parties whose main focus is on fund-raising opportunities.
   Finally, the review notes that each partner organization has flexible fund-
ing instruments that could be used strategically to provide catalytic support
and early results in crisis situations, particularly where peacebuilding and
stabilization are immediate priorities: the UN Peacebuilding Fund (PBF),
the World Bank Statebuilding and Peacebuilding Fund, and the EU
Instrument Contributing to Stability and Peace. Since 2008, these funds have
not been applied systematically to bolster joint assessments. They present an
opportunity for the Joint Declaration partners to bring their collective weight
to promote early strategic action following an assessment (and/or to support
the assessment itself) and provide momentum to peacebuilding and recov-
ery efforts while more detailed assessments are carried out or other funding
streams are being mobilized.22

Finding 4: Promoting Nationally Owned and
Inclusive Processes
Partner organizations recognize national ownership and the participation of
a broad range of national actors, in particular nonstate actors, as an important
component of joint assessments in crisis-affected contexts, as reflected in
the  PCNA guidance. Experiences since 2008 present some good examples,
but overall there is little documented best practice in regard to promoting

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  35
national ownership and inclusiveness. In some cases, leadership by national
authorities was the driving factor behind a joint assessment. In others, efforts
were made to engage national actors at different levels throughout the pro-
cess. At times, concerns about the legitimacy of national actors or the urgency
to act made it difficult to ensure full national ownership. Going forward,
greater efforts are required to identify and document best practices to pro-
mote national ownership and the inclusion of a range of actors, including
nonstate actors, from the outset of a joint assessment and to support national
capacities to engage in the PCNA process. Partner institutions need to decide
whether joint assessment processes should be pursued in the absence of
legitimate national authorities and where engaging other national actors is
­
particularly challenging.
   The review team did not visit any of countries where joint assessments have
been conducted and could interact only with a limited number of national
actors involved with PCNAs, which limits the capacity of this review to draw
detailed conclusions on the issue of national ownership. This said, the inter-
views conducted for this review suggest that since 2008 there has been prog-
ress in promoting national ownership and leadership of assessment processes
in line with the institutional commitment to aid and development coopera-
tion effectiveness, including for fragile situations, to PCNA revised guidance.
The Georgia, Lebanon, Pakistan, Ukraine, and Republic of Yemen assess-
ments reportedly had strong national actor engagement in framing and to
different degrees participating in the assessment process. These exercises
delivered nationally owned end products, for example, priority coordination
frameworks in Georgia and Ukraine, contribution to a national planning pro-
cess in Pakistan and Republic of Yemen, and a government roadmap in
Lebanon. Where national ownership and leadership was weaker or could not
be ensured, PCNA processes have unraveled (Libya) or not progressed beyond
the design stage (Myanmar). Lessons in regard to national ownership from
the ERA, the only joint assessment that took place in g7+, New Deal coun-
tries, need to be drawn.
   Overall, although more evidence is required, these experiences suggest that
national ownership and inclusiveness have been pursued in different ways
and at different levels:
••    Ownership at the outset: Most post-2008 joint assessments followed a
      demand by national authorities. This is a key recognized criterion for
      mobilizing the partnership and joint assessment processes. In some
      instances, however, the lack of legitimacy of national authorities made it
      difficult to ensure national ownership, despite and expressed demand,
      such as in Libya. Whether the partnership and joint assessments exercises
      should be mobilized in the absence of a clear demand from a recognized
      authority is an issue that deserves senior-level discussion and agreement.
      Interestingly some commentators, including a representative of a govern-
      ment that undertook a PCNA, suggested the need to interpret national
      ownership flexibly; at times, a government itself may be fine with
      “­commissioning” a joint assessment exercise and engaging at key political

36	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
     moments without needing to be involved throughout the technical
     process.
••   Leadership and engagement by national authorities throughout the pro-
     cess: In Pakistan, government counterparts were associated at the highest
     political level and across the government in the capital and the provinces
     at all stages of the design and implementation process. This enabled
     national ownership and an increase in capacities of local authorities,
     which was key to ensuring follow-up. In Lebanon and Ukraine, high-level
     government engagement, established coordination mechanisms, consul-
     tations with the relevant national counterparts, and the use of national
     capacities delivered what are considered as nationally owned products.
     The proactive use of national experts that formerly held government
     positions were mentioned as ways to ensure good connection with
     national authorities in particularly challenging contexts, such as in the
     Ebola-affected countries.
••   Consultation with national actors, including nonstate actors: Most
     informants consulted during this review highlighted the importance of
     ensuring the inclusion of key national actors, including nonstate actors
     and women, and to conduct broad national and subnational consulta-
     tions. Post-2008 experiences show a mixed record in terms of how inclu-
     sive the processes have been and, in particular, their capacity to engage
     nonstate actors. In Pakistan, the need for extensive consultations with
     communities was identified at the outset as key to the success of the exer-
     cise and included field visits and focused group discussions with multiple
     stakeholders. The design of the Myanmar JPNA had included extensive
     consultations with local communities and nonstate actors as a key ele-
     ment of a modular assessment process and a key priority in the context of
     the ongoing peace process.
  A number of political and operational challenges in adhering to the national
ownership principle were highlighted, including the following:
••   Legitimacy of the government and/or status of national actors (for
     example, nonstate actors), which may make it undesirable or impossible
     ­
     to partner with all or some of them (for example, the transitional
     government in Libya and nonstate groups in Gaza).
     ­
••   Limited access to parts of the country (for example, Ukraine, Myanmar,
     and Ebola-affected countries)
••   Limited capacities of national partners and more pressing priorities,
     such  as dealing with conflict (presence and leadership by international
     partners may be welcome)
••   Highly sensitive political or peace processes (for example, Myanmar)
••   Capacity asymmetries between national and international staffs, which

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  37
    Box 8 summarizes some of the good and challenging experiences in
dealing with national ownership and inclusiveness.
­
    These experiences suggest that there is space for improvement. This review
has seen no documented evidence, for example, of engagements between the
partner organizations and host country counterparts prior to a request letter
being sent to the HQ of one or more of the organizations. Indeed, many inter-
locutors could not point to how and why a PCNA evolved in the first place.
    The key moments to establish national ownership appear to be the
­decision-making time on whether to undertake a joint assessment and during
 the pre-assessment phase. In particular, scoping missions appear to be valu-
 able opportunities to undertake a stakeholder’s assessment and consultations
 with national actors (for example, Myanmar and Ukraine). Pre-assessment
 planning and briefing workshops with national interlocutors on the PCNA
 process and methodology also help foster participation of national actors (for
 example, Georgia, Pakistan, and Ukraine). In-country planning, coordina-
 tion, and management have at times led to effective engagements with national
 counterparts, while externally planned and driven assessments have resulted
 in avoidable oversights and misjudgments, as in the case of Libya, according
 to interlocutors from two of the partner organizations.
    If national ownership is understood as inclusive to all relevant stakeholders
 in the country and in relation to the crisis, several interlocutors pointed out
 the following:
••    National experts, including national civil servants and country-based
      staff of partner organizations, are often underutilized. This is a critical
      issue in high-capacity, middle-income, crisis-affected contexts or in
      contexts with limited presence of international staff.

38	                      Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
••   Complicated management and coordination mechanisms that are
     established for an assessment and run parallel to the existing national
     ­
     mechanisms make it difficult for national partners to engage.
••   It remains politically and operationally difficult to engage with a range of
     nonstate actors, as mentioned earlier.
   In this particular regard, the review found little documented evidence of
proactive effort to integrate available lessons and best practices. The same can
be said about engaging with women leaders and groups, something that can-
not be accomplished by allocating gender expertise to a joint assessment team
or to the management structure.
   In regard to situations where there may be no legitimate or trusted author-
ity or stakeholder to engage with, let alone to own and lead joint assessment
and recovery planning (for example, Libya today), views seem to differ, and
the case studies and interviews did not provide any clear experience or guid-
ance on approaches or best practices in these circumstances. However, they
do suggest that senior leadership within the three institutions should discuss,
as part of the follow-up to this review, whether these kinds of joint approaches
are best suited to environments where legitimacy is challenged in highly con-
tested political environments or where high insecurity impedes access and
limits engagement with national authorities and actors. Decisions should be
taken on a case-by-case basis.

Recommendations
The following recommendations propose ways to address the issues identified
in this report. The option paper that will be prepared at the request of the
review reference group will propose concrete decision-making points for the
senior leadership of the three partner organizations, based on these recom-
mendations. Following such discussions, some of these recommendations
will be taken forward and implemented during phase of this review. Appendix
A of this report proposes further details for each recommendation.



Strengthening the Strategic Role of PCNA and the
Effectiveness of the Partnership
Recommendation 1: Clarify the strategic role of PCNAs should to reflect the
changes in the environment and diverse contribution of PCNAs within
broader recovery and peacebuilding processes. PCNA activities and method-
ology should be better communicated within each institution and to partners.
Partners should also consider strengthening institutional and senior-level
commitment and governance mechanisms, including through a commitment
to standing support capacity within and across partner organizations, build-
ing on existing bodies. This would require the following:
••    Updating the Joint Declaration, including the definition of PCNAs, and
      defining core principles for joint assessments in crisis and post-crisis
      contexts as an annexed amendment
      ­
••    Identifying a light but effective senior-level governance and decision-
      making mechanism to effectively mobilize and use of PCNAs
••    Establishing a dedicated institutional anchor point and effective support
      capacity within each institution to facilitate collaboration among the
      partners (for example, a virtual or physical joint secretariat), including
      responsibility for basic organizational aspects, standard operating proce-
      dures, support for coordinated PCNA implementation, and collection of
      lessons learned.
   Recommendation 2: Identify opportunities for and establish broader
­ artnerships to conduct joint assessments with relevant regional institutions,
p
­
specifically with the League of Arab States, the African Union, regional eco-
nomic commissions, and regional banks (for example, African Development
Bank, Asian Development Bank, and Islamic Development Bank). This could
be achieved through simple and light mechanisms, such as a standard mem-
orandum of understanding (MOU), staff secondment, joint workshops, and
training. Standing MOUs could be established among HQs to facilitate the
fast mobilization of partners, and initiatives that could facilitate effective col-
laboration on PCNAs, such as training, could be considered on an ongoing
basis. However, decisions on what partnership to mobilize should be taken on
a case-by-case basis.

40	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
Ensuring Effective Design, Management, and
Implementation of Joint Assessments
Recommendation 3: Ensure that adequate time and senior capacities are
invested in the pre-assessment as a key step to identify the scope, strategic
objectives, and priorities of an assessment process, as well as the most
­
appropriate methodology and approach, including for implementation and
financing. This would require the following:

••   Ensuring that scoping missions led by senior-level strategic teams are
     ­systematically mobilized
••    Ensuring greater investment in preparatory analytical and consultation
     work (for example, mandatory conflict analysis, analysis of risks, and
     mapping of the financial landscape), including a mapping of other key
     assessment and planning processes (see next recommendation)

  Recommendation 4: Ensure synergies are built at the outset when the
scope, objectives, and methodology and typology for a joint assessment are
defined and are built into management and implementation mechanisms.
This would include the following:

••   Mapping other relevant processes (for example, UN integrated assessment
     and planning processes, PDNAs, and New Deal fragility assessment) in a
     PCNA’s pre-assessment phase and clarifying the specific role and added
     value of a PCNA in relation to these processes
••   Agreeing on management and implementation mechanisms that
     promote synergies and task sharing among different assessment exercises
     ­
     (for example, joint coordination mechanisms, joint teams, and hybrid
     methodologies)
••   Deciding to not conduct a PCNA but to provide capacities to other
     ­
     processes and/or to adapt the scope of a PCNA to fill in gaps in existing
     efforts in order to provide a comprehensive assessment of peacebuilding
     and recovery needs and priorities

  Recommendation 5: Integrate further flexibility in the PCNA methodology
by streamlining the methodology and process and outlining different typolo-
gies for joint assessments—including for implementation and financing—­and
for partnership arrangements. This would require the following:
••   Outlining different typologies for conducting assessments and, for
     implementation, in particular, considering modular or phased and fast
     ­
     assessments in order to enable assessing and responding to immediate
     priorities, planning for longer-term reform needs, and/or filling gaps in
     existing response, for example
••   Considering a range of implementation options: TRMs where useful, com-
     pacts or mutual accountability frameworks, specific inputs into national or
     international recovery and peacebuilding processes, and joint or individual
     institutional responses (for example, realignment of programs, budgets,
     and new initiatives)—ultimately each context requires a specific approach

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  41
••    Considering a range of management and partnership arrangements that
      enable flexible engagement based on the context and capacity of each
      partner
••    Outlining options for financing based on a mapping of the financing
      landscape conducted during the pre-assessment phase, keeping in mind
      that it may not be necessary to establish a linear implementation-funding
      relationship—consider a greater use of existing multi-partner funding
      mechanisms (for example, PBF).
••    Considering an update to the PCNA guidance to reflect changes in the
      operation and institutional environment outlined in this report, further
      simplifying the key steps (core elements and steps) so as to make assess-
      ments lighter and to enable greater adaptation to specific contexts and
      systematically consider lessons emerging from PCNAs.


Promoting Nationally Owned and
Inclusive Processes
Recommendation 6: As part of a revamped partnership agreement, ensure
institutional commitment to systematically promote national ownership of
joint assessment processes from the outset, through processes that are inclu-
sive of key stakeholders, in particular women and nonstate actors, support the
building of capacities to engage with such processes, and involve national
expertise. This would include the following:
••    Ensuring that a key task of senior-level scoping missions is to assess the
      political environment and outline the strategic options for partnership
      with and inclusion of key national stakeholders
••    Documenting more systematically, as part of standard lesson learning,
      experiences with engagement with nonstate actors and in contexts of
      unclear government legitimacy
••    Considering whether the partnership and joint assessment processes are
      best suited for and should be mobilized in contexts with low government
      legitimacy or in the absence of a national counterpart.

Notes
	 1.	 PCNAs were conducted between 2003 and 2006 in the following: Sri Lanka (2003),
      Iraq (2003), Liberia (2004), Haiti (2006) Sudan (2005), Sudan-Darfur (2006), and
      Somalia (2006). After 2007 PCNAs and other types of joint assessment were con-
      ducted in Georgia (2008), Pakistan (2009–10), Kyrgyz Republic (2010), Republic
      of Yemen (2012), and Lebanon (2013). Assessment exercises were initiated
      in Libya (2011), Myanmar (2013), and Zimbabwe (2010). The Ebola Recovery
      Assessment has been just completed in West Africa (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra
      Leone). Still ongoing are assessments in Ukraine (first phase completed, 2014),
      Gaza, Turkmenistan, and Mali.
	2.	A number of joint assessments explored by this review were not PCNAs but
      have been considered because of the joint nature of the exercise and because they
      can provide lessons and guidance on how to improve PCNAs.

      incentive structure, and approach to the partnership and to joint assessments was
      beyond the scope of this review. Also, at the time of the review, the three institu-
      tions were undergoing significant internal changes, which made it difficult for the
      review team to clearly capture some of the internal dynamics and opportunities in
      regard to PCNAs and to the partnership.

 15.	
 	    The PCNA roster is long since outdated. DOCO no longer has the human
      resources to manage the roster or play a significant coordination role in PCNA
      processes. UNDP is now responsible for PCNA coordination for the UN system,
      which is considered problematic by many colleagues because UNDP is a “compet-
      ing agency” within the UN system.

Appendix A

Options to Consider for
Selected Recommendations
This appendix provides further details on some of the recommendations
­
presented in the main body of the report. It reflects concrete suggestions
expressed by informants interviewed during the review, the experiences from
the case studies, and other experiences with multipartner processes that were
shared with or available to the review team: for example, International
Network on Conflict and Fragility (INCAF) and UN joint missions. Not all
the recommendations are further developed here.



Strengthening the Strategic Role of PCNA and
of the Partnership
Recommendation 1: The strategic role of PCNAs should be clarified to
reflect the changes in the environment and the diverse contributions of
PCNAs within broader recovery and peacebuilding processes. It should be
better communicated within each institution and to partners. In addition,
partners should consider strengthening institutional and senior-level
commitment and governance mechanisms, including standing support
capacity, within and across partner organizations at HQ and the country
level, building on existing bodies.
   This may require updating the Joint Declaration and reaffirming the part-
ners’ commitment to mobilize the partnership and PCNAs where and when
most useful and to strengthen mutual commitments. The principles and com-
mitments of the Joint Declaration should be communicated broadly, includ-
ing within the institutions and in countries in crisis and post-crisis situations
where such joint assessment may be a valuable option.
   The strategic role for PCNAs could be redefined as “joint multilateral
approach to providing a combined qualitative, quantitative, costed, and prior-
itized assessment of immediate and longer tem needs and priorities as part of
a recovery and peacebuilding process in (post)-crisis situations.”
   Core principles could be developed to guide partners in decisions (i) about
when to mobilize the partnership around a PCNA and when this may not be
advisable (criteria and triggers), and (ii) on the need for systematic coordina-
tion and cooperation with the political and security agencies and approaches
(for example, with UN DPA, PBC, PBSO, DPKO, and the EU) and with other
institutional capacities, on peacebuilding and gender, for example. Basic stan-
dards to guide each institution’s commitment to mobilize adequate capacity
and support could also be set.



Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                   45
    Options for a more effective governance mechanism could include (i) using
existing or planning for regular meetings of senior leadership by the three
organizations, ensuring dedicated discussions on PCNAs; (ii) establishing a
Joint Declaration Steering Committee made of the UN Senior Peacebuilding
Group, of which the World Bank is a member, and the relevant EU represen-
tation; and (iii) enhancing the role of the existing PCNA Advisory Group,
providing it with decision making capacity. A mirror mechanism that brings
together the senior country leadership of the three organizations could be
established if it is not already in place in countries where joint assessments
are  conducted. Improved governance and decision-making mechanisms
would have the responsibility to promote greater engagement from across
the  ­ partnership, in particular from political, security, peacebuilding, and
gender-focused agencies in UN (for example, DPA, DPKO, PBC, PBSO, and
­
UNWOMEN), the EU, and the humanitarian community. (An example of a
governance mechanism can be seen in appendix B, figure B.2.)
    In addition, ownership and senior-level engagement and decision making
should be clarified and strengthened within each organization, and concrete
options to further institutionalize PCNAs as part the core business of each
institution could be considered. This will require more substantive consulta-
tions among and within each institution in a follow-up phase to this review.
    A simple but clear protocol for internal decision making and record keep-
ing should be established or revitalized and updated, building on existing
practices and experiences.
    It is necessary, if the joint commitment is renewed, to dedicate the right
type of support and capacities to the joint approach. Without this, a signifi-
cant burden and a degree of improvisation will continue, and it will be diffi-
cult to build on the added value of the partnership.
    In addition to clear institutional anchors, a physical or virtual secretariat
capacity could be hosted in one of the partner organizations, staffed with rep-
resentatives from the three partners (in the case of the physical secretariat)
and funded by existing trust funds. Close links to the Global Facility for
Disaster Risk Reduction could be explored, building on each other’s compar-
ative advantages, if this could help promote collaboration across the two
­communities of practice. This is something that many interlocutors suggested
 would be mutually beneficial.
    In regard to capacity building and training to support PCNAs, the follow-
 ing options, or combinations of them, were suggested: (i) basic training on
 the strategic aspects of the partnership and joint assessment to be included in
 regular trainings for staff operating in crisis situations, in particular in senior-
 level standard briefings (for example, UN RC/HC, UNDP resident represen-
 tatives, country directors, head of delegations, and HQ-based senior staff);
 (ii) in-country extensive briefing with international and national staff and
 targeted training of teams undertaking PCNAs; and (iii) HQ-based periodic
 training of key staff that may be deployed as part of a roaster system.
    Information on PCNAs and lessons learned should be disseminated proac-
 tively using existing forums (for example, the World Bank Fragility Forum,
 the OECD-DAC INCAF, and the EU Development days, among others).

46	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
Ensuring Effective Design and Management of
Joint Assessments
Recommendation 2: Ensure that adequate time and senior capacities are
invested in the pre-assessment as a key step in identifying the scope, stra-
tegic objectives, and priorities of an assessment process, as well as the most
appropriate methodology and approach, including for implementation
and financing.
  Investing effort, resources, and time, in particular senior staff time in HQ
and country offices in the pre-assessment phase, should be a core commit-
ment for engaging with a joint assessment processes. The pre-assessment
phase should focus on the following:

••   Extensive consultations should be held at HQ and in-country offices and
     field missions and with national authorities and key actors, including
     representatives of women’s groups and nonstate actors.
     ­
••   The pre-assessment analysis (for example, gathering existing analysis and
     additional data through remote techniques and available sources) should
     consider, in addition to the mandatory conflict analysis, (contextual) risk
     assessments, and provisions to undertake such an exercise should be
     identified at this stage.
••   Strategic objectives and priorities should be identified, including
     cross-cutting issues and key peacebuilding priorities (for example, politi-
     cal settlements, security and justice, and the other peacebuilding and
     statebuilding goals).
••   The most appropriate assessment methodology and approach should be
     designed, taking care of ensuring synergies with other processes (for
     example, PDNA, humanitarian, New Deal fragility assessments and
     ­
     compacts, and resilience).
••   The management structure should be designed with clear leadership role
     and partnership arrangements.
   Needed resources and capacities and clear arrangements to make them
available should also be identified at this stage.
   To the extent possible, pre-assessment work should take place at the coun-
try level or through scoping missions led by a senior-level strategic team.
A concept note from that exercise should be a political document rather than
an extensive technical paper, outlining the scope and strategic objectives,
typology leadership and management arrangements, and, most important,
the role of national actors.
   Recommendation 3: Synergies should be built at the very outset when
the scope, objectives, and methodology and typology for a joint assess-
ment are defined and should be built into management and implementa-
tion mechanisms.
   Creating greater synergies with other processes may include mapping
what other processes are ongoing—in a given context and globally—and
seeing which are complementary of PCNAs. This would also include
clarifying the specific role of a PCNA in relation to another process
­

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                  47
(for example, a New Deal fragility assessment) and vice versa; agreeing on
specific mechanisms to promote complementarity of different assessment
exercises jointly (for example, coordination team to promote a PCNA,
PDNA, humanitarian, or resilience assessment conducted in the same
country); and agreeing on sharing tasks among different processes. At
times a decision to not conduct a PCNA, but to provide capacities to other
processes, should be promoted as the best way to promote synergies at the
country level. Partners should commit to streamlining their individual
assessment processes as another way to reduce the number of assessments
and promote greater synergies.
  The following scenarios to promote complementary and synergies could be
considered and could also be considered as part of broader PCNA criteria
mentioned in recommendation 1:
••    Existing or ongoing assessment and planning processes, particularly
      when country-owned and country-led (for example, New Deal fragility
      assessment) or mandated in the context of a UN Security Council resolu-
      tion (for example, integrated mission context) are addressing the key pri-
      orities and needs identified in a given context. In this case, a decision is
      taken not to conduct a PCNA.
••    Other processes exist or are ongoing but they do not provide compre-
      hensive information and there is need to complement them and bring
      the information together into one coherent joint assessment and plan-
      ning processes. This could occur as part of a peace process (such as in
      the case of Myanmar) or in view of a donor conference (for example,
      concerning humanitarian, resilience, a New Deal fragility assessment
      might identify a range of priorities but not include an assessment and
      costing of physical damage due to a conflict). In this case, synergies are
      proactively identified and a PCNA is designed specifically to comple-
      ment existing information and data gaps (for example, in Republic of
      Yemen and Pakistan).
••    No solid joint assessment is available, and national and international
      partners agree on the need to conduct a joint assessment. In this case, a
      sequenced PCNA is designed to bring in all key partners (for example,
      UN political bodies) and clearly outline who contributes to what (for
      example, this could transpire in Central African Republic or Syria in the
      future).
••    A new crisis breaks out in a context where there may already be a natural
      disaster, and a PCNA and PDNA must be initiated at the same time. In
      this case, the two processes are designed and conducted through joint
      leadership, management, and coordination mechanisms that includes the
      role of national authorities.
••    It is worth reiterating one more time that when there is a nationally led
      process, like a New Deal fragility assessment, this must become the
      ground for joint assessment and planning, and any additional support by
      the international community must align to the national process



48	                   Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
  In regard to the key steps to follow to promote greater synergies and
collaboration, the following should be considered:
­

••   Create synergies at decision-making points, where possible, under national
     leadership. A renewed Joint Declaration and a strengthened senior-level
     decision-making structure should make clear the commitment to pro-
     moting collaboration across communities and synergies between the
     range of joint assessments in crisis and post-crisis contexts. To enable
     effective decisions and guidance, the information in regard to existing,
     ongoing, and planned assessment and planning processes by national or
     international partners should be gathered and considered at the time of
     decision making on whether to conduct a PCNA and what kind of exer-
     cise is needed. Senior-level leadership will be also required to ensure that
     partner organizations do not pursue individual assessment and planning,
     once a decision to conduct a joint assessment is taken. Where and when
     national partners are in a position to lead in promoting collaboration and
     synergies, such a role should be promoted and followed.
••   Create synergies through design. Ensure that synergies are embedded in
     the design and management arrangements of a joint assessment, depend-
     ing on which of the above-mentioned or other scenarios are relevant.
     When a fragility assessment or a PDNA is ongoing or planned, for
     instance, a hybrid methodology (Such as a combination of PDNA tools
     and assessment of peacebuilding related goals) as suggested in earlier
     chapters, this should be considered. This work should take place in the
     pre-assessment phase, and continued senior-level engagement through-
     out the processes should also ensure that such synergies are built on
     throughout implementation.
••   Create synergies through effective collaboration among support mechanisms
     and joint teams. The HQ-level mechanism to support joint assessment
     and planning and the system set up at the country level should also have
     as a key responsibility: that of ensuring collaboration across communities
     and synergies among key processes, including by creating mixed teams
     with mixed expertise (for example, Disaster Risk Reduction, humanitar-
     ian, peace-building, and gender expertise) and institutional affiliation.
     It  should be noted that at times it may be useful to bring in similar
     expertise from different organizations to build the partnership; however,
     ­
     overall this is not efficient, although it may create opportunities for
     collaboration in some instances.
     ­

   Recommendation 4: Integrate further flexibility in the PCNA methodol-
ogy by streamlining the methodology and outlining different typologies
for joint assessments, including for implementation, financing, and
­partnership arrangements.
   In regard to typologies and approaches, modular, phased, and iterative
 approaches, as suggested by the findings of this review, appear to be useful
 options to consider and further institutionalize. Fast assessments should be



Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                   49
encouraged, as appropriate. A range of options for different typologies based
on the cases examined and the consultations can be found in appendix B,
figure B.3.
   In regard to the thematic focus, the added value of PCNAs seems to rest in
their capacity to combine quantitative and costed assessments of “soft” and
“hard” needs and priorities, which can be well captured by hybrid approaches
that mix methodologies (to be defined on a case-by-case basis).
   Geographical considerations may become more relevant, as the model was
designed for country-based processes, whereas in the future, regional crises
may demand the use of PCNAs and similar processes. There is insufficient
evidence on what works or not in such situations, and it may be useful to draw
some lessons from recent experiences, which may help identify the directions
for further guidance.
   In regard to management and partnership arrangements, and based on
feedback from interlocutors, the following division of labor may be consid-
ered: roles assigned (i) on a thematic basis (for example, social sectors to
the  UN, economic sectors to the World Bank, and political dimensions
to  the EU); (ii) chronologically (for example, the UN intervenes early to
conduct an urgent assessment of needs, the World Bank comes in with a
­
longer-term vision); or (iii) on the basis of other practical considerations
(for example, field presence, availability of funding, or special relationship
with a country).
   Arrangements could include different levels of engagement, depending on
the partners’ capacities and position in the country or in regard to the issues
considered: ) full engagement; (ii) engagement at key moments in the process
(for example, key events, senior-level decisions), and (iii) silent partnership.
The latter could include, for example, providing support and confirming
commitment to the partnership approach, while not engaging with the con-
duct of the process. This model is used by the Nordic donors for their devel-
opment cooperation in conflict-affected and fragile contexts. These types of
arrangements, which should always be agreed at senior, strategic levels and
at  the outset, could greatly contribute to reducing transactional costs and
­
providing opportunities for greater leadership of each process.
   In regard to updating and simplifying the methodology, the following
actions for key core elements are suggested and could inform a revision of the
methodology and guidance:

••    Update definitions of PCNAs and of their strategic role to reflect the
      ­
      current operational and institutional environment (tripartite partnership
      context) and to take account of other key frameworks and processes
      (for example, New Deal and PDNAs).
••    Include an updated decision-making structure, as suggested in this
      report.
••    Outline different typologies for joint assessments and leadership and
      management arrangements, as suggested in this report, with specific
      attention to simplifying proposed arrangements; in particular, include
      guidance on the coordination structure.

50	                  Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
••   Update the section on complementarity and synergies with other
     assessment and planning processes with specific regard to PDNAs, the
     ­
     New Deal, resilience work, and UN-integrated mission frameworks.
••   Include clear reference to using existing and conducting risk assessment
     and mapping (for example, in particular contextual risks, in addition to
     programmatic and institutional risk assessment).
••   Include financial analysis at the outset of PCNA process to enable the
     partners to set realistic expectations for an assessment.
••   Consider developing models, based on emerging practices, and propos-
     ing new approaches for joint assessments with regional scope.
••   Revise the implementation framework and financing strategy components.
••   Further streamline the process from the current 22 steps to fewer core
     steps, to be further developed on a case-by-case basis depending on the
     chosen approach and typology. A graphic overview of the current steps in
     the methodology and an example of simplified methodology is in figure
     B.4 in appendix B.
Regarding implementation modalities and outcomes, the following could be
considered:
••   Reestablish the use of Transitional Results Frameworks (TRFs), possibly
     updating them to enable greater prioritization and flexibility, so they can
     be used in the context of a phased, modular, or incremental PCNA or in
     different geographical contexts, for example. Transitional Results Matrices
     may still be the best tool when an assessment of damage and loss is a
     major component of a PCNA.
••   Consider using a compact or mutual accountability framework. The
     advantage of a compact is that it builds the partnership between national
     and international actors. It provides a space for political dialogue (which
     may be useful when sensitive peacebuilding issues are discussed), an
     agreement on key priorities, a funding commitment linked to the priori-
     ties, and a mutual accountability framework. A compact can take many
     shapes or forms and hence can be flexible and adaptable.
••   Design implementation modalities to provide specific inputs into broader
     recovery and peacebuilding processes at the country level (for example,
     national peacebuilding strategy, UN integrated mission planning, specific
     inputs for major events), enabling a capacity to respond to urgent priori-
     ties (for example, going straight to implementation without the need for
     the additional step of translating findings into a prioritized plan) as well
     as longer term needs.
••   Partners could consider strengthening their commitment to use avail-
     able, flexible funding mechanisms (for example, multi-partner trust
     funds, including the PBF, for instance) for initial, catalytic support.
     Donors could be encouraged to channel the funding that they would oth-
     erwise commit individually following an assessment, or through ad hoc
     mechanisms to such existing instruments. Clearer linkages will need to
     be made between the Joint Declaration engagements and the existing
     funding mechanisms. A clear reference in the Joint Declaration and in the

Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments	                   51
      governance arrangements to utilize flexible funds for catalytic impact and
      to include specific PCNA-related criteria in existing criteria for the mobi-
      lization of such funds could be pursued.
••    In other circumstances there will not be a linear relationship between
      assessment and funding. In these cases the outcomes of a joint assessment
      may be funded partly or entirely through a national budget and loans or
      other funding instruments. A mapping of the funding landscape will be a
      key part of a PCNA processes in order to identify the best financing
      approach.
••    In all circumstances the three institutions should proactively and system-
      atically consider realignment of existing country strategies, programs and
      funding, and/or the development of new initiatives to reflect the finding
      of a joint assessment.



Promoting Nationally Owned and
Inclusive Processes
Recommendation 5: Ensure commitment to systematically promote
national ownership and leadership of joint assessment processes from the
outset, through processes that are inclusive of all key stakeholders, in par-
ticular women and nonstate actors, and support the building of capacities
to engage with such processes and involve national expertise.
   In considering options for and a commitment to ensuring a systematic
engagement with and ownership by national partners, the following should
be considered:
••    National ownership and leadership should be built into the process, start-
      ing from the initial decision making (for example, by establishing a clear
      mechanism for senior-level consultations with national actors) to the
      implementation and follow-up.
••    Transparency and clarity around government requests for PCNA should
      be enhanced. National actors’ motivation for requesting and/or engaging
      or their position on an assessment should be clear and clearly under-
      stood. This will require a clearer protocol for how national and Joint
      Declaration partners engage with each other at country level when
      PCNAs are being discussed as an option for planning for international
      support.
••    In situations where the potential for a joint assessment is identified,
      senior-level scoping missions to assess the political environment and out-
      line the strategic options, in collaboration with national partners where
      and as feasible, should be a key first step in the process to mobilize the
      partnership and a joint assessment process. The mission report should be
      a political document and should become the key input to inform high-
      level decision making in-country and at HQ.
••    A clear commitment to ensuring the inclusion of key stakeholders beyond
      the government, including the establishment of clear and specific leading

52	                   Review of Experiences With Post-Conflict Needs Assessments
     positions for women and taking steps to engage with women’s groups,
     should be embedded into decision making and planning. Models and
     best practices for engaging with nonstate actors should be identified for
     senior-level support (including, for example, a clear authorizing environ-
     ment), which should be ensured to country-level leadership and teams
     engaging with such consultations.
••   Partners should proactively seek to use and support national systems and
     capacities to lead and manage a joint assessment process. At a minimum
     they should seek to engage civil servants, local experts, and local staff of
     the partner organizations in key positions. Fast and targeted capacity sup-
     port mechanisms (for example, technical assistance, secondments, and
     quick training) should be designed as part of the joint assessment
     approach and methodology.
••   Where no legitimate authority is in place (or there is no authority at all)
     and the contested nature of groups involved in a conflict situation make
     consultations difficult, Joint Declaration partners could still consider
     evoking the partnership framework to conduct joint assessments, but it
     should be clear that the assessment would inform internal or cross-agency
     planning in view, possibly, of moving toward some nationally owned
     approach, if and when the situation allows. A decision to undertake a
     joint assessment in these contexts should be considered carefully, justified
     on solid grounds, and documented; a plan to progressively build in
     national ownership as the situation changes should still be considered.
     In  most of these situations, however, it is likely that other types of
     assessment and processes will be preferred (for example, humanitarian
     ­
     assessments or UN Security Council–mandated operations).
