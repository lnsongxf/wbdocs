Facing the prospects of rapid aging and shrinking popula on over the coming decades, Slovakia needs a highly
skilled workforce to help generate the produc vity growth that it needs to fuel its con nued convergence of living
standards with its West European neighbors.

Skilling up the workforce starts with equipping youth with the right cogni ve and socio-emo onal founda on
skills. Interna onal research has iden ﬁed three dimensions of skills that ma er for good employment outcomes
and economic growth: cogni ve skills, such as literacy, numeracy, crea ve and cri cal thinking or problem-solving;
socio-emo onal skills and behavioral traits, such as conscien ousness, grit or openness to experience; and job- or
occupa on-speciﬁc technical skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. Cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills
forma on starts early in a person’s life. Good cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills provide a necessary founda on for
the subsequent acquisi on of technical skills. Put diﬀerently, poor literacy and numeracy skills severely undermine
a person’s ability to beneﬁt from further training and lifelong learning.

Slovakia’s GDP per capita was slightly more than 40 percent of the EU15 average. By 2013, its GDP per capita rose to 74
percent of that average (Figure 2), narrowing the gap between its living standards and those of the EU15, cemen ng
its “Tatra Tiger” moniker in the process. However, looking ahead, its demographic challenge of an aging and shrinking
popula on could prevent that convergence in living standards from con nuing. Slovakia faces a popula on decline of
almost 10 percent between 2010 and 2050 and median ages are expected to increase from 37.2 to 48.2 during the
same years (Figure 3).

Leveraging its human capital will be a key strategy if Slovakia is to sustain the gains made in its living standards.

Overall, policymakers can mi gate the threats to economic growth due to popula on aging and decline.
Recommended policies usually balance quan ty and quality approaches. A quan ty-focused approach centers on
expanding the number of workers through tradi onal means such as increasing the employment rate and encouraging
immigra on. A quality approach requires, among other things, enhancing labor produc vity by raising the skills of the
current and future workforce. Slovakia has signiﬁcant room for improving its employment rate (currently at 65 percent
for the popula on ages 20–64, according to the 2013 Labor Force Survey). Moreover, young Slovaks experience a
slow school-to-work transi on. According to Eurostat, since 2011, just under 15 percent of 15- to 24-year-olds have
remained idle and are not in employment, educa on, or training (NEET). In addi on to the lost income, poor labor
market outcomes at the beginning of the professional life may have a long-las ng, nega ve impact over long-term
labor market outcomes, limi ng the possibili es of young people (Schmillen and Umkehrer, 2013; Kahn, 2010; Gregg
and Tominey, 2005). As such, skills development will play an important role in harnessing the labor poten al of both
the employed and the idle popula on. This report places the spotlight on Slovakia’s next genera on and explores

Interna onal evidence shows how much the skills of a country’s workforce ma er for economic growth
and shared prosperity. Interna onal evidence suggests that quality of educa on is one of the most important
determinants of long-term economic growth.1 Research has explored student assessment surveys from 1960
onward (Hanushek and Woessmann, 2007 and 2012), es ma ng that a score improvement of 50 points in PISA
would imply an increase of 1 percentage point in the annual growth rate of GDP per capita.2

Both the share of students achieving basic literacy and the share of top-performing students ma er for growth
(Hanushek and Woessmann, 2007; OECD, 2010). A recent OECD (2015) report presents economic returns to
universal basic skills, deﬁned as all students enrolled in secondary schooling and the performance of those
young people currently not in school raised to achieving level 1 skills (420 points) in PISA by 2030. While low-
income countries with lagging educa on systems stand to gain the most, advanced middle-income and high-
income countries can expect a signiﬁcant boost for long-run economic growth (un l 2095) simply by making
their educa on systems deliver be er for the weakest students. The report ﬁnds that on average, high-income
countries could gain a 3.5 percent higher discounted average GDP over the next 80 years if they were to ensure
that all students achieved basic skills, deﬁned as level 1 in PISA. As will be presented in this report, a signiﬁcant
and growing share of Slovak 15-year-olds currently perform below level 1 of PISA. Ensuring universal basic skills in
Slovakia would add 5.4 percent to discounted future GDP.

Ensuring that all have basic cogni ve skills also helps make growth inclusive. Beyond aggregate growth,
educa on improves the living standards of individuals. Individuals who are more educated can acquire even more                                         Source: Bodewig and Badiani-Magnusson (2014)

This report focuses on cogni ve skills and examines evidence from the performance of 15-year-old Slovakian
students on the PISA assessment of mathema cs, reading, science and problem-solving competencies.
Introduced in 2000 by the Organiza on for Economic Co-opera on and Development (OECD), PISA is a worldwide
study of 15-year-old school students’ performance in three diﬀerent disciplines: mathema cs, science, and
reading. PISA 2012 also included a problem-solving assessment. PISA focuses on the competence of students and
their ability to tackle real-life problems in these disciplines. The assessment emphasizes cri cal skills for personal
and professional development. The objec ve of the PISA tes ng is to determine how well students are prepared
to meet some of the challenges of their future lives. A sample ques on from mathema cs illustrates the applied
nature of the PISA tests: “Nick wants to pave the rectangular pa o of his new house. The pa o has length 5.25
meters and width 3.00 meters. He needs 81 bricks per square meter. Calculate how many bricks Nick needs for the
whole pa o”.1 In assessing the performance of 15 year-olds, it captures largely those Slovakian students who are in
any one track in upper-secondary educa on and a small share of students who are s ll in lower-secondary. Since
skills forma on is cumula ve, PISA reﬂects not just competencies acquired in those schools but competencies
acquired even earlier in the educa on system as well. PISA’s scoring system is standardized so that the mean score
for each discipline among OECD countries in the year 2000 is 500 points, with a standard devia on of 100 points.
According to OECD, 40 points in PISA is equivalent to what students learn in one year of schooling.2 Slovakia has
par cipated in PISA rounds since 2003.

Slovakia spent about 4.1 percent of GDP (and 10.4 percent of total government spending) on educa on in
2011. The propor on of Slovakia’s public investment has remained at similar levels since 2004, although it was
marginally lower between 2005 and 2008 (Figure 3). Slovakia’s performance is marginally above what should be
expected given its current level of public expenditure per student and similar to that of neighboring economies.
Nonetheless, some countries with similar levels of investment, like Poland and Latvia, have much higher cogni ve
outcomes (Figure 3).

Snapshot of Slovakia’s performance in PISA
Slovakia’s 15-year-olds performed modestly in PISA 2012. In context, Slovakia’s PISA 2012 scores lagged the OECD
average in all subjects.4 Of the 65 par cipa ng countries, Slovakia ranked 34th in math, 40th in science, and 43rd
in reading. The diﬀerence between Slovakia and the OECD average is widest in reading and narrowest in math,
with a diﬀeren al of 33 points in reading and 13 points in math. Overall, its 15-year-olds performed worse in PISA
2012 than all peer countries in the Visegrad group and in the Bal c States (Figure 7), sugges ng that the Slovak
educa on community is failing to provide students with adequate skills for their future.

In addi on to the decline in aggregate learning outcomes, Slovakia saw an increase in test score inequality.
There has been an increased dispersion in the test score distribu on for the three subjects, sugges ng increasing
inequali es in learning. For instance, while learning outcomes in reading did not decrease much, the dispersion
in scores increased quite a bit. The standard devia on increased from 86 points in 2003 to 101 points in 2012.
This makes the reading test score distribu on quite unequal. The dispersion in test scores also increased for
mathema cs, although much less than it did for reading, from 90 to 98 points between 2003 and 2012. Inequality
for science only marginally increased, remaining broadly at similar levels as in 2003 (the standard devia on was 95
points in 2003 and 98 points in 2012) (Figure 10).

Performance in PISA and student background
Substan al dispari es in cogni ve skills emerge between students from rich and poor households. PISA allows
researchers to assess equity in educa on systems and its rela on to socioeconomic status, because it collects in-
forma on on performance and student background characteris cs (Box 2). Two measures are used in this report to
examine equity in educa on: (i) How much of the varia on in outcomes can be explained by socioeconomic status
and (ii) how much of the inequality in scores can be a ributed to ESCS (measured as the PISA score gap between
top and bo om ESCS quin les).8 Figure 12 summarizes the evidence from those two measures. Roughly speaking,
one quarter of Slovakia’s performance variance can be explained by the student ESCS Index, signiﬁcantly more
than for the performance of its regional neighbors (Figure 12, panel A). The diﬀerence in Slovakia’s PISA scores in
reading and math between its top and bo om ESCS quin les is approximately 150 points – the equivalent of al-
most four years of schooling (Figure 12, panel B). This dura on is also equivalent to the length of upper-secondary
educa on in many countries. Both indicators suggest that a student’s household characteris cs dispropor onately
determine cogni ve skill acquisi on.

inequitable school system. The varia on in performance between schools is a measure of how big the “school
eﬀects” are, and they are closely related to how students are allocated or selected into schools. It can be argued
that the lower the between-school variance, the more equitable the educa on system is. Between-school
diﬀerences in mathema cs performance in 2012 accounted for close to 60 percent of the varia on in student
performance in Slovakia. This is signiﬁcantly above the OECD average (see Figure 16) and that of neighboring
countries such as Czech Republic, Germany, and Bulgaria. This reinforces the point that the school that students
a end predicts their learning outcomes (OECD, 2014b).

PISA performance also varies across urban and rural loca ons as well as by regions in Slovakia. First, there is a
clear urban-rural gap in student achievement that has increased over the years (Figure 17, panel A). The urban-
rural gap in Slovakia is among the largest in the region and larger than that in countries such as Slovenia, Latvia,
Romania, and Poland. About 95 percent of students in the PISA 2012 sample who speak Romani at home live in
rural areas; and over 80 percent belong to the bo om quin le (see also Box 3). Second, while in urban areas PISA
mathema cs performance decreased marginally (by less than 10 points) among low achievers and increased for
the top achievers, in rural areas it dropped substan ally for both middle and low achievers (Figure 17, panel B).
Third, performance in 2012 varied signiﬁcantly across Slovak regions (Figure 17, panel C).

but appears to further deepen socioeconomic disadvantage. There are three key messages that emerge from
this analysis. First, performance in PISA varies signiﬁcantly by the student’s socioeconomic background. Second,
performance varies by type of school. Third, 15-year-olds from socioeconomically disadvantaged backgrounds are
dispropor onately represented in voca onal schools and voca onal secondary schools (or indeed are s ll in basic
schools, where aggregate performance is signiﬁcantly lower than that in general secondary schools12). Figure 22
summarizes the above evidence in a single picture showing how students from diﬀerent socioeconomic strata
distribute into diﬀerent educa onal tracks and achieve widely diﬀering levels of cogni ve skills as measured by
PISA.




12 In Slovakia, the 15-year-old group is divided into two diﬀerent grades, 9 and 10, exogenously. This is because the school entrance depends on the month of
birth. The majority of students who were born September onwards are s ll enrolled in basic schools (although students who are repea ng grade enter in this
group too), while those who were born on or before August have already selected between diﬀerent types of schools. Tracking takes place between grades 9
and 10.

with 89 percent of those in the top quin le. About 14 percent of students belonging to the bo om quin le never
a ended preschool, compared with only 2 percent of students in the top quin le. An analysis of determinants of
student achievement does not show preschool educa on as a sta s cally signiﬁcant variable. This can have many
causes, including the possible lack of quality of the preschool services oﬀered when students a ended these
programs during the late 1990s and early 2000s. However, evidence does show that Roma children who completed
ECD are less likely to be enrolled in special schools (by about 7 percent) and are more likely to complete secondary
school and less likely to be on social assistance (World Bank, 2012). Universal preschool educa on for children
aged 3–5 in Slovakia would provide a great opportunity to eﬀec vely narrow the skills gap from the early stages of
children’s lives.
