  •	   Differences in standards among the sending, receiving and transit countries;
  •	   Lack of capacity to modify standard operating procedures to cope with the
       particular demands of emergency situations including massive increases in
       arriving cargo;
  •	   Imposition of taxes, duties, fees and charges including on humanitarian
       consignments;
  •	   Complex and opaque bureaucratic or administrative requirements, which
       sometimes change without notice;
  •	   Excessive documentary requirements and the need for documents to be translated
       before submission;
  •	   The necessity to deal with numerous government entities to obtain necessary
       clearances and exemptions;
  •	   Excessive physical inspections and testing of relief consignments;
  •	   Inflexible working hours of border authorities;
  •	   Delays in receiving information concerning applicable requirements and lack of
       awareness of customs procedures; and
  •	   Burdensome processes for obtaining particular exemptions for humanitarian
       shipments (where such exemptions are possible at all) from applicable measures
