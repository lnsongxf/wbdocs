I. INTRODUCTION
This report summarizes the results of the analytical work on housing market finance carried out
by the World Bank Group at the request of the Ministry of Finance. The purpose of the work was
to inform the policy dialogue about how best to develop a sustainable housing finance market
in Nigeria, and improve the effectiveness of interventions aimed at stimulating the housing
market and providing quality housing to the population. The work was funded by DFID and
carried out over 2013 and 2014.

Experience has shown that an increase in housing production, especially at the lower reaches
of the market, stimulates job creation, both skilled and unskilled; and that housing and other
infrastructure investment is strongly linked to economic growth.1 While the availability of hous-
ing finance is essential for increasing housing production, sustainable and equitable housing
production also depends on (a) access to residential lands and basic services; (b) an efficient
and transparent land administration; (c) legal protections; and (d) a macroeconomic environ-
ment that maintains low inflation and low interest rates. An essential part of making housing
finance work for the poor is the availability of houses at lower prices in the market.

The report summarizes the institutional landscape, policy framework, and public and private
sector actors involved in housing finance, and focuses on the underlying reasons for the lack of
housing finance, particularly for lower-priced houses for the poor. The report also summarizes
issues related to the construction industry and building materials, an understanding of which
is key to developing transformative policies in the sector. Finally, the report proposes possible
new approaches to housing finance in Nigeria, based on international best practices.


A. Methodology
The report is based on the household survey conducted by the National Bureau of Statistics;
the housing finance supply side surveys carried out under the project; review of existing reports;
and extensive consultations with policymakers and stakeholders. The household data provided
some insight into the housing demands in different in income categories and urban areas. How-
ever, there were no data sources that would have allowed the team to estimate these demands
more accurately, or to assess past production of houses in different price categories.

The report draws on previous World Bank reports such as Housing Finance for the Poor and
Mortgage Finance in Nigeria, both by Simon Walley; as well as studies carried out by Oliver
Campbell White (Institutional Framework and Performance); the Affordable Housing Institute
(Opportunities for Housing Microfinance in Nigeria); and Carol S. Rabenhorst (Legal Framework
for Housing Finance in Nigeria), under the leadership of the Michael Wong. The report also
draws on studies carried out for various DFID projects, in particular the Growth Employment
Project.

C. Summary of Findings
The housing market in Nigeria has the potential to generate a higher level of economic value
and be a source of job growth at all skill levels, with the largest immediate benefit to unskilled
labor.

To unleash the housing market, the enabling environment needs to be less costly and opaque,
the financial markets need to provide more long-term lending, and the construction sector
needs to be more efficient in building more standardized, lower-priced homes.

The current policy and institutional framework for the sector aims at providing housing for
lower-income groups, but it is not clear whether this applies to the 95 percent of Nigerians who
are poor or only to the bottom 10 percent. Without clarifying the target groups, including wom-
en, and putting in place policies to address the needs of each group, it will not be possible for
Government agencies to develop targets or measure outcomes related to this objective. For ex-
ample, the level of female home ownership is constrained by high fees and transaction charges.
State governments should consider waiving the fees for women who apply for land certificates,
as well as the charges for extending legal ownership to female family members.

In addition, changes to the land and legal frameworks can help to speed development of the
housing and mortgage sectors. Such changes could include:

     •	 Making broader use of state governors’ power to grant consents to land transactions,
        including sales and mortgages.
     •	 Improving administrative procedures, by reducing the number of steps required to
        register a property; digitizing land registries; introducing electronic payments; and sim-
        plifying the overall process so that an individual is able to register a property without
        the need for a lawyer.
     •	 Lowering the costs of land registration through, e.g., elimination of the consent fee
        and the use of flat fees, where applicable, rather than fees as a percentage of property
        value.

Based on an analysis of the housing survey, home ownership could be extended to more than
50 percent of the population if homes were built for those with an annual income of 340,000
Naira, or about US$2,000. Incremental building, cooperatives, and other forms of housing could
most likely meet the needs of another 25 percent of the market. The construction sector is
currently unable to meet this demand due several weaknesses, such as lack of skills at all levels,
weak organizational capacity, lack of access to finance, and lack of standardization of building
plans and materials.

Furthermore, the mortgage market in Nigeria is unable to provide sustainable long-term loans
to borrowers due to a lack of access to long-term funds. In a survey carried out by the Central
Bank of Nigeria in 2012, financial institutions named this as the number one obstacle prevent-
ing growth of the mortgage market, ahead of foreclosure, housing supply, and the cost of title
registration. Without access to long term funds, lenders are either unwilling or unable to further
extend maturity mismatches on their balance sheets (although the regulatory framework allows
them to do so), or to make the necessary investments in staff and systems to establish large-
scale mortgage lending operations.

In addition to addressing access to long-term housing finance, the Government should support
more innovative approaches, such as housing microfinance products. Some of these are being
piloted by Nigeria’s leading microfinance innovators, who are seeking to expand their product
offerings for different market segments.

II. COUNTRY CONTEXT
1.	   The Federal Republic of Nigeria has experienced stable economic growth, averaging
      8 percent, over the past decade. With the GDP rebasing in April 2014, Nigeria is now
      also the largest economy in Africa. Since 2001, Nigeria‘s non-oil economy has grown by
      more than 8 percent, more than twice the rate of growth over the previous five-year period.
      Telecommunications, real estate, manufacturing, construction, and entertainment played
      a key role in this expansion (Table 1 and Table 2). Agriculture, crude oil and gas, and trade,
      which accounted for 85 percent of GDP in 2012, now contribute only 54 percent. In the con-
      text of high economic growth, Nigeria’s key challenge is to make growth more inclusive, as
      direct indicators of social welfare for the broader population, such as poverty levels, have
      shown little improvement. Furthermore, about 4.5 million Nigerians enter the labor market
      each year, but only 10 percent are able to find formal jobs. As a result, from 2009–2011,
      (formal) unemployment grew from 19.7 to 23.9 percent, and principally affected the young
      (15–24 age group Nigeria’s stability critically depends on accelerating the creation of wage
      jobs.

2.	   With oil accounting for more than 80 percent of imports and 70 percent of consoli-
      dated budgetary revenues, Nigeria faces major macroeconomic risks from the recent
      collapse in oil prices, which has magnified the effects of declining oil output over the past
      few years—declines due in large part to both regulatory uncertainty (e.g., the Petroleum
      Industry Bill) and to oil theft in the Niger Delta. Since 2004, the Government has alleviated
      these risks through the management of a fiscal reserve fund and the pursuit of countercy-
      clical fiscal policy. Nigeria had built up a fiscal reserve of US$22 billion by September 2008,
      and used much of this reserve to insulate the country from the oil price shocks in 2008 and
      2009 related to the global financial crisis. While there was some slippage in countercycli-
      cal fiscal policy in 2010, the Government put Nigeria back on track of fiscal consolidation
      and reserve accumulation in 2011–13. Current oil prices present a new and different kind
      of fiscal challenge, in that oil revenues are not expected to increase in the medium term,
      making it imperative that the Government find significant increases in other sources of
      revenue.

3.	        Inflation has been high in Nigeria, and it has taken several years for macroeconomic
           tightening to have the desired effect. Despite a substantial tightening of macroeco-
           nomic policy in 2011 and 2012, year-on-year inflation (December 2011–December 2012)
           registered at 12 percent in 2012. This reflected a number of nonmonetary factors, including
           partial removal of the fuel subsidy, increases in electricity tariffs, unusually severe flood-
           ing that reduced the supply and transportation of some goods and services, and growing
           security risks in certain parts of the country. Inflationary pressures finally subsided in 2013
           and 2014, and year-on-year inflation has fallen to around 8 percent.

4.	        The Nigerian financial system, which is growing fast and becoming increasingly inte-
           grated into the regional and global financial systems, has the potential to underpin
           growth. As of end–2011, gross financial system assets amounted to the equivalent of 61
           percent of GDP. At the core of the system are banks, followed by pension funds (79 and 12
           percent of total financial system assets, respectively). The Financial Sector Assessment
           Program (FSAP) confirmed that the Nigerian banking system is well capitalized, liquid,
           and profitable. The capital adequacy ratio (CAR) grew from less than 2 percent in 2010
           to an average of 18 percent in June 2012. The non-performing loans (NPL) ratio fell to
           approximately 5 percent of gross loans by end–June 2012, mainly due to the transfer of
           bad assets to the Asset Management Company of Nigeria (AMCON). At end–2011, liquid
           assets were approximately 40 percent of total assets, and demand deposits constituted
           30 percent of total liabilities. Loans and advances were approximately 36 percent of total
           assets. Earnings were relatively low in the first half of 2012, but most banks were profitable
           after recording negative earnings in 2011. By end–June 2012, return on assets (ROA) for the
           industry rose to 1.2 percent, while return on equity (ROE) rose to 8.9 percent.




                                                                                 4
5.	   However, the dominance of the banking sector has done little to improve access to
      long-term financing, which is essential to unlock the housing market. Although the
      consolidation of the banking sector in 2005–06 generated capacity for several Nigerian
      banks to expand internationally and establish subsidiaries, particularly in Africa, bank
      lending is heavily concentrated in the larger corporations and their supplier value chains.
      Moreover, Nigeria faces an enormous long-term financing gap, which is significantly
      hampering its economic growth potential. This gap relates particularly to the financing of
      infrastructure, including housing. In this context, the pace of credit expansion to the pri-
      vate sector has remained modest. Credit to the private sector contracted from 34.6 percent
      of GDP at the end of December 2011 to 30.0 percent in 2013.2

6.	   Housing finance is limited in Nigeria due to an existing maturity mismatch. Nigeria
      has 84 Primary Mortgage Banks (PMBs) and 20 Deposit Money Banks (DMBs). Lending by
      the DMBs for mortgage loans accounts for less than 1 percent of their total assets. Oil and
      gas receives the most lending, representing about 22 percent3 of total credit to the private
      sector. Looking at the whole banking sector, data for the 10 largest banks4 in Nigeria show
      that an average of 84 percent of overall liabilities are short-term customer deposits. The
      remaining funding is primarily equity. Other sources of long-term funds are extremely limit-
      ed, representing on average just 11 percent of the balance sheet.5

7.	   Unlocking the residential housing market through the development of housing
      finance can provide a wide range of income opportunities through the construction
      sector and related industries, as evidenced in Colombia and India. Research from Colom-
      bia indicates that five additional jobs are added for every US$10,000 spent on housing
      construction. In India, 1.5 direct and 8 indirect jobs are created for each housing unit; and
      in South Africa, 5.6 and 2.5 direct and indirect jobs, respectively, are created.6 As a result of
      current urbanization trends Nigeria’s housing demand is expanding rapidly. It is estimated
      that up to 700,000 housing units in different market segments are needed annually to keep
      up with demand. However, current production is below 100,000, resulting in an overall
      accumulated deficit of around 17 million units as of 2013.7 There are also many social ben-
      efits associated with improved housing and home ownership, not least of which is giving
      homeowners a true stake in their community.

III. INSTITUTIONAL FRAMEWORK

A. Housing Policy within the National Development Agenda
8.	   The Transformation Agenda and its implementation plan, Vision 20:2020, reflect the
      Government’s policy objective of providing low-income housing, although income
      segments are not clearly specified. The Transformation Agenda states that:

      (i) “…….the Federal Ministry of Housing will provide Site and Services in all parts of the
      Country in collaboration with States and Local Governments. On their parts, States and
      Local Governments will provide Low Cost Housing units within the range of 100,000 - 200,000
      housing units annually in major cities across the country. Local content such as bricks will be
      encouraged in the construction of housing while all inputs used in delivering housing will be
      obtained from the locality to create jobs and add value.”

       (ii) “Housing is also part of the critical infrastructure to accelerate economic development
      and forms a substantial part of the Gross Domestic Product of most developed countries.
      Nigeria with an estimated population of 150 million, requires at least additional 720,000
      housing units per annum (based on an estimate of 9 dwelling units a year per 1,000 of
      population) not only to replenish decaying housing stock, but also to meet rising demand
      and avert a further housing crisis by 2020. Successive efforts to meet this target have failed
      as housing deficit now stands at over 17 million units in Nigeria. Consequently, at least N60
      trillion is required to provide 17 million housing units at N3.5 million per unit.”

9.	   Vision 20:2020 states that: “…10 million new houses to the national housing stock should
      be added by building an average of 1 million new homes every year…at least 50 percent …
      in the urban centres.” The plan also encourages public-private partnerships (PPPs) in mass
      housing development.

10.	 The importance of the housing sector is also acknowledged in various States’ devel-
     opment programs. For example, the Lagos State Development Plan 2012-2015 states that
     the housing and construction industries provide a large number of jobs, many of which
     are unskilled. “This provides important opportunities to many employable workers who
     might otherwise be unemployed or under-employed. On the other hand, it meets a crucial
     human need for shelter and also engages in many other vital building projects essential
     to good social living in an urban environment. Some of the key Targets for this sector are
     that 100 percent of citizens will have access to homes by the end of the Plan period and
     at least 25 percent of citizenry will own their home.” To help implement this vision, Lagos
     State runs a program called Lagos HOMS (Home Ownership Mortgage Scheme). Based
     on information on the program’s website, the eligibility criteria include: first-time buyer,
     resident in the State, tax registered and taxes fully paid, at least 21 years of age, and able to
     make a 30 percent down payment on the proposed loan. Pre-qualified applicants are then
     selected by a draw.

11.	 Similar housing programs exist in other States; however, a comprehensive assess-
     ment of all programs is not available. State-level housing issues will be addressed in
     another report.

B. Institutions for Housing Delivery
12.	 To implement its ambitious housing agenda, the Government relies on several feder-
     al-level agencies:

   i.	The Ministry of Lands, Housing and Urban Development (FMLHUD) was created in
        20108 to ensure adequate and sustainable housing delivery and improve the living
        environment. FMLHUD is responsible for formulating policy, setting standards for the
        sector, establishing building and safety standards and codes, supporting the efforts of
        State governments to realize national housing goals, and collaborating with relevant
        professional bodies. The National Housing Policy (NHP), published by FMLHUD in 2012,
        states that the role of the Ministry is to “ensure that all Nigerians own or have access to
        decent, safe and sanitary housing in a healthy environment, with infrastructure services
        at affordable cost, and with secure tenure.” To achieve this, the Ministry was given the
        following specific duties:

      •	 implement Government policy on housing and urban development;
      •	 provide and sustain an enabling and conducive environment for home ownership,
         through mortgage financing for all segments of the population (both urban and rural);
         and through the promotion and regulation of the activities of private sector real estate
         developers, housing corporations, and housing cooperatives related to mortgage
         financing;
      •	 promote the modernization, computerization and human resources development of
         land registries throughout the country;
      •	 set standards, regulate, supervise, monitor the development of all categories of build-
         ing materials and housing types for both rural and urban areas in the country;
      •	 collaborate with the Federal Ministry of Industries, the Nigerian Building and Roads
         Research Institute, and the Committee of Bankers in promoting the growth and devel-
         opment of small and medium-scale industries in the building materials sector in all
         parts of the Federation;
      •	 seek bilateral and multilateral assistance for promoting housing and urban
         development;
      •	 improve the regulatory bodies for professions in the building and construction
         industry.

   ii.	 The Standards Organization of Nigeria (SON) is responsible for collaborating,
        through the National Planning Commission,9 with FMLHUD; professional bodies in
        the building professions; research institutes such as the NBBRI and the Raw Materials
        Research and Development Council (RMRDC); the National Office for Technology Acqui-
        sition and Promotion (NOTAP); and regulatory bodies, to:

      •	 set standards, and monitor and approve the quality of building materials and construc-
         tion technology used in the country;
      •	 protect the interests of local building materials manufacturers by ensuring that the
         country does not become a dumping ground for poor quality building materials and
         other components;
      •	 promote the training of skilled manpower for the construction industry; and


8	Frequent changes in the name and mission of the housing ministry underscore the Government’s decades-long
 difficulties in providing a sufficient amount of affordable housing. In 1975, the Federal Ministry of Housing, Urban
 Development and Environment was carved out of the Ministry of Works. In 1978, it was remained the Federal Ministry
 of Works and Survey. Then in 1979, the civilian administration created the much desired Federal Ministry of Housing. In
 2006, it was renamed the Federal Ministr y of Housing and Urban Development; and in 2007, it was named the Federal
 Ministry of Environment, Housing and Urban Development.

iii.	 The Federal Housing Authority (FHA) is a wholly owned Federal Government agency
      supervised by the FMLHUD. It became partially commercialized in accordance with
                                            Decree No. 25 of 1988. The FHA is charged with
                                            (a) the preparation and submission of proposals
                                            for the National Housing Program; (b) making
                                            recommendations to the Government on aspects
                                            of urban and regional planning, transportation,
                                            communication, electric power, sewerage and
                                            water supply development as may be relevant to
                                            the successful execution of approved housing
                                            programs; and (c) and the execution of such
                                            programs. For the Authority to carry out its func-

                                               buildings and other structures;
                                            •	 enter into contracts for the construction,

                                            •	 These functions were further expanded in the
                                               2006 National Housing Policy, which gave
                                               FHA responsibility for:
                                            •	 developing and managing real estate on
                                               a commercial basis in all States of the
                                               Federation and the Federal Capital Territory;

   iv.	 The Federal Mortgage Bank of Nigeria (FMBN) was created under the Federal Mort-
        gage Bank Act (1992) to provide long-term credit funding to mortgage institutions and
        encourage and promote mortgage financing throughout the country. To date, however,
        FMBN has not acted as a mortgage bank that lends to retail lenders. Rather, it acts as
        the body that manages the National Housing Fund (NHF), a compulsory provident
        scheme the proceeds of which can only be lent to retail lenders for their use in financing
        home purchases. These private mortgage institutions (PMIs) disburse subsidized loans
        financed by the NHF, usually combined with their business of making market-based
        loans funded almost entirely by retail deposits. In reality, the assets and finances of
        the NHF are effectively commingled with those of the FMBN, and both operate without
        sufficient transparency or accountability.

The FMBN is the apex mortgage institution in Nigeria, and has a broad mandate to:

     •	 link the capital market with the housing markets;
     •	 encourage the emergence and growth of viable primary mortgage loan originators to
        serve the need for housing finance in Nigeria;
     •	 mobilize domestic and foreign funds into the housing sector;
     •	 collect and administer the NHF in accordance with the provisions of the NHF Act.

Conclusions for Institutional Framework
13.	 The current institutional framework for housing finance concentrates resources at the
     top of the market, which prevents it from effectively financing housing supply at the scale
     and pace of delivery required. The housing policy needs to clearly define the “low income”
     group that it intends to target. This clarification would allow the relevant agencies to
     develop and set measurable outcome targets with respect to the policy objective, and to
     more effectively provide housing subsidies to the specified target group.

14.	 The lower income segments of the housing finance sector is usually local and in-
     formal and based on trust. The activities in this sector are difficult to quantify, as they
     consist mainly of transfers of cash and kind, including donations of land and building
     materials. The informal sector provides the largest share of housing finance in Nigeria, and
     the key to making efficiency gains in housing supply is to better understand this informal
     process.

18.	 The housing deficit has been estimated at up to 17 million units. In Lagos, Ibadan,
     Kano, and Abuja, the need for housing is rising by about 20 percent a year. Current total
     output in the formal housing sector is estimated at no more than 100,000 units. While no
     good data exist, it is clear that the formal sector is only producing a fraction of the total
     number of urban units needed each year. The UN estimates that by 2050, 75 percent of the
     population will be living in cities (Figure 3). This translates into an annual housing re-
     quirement over the coming decades of at least 700,000 units just to keep up with growing
     population and urban migration.

B. The Challenge of Poverty and Inequality
19.	 In spite of huge earnings from oil and an abundance of other natural resources, Nige-
     ria remains largely underdeveloped. The country continues to face a huge infrastructure
     deficit, particularly in power and transportation, and public service delivery is generally
     poor. The 2010 Poverty Assessment12 showed that the national poverty headcount13 de-
     clined from 48.3 percent in 2004 to 46.1 percent in 2010. The comparison between urban
     and rural areas shows that poverty declined faster in rural areas,14 although starting from a
     much higher level. However, given the rapid population growth, the number of individuals
     living in poverty is increasing.

20.	 The general picture seems to be a combination of two geographical patterns—the
     traditional division between North and South, intertwined with a new East-West
     dynamic. Northern States are traditionally poorer and less urbanized, while most import-
     ant economic activities are located in the South. Recent poverty figures seem to show
     that within both North and South, Western States are doing relatively better than Eastern
     States.

13	 These estimates employ the accepted international practice (adult equivalent approach) of weighting children in
 households less than adults due to the fact that children generally consume fewer calories.
14	 It should be noted that the urban-rural breakdown is based on the last available census data from 1991. Thus,
 caution should be used for gaining any inference from this particular breakdown

21.	 The slow pace of poverty reduction despite significant growth in GDP may be due to
     an increase in inequality. The pattern of poverty trends suggests an increase in inequal-
     ity offsetting the poverty-reducing benefits from sustained growth. The most widely used
     inequality indicator, the Gini index, increased from 38 to 41 percent, a jump of 3 points
     (Figure 4).

22.	 Figure 5 shows total expenditure per household and per capita consumption within
     consumption decimals. Yearly household expenditure in Nigeria is estimated at about
     N450,000 (US$3,000), with expenditure in urban areas nearly double that in rural areas.
     These observations are similar for per capita expenditure estimate at N99,000 (US$660)
     yearly, according to the GHS.

C. Housing: Occupancy Status
23.	 The purchasing power and spread of poverty is correlated with the occupancy status
     of different households. The GHS indicates that a majority of Nigerian households
     own their dwelling and that rental housing is prominent in urban areas. More than
     two thirds (66 percent) of households in Nigeria own the house they live in, while about 33
     percent have a different occupancy status; about 14.4 percent live in rent-free houses, and
     17 percent live in rented premises. About one percent live in a property provided by the
     household head’s employer. Owning a house is more common in rural areas (81 percent)
     than in urban areas (44 percent), whereas renting houses and rooms is more common in
     urban areas (35 percent) than in rural areas (4 percent). Living in a rent-free house is rather
     common in both urban and rural areas, at 17 and 13 percent, respectively. On a gender
     basis, 54.3 percent of female-headed households own their property, 29 percent live for
     free in a property with the owner’s authorization, and only 15 percent rent a property. By
     contrast, 68 percent of male-headed households own their property and 17 percent rent
     their dwelling.

24.	 In terms of income distribution, ownership rates increase as total expenditure
     increases. Large numbers of rural households (81 percent) own their housing, but this is
     often ownership of an informal kind, and may be held collectively rather than individually.
     While some farmers rent land, very few rent a home. Table 5 and Figure 6 underline the fact
     that whether rich or poor, most rural dwellers have some kind of access to “ownership.”
     The situation is different in cities, where a higher percentage of households rent.

25.	 International experience indicates that most variations in homeownership in poorer
     cities can be explained in terms of access to cheap or free land. In cities, where land in-
     vasion or clandestine subdivision has been permitted, thousands and even millions have
     taken advantage, pushing up rates of homeownership.16 By contrast, where the authorities
     have been stricter, rates of homeownership tend to be lower.

D. Housing as a Share of Total Expenditure
26.	 Although the ownership rate is relatively high, expenditure on housing is 12 percent of
     household expenditure, ahead of expenditure on health and education. The GHS indicates
     that the share of rent in total household expenditure is fairly constant across regions,
     although households in urban areas spend more in absolute terms on rent than their
     counterparts in rural areas.

27.	 Similarly, house-related expenditures (including rent, water, electricity and repairs) are
     more costly and represent a larger share total consumption in urban than in rural house-
     holds.

E. Conclusion
29.	 Gender: Based on the household survey analysis confirming low levels of female home
     ownership, we can assume that female legal ownership of houses is also low. More affir-
     mation action is needed to increase the number of female-owned houses. For example,
     State governments should consider waiving the registration fees for issuing female-owned
     land certificates, as well as the transaction charges for extending legal ownership to female
     family members.

30.	 Affordable housing: To make the housing market more inclusive, housing construction
     aimed at those with an annual income of at least N340 000 (about US$2000) would extend
     housing to half of all Nigerians. Incremental building, cooperatives and other approach-
     es could most likely meet the needs of another 25 percent of the remaining market. The
     housing microfinance pilot mentioned above will shed further light on how far the market
     can be extended, leaving the remaining income segments for social housing.

V. THE BUSINESS ENABLING
ENVIRONMENT FOR HOUSING
31.	 This section discusses the key constraints to market growth imposed by the sector’s
     legal and operational frameworks. Under the 1978 Land Use Law, there is no private
     ownership of land in Nigeria. The maximum interest a person may hold in land is the right
     of use and occupancy. The statutory right of occupancy of urban land is given to any per-
     son by the governor’s consent and a written certificate of occupancy (C of O). In the World
     Bank’s Doing Business 2015, Nigeria ranked 185 out of 189 in terms of registering property
     because of its long and costly process—up to two years and 20 percent of the value of the
     property, compared to 9.1 percent for Africa, 1.1 percent for Ghana, 4.3 percent for Kenya,
     and 7 percent for India.

32.	 Land reform processes are by nature both social and economic. They reflect wide and
     divergent socioeconomic interests of individuals, families and communities. The ultimate
     goal of land use systems is to ensure sustainable growth and development anchored in
     secure land tenure and effective land titling. Structured reforms will encourage wealth
     creation and the economic empowerment of landowners and homeowners.


A. Ownership of Land in Nigeria
33.	 Prior to 1978, land tenure laws and practices varied across regions. Customary law
     was dominant in southern Nigeria, where allocation and use was controlled by community
     leaders who could vest land in heads of families or other designated community groups
     for their use and disposition. Individual ownership was less common but possible, and the
     common instrument of transfer, the Deed of Conveyance, was accepted as conferring title.
     In northern Nigeria, land was held and administered for the use and common benefit of
     the people, subject to the control and disposition of the local authority, who could grant
     rights of occupancy to groups or individuals. In 1978, the Land Use Act nationalized land,
     placing ownership in the hands of the State governors “in trust”17 for the benefit of all the
     Nigerian people. The Land Use Act created limitations on the rights of ownership and use
     of land. These rights are discussed below.


B. Statutory Right of Occupancy and
Customary Right of Occupancy
34.	 At the time of its passage, the stated purpose of the Land Use Act was to create a uni-
     form land tenure system throughout the country by nationalizing all land. Paragraph
     2(1) confers “control and management” of the land upon the governor of each State in the
     case of urban land, and to the local government in the case of land outside of designated
     urban boundaries.

35.	 As a result, the maximum interest a person may hold in land is the right of use and
     occupancy. Under Paragraph 5(1) of the Act, State Governors may grant statutory rights
     of occupancy of urban land to any person(s), to be evidenced by the governor’s consent
     and a written certificate of occupancy (C of O). They can also collect rent and impose other
     obligations for use of land under such a grant. Local governments may grant customary
     rights of occupancy for non-urban land. Section 9 of the Act empowers the governor to
     issue a Certificate of Occupancy as evidence of the grant of a customary right of occupan-


17	 Paragraph 1 of the Act proclaims that all land is vested in the governor of the respective States where the land is
 located, to be held “in trust and administered for the use and common benefit of all Nigerians in accordance with the
 provisions of this Act.”


                                                          17
      cy. Statutory rights of occupancy must be for a stated period of time, which is not specified
      in the Act. It is common for rights of occupancy to be granted for a period of 99 years, with
      the C of O issued for a period just short of that (often by one day). When rights are trans-
      ferred or assigned to a different party, that party acquires the same C of O, with the transfer
      noted on it, for the balance of the occupancy term left at the time of acquisition.


C. Deemed Grant of Statutory Right of Occupancy
and Customary Right of Occupancy
36.	 Under the Land Use Act, the deemed grant of statutory Right of Occupancy is created
     with respect to land in an urban area vested in any person immediately before the
     commencement of the Act. Where the land is developed, the land shall continue to be
     held by the person in whom it was vested, as if the holder of the land were the holder of a
     statutory right of occupancy issued by the Governor under the Act. Similarly, with respect
     to land not in an urban area which was held or occupied by any person immediately be-
     fore the commencement of the Act, any occupier or holder of such land shall continue to
     be entitled to possession of the land to use for agricultural purposes.

37.	 The Act prohibits the alienation of a statutory Right of Occupancy without the con-
     sent of the Governor. In other words, the holder of a statutory Right of Occupancy must
     obtain the consent of the Governor before alienating or selling interest in land (Section 22);
     otherwise, the transaction is void. Similarly, where the property is subject to a customary
     Right of Occupancy, the consent of the local government is required before land is sold.


D. Registration of Property Rights
38.	 In the absence of specific national legislation regarding land registration, the Land
     Registration Act No. 36 of 1924, a received English Law, remains the principal law
     regulating registration of property rights throughout Nigeria. However, the influence and
     importance of the Law is declining as State and local courts interpret land legislation to
     suit local conditions. Moreover, the land registries of each State, although mandated by
     the Land Registration Act, have their own rules and procedures for registering land instru-
     ments, which differ across the country.


E. Impact of the Land Use Law
39.	 The 1978 Land Use Law was implemented to reduce land conflicts among citizens,
     unify land tenure and land administration procedures, achieve a more equitable distribu-
     tion of and access to land rights for all citizens, and facilitate government control over land
     use and development. However, questions continue to be raised about the achievements
     of this Law.


Cost and Time
40.	 The Land Use Law ended private ownership of land, resulting in increasingly bureau-
     cratic administrative procedures that negatively affect the time and costs of simple
     land transactions. Procedures for property acquisition and title registration of title in
     Nigeria are among the most cumbersome, expensive and lengthy in the world. Costs range
     from 20 percent to as high as 30 percent of the value of the property—two to three times
     as high as the African average, making formal acquisition and titling simply beyond the
     means of most homebuyers.18 In the best case, it takes a minimum of eight to nine months

18	 The six regional studies (not including high-income OECD countries) of the cost of registering property as a


                                                          18
         to complete acquisition and registration of title, and that would be a rare case indeed, as
         the process usually lasts a year or more. The World Bank Group’s Doing Business report for
         2015 ranks Nigeria 185th out of a total of 189 developed and developing countries in the
         category of registering property, indicating that reform of the property registration system
         is lagging behind efforts in other sectors (Table 7). Costs of registration also vary across
         Nigerian States (Table 8).

41.	 In addition to the bottlenecks in registration, in regions where there previously was
     either true ownership or customary ownership of property, disputes over rights to
     acquire land are common and often result in lengthy litigation. Since all land was
     nationalized in 1978 by the Land Use Act, many of the disputes involve whether the orig-
     inal holder of the land was granted continuing rights over the land or was compensated
     adequately for the loss of the land, in accordance with the Act’s provisions. No consents
     are granted for parcels of land involved in ongoing litigation.

42.	 Another outcome of the Land Use Act, directly related to the complex land transac-
     tion procedures, is that it has contributed to the growth of a vibrant informal land
     market. It is estimated that more than 70 percent of land transactions in Nigeria are in the
     informal market.19 These transactions often involve full contractual formalities between
     the parties, but they are informal in the sense that they lack the Certificate of Occupancy
     and the official consent required by law and are unregistered.


Incomplete and Damaged Records
43.	 Another deficiency in the title registration process is that the records are not regard-
     ed as reliable and are far from complete. Therefore, they are not able to serve as legal
     evidence of rights or support effective research of records to identify all interests in a parcel
     of land. The records are substantially incomplete because of the large amount of illegal or
     informal construction upon and occupancy of land that is not registered, particularly in
     urban areas.20 The precise extent of informal land occupancy is unknown, but estimated
     to cover the vast majority of land parcels throughout Nigeria. Informal property cannot be
     legally transferred to another party or used to secure a legal mortgage, substantially di-
     minishing its potential market value and locking it out of a robust, market-based housing
     finance system.

44.	 Registration in most States is done in handwriting, with notations kept in large
     ledgers that record transfers from the government to an individual, and subsequent
     assignments of interests or rights through transfer, mortgage or easement. There
     is no unique property identifier system to ensure that a specific parcel of land cannot be
     confused with any other parcel, or to facilitate research of a chain of title.

 land registration and tenure reform began in the 1980s, titled land became up to 200 percent more valuable than
 comparable non-titled land. “Thailand’s 20 year program to title land,” World Development Report 2005.

F. Land Administration and Registration: Next Steps
45.	 Critics of the Land Use Act say it is the main obstacle to the development of the hous-
     ing and mortgage markets. Many provisions in the Act that make land and mortgage
     transactions time-consuming and expensive can also be subject to inappropriate political
     influence and corruption. Initial efforts are underway to find a way to address these obsta-
     cles. In a key development, on May 7, 2012, the National Assembly called for Memoranda
     on whether the Land Use Act should be removed from the Constitution.

46.	 Although repeal or amendment of the Land Use Act may take many years to accom-
     plish, especially given its political significance, there are provisions in the Act that
     allow States to overcome some of its problems, as long as there is willingness to do so
     among governors and state courts. For example, Lagos State has put in place a series of
     reform-oriented administrative and judicial procedures that can make a substantial differ-
     ence in the growth of the mortgage market.

47.	 To improve registration systems, the Government has funded computerization and
     digitization of records and geographic information systems in the Federal Capital
     Territory and the State of Lagos, and to a lesser extent in several other states, with donor
     assistance. In 2005, the Lagos State Lands Bureau began an ambitious project to improve
     land registration, beginning with upgrading facilities, modernizing operations and making
     information more accessible to customers. These reforms are leading to an increasing
     number of properties being brought into the formal system every year, at lower cost to the
     occupants.

48.	 In addition to improving the physical facilities and staff capacity and computerizing
     the registry, Lagos State has also implemented procedures to lower the cost and shorten
     the time required for registration. Under the new procedures, a Certificate of Occupancy
     on State land should be issued within 21 days of the submission of application and appro-
     priate documentation. The Lands Bureau is also planning to lower the registration fee for
     the purchase of landed property to between 2 and 5 percent of the value of the property.

49.	 More changes can be put in place without changing the existing laws, to begin to
     quickly improve the mortgage market. These include:

     •	 Making broader use of the governors’ power to grant consents to land transactions,
        including sales and mortgages.
     •	 Improving administrative procedures, including reducing the number of steps to reg-
        ister a property, digitalizing land registries, introducing electronic points of payment,
        and simplifying the overall process so that an individual is able to acquire land without
        the need for a lawyer.
     •	 Lowering the cost of land registration by, e.g., eliminating the consent fee and introduc-
        ing flat fees where applicable, rather than fees as a percentage of property value.
     •	 Replicate good practices such as the Lagos fast-track registration procedures and land
        regularization program.

VI. MORTGAGE FRAMEWORK IN NIGERIA

A. Creation of Mortgages under Nigerian Law
50.	 There are three operative laws regulating the creation of legal mortgages in Nigeria:

     •	 The Property and Conveyancing Law Cap 100 Laws of Western Nigeria 1959 (PCL)
        which applies to all states in the old Western and Mid-Western Nigeria; i.e., Oyo, Ogun,
        Osun, Ondo, Ekiti Edo and Delta States. The PCL applies strictly in these states, to the
        exclusion of common law.
     •	 The Conveyancing and Law of Property Act 1881 (CA) is applicable in all other parts
        of the Federation, excluding the PCL States and some parts of Lagos. The parts of
        Lagos covered are those excluded under the Registration of Titles Law.
     •	 The Registration of Titles Law Cap R4 Laws of Lagos State 2004 (RTL) applies
        in a limited number of places in Lagos, including Ikoyi, Ebute-Metta, Victoria Island,
        Surulere and Lagos Island.

B. Conveyancing Laws: Non-Judicial
Foreclosure or Power of Sale
51.	 Two laws confer the power of sale upon a mortgage lender after borrower default,
     so long as the right is included in a clause in the mortgage contract or deed and
     the mortgage is a legal mortgage. These laws are the Conveyancing and Law of Property
     Act of 1881, which operates in the northern and eastern regions of Nigeria and in parts
     of Lagos State, and the Property and Conveyancing Law of 1959, which operates in the
     western region. The power of sale allows the lender to seize and sell the collateral without
     a court order or court supervision if there is a default by the borrower. It is considered an
     advanced, market-oriented procedure designed to improve the efficiency of the mortgage
     market and lower the lenders’ credit risk; however, many countries with mortgage markets
     in the early stages of development do not allow the sale of distressed property through
     this procedure.

52.	 Since lenders in Nigeria routinely retain possession of the C of O as security for a
     mortgage loan, the power of sale should theoretically be a speedy and efficient method of
     dealing with borrower default. However, mortgage lenders in Nigeria are rarely if ever able
     to take advantage of their statutory and contractual right to seize collateral and liquidate it
     by power of sale because mortgages in Nigeria are rarely “legal mortgages” or “mortgages
     by legal charge,” which requires registration of the lender’s mortgage rights in the land
     records for the property used as collateral.


C. Problems and Practical Implications
Arising from the Legal Framework
53.	 While lenders are legally entitled to foreclose on property without a court order pro-
     vided that the property is registered, the widespread practice among mortgage lenders
     in Nigeria is to forego legal registration (perfecting the mortgage), thereby disqualifying
     them from using the power of sale to sell the collateral. Rather than go to the expense and
     trouble of perfecting a mortgage, many banks prefer to have the borrower maintain an ac-
     count in the bank during the term of the loan and to have borrower’s paychecks deposited
     directly into the account, to which the bank has access. However, these procedures are not
     always followed. Bankers sometimes try to protect themselves by estimating the cost of
     perfecting the mortgage at the time the loan is made, and requiring the borrower to keep
     sufficient funds in an escrow account for that purpose. However, lenders have stated that


                                                22
      10-50 percent of their mortgage loans are in some degree of delinquency at any time, and
      those who have not registered their mortgages are unable to foreclose.21

54.	 Furthermore, it often happens that when a property is sold, the C of O is not trans-
     ferred and the land records are not changed to reflect the fact that a new person has
     acquired occupancy rights. Mortgage loans are then made to the new borrower on the
     basis of the old C of O.

55.	 On the rare occasion that a lender takes a borrower to court, during the period of
     the court proceedings—which may last for years—the mortgage debtor has an absolute
     right of redemption at any time. With this right as the ultimate fallback, the debtor has
     no incentive to speed the process and will often delay through frivolous complaints and
     postponements.


D. Foreclosure Issues and Next Steps
56.	 Lengthy and expensive methods of mortgage enforcement, and the failure of lend-
     ers to qualify for right to power of sale, impede the growth of the mortgage market.
     Improved procedures such as standardization of mortgage documentation and proce-
     dures, and increased registration of mortgages, are currently being considered. In addition,
     the State of Lagos has adopted fast track court procedures for mortgage cases under a
     specialized commercial division of the High Court. The fast track procedures have reduced
     the time to resolve a mortgage enforcement case to about 8 months. Similar procedures
     should be adopted in other states to make mortgage enforcement more efficient. Even
     with these changes, however, it is essential that lenders perfect mortgages so they can
     avail themselves of non-judicial procedures.

57.	 The following interventions can be taken to improve contract enforcement and foreclo-
     sure:

      •	 Creation of specialized court division, as stipulated in the Land Use Act, to deal with
         mortgage foreclosure issues;
      •	 Strengthening the capacity of judges and lawyers to manage mortgage caseloads and
         promote strict enforcement of deposit requirements;
      •	 Establishment of licensed foreclosure administrators;
      •	 Strengthening of High Court judicial procedures to make mortgage enforcement
         less expensive and more efficient, and to foster strict compliance with deposit
         requirements;
      •	 Increasing the capacity of lenders to manage mortgage portfolios, stressing (a) the im-
         portance of perfection of title so that power of sale can be used, and (b) diligent record-
         keeping so that good evidence of default is available in case of litigation.
      •	 Enactment of adequate land use regulations.




21	 On the more positive side, bankers stated that 20-30 percent of borrowers in default negotiate a workout with the
 bank. This could mean renegotiating the loan terms, the bank’s forbearing on collection for a short period (e.g., if the
 debtor is between jobs), or the bank’s allowing the debtor to sell the property so it does not appear to be distressed
 and is more likely to bring market value, which benefits both the debtor and the lender.

VII. CONSTRUCTION SECTOR
58.	 The key provider of housing is the construction industry. Dwellings are, essentially, an
     amalgamation of various materials and components assembled on site by the construc-
     tion industry. Unlike most other manufacturing industries, it is mostly not factory-based,
     operating instead on a multitude of sites scattered across the whole country. This chapter
     provides a brief overview of its nature and efficiency, and the supply of the materials and
     components it assembles.


A. Economic Importance of the Construction Sector
59.	 The construction industry has the potential to be as a major source of economic
     growth, development and economic activity.22 It generates employment and offers job
     opportunities to millions of unskilled and semi-skilled workers most in need of econom-
     ic uplift. Because of the predominance of lower-wage workers, the money generated in
     construction tends to be spent close to the site, so that for every dollar in wages, another
     dollar is earned as that money circulates locally. For every job created directly in con-
     struction, it is likely that at least one more is generated, through backward linkages, in the
     industries that supply materials, transportation, sustenance and parts for the construction
     process (Figure 8).

B. The Construction Sector in a Nutshell
60.	 As highlighted by the GDP rebasing exercise, the Nigerian construction industry has
     experienced steady growth over the last decade, with its contribution to growth rising
     from about 1 to 3 percent of GDP. At the same time, however, the national GDP of Nigeria
     experienced much higher growth, and the contribution of the construction industry to GDP
     remained much lower than the African average share of 34 percent.

      The construction sector comprises a small number of large businesses which are
      registered, pay taxes, benefit from government assistance. However, the industry is
      dominated by a myriad of micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMES), which provide
      80-90 percent of jobs, are not registered, do not pay business taxes and rarely employ
      workers other than the proprietor. The industry as a whole has several weaknesses:

      •	   Lack of skills at all levels (technical/managerial/business);
      •	   Poor contract management skills;
      •	   Inadequate marketing skills, ability to price and post qualifying training;
      •	   Weak organizational capacity;
      •	   Poor training in general and inappropriate regional technologies; and
      •	   Lack of training facilities.

C. Organization, Actors, Suppliers,
Contractors and Service Providers

Construction industry
61.	 Formal contractors. As in many Africa countries, many of Nigeria’s formal contractors
     have relationships with international firms or are of foreign origin (a number of Israeli,
     Chinese firms compete with historically dominant firms such as Julius Berger). Most of
     these firms take on large projects such as stadiums, major roads and bridges, but have
     little to do with the housing sector, as—with their capital intensive production methods
     and high overheads—they do not have the cost structure to produce lower cost houses for
     the majority of the population. A few formal contractors work with development compa-
     nies or individual high-income households to build expensive and high-quality dwellings,
     often in gated estates, but these contractors tend to be relatively small and do not take on
     lower-cost projects.

62.	 Informal contractors. Most housing construction in Nigeria is initiated by individuals who
     find and buy the land; negotiate for designs, permissions, builders and infrastructure; and
     then occupy the house once it is finished. This process, which involves a large number
     of people in housing supply, is very inefficient; however, it is considerably more efficient
     than self-help building, which relies on household members building their house using
     their own labor (commonly referred to as “sweat equity”). Furthermore, the construction
     of urban housing for the low-income majority mostly involves building in unauthorized
     (squatter) settlements on land for which the occupants do not have title.

63.	 As a result, small-scale, locally based, informal contractors are the main provid-
     ers of housing in Nigeria and other African countries.23 Using locally sourced materials
     and labor-based technologies, these informal contractors provide very economical and
     efficient building services to the majority of households in Nigeria. They fall outside of the
     industry’s tax and benefits systems and are not able to bid on contracts. Despite this, and
     with no help from official sources, informal contractors and single artisans build almost all
     the housing in Nigerian towns and cities. Much of it is built incrementally, a room or two at
     a time, to match the client’s ability to pay.


Construction Materials Suppliers
64.	 Formal. Suppliers of construction materials include some who manufacture locally, some
     who import goods, and some who manufacture locally from imported materials. Most of
     the building materials on the market have an imported component. For example, clinker is
     imported for manufacturing cement, and aluminum ingots and rolls are imported to man-
     ufacture roofing sheets. Retailers base the pricing of their goods on the manufacturers’
     price, the distance goods are moved, inflation, and very often on shortages in the market.
     Prices increase whenever there is a temporary shortage on the market.

65.	 Informal. Informal traders sell building materials such as bagged cement, cement blocks,
     bricks, metal grilles, stone and aggregate by the roadside. They sell more cheaply than
     established shops, and are willing to negotiate lower prices buying in bulk. Anecdotal
     evidence indicates that most informal sector traders do not keep their stock covered, so it
     may not be in good condition. However, many are now renting or buying dwellings next to
     the road and storing their cement indoors, often in residential properties.

Labor
66.	 Prospective homeowners can obtain construction labor relatively easily. Skilled labor
     is typically engaged by recommendation, while unskilled labor is obtained by word of
     mouth through friends or relatives. Skilled laborers may also engage their own unskilled
     workers. The wages for unskilled labor vary; a lower rate is paid for work with materials
     such as soil and building blocks, and the higher rate paid for (heavier) concrete mixes. In
     most construction projects, workers are paid daily at the close of work. On sites where all
     workers are paid daily rates, the owner or a trusted relative will undertake the supervision.

67.	 Labor costs in Nigeria are not high. At N2,500 or US$16 per day (US$2 per hour) for
     artisans and N1,500 or US$10 per day (US$1.25 per hour) for laborers, labor rates in Nigeria
     appear to be low in comparison with competitor countries (Figure 9). Interviews revealed
     that labor rates are surprising constant throughout Nigeria. Although Lagos has the high-
     est demand for construction, the supply of laborers is also high, keeping wages low. The
     majority of construction workers from other African countries work in Lagos.

68.	 This is a key issue in terms of the pro-poor impact of the construction sector in Nige-
     ria. With a large proportion of construction materials imported (and much of the indige-
     nous production requiring capital-intensive production processes) and fairly high foreign
     ownership of construction companies, the labor market is the critical linkage between the
     construction sector and low-income Nigerians. The strength of this linkage is obviously
     undermined by low wages and poor skill levels, which encourage the use of foreign con-
     struction labor.

Building material
69.	 The cost of construction materials is an important driver of construction costs. Inter-
     views with construction companies and development professionals suggest that building
     materials make up 40 percent to 70 percent of total construction costs in Nigeria, depend-
     ing upon the type, scale and quality of the project. This compares with a more typical
     figure of 40 percent for the construction sector internationally.

70.	 The perception of high cost of building materials in Nigeria is pervasive and makes
     intuitive sense when considering the high import component of materials and the logistic
     costs of moving goods around the country. Figure 10 suggests, however, that other than
     brick prices, building material costs in Nigeria are not significantly higher than in compa-
     rable markets. This result is surprising and requires further investigation. There is some
     evidence that the quality of building supplies in Nigeria is poor, so the quality of supplies
     should be considered in addition to the cost. However, for the very large and vertically
     integrated construction companies which dominate the sector, the relevant indicator is
     the cost of production of their in-house supplies rather than the retail price of building
     supplies.

Construction cost
71.	 Nigerian construction costs are expensive compared with other emerging econo-
     mies (even if one of the lower priced regions, Lagos, is used as a comparator). These
     costs exclude the cost of land, which allows the true costs of the construction sector to be
     compared internationally. This contrast is particularly sharp for low-cost markets such as
     Vietnam. However, even for lower middle-income countries such as China and India, with
     rapidly rising wages and significant construction activity, construction prices are generally
     about twice as high in Nigeria as elsewhere (Figure 11). In short, Nigeria is a high construc-
     tion cost environment where costs, but not quality, are rather similar to those prevailing in
     Europe.

72.	 Other than Nigeria, only the UAE is an outlier on the construction cost analysis. There
     are some similarities between the two construction sectors (both rely largely on imported
     materials and migrant labor). There is evidence of significant recent inflation in construc-
     tion costs in Nigeria. Using the same data series, average costs have risen 20 percent
     between May 2009 and May 2012. (Figure 12).

73.	 There is evidence of significant regional variations in construction costs per m²
     across Nigeria, even when quality of construction is held constant. Construction costs are
     lowest in the South and West of Nigeria and highest in the North and the Delta. Regional
     variation is relatively constant across the quality spectrum (i.e., the cost difference be-
     tween the least expensive and most expensive regions—the South West and Delta, respec-
     tively—is 37 percent across all housing quality types except the most luxurious housing
     (Figure 13).

74.	 Interviews with construction companies and builders’ merchants indicated that con-
     struction costs are lower in the South and West of Nigeria because imported building
     materials (which constitute about 60 percent of total inputs) are mainly brought into the
     country through the port of Lagos. The cost of materials increases with increasing distance
     to the North and East. In addition, several important indigenous sources of construction
     materials are located closer to Lagos than to other regional markets in Nigeria.

VIII. THE FINANCIAL SECTOR AND THE
LACK OF MORTGAGES IN NIGERIA
75.	 Like many African countries, Nigeria has little formal sector finance to offer the ma-
     jority of prospective homeowners. The pattern throughout history has been to establish
     institutions to provide housing finance, ostensibly targeted at ordinary urban Nigerians.
     These initiatives, however, instead turned to the high-income market for safer lending, and
     the majority of urban households remained without any recourse to housing finance.

76.	 The unstable macroeconomic environment does not encourage private sector insti-
     tutions to be involved in housing finance. Banks are understandably risk averse and so
     only lend to the least risky clients—the rich and permanently well-paid. It is a well-known
     feature of Nigerian finance that people do not tend to borrow to build housing; they bor-
     row to do business and then use business profits to build housing.


A. Overview of the Mortgage Market

Size of the market
77.	 The Nigerian mortgage market remains underdeveloped despite its remarkable
     growth over the last decade. From 2006 to 2009, the market grew from N54 billion to
     N226 billion, at an average annual rate of 35 percent (Figure 14). In 2010, due to the bank-
     ing crisis, outstanding mortgage loans experienced a decline of 8 percent, before starting
     to grow again. In 2011, the market was at N224 billion. Despite this rapid increase, access
     to mortgages remains scarce. The ratio of mortgage loans to GDP stands at 0.6 percent.
     This is low for a country with Nigeria’s relatively well-developed financial system.

78.	 Nigeria lags behind its peer countries despite its growing economic and relatively
     developed banking system. Outstanding mortgage loans to GDP ratios in South Africa,
     Ghana, and Senegal, for example, stand respectively at 34, 4, and 2 percent.24 (Figure 15).

Access to housing finance
79.	 The large majority of Nigerians are excluded from access to housing finance. Only 2
     percent25 of households had an outstanding loan from a formal financial institution to pur-
     chase a home in 2011. Housing in general is self-financed by accumulation of equity over a
     long period of time, or financed by friends and relatives.

80.	 Housing finance is largely out of reach because of unfavorable conditions and
     terms of the loans. Loans are denominated in Naira at fixed rates, but with interest rates
     between 17 percent and 22 percent. The maturity varies from 5 years to 15 years. Only the
     subsidized loans obtained through the National Housing Fund scheme have a maturity of
     30 years and an interest rate of 6 percent. The high interest rates are related to the coun-
     try’s inflation rate of about 12 percent, and the high cost of funding for Banks. Risk-free
     Treasury bills paid 13 percent in January 2013, but the rate is expected to fall significantly
     in the next five years.

81.	 Other factors which may contribute to keeping interest rates high are the cost of
     registering liens, and large spreads charged by lenders to protect themselves against
     inflationary pressures. These large spreads indicate that competition is ineffective. Average
     deposit rates stood at 5.93 percent in December 2011. Average and maximum lending
     rates for mortgages stood at 14 and 28 percent, respectively, during the period under
     review, 2009- 2011. Overall, Nigeria has some of the highest real interest rates in the world.
     Several factors explain the size of this spread.

82.	 The concentration of portfolios and deposits in a small group of banks illustrates the
     degree of market power on the supply side. The Nigerian mortgage market is driven by
     7 banks, which together account for 74 percent of the total market. Most of the 97 other
     banks lack the financial capacity to compete with these dominant banks. Establishing
     the Mortgage Refinance Company will reduce barriers to entry and should create more
     competition by creating a level playing field for access to long-term funds. This, in turn,
     should put downward pressure on spreads. In addition, better foreclosure procedures and
     an improved legal environment in general are expected to also reduce operating costs and
     credit risk for lenders. Some studies have found that judicial efficiency substantially affects
     ex-ante spreads and net interest margins.

83.	 It is common for lenders to require personal guarantees as collateral for mortgage
     loans, in addition to the lien. Fifty five out of 76 surveyed lenders require personal
     guarantees for mortgage loans. Personal guarantees are often a second-best choice, since
     lenders have difficulty enforcing their rights in case of default. Personal guarantees are
     provided by family members, friends and cooperatives. The theory is that the creditor will
     be compensated by guarantors, who must then work out an accommodation with the
     debtor. Cooperatives, for example, have proven their effectiveness, since they exhibited
     low default rates. The typical loan to cooperative members is intended for members to buy
     or build homes or buy land. Cooperatives collect savings from their members, and these
     savings serve as collateral in case of default. Given their successful track record, more and
     more lenders have begun expanding lending to them to cooperatives.

84.	 High fees reduce the affordability of mortgage loans. Average fees charged vary
     between 6 and 7 percent of the amount of the loan, and can be as high as 10.75
     percent. The borrower must pay fees in advance, including legal costs (usually about 2
     percent), processing fees (about 1 percent), management fees (about 1.5 percent), and
     taxes, including VAT (about 5 percent). These fees are more burdensome in Nigeria than in
     other countries.


B. Key Challenges
85.	 Access to long-term funds is a major impediment to the growth of mortgage finance
     in Nigeria. A survey of financial institutions carried out by the Central Bank of Nigeria in
     2012 overwhelmingly showed that this was the top obstacle to growth in the mortgage
     market—higher than foreclosure, housing supply and title registration (Figure 16). Without
     access to long-term funds, lenders are either unwilling or unable to further extend matu-
     rity mismatches on their balance sheets, despite being allowed to do so by the regulatory
     framework.26 The lack of access to long-term funds also prevents lenders from making
     the necessary investments in staff and systems to establish large-scale mortgage lending
     operations.

Note: Respondents were asked to rank their top 5 obstacles to market development , however many respondents ranked
several obstacles as number one, so overall frequency is higher than survey participants.

86.	 Development of the mortgage market is also constrained by the shortage of afford-
     able housing. The cheapest house built by a private developer costs about US$31,250 (N
     4.6 million) in Lagos, and US$15,600 (N2.3 million)27 outside of Lagos. A large part of hous-

     ing supply is concentrated in luxury houses that the middle-income population cannot
     afford. The high price of houses mostly derives from the high cost of construction; most
     construction companies and developers have to carry the cost of creating rudimentary
     infrastructure such as sewerage, water, and power, which can add 30 percent of the cost of
     construction.28

87.	 Other challenges include the lack of an appropriate legal and regulatory framework
     for the development of a primary mortgage market.


Why are maturity mismatches an issue?
88.	 A common source is insolvency is illiquidity, which is often preceded by a drop in con-
     fidence brought on by falling profits or bad loans. A drop in confidence in a bank can lead
     savers to withdraw their deposits from the institution; then the bank’s credit lines dry up.
     A classic example is the run on the Northern Rock Bank in the UK during the 2008 financial
     crisis.

89.	 Nigerian banks distinguish between the contractual maturity and the behavioral
     maturity of their deposit base. Essentially, this means that although a large part of the
     deposit base could be legally withdrawn at very short notice, in practice, its “behavior” is
     to stay put and take the form of quasi long-term funds. This so-called “stickiness” of the
     deposit base is especially prevalent when large deposits are held by the public sector,
     which can be more reliable than those held by individuals. Another source of stickiness
     may come from depositors such as SME’s or corporations that maintain a minimum credit
     balance on their transaction accounts. This stickiness can also be enhanced by offering
     bonuses to depositors for maintaining higher balances, or for only making only a certain
     number of withdrawals of a given time period, or by having some short-term contractual
     notice obligations. Many regulators around the world accept some behavioral long-term
     deposit base as part of an institution’s liquidity requirements.

90.	 Figure 17 gives the example of a large Nigerian deposit money bank29 with a substan-
     tial variation in the maturity profile of its deposit base in contractual versus behav-
     ioral terms. A standard tool for understanding liquidity risk is the “liquidity ladder,” which
     categorizes an institution’s assets and liabilities into maturity “buckets” ranging from very
     short-term one-day buckets, up to 7 days, 1 month, 3 month, 6 months, 12 months, and
     beyond. The shorter the maturity, the greater the level of matching expected, as there is
     greater urgency in ensuring funds are available before claims fall due. Although Nigerian
     banks are currently relatively liquid, this reflects their holdings of short-term tradable
     assets, largely government securities. In practice, the holdings are heavily mismatched
     in terms of the maturity profiles on their balance sheets. There is almost no long-term
     funding to match long-term assets, with the vast majority of funding coming in the form of
     deposits. The assumption in Figure 17 is that demand and sight deposits have a maturity
     of between 0 and 30 days, which is a conservative approach.

91.	 Figure 18 provides a full maturity breakdown for a typical large Nigerian deposit
     money bank. Reporting would typically be done using behavioral maturity, so the analysis
     has been adapted to show contractual maturity of deposits. It is clear that a mismatch
     of more than N800 billion, or a third of the balance sheet, exists in the 1-5 year bucket.
     Beyond 5 years, the bank’s equity provides some comfort, although it may not be very
     economical to use equity to fund lending activities.

92.	 Looking at the whole banking sector, data for the 10 largest banks30 in Nigeria show
     that overall liabilities are, on average, consist largely (84 percent) of short-term
     customer deposits. Other sources of long-term funds are extremely limited, representing
     on average just 11 percent of the balance sheet. The remainder of funding is equity, for the
     most part.




29	 Data were obtained from the bank’s annual reports and are fully available in the public domain. Full sectoral data
 on this basis are not available, and situation will differ across institutions, depending on their funding sources and
 strategy. However, overall mismatch analysis would still apply to a large degree across all mortgage lenders, given the
 lack of alternative long-term sources of funding.

93.	 Current regulations applying to both Deposit Money Banks and primary mortgage
     banks focus on ensuring that the short-term liquidity position is covered. The require-
     ment is that 30 percent of deposit liabilities are held as liquid assets. This means investing
     in government securities or holding funds as cash or short-term placements. Given that
     financial markets are still developing, there are limited options in terms of types of liquid
     assets. This requirement provides a lot of strength to the system, but ignores larger, more
     structural issues in the funding makeup of the Nigerian banking system. The regulatory
     rules which have been applied in the UK, for instance, have a clear limit on the amount of
     maturity transformation in which banks can engage, where mismatches in each of the time
     buckets are capped to a certain level and there is also a limit in terms of using short-terms
     funds for long-term funding set at 15 percent.

     are adopted. Basel III strengthens the liquidity framework by developing two minimum
     standards for funding and liquidity, initially published in 2010:

          significant stress scenario lasting for a month. The stock of HQLA must be equal to or
          greater than the expected net cash outflows over a 30-day stress scenario.
       •	 Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR), to promote resilience over a longer time horizon
          (one year) by creating additional incentives for banks to fund their business with more
          stable sources of funding on an ongoing basis. Thus, the amount of available stable
          funding must be greater than the required stable funding. These amounts are deter-
          mined using weighting factors designed to reflect the stability of the funding and the
          duration of the assets.

95.	 Basel II and Basel III set out several further best practice recommendations. “Liquid-
     ity monitoring tools” should be developed together with the LCR and the NFSR ratios,
     to ensure a stable and prudent liquidity management. Specifically, three analyses are
     recommended:

       •	 Contractual maturity mismatch: Cash flows from on and off-balance sheet items must
          be assigned to defined time bands based on their maturity.
       •	 Concentration of funding, in terms of counterparties, products/instruments, and
          currency.
       •	 Available unencumbered assets must be marketable as collateral in secondary markets
          and eligible for the central bank’s standing facilities.

C. Role of Mortgage Liquidity Facility in
Bridging Maturity Mismatch
96.	 The Nigeria Mortgage Refinance Company (MRC) is a type of institution known as a
     mortgage liquidity facility (MLF). These facilities serve as a source of liquidity and
     long-term funds, allowing lending institutions to present illiquid mortgage assets for
     refinancing and receive cash in return; i.e., to transform an illiquid asset on their balance
     sheet into a liquid one. This is a key benefit for lenders that rely on deposits as their main
     funding source, as it allows them to use an MLF as part of their asset/liability management
     process. The second benefit of MLFs is that they provide long-term nature, typically 5-7
     years, matching the typical duration of an amortizing mortgage loan (Figure 19).

97.	 The role that MLFs can play in linking the capital market with housing finance can be
     summarized as follows:

      •	 The provision of secure long-term funding at attractive rates. Lowering the cost
         of funds, which can lead to a lowering of mortgage rates, improves affordability and
         extends the range of potential borrowers.
      •	 For large commercial banks, MLFs can be lender-of-first-resort to provide short-
         term liquidity. Large banks are able to raise their own bond financing, but still need a
         liquidity management tool which allows them to convert assets on their balance sheet
         (marketable bonds are loan portfolios) into cash at relatively short notice.
      •	 MLFs can help build up a safety net for lenders and borrowers in emerging markets,
         where volatile interest rates and inflation can dampen confidence. The availability of
         long- term fixed rates can help provide a degree of certainty to help the markets devel-
         op with confidence.



                                                              37
     •	 By acting as a central refinancing platform, MLFs are able to act as a force for
        standardization in the market, pushing primary mortgage lenders (PMLs) to adhere to
        best practice. MLFs are able to set criteria for the types of loans they will refinance, with
        standardized documentation, underwriting processes and risk characteristics.

98.	 As an MLF, Nigeria’s MRC has the potential to (a) establish itself as a low-risk, efficient
     market intermediary linking capital markets to the housing market; and (b) act as a market
     catalyst for other reforms such as market standardization. Once established, MRC will fulfill
     two key roles in the financial system:

     •	 It will provide mortgage lenders with access to medium/long-term funding, allowing
        them to match the weighted maturity of the mortgage assets they are originating;
     •	 It will provide a liquidity window that allows mortgage lenders to trade mortgages
        loans, which are otherwise relatively illiquid, into cash.

99.	 Fulfilling these roles will help the Government achieve its objective of a mortgage
     market in excess of 200,000 loans outstanding during the project period. Financial
     modeling has been used to help determine what is needed in terms of funding and growth
     levels to meet this target. The target does imply a 30 percent growth in the mortgage
     market over the period, and would mean a significant increase in capacity in the industry
     to handle additional lending volumes. MRC would also have to grow at a significant pace,
     building up its balance sheet at a compound growth rate of 60 percent over the project
     period. While the mortgage market and MRC are starting from low and zero bases, respec-
     tively, these assumptions are challenging but feasible.

100.	In addition, MRC will play the role of providing a deep and liquid supply of corporate
     bonds to the market for institutional investors. These bonds are expected to be treated
     as eligible liquid assets by the central bank, and will therefore offer a better return to banks
     than they can currently obtain from government securities. The bonds will also provide
     an alternative investment option for pension fund administrators and other institutional
     investors.

101.	Growth in the mortgage market will especially impact the primary mortgage banks,
     but deposit money banks will also need extra resources. Based on the expected
     growth in the mortgage market from N300 billion to N1.1 trillion over the project period,
     there will be a clear need for additional funding resources to prevent a further deepening
     in the maturity mismatch. As a proportion of total lending, the growth in the mortgage
     market would represent a relatively modest 11 percent rise in the loan portfolio of the
     top 10 banks. In practice, this growth would also be spread across the primary mortgage
     banks. However the long-term nature of the lending will cause further imbalances on the
     balance sheets of the deposit money banks; and many of the primary mortgage banks
     without access to large deposit bases will simply be unable to expand at that pace.


D. Mortgage Affordability
102.	This section discusses the enormity of the problem of improving housing access,
     and what can be achieved through reductions in interest rates and extensions in loan
     maturities. At present, interest rates are around 20 percent a year, with loan maturities of
     around 10 years. This means that only 7 percent of the urban population can currently
     afford a mortgage loan for a basic N2 million loan (US$13,000) to purchase an N2.4 million
     (US$15,000) property. This implies that 93 percent of the urban population is currently ex-
     cluded from the formal housing market. The situation in rural areas is even more restrict-
     ed, as incomes are much lower.

103.	Affordability is affected by three parameters within the scope of housing policy—loan
     maturity, interest rate, and cost of housing. The other variable, income of the borrower, is


                                                 38
      beyond the scope of this project. All three parameters can be affected by multiple factors.
      Even marginal changes in any factor can help lead to shifts along the affordability matrix
      towards the top right-hand side (Table 10).

Sources: Nigeria Household Expenditure Survey 2010, WB calculations.
Assumptions: (i) Loan payments do not exceed 40 percent of household income; (ii) regular amortizing loan; (iii) based on
mortgage payments only, excluding cost of deposit or transaction costs.

104.	Housing Affordability Parameter 1 – Interest Rate. The interest rate on a mortgage loan
     consists of several elements: (a) the overall cost of funding, (b) administrative costs for
     loan servicing and underwriting, (c) costs associated with credit risk, and (d) a spread to
     allow for a return on capital.

      •	 Overall cost of funding is typically the largest cost. This is in part determined by the
         benchmark cost of funds as set by the yield curve, based on government debt issuance.
      •	 Administrative costs are the second largest component of the interest rate. In
         nascent markets, staff costs tend to be high due to the absence of automated systems
         and to the low volume of business, which means that each mortgage carries a high lev-
         el of fixed costs. It is not unusual for lending institutions to require 300-400 basis points
         to cover administration and processing costs in low-turnover, labor-intensive markets.
      •	 Credit risk is the third largest expense built into the interest rate. The credit risk is
         calculated using Probability of Default (PD) and Loss Given Default (LGD) calculations,
         which together provide the overall expected loss on an asset. The PD in Nigeria is high
         due to the difficulties in underwriting a loan without reliable credit scoring informa-
         tion to assess borrowers and to know with certainty whether the borrower already has
         other loans. The LGD is high due to the difficulties in foreclosing on properties, the
         lack of reliable property valuations, and the lack of a liquid property market to resell
         foreclosed properties.
      •	 The return on capital is also high, based on these other factors.

105.	Housing Affordability Parameter 2 – Loan Maturity. Loan terms in Nigeria tend to be
     around 10 to 12 years. With interest rates of 15 percent or more, there is very little value
     in extending loan maturity beyond 10 to 12 years. Much more significant benefits would
     accrue once the interest rate falls below 10 percent for longer-term funds.

106.	Housing Affordability Parameter 3 – House Prices. High construction costs limit the
     development of affordable housing. The construction supply chain is dysfunctional.
     Locally produced building materials are not available in sufficient quantities. In addition,
     the cost of providing public infrastructure is often priced into residential housing. Skilled

                                                           39
      labor is in low supply, resulting in construction companies needing to train their own staff.
      All of these cost factors make housing construction in Nigeria very expensive and limit
      affordability. It is estimated that the production of a three bedroom house in Nigeria costs
      US$50,000, compared to USS36,000 in South Africa and US$26,000 in India.


E. Dealing with High Interest Rates and Inflation
107.	A major limitation on affordability is the high rate of inflation, which is a key cause of
     high interest rates. One possible solution is to introduce a system of indexed mortgages,
     which would effectively ensure that the loan price is based, both from the borrower’s and
     lender’s point of view, on real rather than nominal interest rates.31

108.	Conceptually, spreading the cost of a mortgage loan over a longer period makes
     sense. By indexing the mortgage, the borrower is effectively being charged a “real” rate
     of interest over the lifetime of the loan, keeping payments constant in real terms. In a
     standard mortgage product, the payments are kept constant in nominal terms, which
     means that over time, their real worth decreases as inflation erodes the value of money.
     By keeping the mortgage payment constant in real terms through indexation allows for the
     mortgage to amortize over a longer period and thereby increase upfront affordability.

109.	Different forms of indexation have been tried in other countries with varying degrees
     of success. A common issue is the reliability of the data used for the index. Especially in
     emerging economies, inflation data can be unreliable and undermine confidence in a
     system that depends on objective, timely data. There are also risks that indices produced
     by government statistical departments may be subject to political interference.

110.	The implementation of an indexing system itself can be complex, due to the different
     financial stocks and payment streams involved in a mortgage system. The outstanding
     mortgage balance, the monthly mortgage payment, the borrower’s income, the lender’s
     source of funds, and the value of the housing collateral are all subject to different price
     dynamics and influences. Using a single index to capture all of these influences leads to a
     disconnect among different flows. For instance, a borrower’s income may not keep pace
     with a price inflation index. Alternatively, using a wage index may not accurately capture
     changes in prices, resulting in losses for a lender. So although the initial concept appears
     simple, practical implementation implies a degree of sophistication and reliability of
     data.32

111.	Overall experiences with indexation have been mixed. Latin America has piloted sever-
     al versions of indexation, some of which have worked for reasonable periods of time, but
     have not been able to stand up to crisis. This was the case in Mexico, where the “Tequila
     crisis” overwhelmed the system. In Colombia, there was a reasonably successfully experi-
     ence with Price Level Adjusted Mortgages (PLAMs)—until a sharp deterioration in the econ-
     omy, along with a Supreme Court ruling that required a change in the index, led to high
     levels of default and a serious asset/liability mismatch for lenders. The most successful
     example is Chile, which has benefited from a very stable and decreasing level of inflation,
     as well as a well-developed capital market and pension system able to provide the funding
     for inflation-indexed mortgages.

112.	A final example is Ghana, where the Home Finance Company (HFC), a non-bank
     financial institution, is virtually the sole lender. HFC was created in 1991 as the imple-
     mentation agency for the housing finance component (US$7 million) of an IDA urban loan.

31	 This proposition is also advanced by Paul Collier, who argues in support of indexed mortgage loans as a means
 of improving affordability in high-inflation environments. Rethinking Cities, Chapter 11: Housing and Urbanization in
 Africa, Collier, Paul and Tony Venables, Oxford University 2013.
32	 For more details see Dual Index Mortgages: Lessons from International Practice and Conditions of Development in
 Poland, L. Chiquier, Housing Finance International 1998.


                                                          40
      The aim at the time of its creation was for HFC to become a central provider of long-term
      funds to mortgage originators, and a catalyst for development of the market. To meet this
      two-fold objective, HFC developed an IDA-related product for moderate-income groups
      (the “Pilot Scheme”), followed by other schemes targeting more diverse populations. Prac-
      tically all of HFC’s loans under this scheme were based on an indexation principle to allow
      for a positive turn on capital raised through bonds issues,33 but with mortgage payments
      not to exceed 25 percent of a borrower’s income.

113.	During the surge of inflation in the mid-1990s, which led to a severe fall of real wag-
     es, the indexation mechanism would have implied unbearable increases in mortgage pay-
     ments, or alternatively, unsustainable negative amortization, had it not been temporarily
     altered. The appreciation of the balance of loans under the Pilot Scheme was capped to
     a floating benchmark tied to the bank’s prime rate; and HFC negotiated with its investors
     (the Government of Ghana and the Social Security and National Insurance Trust, SSNIT) a
     symmetrical limitation on the appreciation of its bonds.

114.	Several lessons34 can be drawn from the experience with inflation-indexed mortgag-
     es. First, although they can ameliorate the impact of inflation on mortgage payments,
     improving affordability and reducing the risk of default, they can only do so within a range
     of inflationary outcomes. Severe shocks such as those seen in Colombia, Ghana and
     Mexico will overwhelm the instrument, leading to adverse results. Second, there must be
     a matched funding source for the instrument. Lenders without a matching liability will not
     be able to manage the cash flow risk these instruments generate. Finally, these instru-
     ments are very complex, presenting challenges to both lenders and borrowers. It is likely
     that many borrowers with indexed loans do not really understand their dynamics; and
     experience suggests that the lender’s staff may not understand them either.

115.	When looking at the current situation in Nigeria and the potential for indexed prod-
     ucts, several preconditions need to be assessed: (a) quality, independence and robustness
     of data on price inflation and wage inflation; (b) capacity of lenders to service and under-
     write highly complex products; (c) inflationary outlook for Nigeria; (d) sources of long-term
     inflation-indexed funding (v) consumer protection issues around selling of such products
     and consumer understanding. Even a cursory assessment would indicate that many of
     those conditions cannot presently be met; however, a longer-term program to create the
     conditions for indexed mortgages would have benefits for a large percentage of the popu-
     lation.


F. Conclusion
116.	The mortgage market in Nigeria has grown significantly in recent years, but remains
     constrained by many factors. At present, the growth is not sufficient to provide even
     a fraction of the housing investment needed to meet the housing needs of the rapidly
     increasing population.

117.	Maturity mismatch is one of the biggest impediments to large-scale growth of the
     mortgage sector. This was the assessment of the financial community in a survey; and the
     analysis in this report confirms this conclusion. Banks are predominantly collecting short-
     term deposits and are building up a significant asset base in the 1-5 year maturity bucket.
     Part of the reasoning behind such a position may be to view the behavioral maturity struc-
     ture of their deposits rather than the contractual one. However, in a country with relatively
     volatile inflation and a weakening currency, this is strategy carries some risks. In addition,


33	 Bonds were placed with the government for one third of the Pilot Scheme, and with SSNIT for most of the remain-
 der of the funding needs.

 Markets, ed. L. Chiquier, L. and M. Lea, World Bank 2008.

     new global standards for banking risk under Basel III impose much greater restrictions on
     maturity mismatches for financial institutions.

118.	There are multiple other constraints on the mortgage market that have not been cov-
     ered in this paper. These include the cost and time it can take to register property, and
     the difficulty in enforcing mortgage collateral through the court system, both of which add
     a significant cost to banks in terms of additional risk, operational expense, and simply a
     lack of mortgageable properties. In addition, the mortgage market is limited by the supply
     of affordable housing. There are numerous reasons for this, including a lack of primary
     raw materials, import tariffs on cement, shortage of skilled workers, lack of professional-
     ism and project management skills among developers, access to finance for developers,
     and lack of access to serviced land. All of these issues, and possible solutions, have been
     treated in depth in other papers.

119.	Recommendation 1 – Develop a simple long-term financing solution able to support
     both deposit money banks and primary mortgage banks. Several options are available.
     The simplest solution would be to create a mortgage liquidity facility, otherwise known
     as a mortgage refinance company. MLFs provide long-term funding by linking mortgage
     lenders with the holders of long-term funds such as pension funds, insurance companies
     and other institutional investors. Another solution would be to develop securitization or
     covered bonds; however, this approach would require a much more mature mortgage
     market with higher levels of origination, more data availability to allow for a historic track
     record, and more developed institutional investors.

120.	The mortgage liquidity facility operates on several levels: (a) by providing long-term
     funds, it allows lenders to extend the average maturity of their balance sheet and reduce
     mismatches; (b) by providing a refinance window to convert some of their illiquid long-
     term mortgage assets into cash, it allows lenders to more fully use their shorter-term
     deposits with confidence, as they would still have access to liquidity should any issues
     arise; (c) by insisting on market standards for refinancing of mortgages, the facility is able
     to improve overall underwriting standards and assist with overall market development.

121.	Recommendation 2 – Develop a proactive approach to deepening access to mort-
     gage products for those with lower incomes. The affordability sensitivity analysis shows
     clearly the potential market that could be achieved under favorable conditions. Some of
     those conditions are dependent on the overall macroeconomic environment, while others
     can be affected by policy actions. For instance, one of the key affordability constraints
     is access to a deposit for purchasing a home. The cost of registering a title transfer, plus
     the cost of a mortgage loan, in addition to a down payment, can be prohibitive for many
     on low or modest incomes. A possible solution is to allow slightly larger mortgage loans,
     extending to 90 percent loan-to-value (LTV), but with a risk-sharing mechanism in place to
     avoid creating excessive levels of risk for lenders. A mortgage insurance product could be
     introduced to cover some of this risk, allowing lenders to extend higher LTV products, but
     sharing some of the risks.

122.	Recommendation 3 – Further work is needed on the potential of inflation-proof
     mortgage products. It is not clear at present whether indexed mortgage products that
     effectively charge a real rate of interest would provide an effective solution in the Nigerian
     market. However, the recent issuance of inflation-linked bonds could provide a market
     for raising inflation-linked funding for mortgage loans. One of the other key obstacles is
     the reliability of data needed to index mortgage payments to a measure of earnings, and
     of consumer price data to index mortgage principal to inflation. If some of these hurdles
     can be overcome, an inflation- proof product could be a major step towards limiting the
     damaging impact of high inflation and macro volatility.

IX. HOUSING MICROFINANCE

A. Rationale for Housing Microfinance
123.	In growing urban centers in African, the majority of homeowners build their own
     houses incrementally, as rural dwellers have always done, using locally available materi-
     als. To finance incremental housing, most households use savings or general microfinance.
     It is generally assumed that between 15 to 40 percent of general microfinance loans are
     used for purposes of housing development.

124.	The majority of Africa’s urban dwellers do not qualify for mortgages (see Afford-
     ability section). Recent data from the World Bank’s Financial Inclusion Index (FINDEX)
     show that formal access to and usage of credit in Africa is very low. In Mauritius, which has
     the highest rate of formal borrowing, only 14 percent of adults said they had taken out a
     formal loan in the last 12 months. Mortgage lending is out of reach for many households in
     Africa, given the longer terms and amounts for borrowing, the need for collateral, and the
     lack of flexibility around payment terms, which makes it difficult for people with irregular
     income streams.

125.	It is in this context that housing microfinance has emerged to finance the process of
     incremental self-build. HMF adjusts to the financial capacities and cash flow of the bor-
     rowers, providing loans for relatively small amounts, typically US$5,000–US$10,000, based
     on the client’s capacity to repay. The repayment periods are relatively short in comparison
     with mortgages, typically one to five years, and are either unsecured or based on collateral
     other than the property itself.


B. Benefits of Housing Microfinance
126.	The benefits of housing microfinance include economic development, income
     generation, and urban improvement. HMF fuels the upgrading and improvement of
     informal homes, and has substantial additional benefits such as income generation. The
     majority of HMF borrowers and households are headed by women or have women as the
     principal income earner, doing home-based work. Improving the home expands the hours
     in the day they can work, their ability to mind children, and their access to clean water and
     sanitation. Home improvement entails the sale of building materials and the employment
     of low-skilled and medium-skilled workers (plasterers, masons, carpenters). All of these
     boost the economy and economic development. Finally, home upgrading improves neigh-
     borhoods and is part of the process of formalizing informal neighborhoods. Though these
     benefits have seldom been quantified, they are significant. Aside from beneficial effects
     on the city and its households, housing microfinance also creates behavioral changes that
     strengthen communities and local governance.


C. Housing Microfinance in Nigeria
127.	The absence of long-term finance has contributed to the lack of innovation in
     financial products to reach lower income segments. A financing mismatch in financial
     institutions, particularly in microfinance banks (MFBs), has limited the ability to respond
     to market demand. Anecdotal evidence from microfinance banks suggests that home
     improvement loans are often disguised as productive loans because they are more easily
     available. Based on consultations within the microfinance industry, these loans could rep-
     resent as much as 25 percent the microfinance portfolio. Smaller loans are often needed
     for home improvements, expansion, upgrading roofing, water supply or connection to the
     power grid.


                                               43
128.	None of Nigeria’s existing 889 MFBs currently offers formal housing microfinance
     products. Their portfolios consist primarily of small loans for microenterprises ranging
     from below US$100 to around US$1,500, with maturities between 3 and 9 months. The
     development of a housing microfinance market is a complex task, and the MFBs are un-
     derstandably cautious about venturing into this new line of business. Despite the existing
     market potential, it is unlikely that MFBs will significantly expand to HMF in the near term
     without initial external support.

129.	At the same time, and based on initial engagement with MFB sector,35 the MFBs have a
     strong interest in moving into housing microfinance. Several MFBs are considering specific
     housing products, largely related to home improvement and incremental construction.
     Further, all MFBs indicated the need to better understand the market potential of HMF, the
     need for technical assistance to develop tailored HMF products, and the need to under-
     stand funding constraints in this market segment. .

130.	Research conducted for this report indicates that in the Nigerian context, the “‘pure”
     housing microfinance loan would be between US$1,6000 and US$4,800, with a term of 16
     to 36 months and an interest rate of no more than 3.5 percent per month. The loans would
     be used for incremental improvements such as adding a toilet or a corrugated metal roof,
     adding a room, laying a foundation slab. A typical customer would own her own property,
     with or without legal title.

131.	MFIs seeking to expand into HMF will require an exemption from banking-type
     regulations, as well as significant technical assistance in product design and some seed
     capital/grant funding so that innovating HMF providers can originate an initial pool of
     loans with money they can afford to lose.

132.	Other key elements needed for an effective housing microfinance program include
     (a) a borrower who has occupied the dwelling for several years; (b) a property with “good
     bones” – a foundation, ground floor walls, well-built window and door apertures; and (c)
     signs that the occupant has been making immovable improvements to the property; e.g., a
     water tank, connection to an electric meter, plastering of interior walls.


D. Existing Activities: Products at the Fringes, Empty Spaces
133.	Several leading Nigerian MFIs are moving into HMF, though tentatively and with sig-
     nificant capital limitations. No MFIs has yet committed to HMF as a major business line.
     Several existing MFIs (such as Accion and Infinity) report that they know their customers
     use microfinance for housing loans, but few keep any statistics, in part because maturity
     limitations, funding limitations, and microfinance’s emphasis on income-producing uses
     discourages such reporting.

134.	For MFBs and MFIs to move aggressively into the HMF market, they will need:

      •	 Risk capital, ideally as restricted grants or equity, so they can build loan portfolios
         without having to worry about liquidity or immediate repayment. Risk capital will need
         to be mandated for HMF, not mortgage finance and not microfinance.
      •	 Technical assistance in product innovation, business models (including possible
         hybrid value chains with building materials companies), and capital strategy.

135.	Risk capital without technical assistance and an HMF mandate will result in the
     recipient MFIs reverting back to their regular microfinance business. Technical assistance
     without HMF-mandated risk capital will lead to hesitant exploration, but no urgency and
     no scale.

136.	A small number of private mortgage institutions, such as Abbey Building Society or
     First Generation Mortgage Bank. Ltd., have expressed interest in housing microfinance
     and are making moves to develop appropriate products.


E. Obstacles to the Development of Housing Microfinance
137.	The lack of HMF in Nigeria, despite the evident need, implies that there must be sub-
     stantial barriers to its emergence. In our view, these barriers fall into three categories: lack
     of positive deviance role models, inherent risks at the property and borrower level, and
     funding obstacles, especially in establishing HMF businesses.


Funding and collateral challenges
138.	MFIs face several challenges in expanding into HMF, including:

     •	 Term restrictions. The Central Bank of Nigeria currently restricts MFIs and MFBs to
        loan products of 12 months or less.
     •	 Regulatory limits on lending to a single borrower. Based on the concept of micro-
        finance, CBN guidelines stipulate that credit is subject to a single obligor limit of one
        percent for an individual/corporate entity and five percent for a group. These caps tend
        to discourage the larger loans suitable for housing microfinance.
     •	 The microfinance ethos. MFI lenders expect their money to be used directly in an in-
        come-generating activity, and have no means of gauging whether home-based workers
        or improved home conditions will boost income.
     •	 An inability to perceive or gauge the level of HMF effective demand, due to:
           •	 Deflection or even suppression of HMF demand. People who might want to im-
              prove their homes are unconsciously (or even consciously) coached to present
              their requests in terms of ‘productive activity.
           •	 A shortage of useful credit histories. While MFIs and MFBs can readily identify their
              best customers and their loan histories, this information tends not to be connect-
              ed to housing or home improvement needs.
           •	 Lack of awareness of asset-based lending. Microfinance is consumer finance for
              the base of the pyramid—it operates on a 100 percent loss-given-default model,
              where collateral is presumed to be basically of zero recovery value. Asset-based
              lending tolerates higher risk of default because there can be collateral recovery
              value. However, when microfinance lenders are presented with asset-based
              lending, such as potential improvements to a property, they tend to be unable to
              incorporate this collateral into their credit decision making.
     •	 Limited share capital, which makes HMF an expensive bet.
     •	 Lack of positive deviance role models for successful HMF lending, which leads to
        the ironic situation of those most motivated to move into HMF (such as Infinity) having
        the fewest resources; and those with the resources to move into HMF (e.g., Accion) not
        being motivated to provide it.


A typology of other risks for housing microfinance
139.	Risks relative to a housing microfinance business can occur at several levels:

     •	 Property level: the borrower, the activity. Individual loans may fail for any of a num-
        ber of reasons.
     •	 Business level: how the entity originates and services loans. As the entity moves
        from doing individual loans to creating a portfolio of loans, the entity’s business prac-
        tices may degrade or become inconsistent.


                                                 45
     •	 Capital markets level: providing periodic liquidity. Even assuming the entity can suc-
        cessfully originate and service loans at scale, capital markets disruptions may prevent
        it from scaling or even from remaining viable.

140.	Housing microfinance can fill a demonstrable need, yet it does not yet exist as a ready-
     to-expand business. HMF is not simply “just another product” that an MFI can offer; it is
     larger and with a longer term, and therefore requires a different risk-management ap-
     proach (before, during, and after the loan is made). MFIs that want to move into HMF need
     to set up a dedicated business unit, and that takes some effort.

141.	Despite the challenges, a handful of Nigeria’s leading innovators in microfinance are
     seeking to move into the business space with innovative products that address the need
     for HMF.
