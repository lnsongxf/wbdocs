  This trial built on lessons from a pilot experiment in 2015, when the World Bank and the UK Behavioural Insights Team supported
the authorities in designing and conducting a trial in two regions, Lubuskie and Wielkopolskie, which compared the results from one
behavioral letter with those from the dunning letter.

     In fact, as shown further in the report, adding some of the social messages actually reduces the impact of the letter compared to
    the standard behavioral letter.




6       APPLYING BEHAVIORAL INSIGHTS TO IMPROVE TAX COLLECTION
Message 3: The effectiveness of some of
the messages depended on taxpayers’
characteristics

The effect of a particular message varied depending
on the taxpayer’s age, gender, geographic location,
and amount owed. For example, the public goods mes-
sage helped to increase tax compliance among people
aged 20–29 but had a negative effect on the compliance
of those aged 50–64. Given the public goods listed
in the behavioral letter (preschools, schools, roads,
and safety), one possibility is that younger people
responded positively because they are more likely
to benefit from these than older people and are thus
more motivated to pay up when reminded of the public
goods benefits. If the heterogeneity observed is in fact
due to the choice of public goods mentioned, higher
compliance might be induced by adapting the types
of public goods mentioned in letters to the age groups
of recipients. Similarly, public good messages work
better in rural areas, possibly because of a tighter link
with the outcome of that kind of spending and the
relevance to community.

Message 4: Sending letters by regular mail
(the cheaper option) proved to be just
as effective as sending them
via registered mail

Analysis of the outcomes for the delivery-method
test found no statistical difference in payment rates
or payment amounts whether the dunning letter was
hand-delivered by registered mail or sent by regular
mail. This suggests that in Poland the tax admini-
stration (and other agencies) could generate useful
savings by replacing use of registered mail (PLN 14.96
per letter) to invoice taxpayers in arrears with delivery
by regular mail (PLN 9.20 per letter).

Message 5: Tax compliance among
taxpayers in arrears can be tackled
cost-effectively

A cost-benefit analysis revealed that if the most
effective letter had been sent to all 149,925 taxpayers
in the sample, the tax authority would have gene-
rated PLN 39,328,742 more in revenues than the
control group – the additional revenues would have
been 28 times larger than the cost of sending the
letters, including staff time.3 The trial results make
a compelling case for rigorous testing of small adap-
tations of government communications with tax-
payers. They also demonstrate that communication
processes can be enhanced to promote tax comp-
liance at low cost and without the need for new
legislation.

  The Polish Tax Department estimates that the cost of sending a dunning letter by regular mail, including staff time costs,
is approximately PLN 9.20 sending it by registered mail would cost about PLN 14.96.

  The cost and benefit analysis presented in the report does not take into account the additional costs associated with handling
the complaints filed with the tax authorities by recipients of certain behavioral letters (mainly hard tone). The Ministry of Finance
does not have data on the total number of complaints in Poland and the costs associated with their handling, hence they are not part of
the cost-benefit analysis. Data from the Tax Chamber in Warsaw show that only 7 complaints were filed formally, while more than
30 thousand letters were sent in Mazowieckie region, which suggests that the cost associated with complaints was not very large.
However, the employees of the Tax Offices also reported to have received over 3,000 phone calls and emails regarding the content of
behavioral communications. In addition, it should be also noted that there might be other tools that can improve tax compliance apart
from behaviorally informed letters, but identifying them is beyond the scope of the report.

       Lubuskie and Wielkopolskie are located in the northwest of Poland. Together their populations totaled about 4.5 million in 2014,
     12 percent of Poland’s total population. In 2014, there were about 1.9 million PIT taxpayers in the two regions, equivalent to 12.4 percent of
     total PIT taxpayers.

     DOES THE CUT-OFF DATE MATTER?


     The results presented in the report are based on the          2.    All behavioral letters become less effective, espe-
     data obtained from the authorities by June 13, 2016.                cially in terms of payment amount.
     Up to that date, the tax administration undertook
     no other enforcement activities. After that date it is        3.    The effect of behavioral letters on days to repay-
     harder to interpret the findings because there were                 ment becomes negative (with regards to dunning
     other interventions, such as enforcement activities                 regular) – an indication that the effect on the
     by tax offices. For example, a number of taxpayers                  composition on the sample of those who pay
     from all treatment arms who had failed to pay by                    attenuates and becomes more homogeneous
     June 13 were sent dunning letter by registered mail,                across treatments – and those who were sent the
     and executive proceedings were initiated for tax-                   regular letter start repaying – an indication that
     payers who had been sent registered dunning letters                 for them slower repayment is slower than for
     as part of the experiment. These factors create poten-              other taxpayers. This confirms that the executive
     tially confounding effects that might affect the validi-            measures partly make up for the fact that non-
     ty of the estimates. Nonetheless, the results using as              -behavioral messages are not as effective.
     cut-off dates the first (June 13) and the last (August 8)
     monitoring rounds are compared here (Table A3.1).             4.    From the administration point of view, omission
                                                                         commission messages lose most of their effective-
     The findings:                                                       ness edge over the behavioral standard letter;
                                                                         it appears that these messages were effective
     1.    The registered letter becomes more productive,                in showing “seriousness of intent” on part of the
           especially with regard to the amount paid and the             administration but once the intent is carried out
           number of days for repayment.                                 via executive proceedings, the messages lose bite.
