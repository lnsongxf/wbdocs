     materialize even in the absence of a disaster and
     can therefore strengthen the immediate business

Glossary of key terms
Avoided losses                   The immediate and long-run damages and losses
(1st Dividend of Resilience)     that disaster risk reduction measures can prevent in
                                 the event of a disaster.


Background risk                  The possibility of an extreme event (e.g. a disaster)
                                 that threatens the prospects of ongoing economic
                                 activity. The presence of background risk restricts
                                 long-term investments and economic growth, even
                                 before a disaster occurs.


Co-benefits                      Co-benefits include development benefits or uses
(3rd Dividend of Resilience)     of a DRM investment or action, in addition to the
                                 primary DRM objective of reducing disaster losses.


Development Dividend             This is the development potential that is unlocked
(2nd Dividend of Resilience)     when background risk is reduced through
                                 DRM measures. This includes innovation,
                                 entrepreneurship, and investments, and is
                                 independent of the occurrence of any actual disaster.


Disaster Risk Management (DRM)   Processes for designing, implementing, and
                                 evaluating strategies, policies, and measures to
                                 improve the understanding of disaster risk, foster
                                 disaster risk reduction and transfer, and promote
                                 continuous improvement in disaster preparedness,
                                 response, and recovery practices, with the explicit
                                 purpose of increasing human security, well-being,
                                 quality of life, and sustainable development. (IPCC,

    saving lives and avoiding losses	

          Saving lives and avoiding losses (First Dividend of Resilience)
          DRM measures can avoid or reduce losses and damages (both immediate and
          long-run) in the event of a disaster.

          These include:
          •	   saving lives and reducing numbers of people affected
          •	   reducing direct damages to infrastructure and other assets
          •	   reducing economic and non-monetary losses (direct and indirect).

          DRM measures that reduce the background risk due to potential future
          disasters can have immediate and significant development benefits. Increased
          resilience enables forward-looking planning, long-term capital investments and

                                         DRM investments

                                                  Generating development co-benefits (Third Dividend
                                                  of Resilience)
                                                  DRM investments have multiple uses and can be classified as economic, social and
                                                  environmental co-benefits. These co-benefits may either be explicitly designed into
                                                  the investment (such as dual-use infrastructure) or incidental.

                                                  While the nature of co-benefits varies significantly, they all materialise even in the
                                                  absence of a disaster. Co-benefits can play an important role in motivating DRM
                                                  measures and determining their design. Multi-purpose design that intentionally
                                                  integrates these co-benefits can save money and significantly improve the
                                                  attractiveness of investing in DRM.

                                                  These co-benefits include:
                                                  •	      economic co-benefits, (e.g. flood protection supporting fisheries)
                                                  •	      social co-benefits, (e.g. improved transparency or social cohesion)
                                                  •	      environmental co-benefits (e.g. watershed protection).

Investing in resilience reduces losses and damages in the case of a disaster. However, it can also yield development benefits regardless of
disasters. Typically, standard disaster risk management investment appraisals fail to account for the 2nd and 3rd dividends of resilience.

Box 1: Key co-benefits of integrated DRM investments in Jamaican agriculture include:

Economic co-benefits

•	   DRM irrigation projects helped reduce the economic impacts of droughts, particularly in Southern Clarendon and
     St.Elizabeth. These farming communities have also benefited from increased productivity and output relative to other
     areas, even in the face of drought over the April-June quarter in 2014.

Social co-benefits

•	   Training and shared learning on drip irrigation has strengthened social capital and built comradeship within the
     communities, especially among the farmers in the field.

Environmental co-benefits

•	   A rainwater catchment tank and drip irrigation system in Lititz, St. Elizabeth, has improved small-scale irrigation,
     resulting in higher yields, less soil erosion and deforestation, and an increase in socioeconomic status for farmers.

7.3	 Communicate outcomes
Communicating the triple dividend assessments to
other stakeholders such as business, tax payers and
political supporters is an essential requirement for
integrating the concept into development planning:

•	 Communicate how DRM interventions are
   linked to, or can be delivered through, other
   development policies and interventions. Explain
   the benefits of DRM actions using triple dividend
   principles and the value of DRM interventions
   relative to ‘do nothing’ scenarios.
