B. Project Status
The Project Development Objectives (PDO) are to assist the Recipient in: (i) improving access to
basic infrastructure and social services in target districts, and (ii) improving the planning,
management and monitoring by local communities and communes of decentralized investment.
IDA Credit 48890 and IDA Grant H6570 for SDR 9 million and SDR 7.30 million respectively
were approved on October 19, 2011 and are scheduled to close on June 30, 2015. As of April 24,
2015 IDA-48890 had disbursed XDR 3.88 million (57%) and IDA-H6570 had disbursed XDR 3.61
million (51%). Achievement of the PDO and implementation progress are both rated unsatisfactory
because of severe shortcomings: (i) lack of provision of adequate counterpart funds in a timely
manner; (ii) high staff turnover in the project management unit which has affected financial
management and project implementation; (iii) poor governance at the project management unit
level - two project coordinators were removed in three years for wrongdoing, before an interim one
was appointed in July 2014.

The project has not fully complied with one legal covenant related to the technical audit of quality
of micro-projects but has complied with Bank procurement and safeguards requirements. Project
Financial Management performance is rated unsatisfactory: quarterly financial reports and audit
reports have not been submitted in a timely manner; the external auditor’s opinions have been
consistently qualified; and the 2013 audit report has not yet been submitted.
The status of implementation of each project component is summarized below.

Component 1: Capacity building of local communities and communes and support to
decentralization (US$ 4 million). Implementation of this component is rated moderately
unsatisfactory. About 1,900 beneficiaries have been trained in community-based procurement and
financial management. 13 out of 75 communes had prepared and adopted strategic development
plans. Activities whose implementation has not started so far will be cancelled, and US$512,000
will be reallocated from this component to Component 3: Project Coordination and Management.

Component 2: Decentralized financing of micro-projects (US$18 million) finances the construction
of basic infrastructure in targeted districts through the financing of demand-driven activities: (i)
socio-economic infrastructure; (ii) environmental and natural resources management micro-
projects; and (iii) income-generating micro-projects. Implementation of this component is rated
moderately unsatisfactory. Currently, the 120 micro-projects being implemented will continue to be
funded until the closing date. By the June 30, 2015 closing date, 360 micro-projects will be
completed. The remaining 540 planned micro-projects and subsequent activities are proposed to be
cancelled, as these will require about three years to be completed. This will result in a saving of
SDR 8,686,827, which is proposed to be cancelled.

Component 3: Project coordination and management (US$3 million) supports project
implementation, including: (i) administrative activities; (ii) fiduciary activities, including financial
management and procurement; (iii) technical execution; and (iv) monitoring and evaluation of
Project performance and impact, including through the establishment of a monitoring platform.
Implementation of this component is rated unsatisfactory. IDA resources allocated to this
component have been fully utilized and it is proposed to allocate SDR 564,000 to this component
from Component 1.

Change in Disbursement Estimates
Explanation
Disbursement estimates for the remainder of the project are proposed to be adjusted as indicated in
the table below to reflect the proposed cancellation.

Change to Components and Cost

Explanation
As a result of the above-mentioned cancellations and reallocations, project cost will be reduced and
components costs need to be adjusted. Current costs comprise (i) the project cost including the
counterpart funding for US$ 50 million; (ii) IDA allocation for US$ 25 million and Beneficiaries
US$ 2.5 million as shown in the table below. Proposed Project Costs include: US$ 3.130 million for
