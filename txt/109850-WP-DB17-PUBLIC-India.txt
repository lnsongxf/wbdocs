This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

      Obtain Intimation of Disapproval and pay fees


      After the site inspection, the application file returns to the
      Building Proposal Office to receive an intimation of disapproval
      (authorization). The concerned Sub Engineer reviews the
      proposal and forwards the report to the Assistant Engineer and
      Executive Engineer. The proposal is approved at the Executive
      Engineer’s level if no concessions are involved. There are 3
      executive engineers in the main Municipal Corporation of
      Greater Mumbai (MCGM) office and 2 in the Andhuri office (the
      latter is the office considered for the purposes of this study).

      Complete applications that do not require concessions (i.e.
      claiming of areas free of FSI as per provision in DCR 1991,
      deficiency in open spaces etc.) can be approved within a week.
      However, the majority of applications require some concessions
      and further scrutiny so they must be forwarded to the competent
      authorities. This latter process may take 30 -- 90 days to
      complete.

      The intimation of disapproval is issued with a list of NOC’s which
      the applicant must obtain separately from various departments
19    and government authorities. Final clearance to build will only be    29 days      INR 42,000
      given once BuildCo obtains all NOC’s. The NOC’s assigned to
      the intimation of disapproval are case specific. For the purpose
      of this study, Doing Business has determined 7 basic NOC’s that
      are required of almost all projects:
      • Tree Authority
      • Storm Water and Drain Department
      • Sewerage Department
      • Hydraulic Department
      • Environmental Department (concerned with debris
      management)
      • Traffic and Coordination Department
      • CFO (fire clearance)

      BuildCo’s architect must take the Intimation of Disapproval and
      the design plans to each clearance office separately. NOCs can
      be applied for simultaneously, but NOC offices are spread out so
      the submission for these 7 NOC’s is likely to take some time.

      Department reviews the drawings and checks the fire and safety
      arrangement on the plans against the National Building Code of India
      2005. It takes 3 weeks to issue a Provisional No Objection Certificate

      are paid to the Municipal Corporation of Delhi, who will transfer the
      charges to the Labor Welfare Department of Government of NCT Delhi.

      inspection but randomly selects about 20% of the buildings and
      inspects them after the issuance of Building Permits.

      A single window concept has been introduced for approval of building-
      plan applications. Online approval is available for residential plots and
      sanction is generally given within 1 week if all documents are complete.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March (for 11 economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city). As noted, the
warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff schedules may apply if a time-of-
use tariff is available.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                                                 To enforce its security interest, Bizbank would file a petition to the

                                                 creditors will object before the High Court.

                                              The reason why BizBank initiates the insolvency process is that the
                  Mumbai,                     hotel is unable to pay its debts and the hotel expects operating

                                              hotel assets will be sold piecemeal and the hotel will stop operating.

                                                 Bizbank will apply to the Debt Recovery Tribunal to enforce its
                                                 security. This will take a couple of months. But other creditors

                                                 money owed to it takes about 4.3 years.

                                                 The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately

on employment regulations that is completed by local
lawyers and public officials. Employment laws and
regulations as well as secondary sources are reviewed to
ensure accuracy.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
     Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
       age 19, with one year of work experience.
     Is a full-time employee.
     Is not a member of the labor union, unless
       membership is mandatory.
The business:
     Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
