solving; socio-emo onal skills and behavioral traits, such as conscien ousness, grit, and openness to experience;
and job- or occupa on-speciﬁc technical skills, such as the ability to work as an engineer. Cogni ve and socio-
emo onal skill forma on starts early in a person’s life. Good cogni ve and socio-emo onal skills provide a
necessary founda on for the subsequent acquisi on of technical skills. Put diﬀerently, poor literacy and numeracy
skills severely undermine a person’s ability to beneﬁt from further training and lifelong learning.

An impressive transforma on in cogni ve skills has occurred among youth in Poland. This report focuses on
cogni ve skills. It examines results for Poland from the Program for Interna onal Student Assessment (PISA), which
assesses the mathema cs, reading, and science competencies of 15-year-olds. The ﬁndings point to an impressive
transforma on in the cogni ve skill set of the youth in Poland between 2000 and 2012. Poland raised its scores in
mathema cs, reading, and science to the equivalent of what students would have learned in one addi onal year of
schooling. Its PISA scores are now above the OECD average and at the same levels as in countries such as Finland
and Germany.

Aggregate gains in quality have gone hand in hand with improvements in educa onal equity. Poland has seen
an increase in the propor on of its students at the top performance level, and the share of its students who are
poor performers has declined. Students from poor and well-oﬀ socioeconomic backgrounds alike saw performance
improvements. All this has been achieved with stable levels of educa on spending, at about 5 percent of GDP and
below the OECD average.

The overall eﬀects of reform on Poland’s PISA scores has been posi ve, although isola ng the precise impact of
each reform element is diﬃcult. Given the many educa on (and non-educa on) reforms in Poland since the early
1990s, it is diﬃcult to isolate the eﬀects of each element of reform on Poland’s PISA results. The overall eﬀects
are clearly posi ve. In addi on to changes in the accountability arrangements with a strengthening of the role of
local governments and the introduc on of standardized examina ons, the Polish authori es introduced a change
to the structure of the educa on system in 1999, which delayed selec on between general and voca onal tracks
and eﬀec vely added one year of exposure to general curriculum content. Taking eﬀect a er the ﬁrst PISA test in
2000, when Poland performed rela vely poorly, this change has been rigorously evaluated and shown to have had
a signiﬁcant posi ve eﬀect on performance.

Despite the many successes, some challenges remain, par cularly regarding problem-solving skills and equity in
achievement. There is evidence from PISA assessments replicated for older students in upper-secondary educa on
in 2006, 2009 and 2012 that performance gaps previously found between voca onal and general schools for

Snapshot of Poland’s performance in PISA
Poland’s 15-year-olds performed strongly in mathema cs, reading, and science in 2012. Poland’s scores were
above the OECD country average in all subjects: mathema cs (518 points), reading (518 points), and science (526
points) (Figure 5). Poland scored well above the OECD average in mathema cs and at par with countries such as
Germany and Finland. These rapid improvements in PISA scores make Poland an interes ng case to examine.

The signiﬁcant gains in Poland’s PISA scores have extended across three dis nct phases. First, Poland saw
signiﬁcant improvements between 2000 and 2003. Its scores presented a broadly stable picture between 2003
and 2009, followed by another signiﬁcant jump between 2009 and 2012 (Figure 6). The aggregate increases for
reading, mathema cs and science across the en re period are around 40 points, the equivalent of one year of
instruc on. What have been the drivers of the sudden improvements in performance between 2000 and 2003 and
between 2009 and 2012? While evidence shows a causal link between the ﬁrst jump and the 1999 reform, with its
extension of general educa on by one year due to the introduc on of the comprehensive lower secondary schools
(Jakubowski et al., 2010), no causal evidence has been found to explain the 2009-2012 improvements. However,
one credible hypothesis is that the changes in curriculum and student assessment led to improvements in cogni ve
skills, with students tested in 2012 having completed three years of lower secondary educa on under the new
curriculum (see also Marciniak, 2015, and Jakubowski, 2015).

However, there is evidence that performance stra ﬁca on emerges in upper-secondary educa on that is similar
to the pre-1999 situa on. In addi on to 15-year-olds in grade 9, the PISA test has also been administered to grade
10 students in upper-secondary educa on in 2006 and 2009. Analysis using the data for the grade 10 test shows
signiﬁcant performance varia on between voca onal and general upper-secondary schools and a high share of
students in basic voca onal secondary schools performing below level 2 in the PISA test (Chłoń-Domińczak and
Federowicz (2014). The evidence of a re-emergence of such performance gaps in upper-secondary educa on
was one reason the authori es decided to introduce an iden cal curriculum in the ﬁrst year of upper-secondary
educa on for both general and voca onal schools.

Moreover, while Poland’s school system today is less stra ﬁed by performance and socioeconomic background,

Poland’s social assistance system for low-income families is under review. Poland’s social assistance system
comprises a considerable number of permanent and temporary cash and in-kind programs, mostly means-tested
and with diﬀering objec ves that include poverty reduc on, support to families, and support to people with
disabili es. There are also signiﬁcant, well-targeted child tax credits to low-income families. Social assistance
overall, as well as the biggest beneﬁt program, the family allowance, are well targeted, but they suﬀer from low
coverage of the poorest households and low adequacy in their beneﬁt levels. As a result, the poverty reduc on
impact is limited. This suggests the need to examine the overall eﬀec veness of the social assistance system,
especially from the perspec ve of poor families with children. Poland’s Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Labor
and Social Policy are in fact engaged in a spending review exercise focusing on strengthening ﬁnancial assistance to
low income families.
