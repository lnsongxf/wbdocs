I. Objectives
This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in Mauritius
        perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Mauritius regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Mauritius;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Mauritius;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Mauritius; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Mauritius.

       Use data to help inform the Mauritius country team’s strategy.



II. Methodology
In June and July 2012, 303 stakeholders of the World Bank in Mauritius were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President or Prime Minister;
the office of a Minister; the office of a Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial
department, or implementation agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank-
supported projects/programs; project management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a
project; local government officials or staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private
sector organizations; private foundations; the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-
based organizations (CBOs); the media; independent government institutions; trade unions; faith-
based groups; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and the judiciary branch. A total of 153
stakeholders participated in the country survey (50%).

Respondents received questionnaires via courier or post and returned it similarly. Respondents
were asked about: general issues facing Mauritius, their overall attitudes toward the Bank, the
World Bank’s effectiveness and results, the Bank’s knowledge, working with the World Bank,
the Bank’s future role in Mauritius, and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in
Mauritius.

Every country that engages in the Country Survey must include specific indicator questions that
will be aggregated for the Bank’s annual Corporate Scorecard. These questions are identified
throughout the survey report.

    A. General Issues facing Mauritius: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Mauritius
       was headed in the right or wrong direction, the three most important development
       priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and generating
       economic growth.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Mauritius, Bank staff preparedness,
   the extent to which the Bank should seek to influence the global development agenda,
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Mauritius, with which groups the Bank should
   work more in Mauritius, and how they attribute slow or failed reform efforts.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve sustainable development results in Mauritius, the extent to
   which the Bank meets Mauritius’s need for knowledge services and financial instruments, the
   extent to which the World Bank’s programs and financing contribute to improvements in
   Mauritius, and the Bank’s level of effectiveness across thirty-six development areas, such as
   economic growth and anti-corruption.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate how frequently they
   consult Bank knowledge/research, the areas on which the Bank should focus its research
   efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s knowledge/research, including
   how significant a contribution it makes to development results and its technical quality.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Mauritius: Respondents were asked to rate how
   significant a role the Bank should play in Mauritius in the near future and to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Mauritius.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate how they get
   information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, their access to the Internet, and their usage and evaluation of the
   Bank’s website. Respondents were asked about their awareness of the Bank’s Access to
   Information policy, past information requests from the Bank, and their level of agreement
   that they use more data from the World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy.
   Respondents were also asked to indicate their level of agreement that they know how to find
   information from the Bank and that the Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Mauritius, and their geographic location.

In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 90 respondents (23% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY 2007. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were
possible.

III. Demographics of the Sample (continued)

Familiarity with the World Bank

       Across all respondents, familiarity with the Bank received a mean rating of 5.7; this was
        statistically similar to the mean familiarity rating received in the FY ’07 country survey
        (5.5).
             Respondents across all stakeholder groups and geographic locations had
              statistically similar levels of familiarity with the Bank.
             It should be noted that respondents’ ratings of familiarity with the Bank were
              significantly, strongly correlated with their perceptions of the Bank’s overall
              effectiveness in Mauritius, and significantly, moderately correlated with the
              extent to which the Bank achieves developmental results in Mauritius, and the
              Bank’s relevance to Mauritius’s development.

Headed in the Right Direction

       Compared to respondents from the FY ’07 country survey, respondents in this year’s
        country survey were significantly less likely to indicate that Mauritius was headed in the
        right or wrong direction, but were instead more likely to indicate that they were not sure.
       The majority of respondents from most stakeholder groups indicated that Mauritius was
        headed in the right direction, except respondents from the media who were more likely to
        say that Mauritius was headed in the wrong direction and respondents from bilateral or
        multilateral agencies who were more likely to say that they were not sure.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness

To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable development results in Mauritius, bivariate
correlational analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the thirty-six specific areas
of effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve sustainable
development results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area
increase, respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of
effectiveness in one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results increase. Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of
effectiveness in one specific area are related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s
overall effectiveness or perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable
development results.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Mauritius. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at education;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at disaster management;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at financial markets.
             For comparison, the areas determined to be key drivers in the FY ’07 country
              survey were:
              o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to bring about economic growth;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness in encouraging greater transparency in governance;
              o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping the government stay on track with its
                  macro-economic program; and
              o The Bank’s effectiveness in helping to strengthen the regulatory framework.

       Achieving Sustainable Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest
        Pearson Product-Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results in
        Mauritius, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are drivers of
        perceptions of the Bank’s ability to help achieve sustainable development results. The
        areas determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at equality of opportunity; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth.
