THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 22,137,261

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 183*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name

Angola is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Sociedade por Quotas de
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through            Responsabilidade Limitada (LDA)

       Search for a unique company name and pick up the relevant
       certificate

       The company name can be verified at the commercial registry (Ficheiro
       Central de Denominações Sociais), affiliated with the Ministry of Justice.

       To obtain the company name certificate, an application (with copy of
       identification attached) must be filed with the one stop shop (Guichê
       Único da Empresa), as follows:
       1. State the company’s proposed name.                                                     Kz 400 + Kz 29,090

      Verify the company documents at the Guichê Único da Empresa

      Companies have 2 options: either to resort to lawyer services to draft
      the company documents or to fill in the standards documents. If the
      company decides to use the standard statutes of Association from the
      Guichê Único da Empresa (2 pages), it takes 1 hour at most. The
      applicant just enters the information (ID info of associates, address,                     the fees are
      activities of company) and confirms that the articles are applicable to                  included in the

      Obtain NIF at Guichê Único da Empresa

      Once documents are verified and completed, applicants must apply to
      the National Tax Office (Direcção National dos Impostos) to obtain the
      National Identification Number (NIF).

      Notarize company draft documents, register the company and pay
      registration fees at Guichê Único da Empresa

      The applicant submits the dossier to the Notary Public at the Guichê
      Único da Empresa. Once the Notary reviews and notarizes the dossier,
      he will have a reading with the applicant present or the accredited
      person to ensure that there are no mistakes. This service fee is included
      in the Guichê fees and takes a day depending on room availability and
      complexity of the company’s Articles of incorporation. After this lecture,
      the notary makes copies and send to each of the agencies involved a           2 days       Kz 12,000

      Social Security.

      Each agent from each institution is in charge of sending the files to
      his/her agency, but this doesn't impede on the process of registration.
      For Imprensa national, the receipt is sufficient to continue the process.

      of banco BAI within the Guichê Único da Empresa to facilitate payment
      of the different fees. Each agency and fees goes to a specific account
      and payments can be made cash or by card.

      After approval of Law n. 16/2014 of September 29, the cost of
      incorporating a Sociedade por Quotas de Responsabilidade Limitada

      Obtain the Commercial Operations Permit from the Ministry of
      Commerce

      To carry out commercial activities in Angola, a company must obtain a
      commercial operations permit (Alvará) from the Ministry of Commerce.
      To apply for the issuance of the commercial operations permit, the
      following documents must be filed with the Municipal Delegation of the
      Ministry of Commerce: (a) company’s notary deed of incorporation; (b)
      copy of the tax identification card; (c) commercial registration
      certificate; (d) statistical registration certificate; (e) extracts from the
      criminal record of the founders; (f) opinion, by the relevant
      administrative authority, on the company’s geographical location and
      social and economic feasibility; and (g) a photocopy of ID or passport.
      For the issuance of the commercial operations permit, one requirement
      is for the relevant administrative authorities to inspect the company’s
      premises to confirm they are suitable for commercial activities.
                                                                                     Between 15-45    see procedure

      Since the Decree no. 40/12 came into effect, it is now possible to get a
      provisional license right away giving the firm a permit to operate for
      180 days while the definitive license is issued by the Ministry of
      Commerce. The entrepreneur can apply online to schedule the

        Before obtaining the proof of title, BuildCo must also obtain the

        Urbana de Luanda. This is often a time-consuming procedure
        taking up to one year or more. However, it is assumed in the
        case study that BuildCo already owns the land.

        BuildCo must obtain a proof of title of property for the land from
        the Real Estate Registry in Luanda. An updated certificate of the
        property ("certidão predial") is obtained from the relevant Real
        Estate Registry. It sets out a full description of the property,
        including information on its owner and any charges, liens or

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
