   The four sources of legitimacy widely discussed in the lit-

legitimacy; shared beliefs; and international legitimacy—are
summarised in Box 1. While none of these sources of legitima-
cy exists in isolation, and no state relies solely on one of them,
their interaction is critical to how state-society relations play
out in a particular context, and impacts on fragility (OECD
2010b p12). Donors tend to focus on process and perform-

CONSTITUTIONS EMBODY THE CHARACTER of the political
settlement (see Box 2), and constitutional reform is often a
priority in post-conflict peacebuilding and state-building. In
Sierra Leone and Liberia, constitutional reform is on the

rather greater on the international side.
   In Sierra Leone, a Constitutional Review Committee was
set up in early 2007 and reported to the President in early
2008.12 Despite references as far back as 2007 in UN doc-

The evidence is now in on Anti-Corruption Commissions
in fragile settings, and it is not encouraging. In 2008,
the World Bank’s Independent Evaluation Group
released its report Public Sector Reform: What Works
and Why? Its sobering assessment is that direct meas-
ures to reduce corruption, such as anti-corruption laws
and commissions, rarely succeed. The report recom-
mends that, where strong political will and an effective
judicial system are absent, anti-corruption efforts
should focus on indirect measures such as strengthen-
ing public financial management and personnel man-
agement and information systems, making better infor-
mation available to the public in ways that stimulate
public demand for better processes, and building the
capacity of demand-side institutions like the legisla-
ture, the audit office and the media. This comes down
to repairing what is there: more laborious perhaps, but
ultimately more effective.

WHAT CAN

COUNTRY OFFICE DO?



T
          o work effectively in the business of state-building,
          we need to recognise it for the political process
          which it is, to work to understand as best as possi-
ble the context in which we are operating, and to always
analyse the potential consequences of our actions. This is an
area that demands a high degree of honesty and integrity by
international actors working with fragile and conflict-affected
states if we are to avoid doing harm.
   This paper has attempted to show some of the ways in
which we can focus and calibrate our approach as develop-
ment practitioners to positively support state-building
processes, and minimise the inadvertent harm we might do
along the way. In considering what country offices can do in
this area, we are very aware of the many competing demands
on them, and of the day to day realities of development pro-
