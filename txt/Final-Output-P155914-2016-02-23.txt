﻿I     OVERVIEW
The purpose of this policy note is to provide evidence on the level of integration between
Zimbabwe's domestic markets for grains and staple foods. In order for prices to deliver the
appropriate incentives, markets must be efficient and hence, integrated. Integrated markets have a
long-term relationship whereby price changes in one market are transmitted to another, providing
the necessary signals that guide production and trading decisions. From a theoretical perspective,
integrated markets are consistent with the law of one price, which postulates an arbitrage driven
equilibrium whereby the difference in price between two markets for the same good remains only
with the transaction costs between them, In practice, integration is a signal of well-functioning
markets that are characterized by competition, information and absence of policy impediments to
supply and demand response.
Efficient and integrated agricultural markets are an important vehicle for growth and
poverty reduction. A key stimulant to agricultural growth and poverty reduction is small farmers'
incentives, whether through higher sale prices at the farm-gate, reduced costs of production and
transport, or the spread between them. In order for prices to deliver the appropriate incentives to
smallholders, markets must be integrated and assure the participation of the poor. These factors
provide the motivation for this policy note, which covers six grain markets, across the ten
provinces of Zimbabwe, These markets represent some of the most significant products in the
economy as well as some of the most important commodity markets for the poor, both as producers
and consumers. Indeed, Zimbabwe's grain markets are estimated to contribute between 17 and 32
percent of rural household incomes
The note determines whether Zimbabwe's provincial markets are integrated and explores
the determinants of market integration. It begins by determining whether Zimbabwe's
provincial markets are integrated, and provides estimates of the speed of adjustment between
markets pairs. The analysis is then extended to investigate the extent to which distances and
demand for the products determine market integration. The paper concludes with a discussion of
other structural or policy related factors that affect integration and efficiency of domestic markets,
The literature on market integration and price transmission is vast3, and has contributed to the
understanding of market dynamics and transmission channels especially in times of global price
volatility. Price transmission analysis has been used to investigate the relationship between world
prices and local prices for given commodities, to analyze the prices of two competing commodities
(such as maize and cassava), or the prices of two commodities in the same value chain (e.g. maize
grain and maize meal). In this study, we focus on spatial integration between regional prices for
the same commodities,
Maize grain, maize meal, sorghum, cowpeas, sugar beans and groundnuts.

﻿The main finding of the study is that Zimbabwe's largest domestic grain market, the market
for maize, is segmented between surplus and deficit areas. Although maize markets tend to be
integrated within these zones, the linkages between surplus and deficit areas are weak. The other
commodities (cowpeas, groundnuts and sugar beans) have more robust level of integration with
the exception of sorghum, which has the lowest levels of market integration. However, these grains
are narrowly produced and traded.
A domestic marketing structure that is strong on aggregation and weak on arbitrage, and
high transactions costs for small traders, are highlighted as the main drivers of the observed
segmentation, In particular, a requirement for traders to obtain an annual permit at a cost of USD
1,000, doubled to USD 2,000 in case of late registration is an onerous cost that may dampen their
role in moving maize across zones. High transport costs between the regions and the low
production levels are also discussed as drivers. The policy note concludes by offering some policy
recommendations to strengthen market integration. First, liberalizing market entry for small traders
by removing the current set of administrative fees would reduce their transaction costs and
strengthen their role in facilitating spatial arbitrage. Second, prioritizing rural roads and transport
costs to and within deficit areas would reduce transaction costs and deepen integration. Lastly,
deepening the focus of key agricultural programs on stimulating production in deficit areas would
ease local food shortages and help mitigate the effects of weak market integration.
2     BACKGROUND
Grain production, maize in particular, is a dominant feature of Zimbabwe's agricultural
landscape. Agriculture plays an important role in Zimbabwe's economy and represents a major
source of income for the poorest and most vulnerable households. Its contribution to GDP averaged
11.5 percent since 2009 (figure 1) and it is the source of over 40 percent of export earnings. Grains
dominate the agricultural landscape. They are grown by over 90 percent of farming households
across the country and are both the main source of calories and income for the rural population.
Maize alone covers over 60 percent of the total cropped area and represents over 50 percent of the
average calorie intake of the population4. These trends underline the importance of efficient grain
markets for welfare, by ensuring access and affordability for consumers and the right price signals
for producers.
Zimbabwe's grain production levels have declined markedly over the past years, and imports
have come to play a growing role in domestic supply. In spite of Zimbabwe having had a long
history as a surplus producer in the southern Africa region, both yield and production levels have
declined in recent years as the sector evolved from a large-scale commercial farming structure to
one dominated by low yield smallholder production (figure 2). This trend, combined with periodic

﻿drought episodes, has opened a deficit in the national grain balance sheet. Zimbabwe's persistent
grain deficits are plugged by imports, mostly from South Africa and Zambia. During the past
decade, imports as share of maize requirement have averaged approximately 20 percent.

3      DATA AND METHODOLOGY
The analysis is based on monthly and weekly grain price series collected at main provincial
markets. Table 1 presents a summary of the dataset and its sources. Maize prices series cover all
ten provinces of Zimbabwe, whereas the selection of provinces for other commodities is guided by
the areas for which sufficient data was available. These tend to be the areas where the commodity
is produced and most frequently traded5.

In terms of methodology', the analysis of market integration relies on a vector error
correction model (VECM) to assess spatial cointegration between markets. Two variables are

﻿said to be cointegrated if they tend to move together in the long-run. Although deviations from the
equilibrium may be observed in the short-run, these are corrected in the long-run if the price
transmission mechanism is functioning and hence, the markets are said to be cointegrated. Unlike
many other studies which analyze the price transmission between domestic and world markets of
a given commodity (in this case the standard hypothesis is that world prices affect local prices),
this analysis investigates spatial price transmission between all possible combinations of domestic
markets at the provincial level.
The VECM approach is appropriate if two conditions are met. First, each price series is non-
stationary and integrated to degree 1, written as I(1). That is, the variable (commodity price) is a
random walk but the first differences (commodity return) is stationary or 1(0). Second, the
variables are cointegrated, meaning that there is a linear combination of the variables that is
stationary. If the time series of prices of a given market is not unit root, by definition, no
cointegration can be tested. Such market will be excluded from the VECM estimation. Hence, for
each pair of markets the analysis consists of three steps:
L    Unit root tests: to check whether the price process is stationary. These tests are the
Augmented Dickey-Fuller (standard, with drift and with trend), and the Phillips-Perron test
(standard or with drift).
ii.  Cointegration tests: the Engle-Granger and Johansen tests are used to determine whether
the two series are cointegrated. This indicates whether there is a long-run relation between
these two time series.
iii.  VECM: the model is estimated only for cointegrated market pairs to estimate the speed of
price adjustments between them.
4      MARKET INTEGRATION PATTERNS
The cointegration analysis detects the existence of a long-term relationship between markets
and estimates its strength. Table 2 presents a summary of the results8. Three main indicators are
presented. The first is the existence of a cointegration relationship between a market pair for a
given commodity9. This identifies the existence of a long-term relationship. The second is the long-
term elasticity, which indicates the strength of price transmission in the long-term. The third is the
speed of price adjustment between markets.
The full results of the analysis are presented in annex 11.
9 Cointegration is accepted provided that either the Engel Granger test or the Johansen tests identifies a long-tern
relationship,

﻿Maize markets
The cointegration results indicate that maize grain markets are characterized by
segmentation between the northern surplus and the southern deficit production regions0. In
general, maize grain prices in deficit production areas are not integrated with surplus areas.
Although integration is found within the two zones, grain prices in low production areas such as
Matabeleland North and South do not have a long-term relationship with prices in the main
producing areas of Zimbabwe, These regions are concentrated in the northern and eastern parts of
the country. In effect, the results show two separate enclaves, with grain moving within the surplus
and deficit producing areas but not between them (figure 3). Overall, 41 percent of the market pairs
for maize grain are integrated. The average long-term price transmission elasticity for the
integrated markets is very close to full price transmission. The speed of adjustment between these
market pairs is also high compared to the other commodities in the sample (table 2).
The only link between the surplus and deficit regions is through the Harare - Bulawayo
trading corridor. Although surplus and deficit markets are segmented, the prices series for Harare
and Bulawayo are integrated. This result reflects the aggregator role of Harare, where much of the
maize produced in the northern surplus areas is collected for milling or for shipment to
Zimbabwe's second trading and processing hubs in Bulawayo. They also reflect the structure of
Zimbabwe's road network, whereby the main provincial hubs in the southern deficit regions are
connected to northern surplus production areas through Harare.
10 Surplus/ deficit regions are defined as those with cereal production in excess/ deficit of internal requirements on
average over the last three crop seasons. See annex IV for average production gaps by region.

The segmentation extends to regional integration, whereby surplus maize grain markets are
integrated with South Africa whereas the deficit regions are not. The cointegration between
Zimbabwe and South Africa's maize grain markets is not surprising given that South Africa is the
main source of imports for closing Zimbabwe's production deficit. The liberalization of
Zimbabwe's maize market in 1990 has facilitated trade and integration with this major regional
market, What is less expected is the absence of a long-term relationship between maize prices in
Zimbabwe and Zambia. This may reflect the characteristics of the Zambia maize markets which
might not be efficient and integrated with regional and world markets."
In contrast, the markets for maize meal are relatively well integrated. Maize meal is one of
the most efficient markets in the sample with full long-term elasticity and the highest speed of
adjustment amongst the selected commodities. This is not surprising. Maize meal is the most
widely consumed staple food. Its production and distribution infrastructure is well developed with
processing hubs in both surplus and deficit areas and the co-existence of large and micro milling
industries. However, these results should be treated carefully when making comparisons, given
that domestic maize meal movements are determined by the distribution decisions of a handful of
large processors.

﻿Given the major role played by maize in Zimbabwe's food basket, the segmentation of this
market has direct implications in terms of food security and demand stimulus for
agricultural production. Although surplus and deficit regions are connected through the Harare-
Bulawayo corridor, the maize traded through this channel is mostly destined for the milling
industries that serve these large urban hubs as opposed to the small markets that serve vulnerable
and food insecure rural households2, Rural households in deficit areas rely largely on unprocessed
maize grain for their needs during pails of the year, and are more likely to purchase maize form
their neighbors than from local retailers or markets. They are also more likely to report difficulties
in sourcing maize for their basic consumption needs than in other regions (figure 4 and 5).
Therefore, the integrated markets for maize meal do not necessarily counteract the inefficiencies
stemming from segmented grain markets and their impact on growth and food security.

Other commodities
The other staple food markets are relatively well integrated in the areas where they are
traded, with the exception of sorghum. Unlike maize, small grain markets are more narrowly
transacted making the regional coverage of small grains in our sample less broad. The market
coverage for these commodities in the sample tends to be concentrated in the drier regions of the
country, with the exception of sugar beans which are more widely traded. In those areas, small
grains show robust levels of cointegrationl3. On average, 78, 60 and 52 percent of the market pairs
for groundnuts, cowpeas and sugar beans are cointegrated. The exception is in the sorghum market,
where only 17 percent of market pairs are cointegrated. Although fairly well integrated in the

﻿observed areas, small grains have slightly lower long-term elasticities and slower speeds of price
adjustment than maize, with sorghum registering the slowest rates of adjustment.
Sugar beans are the only commodity in the sample, other than maize, which is regularly
traded across surplus and deficit areas. Unlike the markets for maize grain, sugar bean markets
are integrated between surplus and deficit zones. This suggests that the observed segmentation
maybe a phenomenon that affects maize more acutely than it applies to other tradable food crops.

﻿5      DETERMINANTS OF MARKET INTEGRATION
To explore the determinants of market integration, the analysis turns to estimating the role
of distance, production and population as driving factors. Having determined the levels of
spatial integration between the main provincial markets for the selected commodities, the analysis
was extended to consider the extent to which distance between markets and the respective levels
of demand explain the observed patterns of integration'8 and the speeds of adjustment between
market pairs. The estimations focused on maize grain given that maize is the commodity in the
sample with the widest regional coverage, and to investigate the observed segmentation in this
market. Three explanatory variables were considered (i) distance between markets on major roads;
(ii) difference in production between market pairs as a share of their joint total output9; and (iii)
difference in the provincial population between market pairs as a share of their joint total
population. The first variable represents transport as the main transaction cost in the domestic
marketing of maize. It is expected that shorter distances between market pairs would increase the
level of integration between them. The second and third variables are proxies of respective levels
of demand for maize between two areas. The estimated model (OLS linear regression) is as follows
and the results of the estimations are reported in annex IV:
Cointegration, = f3z distancei + P2 production difff9 + j3 population diff.. + e
The results indicate that distances have significant and negative effect on the levels of market
integration for maize grain. In contrast, differences in production levels between market pairs
and the respective population shares were not found to have a significant effect. These results
partly confirm the observed pattern of market integration, whereby the integrated markets are
clustered within two distant zones, one in the northern fertile regions and the other in the southern
arid areas of Zimbabwe20. The distances between these two areas are large. In terms of the speed
of adjustment, the explanatory variables were not found to not have an effect. Overall, these results
suggest that although distances have the expected effect on market integration, distance,
production and populations have relatively low  levels of explanatory power for market
integration2l. Factors other than these are likely to be important determinants of both the level of
integration and the speed of adjustment between Zimbabwe domestic markets, Some of these
factors are discussed below.

﻿Other factors that influence the levels of integration
The formal marketing chain has evolved in favor of aggregation and distribution rather than
arbitrage. Zimbabwe's formal grain marketing and processing industries absorb a large share of
total production. The industry is composed of large buyers that import maize and that purchase it
on a wholesale basis in domestic markets, and large processors that mill grain to distribute it
through national networks. The industry also includes some firms that are vertically integrated
across both segments. The main function of these firms in the domestic marketing chain is to
consolidate grain in volumes large enough to feed the large scale milling industries. In other words,
they aggregate grain in the most cost effective way and process it for delivery to urban and
semi/urban consumption hubs. Arbitrage, which involves the movement of grain between surplus
and deficit areas, is the domain of a smaller, less organized group of agents: small agro dealers and
traders.
Arbitrage through informal channels is limited by the high transaction costs faced by small
traders. The spatial arbitrage between surplus and deficit areas relies largely on the operations of
small itinerant traders and agro dealers. Unlike the large formal industries, these agents are
fragmented, dispersed and under-capitalized. They typically trade in small volumes at high
transaction costs relating to search, financing and transport, amongst others. Their margins are low
and they face high entry costs associated with the administrative procedures and fees for small
traders. An important example is a requirement to obtain an annual permit at a cost of USD 1,000
for buyers, brokers or traders, which is doubled to USD 2,000 in case of late registration22. This
fee alone represents a large cost and an obstacle to market entry for small traders. The late
registration penalty also limits flexibility to enter the market for traders who are likely to operate
on an opportunistic basis as they become aware of seasonal opportunities for arbitrage or free-up
operating capital during the course of the year. Other transaction costs are also likely to be
important, particularly those related to transport. Taken together, high entry and transaction costs
and low margins will limit the number agents engaged in spatial arbitrage. These factors also
dampen the level of competition governing the first transaction in the domestic marketing chain at
the farm-gate, to the disadvantage of small farmers that have limited information and access to
markets.
The national production deficit and thin markets for small grains limit the volume of trade
and dampen the potential for integration between markets. Zimbabwe has transitioned from
being a surplus to a deficit producer of food over the past two decades. It posted a national deficit
for grain in three of the past five years (figure 6). Hence, the shortage of production may be one
of the factors limiting the volume of trade and integration between surplus and deficit regions,
particularly since a large share of surplus production in the northern regions is absorbed by the
large urban population of Harare. Moreover, most food commodities (except maize) such as small

volumes and limited marketing activity. These crops represent between 10% and 14 % percent of
household production3, and households that grow these crops are more likely to produce them for
own consumption. Only a very small share is traded (figure 7). Small grains and pulses are also
less represented in the commercial farming portfolio and in trade flows. It follows that thin markets
are less integrated and are more exposed to local demand and supply fluctuations.

6      CONCLUDING REMARKS
Using spatial price transmission analysis, this paper empirically measures the levels and
patterns of integration for some of Zimbabwe's most important domestic product markets.
Weak domestic market integration is indicative of slow spatial arbitrage. In the absence of robust
market linkages, prices are vulnerable to local availability and may fluctuate widely if domestic
markets do not respond by increasing supply during times of scarcity or by exporting surplus
during times of plenty. Weak integration would also contribute to widening the spread in prices
between surplus and deficit areas as prices in low production areas continue to reflect tight supply
conditions.
The analysis has shown that Zimbabwe's domestic markets for maize are segmented between
surplus and deficit areas. Although regional markets tend to be integrated within these zones, the
linkages between them, as indicated by systematic price co-movement, are absent. It is a finding
that is indicative of a failure in arbitrage and weak trade flows between these two zones. This
matters not only for production incentives and agricultural growth, but also for vulnerability and

﻿food security in some of Zimbabwe's poorest regions. The markets for the other small commodities
reviewed show more robust integration patterns across surplus and deficit regions.
The policy note highlights four main drivers of the observed segmentation in domestic maize
markets. (i) a domestic marketing structure that is strong on aggregation and retail distribution
but weak on arbitrage; (ii) high transaction and market entry costs facing small traders who are
main agents for arbitrage; (iii) costly domestic transport given the large distances between surplus
and deficit zones; and (iv) low national production levels and thin markets for domestic
commodities other than maize. The note concludes by discussing potential interventions and
priorities that could ease the obstacles to spatial market integration.
First, liberalizing market entry for small traders, agro dealers and brokers would reduce
their transaction costs and strengthen their role in facilitating spatial arbitrage. The current
set of administrative fees required of these agents increases their transaction costs and dampens
their role as the primary agents for spatial arbitrage. Waiving all licensing and permit fees, or
reducing them to a nominal amount, would increase the number of active traders and their
flexibility to enter the market in response to arbitrage opportunities. Other interventions that
increase their access to finance and information, and that deepen their linkages to the formal
marketing chain would also strengthen this segment of the domestic market.
Second, prioritizing rural roads and transport costs to and within deficit areas would further
reduce transaction costs and deepen integration. Prioritizing infrastructure investments in these
areas would tangibly reduce transaction costs for domestic marketing, resulting in better trade
linkages and wider spatial arbitrage. Interventions that reduce the incidental costs of road transport
such as reducing toll fees and the costs associated with controls points would also contribute to
this result.
Third, deepening the focus of key agricultural programs on stimulating production in deficit
areas would ease local food shortages and help mitigate the effects of market segmentation.
Raising agricultural production and productivity has been a priority issue for Zimbabwe, and the
recommendations to attain this goal are addressed in numerous policies, studies and textS24.
Amongst these, the findings of this paper point to the importance of increasing productivity in
deficit areas, especially for the production of small grains given the comparative advantage of
deficit areas in the production and marketing of these commodities,
Lastly, the analysis revealed differences in the extent of spatial integration between maize
(and sorghum) and the other small commodities. Various factors could explain these results.
Firstly, unlike maize and sorghum, the marketing chains for small grains do not have large formal
processing industries, Hence, their marketing networks rely more heavily on informal channels
and small traders that look to arbitrage for profit. Second, the marketing profit margins of each

﻿crop are an important factor in determining the incentive to trade in small grains. Higher margins
would raise the returns from trading, and support integration across regional borders. An analysis
of these margins by crop may yield further insights to these underlying dynamics of market
transactions. Lastly, the marketing of maize grain is a delicate issue in Zimbabwe, and is subject
to heavy attention by the authorities, Hence, its spatial market integration may be dampened to the
extent that it is subject to more burdensome administrative controls. Further analysis of these
questions that, combines quantitative value chain analysis with and qualitative assessments of
market regulations at the local level would yield further insights to the constraints to stronger
spatial integration in Zimbabwean markets.

Unit root tests
A time series y, is said to have a unit root if it follows the autoregressive process
y1 = yI + e,
where e, is a white noise. The process y, is said to be 'non-stationary' as mean is not constant
over time and variance is diverging to infinity with t --> o.
Augmented Dickey-Fuller test
This test, dubbed ADF test, is the extension of the Dickey-Fuller test allowing for more lags to
be considered. Consider an AR(3) process
y,= O y1+ 62y,2+ e3y,3+ e,
Rewriting the model as
19


﻿A y,= 0+ Pt+ TTy-t+ c1A y,-+ c2 A y,2+ e,
under the null hypothesis of unit root we have that
Ho :fw = Oagainst H, :r<0
The t-test on HGis called Augmented Dickey-Fuller test. Allowing a and 0i to be different from
zero is the version of the test which include drift and trend, respectively.
The optimal number of lags to be included can be selected relying on some goodness-of-fit
criterion, e.g. AIC or BIC.
Phillips Perron test
Whereas the ADF test involves estimating (assuming no drift/trend/lag)
A y,= ny,. + e,
the Phillips Perron test (PP) estimates
y1= p yt_[+ el
In the ADF test e, is 1(0) and can be heteroskedastic. The PP tests correct for any serial
correlation and heteroskedasticity in the errors e, non-parametrically by modifying the Dickey
Fuller test statistics. One advantage of the PP tests over the ADF tests is that the PP tests are
robust to general forms of heteroskedasticity in the error term e,.
Kwiatkowsld, Phillips, Schmidt, and Shin test
This test, known as KPSS test, differs from the previous two as the null hypothesis is now that
the process is stationary, i.e. 1(0).
Assuming no trend is present, the starting point of the test is the process
Y,     e,
where e, is stationary and  is a random walk, i.e.
+v,, v, is IID(0,a2).
If a, = 0 then 4 = o hence y, is a stationary process.
20


﻿The simple regression
y= +e2,
can be used to get an estimate of the stochastic component. Under the null hypothesis, e, is
stationary.
The test reads
Ho:o    = 0 againstH:o- >0.
The test statistic is given by
lS'
KPSS=-
where S,= Z    is a partial sum and ca  is a HAC estimator of the variance of F,.
Cointegration tests
As we are analyzing two prices at the time, the cointegration relation reads:
P1 = a + fP2 + e or P - a - #P2 = e where cis a stationary process.
Engle and Granger (1987)
Consider the following equation;
Pit  P2 + Ut
If u, is non-stationary, then p, - fp2, is not a cointegrating relationship. Engle and Granger
suggested estimating the above relation via OLS and then testing for the presence of a unit root
on the estimated residuals ii, in order to test the null of no cointegration.
Johansen (1988, 1991)
Consider at VAR of two variable p,,and p,, and two lags, i.e. a VAR(2)
21


﻿This VAR(2) has Vector Error Correction (VECM) representation
n1       (A,- A,- I1)       l
Pv       2,              t- I  (V2
The rank of the matrix (A - A2 1) is equal to the number of cointegrating vectors. If it is 2,
both variables are stationary. If it is 0 the non cointegration relation is present. If it is equal to 1
then the variables are cointegrated.
With two price variables, cointegration can be assessed by testing the significance of the
characteristic roots or eigenvalues of (A, - A2 - I). If the variable are cointegrated then
0 < , <I andk  = 0. Johansen (1988, 1991) derived the distribution of the two statistics for the
null of no cointegration referred as the Trace and Maximum Eigenvalues test.
Vector Error Correction Model
The VECM model takes the general form:
q
Apt :7-a+Ht-         ,r AP- + Vt
where
Ptis nxl the vector of n price variables
Ais the difference operators so that Ap = Pt - Pt-1
vt is an nxl vector of error terms
a is nx1 vector of estimated parameters describing the trend component
II is an nxn matrix of estimated parameters that describe the long-term relationship and the
error correction adjustment
Fk is a set of nxn matrices of estimated parameters that describe the short-run relationship
between prices, one for each of the q lags included in the model.
Since we only consider pairs of variables, each representing the prices in a pair of commodity
market in Zimbabwe, the VECM specification can be simplified and re-written as:
22


﻿Apft = a + 0(p     - flpU) + 8Ap1 ± pApf_+ Vt
where
pt and pf are the (log) prices of a given commodity in Market A and Market B,
respectively
a, 0, fl, 6 and p are parameters to be estimated.
If prices are I(1), the first difference Aptwill be stationary or 1(0).
The following interpretation is given to the model parameters
1. With prices expresses in logarithm, the cointegration factor flrepresents the long-run
elasticity of the prices in Market A with respect to Market B. Hence flis the long-run
elasticity of price transmission. For example, if P = 0.5, 50 percent of the proportional
change in prices of Market B will be transmitted to prices of Market A in the long-run.
2. The error correction coefficient 6 reflects the speed of adjustment. The term
represents the deviation or 'error' between prices in the previous period and the long-run
relationship between the two prices. If the 'error' is positive (price in Market A is too high
given the long-term relationship) then a negative value of 0 helps correcting the 'error' by
making it more likely that the Ap' is negative. The larger Oin absolute value, the more
quickly the price in Market A will return to the value consistent with its long-term
relationship to Market B.
3. The coefficient N of change in prices of Market B is the short-run elasticity of prices in
Market A relative to prices in Market B, It represent the percentage adjustment of Market
A prices one period after a 1 percent shock to Market B prices.
4. The coefficient of the lagged change in prices of Market A (p) is the autoregressive term,
reflecting the effect of each change in the price of Market A on the next period changes of
prices in the same market.
After the VECM model is estimated - only for pairs in which the cointegration hypothesis cannot
be rejected - statistical significance of each coefficient is assessed in order to be able to correctly
comment on the long-run equilibrium values, elasticities and speeds of adjustment. In a last step,
for statistically significant speeds of adjustment, half-lives are computed. The half-life statistic
measures how long it takes to correct 50 percent of the deviation (or 'error') of the two prices from
the long-run equilibrium. It is calculated as:
Half Life     -logl(2)
