 n 2014, over half of the world’s population was residing in urban areas. Continuing population growth
 and urbanization are projected to raise this to two-thirds, adding 2.5 billion people to the world’s
 urban population by 2050, with nearly 90 per cent of this increase concentrated in Asia and Africa.
With rapid urbanization, competition for water resources across all sectors will become fierce. At
the same time, raw water sources risk becoming more contaminated through changes in land use
patterns, poor solid waste and stormwater management, inadequate wastewater treatment, aging
infrastructure, and unbridled formal and informal urban expansion. Climate change is adding more
uncertainty and vulnerability to these challenges as water management has to take into account the
additional stresses stemming from rising temperatures, changes in precipitation patterns and weather
variability. Consequently, the quantity and quality of water available to cities for agriculture, energy,
industry and human development needs is, and will remain, in constant flux. With many sectors relying
on the same river basin, the competitive dynamics at play require a paradigm shift to an integrated
approach to urban water management.
    In response to these challenges, integrated urban water management (IUWM) aims to improve
the way resources are managed across the urban water cycle by promoting resource diversification,
system efficiency and conservation, while taking into account all water users in the city and in the
wider catchment through broad stakeholder participation.
    IUWM is an integral component of sustainable cities and metropolitan areas. The four dimensions
of sustainability: clean and green, inclusive, resilient, and productive are inextricably linked to IUWM.
Reducing pollution loads and making sure every drop of water is used in the most efficient manner
are integral concepts of IUWM. Providing water services to excluded populations, and enhancing the
resilience of cities to water disasters are key pillars of IUWM. Finally, competitive and productive cities
not only need to provide water services for businesses and industries, but also need to be ready to
deal with the extreme variability of water and the disruptions it can cause; water shortages and floods
reduce the competitiveness of cities.
    This Guidance Note was produced as part of the Water Global Practice’s Science of Delivery in
Urban Water Supply and Sanitation initiative, and under the auspices of the IUWM Knowledge Silo
Breaker which is supported by the Urban, Environment and Water Global Practices. It aims to bridge
the gap between knowledge and implementation by capturing tacit knowledge and facilitating World
Bank teams’ requests for practical guidance on how to engage with clients under an IUWM approach.
    The Guidance Note is designed as a key entry document with links to existing and future material
which provide depth of information on specific IUWM topics for development practitioners. It aims to

1.1 Objective and Structure

The objective of this document is to provide guidance for managing the urban water cycle in a sustain-
able manner, with a focus on cities in developing countries. In doing so, the Bank is promoting a para-
digm shift to more holistic and sustainable management of urban and water resources by applying
an Integrated Urban Water Management (IUWM) approach to the broad water challenges commonly
faced in developing country cities around the world.
    IUWM is not a new concept; its principles have been outlined elsewhere before and are refered
to in a variety of ways (Cities of the Future (IWA) or Water Sensitive Cities (Wong 2009) and with dif-
ferent acronyms (Sustainable Drainage Systems (SUDS), in the UK, or Water Sensitive Urban Design
(WSUD), in Australia). The objective of this Guidance Note is not to add to the theoretical framework
but to provide practical references and recommendations for the Bank and for other development
practitioners working on the issues of water in cities in developing countries. IUWM is multi-sectorial
in nature, and this note specifically targets staff working in several Global Practices of the Bank: Water
(particularly urban Water Supply and Sanitation (WSS) and Water Resources Management (WRM)),
Urban (particularly urban services provision, Disaster Risk Management, and urban upgrading), Envi-
ronment, and Climate Change, as well as Social and Environmental Specialists involved in the design
and implementation of Bank projects. A separate version of the Guidance Note will be published for an
external audience, aimed at Bank clients such as municipal, central and regional governments, water
utilities, river basin authorities, urban planners, and other relevant stakeholders and decision makers.
    After a brief introduction to the concept of IUWM (Section 1), this Guidance Note profiles the differ-
ent IUWM approaches applied in three types of city: a water-scarce, fast-developing city (Windhoek,
Namibia), an expanding city subject to climate extremes (Melbourne, Australia), and a dense, flood-
prone city (Rotterdam, the Netherlands). It also profiles an example of Bank engagement under an
IUWM approach in a fast-growing city in a middle-income country (Vitória in Espírito Santo, Brazil).
    The final section of the Guidance Note showcases a potential methodology for applying an IUWM
approach in a city, from the initial engagement and diagnostic phases toward the application of a full
IUWM umbrella framework under which a program (or a series of operational loans and analytical
activities) can be implemented.
    Throughout this Guidance Note, we will refer to the city and the urban or metropolitan areas inter-
changeably—the area of interest being the urban agglomeration (including informal areas and other
urbanized zones) rather than the jurisdiction of the city per se.

                    tors; a situation which is further exacerbated by             groundwater sources. These circumstances,
                    increasing urbanization, demographic growth,                  in turn, further exacerbate the security of

         Framework
 Legal and water quality drivers: In Buenos Aires, the Supreme Court of Argentina ruled that authorities
 were responsible for controlling the environmental degradation of the Matanza Riachuelo River, and
 ordered an accelerated action program for the cleanup of the river, which provided an entry point for an
 IUWM approach supported by the Bank.

 Water quality regulation and political drivers: Rotterdam turned to an IUWM framework as a means of
 complying with more stringent national and EU regulation for water quality, but also as a result of a
 strong political push at the municipal level to turn Rotterdam into a model “water city” and make it more
 attractive to potential residents.

 Scarcity of water resources and governance drivers: Windhoek and Melbourne both took an integrated
 approach to dealing with water resources scarcity. In Melbourne, the water resources scarcity issue only
 arose in recent years, due to strong demographic growth, climate variability, and related extreme events;
 while in Windhoek, an integrated approach to water supply has been in place for half a century due to
 the arid climate. In both cases, municipal governance structures helped with the implementation of an
 integrated approach: Melbourne has the institutional and governance structure to veto development
 in areas of flood risks; and Windhoek has the authority to extend its municipal territory to prevent
 development in areas where aquifer recharge takes place.

       ence point for Task Team Leaders looking for more context or examples of what has been
       done elsewhere. It also provides an illustration of the type of IUWM approaches that have been
implemented in four reference cities:

●●   The water-scarce city, where water resource constraints have traditionally been the main driver
     for an IUWM approach (e.g., Windhoek, Namibia, with 322,500 residents)
●●   The city of extreme events, where resilience and adaptation to climate extremes are the main driv-
     ers for an IUWM approach (e.g., Melbourne, Australia, with 4.3 million residents)
●●   The coastal, flood-prone city, where managing water pollution and environmental health are the
     main drivers for an IUWM approach (e.g., Rotterdam, the Netherlands, with 625,000 residents)
●●   The case of the Bank’s engagement under an IUWM approach in a fast-growing, developing city
     (Vitória, Brazil, with 1.7 million residents).



2.1 The water-scarce city: Windhoek, Namibia

Namibia is the most arid country in Sub-Saharan Africa, with a generally hot and dry climate, marked
by sparse and erratic rainfall. The country has perennial rivers only on its very northern and very
southern borders, respectively 750 and 900 km from the capital, Windhoek, which lies in the country’s
geographical center. In Windhoek, the average minimum and maximum temperatures range respec-
tively from 6°C to 20°C in July (winter) to 17°C to 29°C in January (summer), the average annual rainfall
is 360 mm, and average annual evaporation is 3400 mm (Lahnsteiner 2007).


2.1.1 Diagnostic
Windhoek has seen a major increase in population, with the number of residents increasing from
190,000 in 1990 to 350,000 today, and a current population growth rate of 5 percent per year. The
city is governed by a municipal Council, which officially extended Windhoek’s boundaries in 2011 to
accommodate the vast number of people coming to the capital city and to regulate construction by
developers of private residential areas outside the city’s boundaries. Aside from a severe housing cri-
sis that has pushed up house prices by more than 80 percent over the past five years and pushed out
low-income earners to informal, densely populated townships, Windhoek faces WSS service delivery

     nternational and World Bank experience shows that the transition to an IUWM approach in a city is
     often an incremental process, usually triggered by one or several drivers, be they social (such as
     rapid urbanization, as in Vitória), economic (such as increased demand for a “liveable” space, as in
Rotterdam), or environmental (such as water quality issues, water scarcity or climate extremes, as in
Melbourne and Windhoek).


       In OECD countries, ageing infrastructure, extreme weather events, and national laws and regula-
tions are the main drivers affecting the governance of urban water management (OECD 2015). Daniell
et al. (2015) define more broadly the following factors as potential drivers for transition to an integrated
approach to urban water management (see Box 4 for more examples of drivers to IUWM):

●●     Population growth, demographic change, and increasing urbanization, all adding to growing
       demand for water supply and sanitation/wastewater treatment services, as well as changes in the
       hydrological cycle at the local level, as seen in Espírito Santo.
●●     Increasing resource scarcity, including water (both in quantity and quality), as seen in Windhoek;
●●     Technological innovation including, among others, smart grids and ICT tools;
●●     New water governance approaches and systems, such as the public’s higher demand for citizen
       participation and transparency;
●●     Changing water values and cultures, resulting in higher demand for environmentally friendly
       approaches, as seen in Rotterdam;
●●     Climate variability and global changes, which require decision making for long-term urban invest-
       ments under increasing uncertainty, as seen in Melbourne;
●●     Ecosystem degradation and the growing awareness of the need to protect river ecosystems in
       urban environments; and
●●     Political ideology and development of international norms (such as the “green growth” movement).


       Virtually all of the world’s cities are subject to such economic, social, and environmental changes,
so why is it that only a handful have started to transition to an IUWM approach to tackling them?

                     view the transition to IUWM in cities as similar to              correct, or by facing the challenges of retrofitting
                     technological transitions, with sequential phases                existing infrastructure to evolving pressures

       when engaging with a city under an IUWM approach, and referencews supporting material and
       resources for Bank task teams and their city counterparts. The activities listed do not represent
a checklist—not all of the activities below need to be implemented, nor do they have to be undertaken
in the order suggested here. Each project’s specific approach will vary depending on local conditions
and drivers, as well as on the experience of the city in applying an integrated approach, the length of
the Bank’s prior engagement in the relevant sector(s), and the client’s interest and capacity.

Resources
Undertaking analytical work, a technical assistance (TA) program, or preparing for an investment project
will require staff time, technical capacity, and funding, all of which are normally limited. Cofinancing with
other donors may be a good way to secure additional funds and technical support, as well as to pave the
way for a coordinated approach among donors.

Note: The range of unit costs (vertical lines) are based on the technologies and approaches used. For example, unit
costs for water demand management depend on the quality and type of water saving devices; leakage management
costs depend on the cost of water production and leakage control strategies; greywater costs depend on the
treatment choices; stormwater costs depend on whether structural and/or nonstructural measures are applied;
rainwater harvesting costs depend on whether simple storage tanks or pumping to elevated reservoirs are required.

                                adoption of natural systems for improved water quality
                       Driven by the need to comply with regulatory demands for improved water quality, DC Water (the
                       water and sanitation utility of the District of Columbia in the United States) has been implementing the
                       Clean Rivers Project since 2007. This US$2.6 billion project aims to decrease the volume of combined
                       sewers overflow (CSO) by 96 percent for all of DC’s waterways—the Anacostia and Potomac rivers as
                       well as Rock Creek. In May 2015, DC Water announced an agreement with the District of Columbia, the
                       Environment Protection Agency, and the Department of Justice, which modifies the terms of the project
                       to include the use of some IUWM options instead of only constructing underground tunnel systems to
                       control CSO. These IUWM options include natural systems such as green roofs, porous pavements, and
                       rain gardens, to treat stormwater prior to discharge, as well as rainwater harvesting. The Project has
                       been given a 7-year extension to allow for the additional time needed to encourage the construction of
                       green infrastructure and is now expected to be completed by 2032.

                       The success of DC Water’s amended Clean Rivers Project rests on convincing both private and public
                       land owners to construct green roofs, porous pavements, and rain gardens, and encourage the uptake
                       of rain barrels. DC Water’s tactics includes partnering with nonprofit groups to raise awareness and
                       increase uptake of these systems, as well as coordinating with the District of Columbia—the primary
                       public landowner in the area—and particularly its environmental regulator, the District Department of
                       the Environment (DDOE).

                       Since 2013, and as part of the Mayor’s Sustainable DC Plan, DDOE has been running the RiverSmart
                       Program, which provides financial incentives to help District land owners install the green infrastructure
                       DC Water is planning for, such as rain barrels, green roofs, rain gardens, and permeable pavements.
                       Financial support from DDOE includes rebates and subsidies for construction of green infrastructure,
                       as well as discounts on environmental pollutions fees. A number of targeted areas of importance to
                       the watershed are given additional incentives to encourage private uptake of stormwater management.
                       Furthermore, DDOE regulation requires new development and large renovations of properties in the
                       District to install stormwater pollution control measures. DC Water is also running an extension of the
                       DDOE’s RiverSmart program, by providing their customers with a discount on the impervious area
                       charge if they have taken stormwater management measures.

                       In 2013, DDOE also launched an innovative Stormwater Retention Credit Trade, which is the first of its
                       kind in the United States. Private property owners can generate Stormwater Retention Credits (certified
                       by DDOE) by installing green infrastructure that captures and retains stormwater runoff; these Credits
                       can then be sold in an open market to buyers who can use them to meet DC’s regulatory requirements
                       for retaining stormwater for new building or major renovations.

    An early champion of the IUWM approach was the EU-funded SWITCH project, which was
implemented between 2006 and 2011 and researched IUWM approaches around several interrelated
themes: water supply, stormwater, wastewater, planning for the future, engaging stakeholders, and
decision-support tools. The research project engaged with 12 cities around the world, by empowering
them to develop a vision for water in their city 30 to 50 years into the future, and to think of an integrated
approach that might benefit them. These cities included Accra (Ghana), Lima (Peru), Bogota and Cali
(Colombia), Alexandria (Egypt), Tel Aviv (Isreal), Łódź (Poland), Beijing (China), Belo Horizonte (Brazil),
Birmingham (UK), Hamburg (Germany) and Zaragoza (Spain). A useful resource is the SWITCH Train-
ing Kit, which contains several modules that can be used to organize a workshop and explore IUWM
options. The SWITCH project also documented case studies of cities that had made progress in transi-
tioning to various stages of sustainable urban water management, including Berlin, Seoul, and London.


  All documentation from the SWITCH project, including diagnostics of urban and water
    challenges for the above cities, training resources, case studies, and IUWM knowledge
    base can be found at http://www.switchurbanwater.eu/index.php.
  The SWITCH Training Kit can be accessed at http:/    /www.switchtraining.eu/trainer-
    materials/ and includes the following modules: (1) Strategic Planning – Preparing for
    the Future; (2) Stakeholders – Involving All the Players; (3) Water Supply – Exploring the
    Options; (4) Stormwater – Exploring the Options; (5) Wastewater – Exploring the Options;
    and (6) Decision-Support Tools – Choosing a Sustainable Path.

    The tangible outcomes for the cities involved in the SWITCH project are quite difficult to assess,
as the processes and outcomes related to the transition to an IUWM mindset varied between the

           eveloping an IUWM Approach in Brazil: an overview of Bank
 Box 6. ■ D
          support in São Paulo, Paraná and Espírito Santo
 An IUWM approach has been adopted in a number of water and urban projects in Brazil over the past
 two decades. The information below refers to the following Bank-funded projects implemented between
 1992 and 2007: the Water Quality and Pollution Control Project in São Paulo and Paraná, and the Water
 and Coastal Pollution Management Project in Espírito Santo (World Bank 2007).

 •	       The overarching objective of these projects was to preserve and improve water quality; poverty
          alleviation was also central to these projects, as the choice of target areas coincided with poverty
          alleviation and watershed management strategies.
 •	       The São Paulo Water Quality and Pollution Control Project (the ‘Guarapiranaga’ project,
          1994–2000), a US$ 387 million project cofinanced by the state government, the state water utility,
          the municipality of São Paulo and the Bank, initiated the study of the Guarapiranga watershed,
          strengthened the institutional capacity to manage the watershed in an environmentally sustainable
          manner, and improved the quality of life of the watershed’s slum dwellers by providing them with
          water supply, sanitation and related services. The achievements of the Guarapiranga project
          included reversing the pollution of the Guarapiranga reservoir, used as a potable resource fo the
          city of São Paulo, and improving the quality of life and environmental health of a large number of
          slums surrounding the reservoir. The project also contributed to increased community awareness.
          Project outcomes were reflected in the enhanced level of respect for public areas, equipment and
          amenities, in the concomitant upgrading of housing with residents’ own funds, and in the overall
          post-program increase in real estate values. Guarapiranga also helped show how to integrate
          interventions within a complex institutional framework involving different levels of government
          (state and municipal) and myriad service providers.
 •	       In Paraná, the objective was to rehabilitate and maintain the river and its larger watershed as a
          reliable water source, and to promote flood control and rehabilitation of flooded areas in Curitiba.
 •	       In Espírito Santo, the objectives were to improve the efficiency of the state water company and provide
          appropriate water and sanitation infrastructure to low-income urban areas of the capital city, Vitória.


 Research conducted during the implementation of the projects generated evidence that the problem of
 water quality was not just caused by industrial waste, as was initially thought, but mostly by domestic
 wastewater. These findings confirmed the importance of including the upgrading of informal settlements
 to include adequate wastewater, stormwater and solid waste management in them as a way of reversing
 broader water quality challenges in the cities; they also highlighted the importance of undertaking
 strong monitoring and data collection.

 An IUWM approach has been adopted by follow-up projects in Brazil, notably in São Paulo, Espírito
 Santo and Teresina.

                Literature Review: The IUWM

     ucci (2007) argues that there are three sequential stages in the development of urban water
     services in developed countries, namely:

●●   Interventions prior to the 1970s, concerned with public health;
●●   Urban water management from the 1970s to the 1990s, concerned with corrective measures to
     improve water quality and quantity;
●●   From 1990 onward, a paradigm shift to sustainable water management.


     The Water Sensitive Cities Framework (Wong 2009) has also been used to describe the stages
in a city’s development and urban water management (Figure 12). More specifically, it describes
the various stages that developed cities have historically taken to develop, and the drivers that have
pushed for paradigm shifts in urban water management. While most cities in the developed world by
the early 20th century had gone through the first phases and have recently begun to shift from the
concept of “drained city” to that of “environmental city,” only a few have started to transition to the
stage of the “water cycle city”, while the “water sensitive city” remains an aspiring concept that has
yet to be translated into reality.
     The advantage of this framework is that it gives a historical perspective to the development of
urban water management in cities and underpins the potential for cities in developing countries, which
may be at the “water supply” or “sewered” city stage, to ‘leapfrog’ across several stages to that of a
“water sensitive” city by avoiding the loss of environmental capital that developed cities are now trying
to correct/reverse.
     However, it may also be difficult to characterize developing cities using this framework, as it may
be too monolithic in practice: a developing city may exhibit aspects of the waterway city in some
areas (e.g., the business district), of the drained city in others, of the sewered city or the water sup-
ply city elsewhere, or have no services at all in informal areas. For instance, a city like Nairobi may
provide water supply, sewerage services and drainage to parts of its city, but some areas may not
benefit from any of these services at all—therefore making its insertion with this framework more
problematic.
     A more pragmatic approach was chosen by Jacobsen et al. (2012), who emphasized the need
to analyze the institutional capacity of cities as well as their water-related challenges when consider-
ing an IUWM approach in developing countries. These criteria make sense in a developing context
and have been emphasized earlier in this guidance note (Section 1.2.4): an IUWM approach may

 Sector             Challenges
 Solid waste        What entities are involved in solid waste collection, and what percentage of the city is
                    covered?
                    What is the percentage of solid waste produced that is collected?
                    Is there a program of minimizing and recycling/reusing solid waste?
                    Is there an adequate solid waste disposal site? Is it managed sustainably?
                    What percentage of solid waste produced is disposed of adequately?
                    What is the coverage and frequency of street cleaning?
