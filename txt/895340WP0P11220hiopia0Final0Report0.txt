Executive Summary
  Corruption is the misuse of public authority for private benefit. It is generally viewed as an
  additional cost of doing business or a tax on profits. As a result, corruption can be expected
  to decrease the expected profitability of investment projects. Investors will therefore take
  the level of corruption in a host country into account in making decisions to invest abroad.


  The World Bank (WB) Group has identified “corruption as the single greatest obstacle to
  economic and social development.”1                    According to the WB Group it undermines
  development by distorting the rule of law and weakening the institutional foundation on
  which economic growth depends.


  Cognizant of this fact, the Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) is
  undertaking numerous activities to combat corruption in the country. As part of this effort,
  FEACC in collaboration with donors has commissioned this study to assess the perception
  of corruption risk held by foreign direct investors in Ethiopia, in view of identifying
  remedial action and training to those high risk sectors and institutions.


  The study was based on interviewing 350 random sample executives of foreign companies2
  which were active in all regional states of the country and all economic sectors. The
  respondents owning the foreign direct investments were citizens of 42 countries coming
  from all continents except Latin America.


  The major issues that were targets of opinion assessment during the survey were:
        1. The conduciveness of the legal environment of Ethiopia for foreign investors;
        2. The difficulties associated with registering, opening and running foreign owned
             businesses;
        3. The current perceived level of corruption faced by foreign investors in their day-to-
             day running of their businesses as well as the perceived changes in the level of
             corruption during the last three years;

   The Federal Investment Agency provided us with the address of all the foreign companies operating in Ethiopia
  that were registered after 2005. The total number of these companies is 1201.
                                                                                       Page   ix
      4. The frequency and actual incidence of "unofficial payment" requests by employees
          in key government owned service delivery agencies;
      5. The perception of level of corruption with regard to Government Procurement;
      6. And last but not least, their suggestions to improve the foreign direct investment
          (FDI) climate in the country.


The majority of the respondents believed that obtaining information related to the rules
and regulations is easy and the interpretation of regulations is consistent and predictable.
In the opinion of those who have been running businesses for more than three years, there
has been an improvement in the rules and regulations concerning foreign investment. The
confidence of the foreign investors was also highlighted by their 85% positive response to
the question of whether they believed that the legal system in Ethiopia will uphold their
contract and property rights in business disputes if they are the aggrieved party.


However, foreign investors identified major obstacles related to three key areas of their
operations in the regulations governing foreign currency, land acquisition and
customs/foreign trade. These appear to be the reasons for the respondents’ judgements
that the country's legal environment is "Somehow attractive (32.6%)" and "Not attractive
(12.9%)"


The respondents also pointed to the impact of bureaucratic inefficiencies on the
registering, opening and running foreign owned businesses, and indicated that the whole
registration process, i.e., from document authentication to getting a legal business license
takes on average about 8 days. This may seem a reasonable length of time but it does not
compare favorably with the fact that it takes only 2 days in Rwanda 3.


With regard to the perceived levels of corruption faced by foreign investors in the day-to-
day running of their businesses, some of the respondents (32%) indicated that it is
common to pay some unofficial payment and more than 10% said this happens either
mostly or always. This should be a cause for concern even though it mostly involves petty
corruption and the proportion of respondents reporting the practice is not large. The
survey results showed that in most cases the unofficial payment is not communicated to
the respondents directly by those seeking it, but rather indirectly in the form of "hints" in

                                                                                        Page   ix

the form of procedural delays, citing regulations that suggest process complications,
making themselves "unavailable", etc... We feel that these are the typical maneuverings of
corrupt employees seeking unofficial payment and, most of the times they exploit
weaknesses in the transparency of working procedures and systems.


On the other hand, about two third of the respondents indicated that they believe that if an
employee acts against the rules they can go to his/her superior to get proper treatment.
Almost 60% of the respondents stated that they would not give any bribe money if asked.
The data pattern also showed that being asked for bribes did not translate directly to actual
unofficial payments. However, in the case of traffic police those who paid willingly bribe
money are more than those who were asked for it. These results should be interpreted
carefully because some of the respondents wish to not be "perceived corrupt" by the
interviewers. This can lead us to believe that corruption prevention may be easily
strengthened by creating more awareness and confidence of foreign investors that going to
the superior can solve the problem and that not paying unofficial money is the correct and
moral thing to do.


Except for the traffic police, the findings show that reported incidences of actual corruption
in 14 key service delivery Government agencies is limited to less than 6% of respondents
ranging from 0.6% to 5.1%. The agencies/areas where there are reports of actual bribe
money payment by more than 3% of the respondents include the Electric Power Company
(5.1%), Customs (4.9%), Federal/Local police (4%) and Construction Permits( 3.4%).
Those who reported having made some sort of unofficial payment indicated that the
amount can range from 50 Birr (or USD 2.60) to Birr 50, 000 (or USD 2,605.00). By
international standards, this can only be categorized as petty corruption. However, since
there should be zero tolerance for corruption coupled with the identification of the above
agencies as places where most of the reported actual corruption takes place, the FEACC and
those Agencies cited above should look to ways to reduce the levels of petty corruption by
implementing appropriate policy measures.


The key battleground against corruption in many countries should focus on government
procurement. The appreciation of this fact led the Government to issue several
proclamations in just few years, an indication that the GOE is serious about preventing
corruption. On the positive side, only 0.6% of respondents indicated personal exposure to
actual corruption in government procurement. This should be interpreted carefully
                                                                                             Page   x

because of the tendency of respondents to avoid self-incrimination. It is also good to note
that only 10% of the respondents said that a complex Government procurement process
has been a major problem for their businesses.            However, asked about their overall
perception, they gave a different picture. When asked for their opinion on the following
statement: "Contracts relating to government procurement are generated in a clear and
efficient manner" only 7.4% believed this statement to be true while 21% believed it is not
true at all. Despite the fact that the latter figure is relatively low, the great majority of those
who responded (80%) believed that government contracts involve unofficial payments in 2
to 50%cases. Additionally, they believed that the unofficial payment can be up to 10% of
the contract price.    Thus, one area for further improvement is clearly the Government
Procurement System.


Among other things, success in combating corruption is dependent on the willingness of
the public to report corrupt practices. The survey results show some reluctance on the
part of foreign investors to make such reports due to a number of reasons, including the
belief that no action will be taken against those involved in corruption (43%) and a lack of
clarity about corruption reporting procedures (41.7%). Hence, it is clear that
improvements in these areas are needed from FEAC and other stakeholders.


Finally, the respondents expressed opinions about what should be done to combat
corruption and attract more FDI to Ethiopia. About 55% of them believe that corruption is
less in Ethiopia than similar developing countries. However, to further improve the
environment for FDI, they suggested many improvements but the most important is that
Government Agencies involved with foreign investors should work in an integrated
manner, and if possible a "one window shop" for licensing, customs clearing, land
acquisition, etc should be established.
1. Introduction
      The Federal Ethics and Anti-Corruption Commission (FEACC) was established in 2001 -
      Through Proclamation No. 235/2001 - as an independent federal government agency with
      the following three objectives:

          1. To create awareness in Ethiopian society that corruption will not be condoned or
             tolerated by promoting ethics and anti-corruption education;
          2. To prevent corruption offenses and other improprieties; and
          3. To strive to create and promote integrity in public services by detecting,
             investigating, and prosecuting suspected cases of corruption offenses and other
             improprieties.

      In 2005, the Commission‘s establishment, special procedures, and rules of evidence
      proclamations were amended by the House of People‘s Representatives (Proclamation No.
      433/2005). The amendment was necessary to ensure that the Commission‘s operation and
      activities are transparent and accountable. The amendment also enabled the Commission
      to prevent, investigate and prosecute corruption, and redefined its powers and duties in
      line with the amended criminal code of the country. The revised FEACC Establishment
      Proclamation of 2005 resulted in the modification of the Commission‘s objectives. The
      Commission‘s revised objectives are as follows:

          1. In cooperation with relevant bodies, to strive to create awareness in Ethiopian
             society that corruption will not be condoned or tolerated by promoting ethics and
             anti-corruption education;
          2. In cooperation with relevant bodies, to prevent corruption offenses and other
             improprieties; and
          3. To expose, investigate, and prosecute corruption offenses and improprieties.

      The Commission believes that its efforts should be based and assisted by focused research
      on corrupt practices. In line with this, the Commission has mobilized various studies aimed
      at supporting the ongoing fight against corruption. These include:

          1. Diagnosing Corruption in Ethiopia: Perception, Realities and the Way Forward for
             Key Sectors;

FEAC in Collaboration with JGAM Donors - Survey on The Perception of the level of Corruption by Foreign Investors in Ethiopia
                                                                                    Page   2

As an additional research effort, the FEACC in collaboration with donors supporting the
Joint Governance Assessment and Measurement (JGAM) fund (managed by the World
Bank) decided to conduct focused research on the perceptions of corruption risk held by
foreign direct investors in Ethiopia. This findings and recommendations of this research
are the subject of this report and will augment the findings of the prior research
undertaken in 2012 by the FEACC, JGAM donors and the World Bank entitled “Diagnosing
Corruption in Ethiopia: Perceptions, Realities, and the way forward for key Sectors.” The
current study targeted foreign investors operating in Ethiopia and gathered their views,
perceptions and experiences regarding corrupt practices in the country. The study mainly
assessed their perceptions and also any corruption challenges they faced either in starting
up their business, or in maintaining day-to-day operations. Issues covered in the study
include the ease of business start-up, obtaining licenses and appropriate registration,
capitalization, and issues relating to tax and customs. In addition to their perceptions of
corruption, foreign investors were surveyed to gather data about their views on the
strength of Ethiopian institutions in combating corrupt practices and their experiences
with actual instances of attempted or successful malpractice.

The report is conveniently divided into six sections including this introduction. The next
section presents the objective and expected outputs of the consulting assignment. Section
Three deals with the methodology of the study and Section Four outlines the results of the
literature review. The core section, Section Five describes in detail the findings of the
survey. In Section Six, the major conclusions and recommendation of the study are put
forward. Additional information is also presented in annexes.

2 Objectives and Scope of Work

                                       2.1 Objectives


    The Terms of Reference (TOR) define, the objective of the study as “find out the general
    perception level of corruption in Ethiopia and identify the sectors and public sector
    institutions that are more prone to corruption according to foreign investors operating
    in Ethiopia, with a view to identify remedial action and training to those high risk areas
    and institutions at a later date.” (TOR P. 3)



                                    2.2 Scope of Work


    The TOR calls for a baseline survey of Foreign Investors currently operating in Ethiopia.
    The list of foreign firms will be made available to the FEACC by the Foreign Investment
    Office. The survey will be conducted by a consulting firm which shall complete the
    following tasks:

               Develop a survey questionnaire in partnership with the FEACC which will
                collect all data relevant to the exercise;
               Using the questionnaire, survey a representative sample of foreign direct
                investors;
               Encode the data; ensure utilization of a data entry software that simulates
                the designed data/information collection instruments and provides audit
                trail print outs of questionnaires to verify the data entered.
               Analyze the survey results and produce a clear and concise draft report,
                including an executive summary of not more than five pages, to be delivered
                to the FEACC and JGAM partners;
               Present draft findings and recommendations to the relevant stakeholders in
                a feed-back gathering workshop;
               Incorporating the comments of the stakeholders into a final version of the
                report;
               On conclusion of the research, provide the FEACC and stakeholders with both
                hard and soft copies of the report.

  The scope of the baseline survey includes data gathering, encoding, conducting statistical
  analysis, developing general recommendations and delivering the output to the FEAAC. The
  TOR required that the consulting firm should survey approximately 300 investment firms
                                                                                     Page   4

operating in the country. The sample firms must be representative of the eight sectors
identified in the earlier studies and all regions of the country. The sample size and
selection method should be agreed with the FEAAC and the JGAM partners.



                    2.3 Expected Deliverables/Specific Outputs


As per the TOR (Pp.4-5), the deliverables of the consulting contract are:

             Deliver all the Questionnaires that were filled by the Foreign Investors;
             To deliver the encoded data which is gathered from the questionnaires by
              soft copy
             To make necessary statistical roundups and submit in both hard and soft
              copy.
             Produce a draft report and, taking into account stakeholder comments
              produce a final report

3. Methodology of the Study
                                 3.1. Determination of Sample Size

  As noted above, the TOR (p. 4) required a survey of approximately some 300 foreign
  investment firms. Initial information indicated that there are 1000 – 1200 FDI firms
  operating in Ethiopia.

  With this information, the following formula was chosen to enable calculation of the
  sample size (ss) with 95% confidence level ± 5 percent precision.

  Sample Size Formula4

                                                       Z2 * (p) * (1-p)
                                                ss =
                                                             c2
  Where:
             Z        = Z value (Z=1.96 for 95% confidence level)
             p        = percentage picking a choice, expressed as decimal
                          (0.5 used for sample size needed)
             c        = confidence interval, expressed as decimal
                          (We used 0.5)

                               Corrected ss =
                                                                                   ss-1
                                                                    1+
                                                                          population

Thus we have calculated the sample size with Z 1.96, p=0.5 and c=0.05 as follows:

                                           (1.96)2 * (.5) * (1-.5)
                                    ss =
                                                  (0.05)2

                                            SS=384.16



The Correction Factor for finite Population is calculated as:

                                               384.16
             Corrected ss =                                          new ss = 291

                                   1+((384.16-1)/1201)



Hence, the total sample size for 95% level of confidence is 291. To deal with any
unexpected contingencies the sample size was increased to 350 investment firms.


                                    3.2. Primary Data

After determining the sample size, the list of all foreign investors who obtained their
license between 2005 and 2012 was prepared by the Federal Investment Agency and sent
to the FEACC. The list was used to select the required sample of 350 companies out of the
total comprising 1201 companies operating across the country. The sample selection was
carried out by considering the inclusion of all regional states in the country and all
economic sectors. The distribution of foreign firms in the regions is uneven with most of
them being concentrated in Addis Ababa and Oromia while in some regions such as
Benshangul-Gumuz, Harar or Dire Ddawa there were only 3-6 foreign investment firms.
This led us to include all the firms in the regions except Addis Ababa and Oromia (see table
3 for details).

The questionnaire was designed by the consultant and counterpart staff of FEACC have
commented and approved it as final. The questionnaire is attached as Annex 1 to this
report. Training was given to the 30 Supervisors/Enumerators and the actual data was
gathered in November, 2013. During the survey, field supervision was carried out by the
consultant’s key personnel as well as three experts from FEACC.

Collecting the required data had not been easy due to several reasons. The respondents
needed to be convinced that data was collected merely for a research project and that their
                                                                                                          Page     7

firm’s name or the respondents name were not necessary. Besides, the data collectors
needed to assure the respondents about confidentiality of the collected data.        The
questionnaire was also designed to warm up the respondent enough before going to critical
questions related to corruption “per se”.

                                           3.3. Secondary Data

From the desk research carried out by the consultant, the reference materials shown in
Annex II were used to support the facts derived from the findings of the analysis and
results of the primary data. Besides, the available literature was summarized and
presented in section four of this report.

                                     3.4. Limitations of the Study

As with all studies, this one also has its limitations that the reader must know up-front. The
aim of this study was limited to assess only the perception of foreign investment firms and
not local investment ones. Thus, comparing the results with previous studies on corruption
in Ethiopia including the Enterprise Survey by IFC and the World Bank, the second
corruption survey for Ethiopia, etc may not be methodologically correct since those studies
had different survey targets and not exactly the same respondents and sample size as this
one. In principle the results should be similar, but in some cases discrepancies should be
expected because of the nature of the studies. Section 5.10 of this report highlights the
similarities and differences between the results of some of these studies.

There are inherent limitations of this study because it is not an attempt to measure hard
and documented facts but rather the opinions and current perceptions of the respondents.
Even though there are numerous journalistic accounts5 of corruption it is still difficult to
estimate precisely the actual extent of corruption. There are two basic approaches to
measure corruption at the macro level: (1) general or target-group perception and (2)
incidence of corruptive activities (also referred to as the proxy method). The first type of
measures reflect the feeling of the public or a specific group of respondents concerning the
’lack of justice’ in public transactions. In this case the perception of corruption perception
is an indirect measure of the actual level of corruption. The incidence-based approach is
based on surveys among those who potentially bribe and those to whom bribes are
potentially offered. Golden and Picci (2005)6 criticize survey-based measures of corruption
as they have at least two intrinsic weaknesses. First, the reliability of survey information
about corruption is largely unknown. Respondents directly involved in corrupt practices
may have incentives to underreport such involvement, and who are not involved typically
lack accurate information. Secondly, the reliability of the index may deteriorate over time.
There is a danger that respondents report what they believe based on highly publicized
results in the media rather than how much ’real’ corruption exists. So, in this survey we

were even aware that some of the questions could be self-incriminating for the
respondents and we can only take the answers at face value.

4. Literature Review
  Is corruption detrimental or beneficial to the economic activity? This question may seem
  ironic and even provocative; however, it is still controversial among economists.

  Common wisdom views corruption as an impediment to development and growth. This
  view was recently supported by the results of studies focused on quantifying the
  consequences of corruption on growth. Exploration of this question was pioneered by
  Mauro (1995), who observed a significant negative relationship between corruption and
  investment that extended to growth. Mauro (1995)’s findings were confirmed by Brunetti
  and Weder (1998) and Mo (2001). On the basis of these studies, international
  organizations (e.g. the IMF, the World Bank, the UN and the OECD) gave the fight against
  corruption high priority. They took international initiatives (e.g. the 1999 OECD’s
  Convention on Combating Bribery and the UN Convention against Corruption in 2003) and
  urged states to criminalize and deter the bribery of public sector office holders.

  In contrast, other researchers have suggested that graft may be beneficial. Leys (1965)
  questioned “the problem about corruption”. Bardhan (1997) recalled episodes in the
  history of Europe and the US which illustrate situations where corruption may have
  favored development by allowing entrepreneurs to grow out of bribers. Furthermore, Beck
  and Maher (1986) and Lien (1986) argued that corruption may raise efficiency. The most
  popular justification of the beneficial effects of corruption rests on the so-called “grease the
  wheels” hypothesis. Put forward by Leff (1964), Huntington (1968) and Leys (1965), that
  hypothesis suggests that corruption may be beneficial in a second best world because of
  the distortions caused by ill-functioning institutions. The argument here is that an
  inefficient bureaucracy constitutes an impediment to investment that some “speed” or
  “grease” money may help circumvent. In a nutshell, the “grease the wheels” hypothesis
  states that graft may act as a trouble-saving device, thereby raising efficiency hence
  investment and, eventually, growth.

  Holding the line, on the other side of the argument was Nobel laureate Gunnar Myrdal. For
  example, Myrdal (1968) argued that bribes were a source of inefficiency, and even the
  sheer possibility of collecting bribes was enough to induce the bureaucracy to create
  artificial bottlenecks. To put it differently, corruption provided the wrong incentives. As
  such, it would then be expected to “sand the wheels”. Papers that have been mentioned so
  far were mainly products of a theoretical approach and did not offer much in the way of
  state of the art mathematical treatments of this subject. In the 1980s corruption started
  receiving more formal treatment. One relevant example is Lui (1985), where in the context
  of a queuing model it was shown that corruption produced efficient outcomes in that the
  ones with the highest willingness to pay bribes were exactly the ones who had the highest
  opportunity costs of waiting.
                                                                                     Page   10

The empirical evidence on the negative impact of corruption on growth and investment is
not inconsistent with the “grease the wheels” hypothesis. This hypothesis implies that
corruption may be beneficial in countries where other aspects of governance are
ineffective, but remain detrimental elsewhere. Existing evidence shows that corruption is
on average associated with lower growth and investment but do not demonstrate to what
extent such an association depends on the quality of governance. Actually there is little
evidence to support a rigorous rejection of the “grease the wheels” hypothesis. Mauro
(1995) attempted to shed light of this issue by sub-dividing his sample into high red tape
and low red tape countries and did not find any significant difference between the two sub-
samples with respect to the negative impact of corruption. Kaufman and Wei (2000)
tackled the issue from a different angle. Using firm-level data, found that multinationals
that pay more bribes also tend to spend more time negotiating with foreign countries’
officials, which contradicts the “grease the wheels” hypothesis.

The “grease the wheels” versus the “sand the wheels” hypothesis: The debate on the
impact of corruption on economic performance goes beyond a “moralistic view” that
unequivocally condemns corruption. Moral judgments on corruption may bias
understanding of its economic consequences. One strand of the literature argues that
corruption may take place in parallel with a low quality of governance and can, therefore,
reduce the inconvenience that it produces. This is the “grease the wheels” hypothesis.
Another strand stresses that even though bribery may have benefits if the quality of
governance is low, it may impose additional costs in the same circumstances. The existence
of such costs provides a rationale for the “sand the wheels” hypothesis.

 The core of the debate on the “grease” vs. the “sand the wheels” hypotheses lies in the
interface between corruption and low quality of governance. While there are many aspects
of governance that corruption may grease or sand, the literature has mainly focused on
two. One concern poorly functioning bureaucracies (that fail to accomplish assigned goals -
example Leff, 1964) while the other refers to policy options by public authority. The extent
to which corruption can grease or sand the wheels in the presence of a low quality of
governance is discussed below.

The “grease the wheels” hypothesis: Poorly functioning bureaucracies are considered the
most prominent inefficiency that corruption could improve. Huntington (1968) stated: “In
terms of economic growth, the only thing worse than a society with a rigid, over-
centralized, dishonest bureaucracy is one with a rigid, over-centralized, honest
bureaucracy”. There are various aspects of poorly functioning bureaucracies that can be
overcome through corruption. One is slowness. Using a formal economic model, Lui (1985)
showed that corruption could efficiently lessen the time spent in queues. Bribes give
bureaucrats an incentive to speed up processes, in otherwise sluggish administrations
(Leys, 1964). Furthermore, Huntington (1968) argued that corruption could help overcome
tedious bureaucratic regulations and foster growth. According to him, such a phenomenon
had been observed in the 1870s and 1880s in the United States, where corruption by
railroad, utility and industrial corporations resulted in faster growth.
                                                                                        Page   11

Another aspect of poorly functioning bureaucracies is the poor quality of civil servants.
Leys (1964) and Bailey (1966) argued that corruption can promote progress in
bureaucracies by improving the quality of its civil servants. For example the existence of
the perks of corruption may be enough to attract able civil servants other lines of business,
when low government wages do not.

Finally, Beck and Maher (1986) and Lien (1986) suggested that corruption may enhance
decision-making by officials. If bureaucrats do not have enough information or are not
competent to make some decisions, corruption can replicate the outcome of a competitive
auction. They formally showed that in processes to award government procurement
contracts the ranking of bribes can replicate the ranking of firms by efficiency. Moreover,
with investment projects that are dependent on obtaining licenses, corruption is very
similar to a competitive auction. Leff (1964) concluded that licenses tend to be allocated to
more generous bribers, who can be the most efficient. Hence, the capacity to offer bribes is
equated with talent.

Some authors praise corruption for its role in allowing economic agents to escape the
consequences of bad policies. Bailey (1966) for instance argues that if bribes help private
agents evade public policies ill-suited to solve particular problems, they may enable the
discovery of overlooked and better-suited solutions. This may in turn improvement of
policy outcomes even in relation to the government’s objectives. Leff (1964) and Bailey
(1966), also argue that graft may simply be a hedge against bad public policies. This is
particularly true if institutions are biased against entrepreneurship, for example on an
ideological basis. By enabling leap-frogging over inefficient regulations, corruption may
limit their adverse effects. It may also result in an alteration of the policy in a way that is
friendlier to growth.

 It has also been argued that graft may in some circumstances improve the quality of
investments. This is the case (Leff, 1964) when government spending is inefficient. If
corruption is a means of tax evasion, it can reduce the revenue of public taxes. Provided the
bribers can invest efficiently, the overall efficiency of investment will be improved. In
addition to the quality of investments, some authors argue that corruption may also raise
the level of investment. For instance, Leff (1964) asserts that corruption may constitute a
hedge against other systemic political risks, such as expropriation or violence. If corruption
helps mitigate those risks, investment will be less risky and may accordingly increase.

 All the above-mentioned arguments share the presumption that corruption may positively
contribute to growth and development, because it compensates the consequences of a
defective bureaucracy and bad policies. One may nevertheless wonder whether corruption
creates or reinforces other inefficiencies and whether bribers are always taking more
efficient decisions than public authority. Although bribery may have benefits in a weak
institutional environment, it may as well impose additional costs in the same
circumstances. The existence of such costs provides a rationale for the “sand the wheels”
hypothesis.
                                                                                        Page   12

The “sand the wheels” hypothesis: The presumption that corruption can have a positive
impact on bureaucratic slowness rests on the assumption that a civil servant can speed up
an “exogenously” slow processes. However, corrupt civil servants could cause delays that
would not appear otherwise, just to get the opportunity to extract a bribe (Myrdal, 1968).
Moreover, the ability of civil servants to speed up processes can be very limited when the
administration includes a succession of decision centers. In this case, civil servants at each
stage can have some form of veto power or some capacity to slow down a project. Using
industrial organization models, Shleifer and Vishny (1993) show that the cost of corruption
can be higher when, for example, to obtain authorization for a project many independent
agents (rather than only one) are involved. Bardhan (1997) reports that an Indian high
official once declared that he could not be sure to be able to move a file faster but could
immediately stop it. The increased number of transactions due to graft may well offset the
increased efficiency with which transactions are carried out (Jain, 2001). Under these
circumstances one distortion adds to the others instead of overcoming them, which is
precisely the meaning of the “sand the wheels hypothesis”

 At an aggregate level, the impact of corruption on the quality of civil servants is
questionable. Kurer (1993) argued that corrupt officials have an incentive to create other
distortions in the economy to preserve their illegal source of income. For instance, a civil
servant may have an incentive to ration the provision of a public service just to be able to
decide to whom to allocate that service in exchange for a bribe. Similarly civil servants also
have the incentive to limit new colleagues’ (especially competent ones) access to key
positions in order to preserve their income from corruption. While individuals can indeed
obtain advantages from bribes, nothing is gained from corruption at the aggregate macro-
economic level.

The argument that corruption may enhance decision-making is also subject to doubt. There
are reasons to believe that agents paying the highest bribe are not always able to improve
efficiency. Rose-Ackerman (1997) argues that a firm may be able to pay the highest bribe
simply because it compromises on the quality of the goods it will produce if it gets a license.
Mankiw and Whinston (1986) show that entry in a market may be beneficial for the firm
but detrimental for overall welfare. In these cases, entry is, in general, subject to an
authorization. Although entry is detrimental for welfare, the firm can find it profitable to
pay the bribe to get the authorization and enter the market. Finally, if the profitability of a
license is uncertain, the winner of the auction may be the more optimistic rather than the
most efficient, a situation that is known as the “winner’s curse”. In these cases, corruption
is not the best way to award a license. Thus, even if the analogy between corruption and a
competitive auction holds, there are situations where the winner is not enhancing
efficiency.

Turning to the second category of institutional deficiencies (i.e. policy options by public
authority), the argument in favor of corruption can be counter-balanced in various
respects. The argument according to which corruption may raise both the quantity and the
quality of investment is questionable. There is evidence that this may not be true for public
investment. Empirical evidence shows that higher corruption is associated with higher
public investment (Tanzi and Davoodi, 1997) and that this results in a diversion of public
                                                                                          Page   13

spending towards less efficient allocations (Mauro, 1998). In other words, corruption
results in a greater amount of public investments in unproductive sectors, which is
unlikely to improve efficiency and result in faster growth.

One may also doubt that the assertion that corruption may be a hedge against risk in a
politically uncertain environment. This may only be true if the corrupt act does not imply
additional risk-taking. However, corruption is not a simple transaction. Given their illegal
nature, the commitment to comply with corrupt agreements may indeed be very weak
which may lead to opportunism, especially on the bribee’s part. As Bardhan (1997) points
out, the inherent uncertainty of such agreements may simply make the efficiency-
enhancing mechanisms ineffective. This presumption is supported by the results obtained
by Campos et al. (1999) and Lambsdorff (2003) who observe that the unpredictability of
corruption has an impact on investment and capital inflows that is independent from the
impact of the corruption itself. As a result, it is likely that corruption may increase the risks
associated with a weak rule of law instead of mitigating them.

Corruption Level impact on FDI: Wei (2000) investigates whether or not FDI flows from
US and other source countries are statistically different by using data on bilateral flows
between 14 source countries and 45 host countries for the years 1990 and 1991. He
concludes that corruption has a negative and significant impact on the levels of FDI, and
that this impact does not vary according to the source country.

Smarynzka and Wei (2000) argue that host country corruption causes foreign investors to
favor joint ventures over wholly owned firms. Lambsdorff and Cornelius (2000) found a
negative impact of corruption on FDI for a sample of African countries. Wei and Wu (2001)
concluded that corruption impacts on the composition of capital inflows in a way that
reduces FDI, and increases countries’ reliance on bank loans. This, in turn, makes the
country in question more vulnerable towards financial and currency crises.

Habib and Zurawicki (2001) examined the impact of corruption on both foreign direct
investments and local investments and found that corruption has a stronger negative
impact on FDI. Lambsdorff (2002) studied the question of how corruption influences
persistent capital flows. This study breaks down investment into two broad categories:
domestic savings and net capital inflows. A significant negative impact of corruption on the
latter variable is proven. Yet, no distinction is made between different forms of capital
inflows. In order to identify potential channels of influence, this study also examines
certain institutional variables such as bureaucratic quality, civil liberty, government
stability, and law and order traditions. A somewhat surprising result emerges in that all but
the last variable matter for attracting capital inflows.

On the other hand, there are a series of studies which remain inconclusive on the above
mentioned link. Using cross-sectional data, Alesina and Weder (1999) fail to produce a
significant parameter estimate for the corruption variable on FDI in spite of trying a series
of model specifications. Working on data for Sub-Saharan Africa, Okeahalam and Bah
(1998) also produce inconclusive results. To wrap up, it is fair to say that the literature has
documented mixed results regarding the impact of corruption on FDI. For this report, the
                                                                                                             Page   14

results of a survey conducted recently were also taken into consideration and will be
detailed later. The pioneering effort in this area was the study by Mauro (1995) who found
that corruption lowers investment and thereby economic growth. Later, the study by Tanzi
and Davoodi (1997) further extended and elaborated this line of causality by showing that
corruption increases public investment while reducing its productivity.

Empirical studies suggest that corruption is, indeed, associated with a misallocation and
misappropriation of public expenditures which are often inflated as a result. Gupta et al.
(2000) find that corruption has the effect of reducing the provision of education and health
care, and of increasing infant mortality. Mauro (1997) presents evidence that corruption
distorts public expenditures away from growth-promoting areas (like education and
health) towards other types of projects (e.g., infrastructure investment) that are less
productivity-enhancing. In a similar vein, Tanzi and Davoodi (1997) find that corruption
leads to a diversion of public funds to where bribes are easiest to collect, implying a bias in
the composition of public spending towards low-productivity projects (e.g. large-scale
construction) at the expense of value enhancing investments (e.g. maintenance of the
existing infrastructure). The same authors conclude that, as a result of corruption, the
amount of public investment tends to rise, while the quality of this investment tends to fall,
where the latter is measured for example by the number of paved roads in bad condition
and power supply faults.

Following theoretical and empirical arguments pointing to the damage which corruption
inflicts on economies, several empirical researches looked at the impact of corruption on
the inflows of foreign direct investment by controlling variables positively correlated with
FDI (the rule of law, control of corruption, regulatory quality, government effectiveness,
and political stability). The analysis indicates that US firms are less likely to invest in
countries where bribery, as measured by the Corruption Perception Index (CPI), is
widespread. Many authors examined US Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) outflows with
respect to the level of corruption (in the form of bribery) in 42 recipient countries over a
five-year period. As might be expected, the size of the foreign market is found to be a more
robust factor determining US outward investment, with larger economies attracting more
investment. The level of bribery, while significant by itself, loses its importance when
included with other economic and cultural political and governance variables.

It has also been observed that "FDI may be a major cause of corruption, especially in
resource-rich poor countries, if international investors try to gain access to natural
resources (e.g. minerals, forests, and agricultural land) by paying bribes to government
officials controlling the access (Leite and Weidmann,1999; Pinto and Zhu,2013). Where
such corruption is successful in circumventing government restrictions designed to protect
the environment, it may entail the contradictory effects of raising the country’s GDP, but
lowering its overall welfare by damaging the environment and public health"7.

A study conducted by Ali Al-Sadig (2009) entitled “The Effects of Corruption on FDI
Inflows” which analyzed a 20 year panel data of 117 countries offered the following
conclusion:

        “The corruption level in the host country has an adverse effect on FDI
        inflows: a one-point increase in the corruption level leads to a reduction in
        per capita FDI inflows by about 11 percent. However, after controlling for
        other characteristics of the host country such as the quality of institutions,
        the negative effects of corruption disappear and sometimes it becomes
        positive but statistically insignificant. In fact, the results show that the
        country’s quality of institutions is more important than the level of
        corruption in encouraging FDI inflows into the country. For instance, ceteris
        paribus, a country with sound institutions is able to attract as much as 29
        percent more per capita FDI inflows than a country with poor institutions.”

On the other hand, Morten; Feldmann, Sven E.; Dreyer Lassen, David (2011) found that
firms that perceive the national legislature to be of higher quality invest more in political
influence and pay less bribes while, conversely, firms with lower faith in the legislature
perceive themselves as having less influence and report more bribe paying. This is
consistent with the theoretical argument, made by Harstad and Svensson (2010), that firms
tend toward rule-breaking when credibility of political systems is low, while they invest
(more) in rule-changing when political credibility increases.

In general, the trend in recent literature also emphasizes the above findings. Castro and
Nunez (2013) concluded that “it is clear that corruption is a crucial determinant of FDI
inflows.” Sammi and Abedini (2012) asserted also that Corruption is one of the most
important factors creating inflation tax through budget deficit. A study by Alemu (2012) on
the Effects of Corruption on FDI Inflow in Asian Economies based on the Transparency
International Index states that "The empirical evidence in this study generally confirms that
corruption remains a significant problem for inward FDI in Asian economies. This is
equivalent to saying that if a country is able to decrease the level of corruption by 1%, the
inward FDI may increase by about 9.1 percentage points. Thus, the argument of some scholars
that corruption does not keep FDI out of those corrupt countries is either flawed or invalid. In
fact, some countries such as China and India, which are characterized by high level of
corruption and a remarkable FDI inflow at the same time, could even double their inward FDI
if the present pervasive level of corruption can be reduced." 8

5. Survey Findings

                         5.1 Description of the Surveyed Firms

  Differing views on corruption are important as they offer various insights into how
  corruption affects lives in different contexts. This corruption perception survey targets
  foreign companies operating in Ethiopia and aims at capturing their perceptions and
  attitudes as well as their experiences with corruption in this country. Major factors that
  could influence the perception of persons include their personal background, their
  respective country’s socio-economic and political situation as well as culture. The positions
  within their companies of the respondents interviewed during this corruption perception
  survey are presented in Table 1.

  The majority of the respondents interviewed were Managing Directors/General Managers
  (36.6%) followed by principal/owners (18.3%), Finance/Administration Managers
  (14.9%), Partner/shareholders (14.6%) and Liaison Officers (9.7%). The proportion of
  liaison officers is low (9.7%) although they normally have the responsibility of handling the
  day to day contacts with government officials/employees and face the challenges especially
  related to petty corruption. Similarly the proportion of CEOs is low (5.4%), but this could
  be attributed to the naming of the head of the organization as Managing Director/General
  Manager or CEO.

  The respondents included citizens of 42 countries and all continents except Latin America,
  as shown in Annex 3. Their perceptions of corruption in Ethiopia could reflect their
  economic, political and cultural differences, and their range of nationalities provide wider
  view of foreign firms operating in the country. The dominant nationalities of the
  respondents were Chinese and Indians (14% and 12%, respectively) followed by
  Americans (7.4%), Turkish and Italians (6.6% each) and British (5.1%). The next higher

nationalities were Dutch (4%) and Sudanese and Pakistanis (3.7% each). There are also
Ethiopian-Americans, Ethio-Chinese and Ethio-Pakistani companies that increased the
proportions of those countries by 2%, 0.6% and 0.3%, respectively.

Moreover, most of the companies surveyed do not have Ethiopian shareholders in their
companies, those which do account for about 29% of the firms as depicted in Figure 1.

nature of corruption that are faced during both establishment and operation phases

Furthermore, all regional States are represented in the survey of foreign companies
operating in Ethiopia. The result showed that the majority of the foreign companies
operating in Ethiopia are concentrated in and around Addis Ababa. Over 44% operate in
Addis Ababa and 31% in Oromia. The count by region is higher than the sample total
because some companies are operating in more than one Region.

The majority of the companies covered by the survey sell their products/services in the
local market. A little over 6% of respondents export more than 80% of their
products/services. On the other hand, about 43% of the surveyed foreign firms sell their
products/services to government bodies (including both budgeted public sector agencies
and enterprises owned by government).

The majority (56%) of the companies are not dependent on government bodies for inputs
other than power, telecom and water. In addition, almost half of them import raw materials
from abroad (for details, see Figure 4 and Figure 5).

About 80% of the surveyed companies have plans to expand their investment in Ethiopia
while only 4% have a plan to shrink. The rest 15.7% planned to operate at their current
size.

             5.2 Accessing Information on Rules and Regulations

The questions under this section focused the respondents’ opinion about rules and
regulations of the country covering businesses in general and FDI in particular. During the
survey respondents were asked to report their level of agreement with the statement:

              “In general, acquiring information on the laws and
               regulations regarding my company are easy to obtain”.

The proportion of the respondents that agree with the statement is by far greater than
those that do not agree. In aggregate 82.8% of the respondents agree with the statement
while the rest (17.2%) don’t agree. More specifically, 18.6% reported that they fully agree,
33.7% agree, 30.6% tend to agree, 8% tend to disagree, 6.9% disagree in most cases and
2.3% reported that they fully disagree (Figure 7).
                                                                                   Page   22

              information on the laws and regulations regarding my company are easy to
              obtain"




Respondents were also requested to express their perception regarding the country’s legal
framework in terms of its attractiveness to FDI. The results indicated that 11.4% of the
respondents reported that the country’s legal framework is very attractive, 40.6%
attractive, 32.6% somehow attractive while 12.9% reported not attractive and 2% didn’t
know.




            5.3 Variation in Perceptions of Corruption over Time

Respondents were asked to give their level of agreement with the statement that:

             “In general, interpretations of regulations affecting my
             company are consistent and predictable” comparing the
             current period with 3 years back.

The proportion of respondents with affirmative responses is somewhat higher for the
present (77.7%) compared to three years ago (72.5%). Particularly, for now 20.3% of the
respondents fully agree, 27.7% agree in most cases, 29.7% tend to agree, 10.6% tend to
disagree, 7.4% disagree in most cases and 4.3% reported that they fully disagree. For 3
years ago, 9.1% of the same respondents reported that they fully agree, 32.3% agree in
most cases, 31.1% tend to agree, 14.9% tend to disagree, 9.7% disagree in most cases and
2.9% reported that they fully disagree.

The respondents were also requested to opine on the statement that:

              “I am confident that the legal system in Ethiopia will uphold
              my contract and property rights in business disputes if I am the
              aggrieved party,” comparing the present with 3 years ago.

The proportion of respondents that agree on the statement is by far higher than those that
don’t agree. For the present, 30.3% of the respondents reported that they fully agree,
31.4% agree, 22.9% tend to agree, 7.4% tend to disagree, 1.1% disagree and 2.6% reported
that they fully disagree, while 4.3% didn’t respond. For 3 years ago, 16.3% of the
respondents reported that they fully agree, 29.7% agree, 30.6% tend to agree, 6.3% tend to
disagree, 2.3% disagree, 2.9% fully disagree, and 12% didn’t respond. This reveals that the
proportion of respondents with affirmative responses regarding contract and property
rights is higher at present (84.6%) than it was three years ago (76.6%).

The respondents were asked for their views on whether they feel that overall corruption
levels have increased or decreased in specific bureaucratic processes and institutions
where corruption was perceived to be widely practiced in the last three years. The answers
are summarized in table 8 below.

Table 8 also shows that a plurality of respondents do not know whether levels of
corruption in the specified processes or institutions have changed or remained the same.
The table also shows that opinions were mixed about whether corruption has become less,
remained the same and increased in the last three years.

Compared to the situation three years ago respondents ranked the processes and
institutions where corruption increased most as customs/imports (26.3%), acquiring land,

(25.1%), securing foreign currency (22.3%), dealing with taxes and tax collection and
obtaining connections to public utilities like Electricity and Telecom (20.3%).

Respondents also stated that the average time required to complete the registration
process, including document authentication, investment license, business license etc, was
7.8 days. 41% believed that less time is required now than when they registered their
companies, 23.1% reported that it takes longer and 33.1% didn’t know.



    5.4 Perceived Difficulties Related to Government Requirements and
                              Accessing Services

Data was collected on the perception of foreign investors regarding government
requirements that are considered to be the most difficult in operating business. Results of
the data analysis showed that customs/foreign trade was believed to be among the most
difficult by 36.6% of the respondents, business licensing by 32.3%, tax regulations by 28%,
foreign currency/exchange, labour hiring/firing by 9.1%, quality standards by 4.3%, both
construction standards and environmental directives by 3.7% and others by 7.1%. These
results are consistent with the findings of highlighted in Table 13 where it is shown that
customs/foreign trade, foreign currency/exchange and tax regulations are among the most
problematic regulatory areas for operating foreign businesses in the country.

Respondents were also requested to express their opinion on the statement that:

      “It is common for firms in my line of business to have to pay some
      unofficial payments to have undue influence and get things done”.

Figure 8 shows that the greatest proportion (38.9%) of the respondents stated that this is
never true, 11.4% that it is seldom true, 23.1% that it is sometimes true, 12% that it is
frequently true, 9.4% that it is mostly true and the rest (2.3%) didn’t respond.
                                                                                       Page   26

              things done




The respondents were also requested to express their opinion about the statement that

              “Firms in my line of business usually know in advance about
              how much this unofficial payment is”.


Figure 9 depicts, among all of the answers that 50% of respondents stated that this is never
true while only 1.4% stated that it is always true.

In the same way respondents were requested to express their opinions on the statement
that:

       “If a firm pays the required unofficial payment the service is usually also
       delivered as agreed”.

Here too, the greatest proportion (36.9%) responded that this is never true while the
proportions that responded this is seldom true, sometimes true, frequently true, mostly
true and always true were respectively 12.3%, 16.6%, 8.0%, 19.4% and 2.6%. Details are
shown in table 9.

Data on the mode of communication for initiating corruption conversations was collected
and out of the 350 respondents 296 valid responses were obtained. 63.9% stated that hints
provided by government agents were the most common method used.

The respondents were requested to share their experience on how often it is true that if a
government agent acts against the rules one can usually go to another official or to his
superior and get proper treatment without recourse to unofficial payments. Out of the total
337 respondents, 96.3% gave valid responses. 22.3% responded that this is sometimes
true, 26.1% that it is mostly true and 19.6% always as shown in Figure 11.

             rules




One of the questions posed during the survey was how frequently the foreign owned
companies contacted (or sought the services of) about 15 key government agencies and
their employees during the previous 12 months. Following this, respondents were asked if
they had encountered requests or hints for unofficial payments in order to obtain the
services from these agencies/employees and whether they paid any amount of money in
bribes. The survey results revealed that EEPCo is the organization with the highest average
number of foreign companies seeking its services. In fact, the data shows that some foreign
companies had contacted EEPCo as much as 240 times while most did so 12 times during
the 12 months preceding the survey. Ethiotelecom is the next most frequently contacted
agency with an average of about 10 per year. The statistical mode, i.e., the number of
contacts mentioned more repeatedly by respondents for EEPCO, Ethiotelecom and the
water and sewerage company is 12, perhaps because bills had to be paid on a monthly
basis to these agencies. The maximum contact mentioned is with Judges or court officials

Responses to a follow up question, about whether respondents were asked for any
unofficial payment during the previous twelve months, put both EEPCo and Traffic Police
employees high on the list. EEPCo staff asked about 6% of the respondents a total count of
213 times for bribes which is an average of 10 requests per respondent. Traffic police
asked 16.6% of respondents for more total bribes (370) but with an lower average of 6
bribe demands per respondent. The Revenue and Customs Authority employees asked 6%
of the respondents a total of 54 times for bribes for customs/trade licenses (an average
twice per respondent) and 49 times for tax inspections. Staff from the Federal/Local police
and employees involved in authorizing construction permits approached 3.4% and 4% the
respondents, respectively, for bribes. More detail on this is presented in the table below.

The respondents were also asked to mention the average amount of unofficial payments
that they had made to the employees in these institutions during the previous twelve
months. Their answers reveal that employees in all agencies are being bribed though with
differences in the average amount of bribe money. Even though 18% of the respondents
identified the Traffic Police to be the most corrupt by all measures, the most alarming cases
were reported about employees involved with Customs and Trade, Land Acquisition
/Administration, Investment Licenses, Tax Agency Inspection and Government
Procurement. The respondents revealed that employees in these agencies are collecting on
average bribe money ranging from 5,000 to 7000 Birr (USD 260 to 364.60). The survey
data also informs that maximum bribes range from 20,000 to 50,000 Birr (USD 1042 to
2,604). The total of reported bribes by institution/employees shows that customs staff are
the most corrupt having collected 121,660 Birr (USD 6,336) from respondents, followed by
employees approving construction permits and conducting tax inspection with a total bribe
money payment amounting to Birr 43,400 and 41,900 (USD 2260 and 2,182), respectively.

        Note: The counts of incidences and the sum of bribes paid are estimates based on responses received and not
      directly documented amounts.

      On the other hand, the data pattern as revealed by the statistical mode and the minimum
      and maximum bribe payments suggests that petty rather than grand corruption is more
      ubiquitous. More detail on this is presented in the table below.

      Respondents were also asked to judge on a scale from 1 to 4 (no obstacle, minor obstacle,
      moderate obstacle, and major obstacle) how problematic are the 10 regulatory areas:
      investment licensing, business licensing, customs/foreign trade, labor hiring/firing, foreign
      currency/exchange, land acquisition, environmental directives, tax regulations,
      immigration/work permit, and quality and standards for the operation and growth of their
      companies. Major obstacles were reported most for foreign currency/exchange (26%)
      followed by land acquisition (23.4%), customs/foreign trade (19.4%), tax regulations
      (12%), immigration/work permit (11.7%), labor hiring/firing (9.7%), for quality and
      standards (8.3%), business licensing (6.9%), investment licensing (4.6%), and
      environmental directives (4%).

      On the other end of the spectrum, the proportion of the respondents that reported there is
      no obstacle was the highest for investment licensing (54%) followed by environmental
      directives and quality and standards (36.6% each), immigration/work permit (33.7%),
      business licensing (33.1%), tax regulations (22.3%), foreign currency/exchange (20.9%),

land acquisition (18%) and customs/foreign trade16.9%. The proportion of respondents
that reported minor to moderate obstacles was the highest on tax regulations (63.5%)
followed by customs/foreign trade (60%) and business licensing (59.2%). These details

     5.5 Perceptions of Corrupt Practices in Government Procurement

Respondents were asked suggest the level of malpractice in the example below.

          To avoid having to visit the police office and pay a full fine, a traffic
          offender offered to pay Birr 300 (or about USD 5) to the traffic
          police. The traffic police did not ask for the money but accepted it.

The majority of the respondents (43.7%) considered the case as bribery and 15.1% as
corruption. Only 6% perceived it as gift of good will and about 13% as tea money as shown
in Figure 12.
                                                                                       Page   33


Figure 12: Differing perceptions of malpractice (%) among respondents




Similarly the answer given to the case stated below is another indicator for variations in
the respondents’ perceptions of levels of malpractice.

       “Someone visits a government office and receives good assistance from
       the officer in charge. When the matter is concluded, he offers Birr
       10,000 (or about USD 520), which the official accepted.”

36.6% perceived it as corruption and 27.4% as bribery as shown in Figure 13.

Figure 13. Differences in perceptions of respondents on the malpractice example




The above questions are further elaborated as follows. One should note that such survey
questions should be interpreted carefully and in culture-specific ways. A question on ’bribe
or corruption practices’, for example, is certainly colored by country-specific perceptions of
what is meant by bribe or corruption. As a consequence, evaluations made by foreign
                                                                                        Page   34

investors tend to be biased by the cultural principles and practices of their home countries.
Accordingly, 300 Birr paid to a traffic police officer is regarded neither as a bribe nor
corruption by a relatively high proportions of Pakistani owned firms (61.5%), German
owned firms (55.6%), and Chinese owned firms (48.9%). Similarly, the offer of 10,000 Birr
to a government officer is considered corruption by relatively small proportions of
Pakistani (8.3%), Sudanese (23.1%), American-Ethiopian (28.6%), American (30.8%),
Chinese (38.3%) and Dutch (35.7%) owned firms, as compared to investors from other
countries.

During the survey, respondents were also asked to rate four factors that were generally
considered as an impediment to run their business efficiently: procurement processes in
the country, competition by other firms, frequent and high unofficial payment requests and
the existence of corrupt practices. The respondents were asked to judge these factors as
“No”, “Minor, Difficult or Major” problem.. Procurement processes, competition, frequent
and high unofficial payment requests and existence of corrupt practices were ranked as a
major problem by 10%, 6.9%, 15.1% and 19.4% of the respondents respectively. Added
together, the ratings of these responses as either “No Problem” or “Minor Problem” are
consistently higher with 63.7% (procurement), 73.7% (competition), 60.8% (unofficial
payments) and 54% (corrupt practices). The full sets of rankings are shown in Table 16.

As it is indicated in table 17, one of the areas that where impediments to running
businesses efficiently and in which corruption are commonly observed is government
procurement. To specifically assess their perceptions in this area, respondents were asked
to give opinions on the following statement.

             Contracts relating to government procurement are generated in a
             clear and efficient manner.

7.4% the 350 respondents characterized this statement as always true, 16.3% that it
is mostly true, 20.9% frequentl y true, 26.9% sometimes, 8.3% seldom true and 12.6%
never true.

Above it was noted that only 43.4% of the surveyed foreign firms actually sell their
products/services to the government sector. However, respondents from only 21% of the
350 sampled firms gave opinions on whether government procurement contracts involve
unofficial payments. 80% of these respondents stated that from 2% to 50% of government
contracts involve unofficial payments, while 20% believe that over 50% of total
government contracts are awarded after some unofficial payment has been made.

Similarly to the above question, respondents from respondents from only 16% of the 350
surveyed foreign firms gave valid answers about the amount of unofficial payments in
relation to the total value of individual contracts. Out of these respondents, 57.1% replied
that the amount ranges from 1% to 10%, 7% stated from 11 to 25%, while 21.4%
perceived that the range was 26 to 50%.

Among the areas covered by this survey are the motives behind corrupt practices. The
result is summarized in table 19.

According to the respondents the three most common reasons people justify their corrupt
practices are speeding up the processes/procedures, avoiding punishment/sanctions and
to have alternative source of income in the case of those getting bribed. A significant
number of respondents also felt that people engage in corrupt actions to get preferential

Regarding respondents’ certainty of getting services or resolving a problem by giving
bribes to government officials/employees, the survey result indicated that 7.6% are very
certain while 37.5% are fairly certain and only 5.5% are extremely.

The survey also asked for respondents’ opinions on how they would react if asked to give a
bribe for favors or service. They were then asked if they would pay the bribe or not.
Further, those that had paid one or more bribes were asked why they had done so, and
those who had not why they had not. The results are summarized in Figure 16.

                                                                                 Page   39

59.7% the total respondent replied they would neither give nor offer a bribe to obtain a
service or resolve a problem, while 12.6% would give a bribe when asked. The respondents
who were willing to give bribes said they did so to speed up processes (6.6%) and/or
because there was no other way to obtain services or resolve problems (5.4%). These and
other details are found in Table 20.

On the other hand, those who stated that “I will not give it” explained that it was
unacceptable according to their principles (40.3%) or because they chose to resolve the
issue through legal means (15.7%). These and other details are found in Table 21.

About 30% of respondents stated that they have heard information from acquaintances or
others about foreign firms paying bribes to obtain public services in the 12 months
preceding the survey. These are found in Figure 17.

The respondents were requested to express their opinions on:

                 Whenever you have contacted officials in the public sector, how
                 often did the following (behavioral examples) happen?

The answers to be given by respondents are conditional upon having contacts with the
service providers. The answers given by respondents are summarized in the table 22.

preferential treatment

As related above, 8.6% the respondents stated that in most of their direct contacts in public
agencies, officials make direct demands for cash, gifts or favours while 26% responded that
officials rather hint for cash, gifts or favours in most cases. Also in most cases, 20.3% of
interviewees said that they give cash, gifts or favours without being directly or indirectly
asked. This finding is in agreement with conclusions presented elsewhere in this report
that hints by government agents and offers by foreign companies are the top two common
modes of communication about unofficial payments.

The respondents were also requested to rank the three most corrupt sectors and/or
service providers. The data showed that 38.5% of the respondents ranked as most corrupt
the Ethiopian Revenues & Customs Authority, 8.3% ranked equally the Transport Authority
and EEPCo, 7.4% land administration and 4% the Sub City Administrations in Addis Ababa
as the most corrupt. These and other findings presented in Table 23 are consistent with
the discussion in section 5.4 comparing current perceptions of present day levels of
corruption with those of three years ago.

                  5.6 Use of Anti-corruption Mechanisms by Firms

 The survey assessed perceptions about the reasons that corruption is not reported to
 relevant authorities. 46.3% of respondents pointed to a lack of evidence, 42.9% to a lack of
 actions against those that commit corruption and 41.7% a lack of clarity about corruption
 proceedings. These and other details are presented in Table 24.

Perhaps in line with the above perceptions, only 6.3% of the respondents stated that they
or anyone in their company reported a corrupt act to a public official during the 12 months
preceding the survey, while 92.3% declared that no reports were made and 1.4% didn’t
respond (see Figure 18).

Figure 18. Proportion of those who reported corrupt acts over the previous 12 months




As shown in Figure 19, most corruption complaints were submitted to the Police and the
Federal and Regional EACCs. Smaller percentages were reported to the Ministry of Foreign
Affairs, the Office of the Prosecutor and the Courts. Included in the other category are the
Revenue and Customs Authority, EEPCo and the Traffic Police.

Of those who reported submitting complaints about corrupt acts, Figure 20 shows that
12.9% stated that the process was very easy, 9.7% that is was easy, 25.8% that it was
somewhat easy, while 16.1% said that the process was extremely difficult .

When asked, “do you agree or disagree that as a reporter of corruption, you felt protected
from potential harassment” 32.3% of respondents stated that they somewhat agree, while
42% stated that they somewhat disagree or strongly disagree. These and other details are
presented in Figure 21.

Although the majority of the respondents who report corrupt practices stated that they
were satisfied with the feedback they received, there are significant numbers who were not
satisfied. For the question forwarded to rate level of satisfaction with the feedback they
received as a result of their corruption report; Figure 22 shows that 15.6% were very
satisfied 21.9% somewhat satisfied, and 12.5% dissatisfied 15.6% strongly dissatisfied.

Figure 23 shows that the great majority of respondents (76.9%) stated that they were
aware of anti-corruption measures being taken by the Government of Ethiopia, while
21.4% were not, implying that there is still a need for the government to carry out
awareness raising interventions to bridge the gap.

             5.7 Government’s Commitment to Combat Corruption

Respondents were queried about their perceptions of the government’s anti-corruption
efforts in the country. . Figure 24 shows that majority plurality of respondents believed that
the government’s efforts are effective: 7.4% stated very effective, 38.6% somewhat
effective, 21.7% not very effective, and only 5.1% reported not effective.


Figure 24: Perceptions of the effectiveness of the Government's anti-corruption efforts (%)




Figure 25 shows that additionally, 21.4% strongly agree and 49.7% somewhat agree that
the government has a “sincere commitment and will to combat corruption.” On the other
hand, 2.9% of the respondents strongly disagree and another 17.4% somewhat disagree
with the statement.

The respondents were requested to compare levels of corruption in Ethiopia to similar
developing countries and Figure 26 shows that 54.6% of the respondents perceived it
lesser, 26% similar and 14% bigger (Figure 26).

When asked to indicate on which information sources they based their assessment of the
level of corruption in the country, as Table 25 shows, 26.6% respondents pointed to
personal experience, 23.1% to talk with friends and acquaintances, 17.1% to talk with
relatives or family and 14.9% to the media.

Figure 27 shows that although the majority of the respondents (68%) stated that they were
aware of the existence of the Federal and Regional EACCs, about a quarter of respondents
(26.6%) were not. Lack of information about the institutions responsible for handling
corruption cases could be one of the impediments to reporting instances corruption and
should be addressed.

                      5.8 General Comments of Respondents

Over 90% of respondents shared their views on what the Ethiopian Government should do
to increase the flow of FDI. The main recommendations are summarized as follows:
        Ease work permit norms for essential foreign employees in key positions.
        Reduce bureaucratic red tape in all relevant government agencies by
           rationalizing work processes.
        Improve and synchronize the working relationships between relevant agencies
           and foreign investors. In fact, many respondents suggested creating a “one stop
           shopping” for licensing, customs clearing, land acquisition, utilities, etc.
        Hold an annual or bi-annual consultation forum between the Ethiopian
           Government and all foreign investors to discuss the bottlenecks that the latter
           are facing.
                                                                                                             Page   50

         Adopt international best practices by emulating the fair, smooth and soft
          regulations and institutional practices that enabled exemplary countries (e.g.
          Malaysia, Dubai, Hong Kong, and Singapore) to sky rocket economically from
          very humble beginnings.
         Ease access to bank loans.
         Improve the qualifications (through proper training), salaries and promotion
          opportunities of Government Agency staff that deal with FDI, especially if they
          are involved in sensitive decision making areas.
         Simplify the business license renewal10 process. Currently it is like re-opening
          businesses from scratch every year.
         Strengthen the working relationship between Federal and Regional Agencies to
          have a smooth flow of investment.
         Provide extended tax breaks and ban the foreign currency restrictions on
          repatriating profits.
         Improve infrastructure such as telecommunications, transport, etc. Currently,
          doing internet-based business in Ethiopia is practically impossible due to
          problems with the government telecom company.
         Use international media such as the BBC, CNN and Al-Jazzera to attract FDI.
          Advertise the good things that Ethiopia has.
         Even in advance of WTO accession, institute WTO-like procedures to attract
          more FDI.

The survey respondents were also asked to give general recommendations about how the
Ethiopian government could more effectively combat corruption:
        Focus on improving attitudes and commitment to combat corruption by all
          concerned at all levels through continuous awareness creation and provide
          adequate sensitization and awareness for the business community on their
          rights and obligations.
        Streamline the duties and responsibilities of officials and experts.
        Enforce accountability and transparency at all levels.
        Take appropriate and timely measures on persons practicing corruption and
          announce the measures publicly.
        Strengthen internal control systems at all levels of government.
        Improve the salaries and benefits of civil servants.
        Include corruption as a topic in the education system/curriculum.
        Strengthen the media towards combating corruption.
        Encourage and reward people who combat corruption and give them adequate
          protection against vengeance.
        Improve the efficiency of service delivery by making rules and procedures clear,
          short and straight forward for foreign investors and the public. Automate all
          government offices and carry out routine checks. Make it possible for foreign
          investor to complete most of the requirements on line. Improve the working

   This suggestion seems related to the recent directive of the Ministry of Trade which makes annual renewal of
trade licenses very similar to first time registration.

          environment for the business community/private sector; and human skill
          development.
         Undertake experience sharing with other countries.
         Reduce poverty in general and control inflation in particular.

Finally, respondents were asked to offer any other comments and recommendations:
        Work hard to increase the salaries of civil servants to reduce the chances that
            low wages lead to corrupt behavior11.
        Facilitate discussions with foreign investors to find solutions to combating petty
            and grand corruption.
        Make periodical assessments of the problems that foreign investors are facing in order to
            develop and provide appropriate and timely solutions, transit and customs issues needing
            particular attention.
        Raise awareness of the public on the government efforts and measures to
            combat corruption. Strengthen the on-going anti-corruption activities by the
            government.
        Publicize investment opportunities that the country can offer to foreign
            investors more aggressively.
        Handle small and minor business mistakes more smoothly and logically without
            harassing foreign investors
        It would be good to open an FDI office and create a website issues and concerns
            of investors can be discussed and dealt with anytime.

  The authors have reservations about this recommendation because the employees in the institution identified as
the most corrupt, the Revenue & Customs Authority, benefit from one of the highest salary scales. As such, the
relationship between higher salary scales and reduced corruption levels is questionable.

5.9.2 Diagnosing Corruption In Ethiopia by The World Bank.

The Diagnosing Corruption report highlights the following risks reported by stakeholders
as having recently occurred in Ethiopia in the construction Sector (P. 251):

            Packaging of contracts in a manner intended unfairly to favour some contractors
             over others.
            Lack of transparency in planning some design-build contracts and off-budget
             engineering, procurement, and construction contracts.

This Report included the following in the section on government procurement:

The Ethiopia 2011 Enterprise Survey is based on interviews with business owners and top
managers in 644 firms (local/foreign and all sizes). Even though the questions asked may be
different from those posed in this survey, the results of both studies are compared in the

The data from "Ethiopia: Enterprise survey 2013" in most cases points in the same
direction of the results reported by this study. For instance, bribery incidence (6.5% vs.
4.8%), gifts to tax officials (3.8% vs. 6.3%), gifts to get construction permit (7.7% vs. 4.9%),
gifts to get electrical connection (5.3% vs. 6.3%) and gifts to public officials "to get things
done" (4% vs. 2.3%). The variation of the results for these indicators is just less than 4% in
either side. However, even though the results are similar for other indicators the variations
are relatively higher ranging from 7 to 12%. These indicators are identifying corruption as
a major constraint (7.1% vs. 19.4%), identifying the courts system as a major constraint
(2.8% vs. 10.6%), identifying business licensing and permits as a major constraint (3% vs.
15.1%) and identifying customs and trade regulations as a major constraint (19.7% vs.
26.3%). It is also observed that both studies have relatively more respondents identifying
customs and trade regulations as a major constraint.

6. Conclusions and Recommendations
  Governments are generally concerned with corruption and its corrosive effects on their
  development. Various empirical studies confirmed that corruption has significant impacts
  on foreign direct investment, private sector development and good governance. It is also
  associated with organized crime. As a result governments and non-governmental
  stakeholders are taking measures to reduce corruption. The Ethiopian government is
  taking bold steps towards that end. This survey was conducted to identify and revise gaps
  in policies and working procedures that will help to increase FDI. It targeted foreign
  companies operating in Ethiopia and captured their perceptions and attitudes as well as
  their experiences with corruption in this country.

  The survey was comprehensive in terms of geographic representation, sectors,
  respondents’ position in their companies, the companies’ years of operation in the country,
  and types and ownership of those companies. The survey has generated data that leads to
  the following conclusions.

     1.    The opinion of respondents on the consistency and predictability of rules and
          regulations of the country with respect to FDI and their belief in the legal system
          with regard to contract and property rights are generally positive. However, the
          respondents identified some regulatory areas that are problematic: foreign
          exchange and land acquisition, customs/foreign trade, business licensing, and tax
          regulations. The government should give due attention for these areas to be make
          Ethiopia more attractive to FDI.

     2. The survey results indicated that the major reason that foreign investors engage in
        corrupt practices is to avoid wasting time in lengthy processes/procedures. Process
        and procedural requirements for business registration (document authentication,
        investment license, business license, etc…) are indeed time consuming and increase
        the attractiveness of corrupt practices. Hence there is a need to streamline
        processes and procedures as much as possible. Institutions that are considered most
        corrupt (Revenue and Customs Authority, Transport Authority, EEPCo, land
        acquisition related agencies, Sub-city Administrations, etc.) should also be further
        strengthened and their operations closely monitored by the government using
        appropriate mechanisms.

     3. The survey revealed that government contracts are of more concern than rules and
        regulations, with 21% of respondents perceiving that government procurement
        involves unofficial payments of, on averaging, 24% of the value of contracts. This
        needs to be urgently addressed.

     4. According to the opinions of the foreign firms operating in the country there is no
        grand corruption in Ethiopia. In fact there respondents believe that the level of
                                                                                    Page   56

      corruption in general is decreasing, except the case of few institutions which are
      mentioned above. Hence, the government anti-corruption efforts appear to be
      bearing fruit and should continue and strengthened.

   5. Lack of evidence, perceptions that actions are not taken against corruption officials
      and limited clarity about corruption proceedings are the three top reasons given for
      not reporting instances of corruption to the relevant authorities, although the
      survey indicated foreign companies believe that the Ethiopian Government has
      sincere commitment and will to combat corruption. This suggests that the
      government to do more to convince foreign companies that reporting corrupt
      practices will produce government action.

Based on all the results of the study, a number of recommendations to increase the flow of
FDI have emerged:

1. Further actions are required by the Ethiopian government to streamline requirements
   and to cut down lengthy processes and procedures in the rules and regulations and the
   regulatory institutions that are considered problematic and corrupt. Agencies involved
   with foreign investment should have a more synchronized work relationship with
   investors. In fact, many respondents have suggested the creation of a “one stop shop”
   for licensing, customs clearing, land acquisition, obtaining utilities, etc.
2. Government procurement processes still need further improvement by streamlining
   the duties and responsibilities of officials and experts, enforcing accountability and
   transparency at all levels and building the capacity of institutions involved in public
   procurement.
3. In order to combat corruption at its early stage and attract more FDI, the Government of
   Ethiopia should consider working on simplifying and facilitating the reporting of
   corruption, on protecting of those reporting corrupt practices, on taking prompt public
   measures to investigate and sanction malfeasance, on assisting foreign investors to
   understand their rights/obligations, on organizing periodic consultation forums with
   them to discuss the bottlenecks and problems they are facing; and on adopting fair,
   smooth and soft regulations by drawing best practices from exemplary countries.
4. The other area for improvement is the capacity of government institutions and staff,
   which should be addressed through assigning more qualified staff in the institutions
   that have contacts with foreign firms, strengthening the media towards combating
   corruption and strengthening government systems and procedures for the registration
   and licensing of foreign firms.
5. Improving infrastructure such telecommunications, transport, electricity, etc is vitally
   important as they are basic requirements for business operations.

        Good Morning/Afternoon. I am                     , an interviewer from Selam Development
        Consultants. This Study is being conducted on behalf of the Federal Ethics and Anti-
        Corruption Commission through World Bank Funding. Among other things, Corruption, or
        similar ways of making influence on decision-makers, is thought to be a challenge for those
        foreign investors who want to enter or operate in Ethiopia. The study is part of the effort of
        the FEACC to combat corruption based on facts. The objective of this survey is to examine
        some aspects of the problem, and particularly how foreign firms encounter unethical business
        practices when operating in the country. The data collected will be applied for research
        purposes. The information obtained will be treated strictly anonymously and confidentially.
        Neither your name nor the name of your company will be mentioned in any documents related
        to this study. During the survey we intend to cover about 400 foreign companies like yours
        and we add everyone’s answers together for our research purposes. Thank you in advance for
        your cooperation.
