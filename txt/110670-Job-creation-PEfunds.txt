ASSESSING PRIVATE SECTOR CONTRIBUTIONS
TO JOB CREATION: IFC OPEN SOURCE STUDY

Measuring the job creation effects of IFC-supported private equity funds

Data from IFC’s Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) show strong job growth for companies financed through
IFC-supported private equity (PE) funds. The nearly 500 companies covered in this analysis — in which the funds had
invested about $4.0 billion, of which more than $400 million or 10% in financing came from IFC — created nearly 300,000
jobs between 2000 and 2010. Though job growth rates1 were higher for smaller companies, most jobs were created by larger
companies. Job creation was also strongly and positively correlated with the returns of the funds, showing that good financial
performance did not come from cutting jobs, but from expanding companies — their valuations, revenues, and jobs. The best
job creation occurred when fund managers worked with companies with which they were familiar.


  The sample for the Development Outcome Tracking System (DOTS) consists of:

     •	 69 PE funds classified as growth equity funds.

     •	 596 companies in which these funds had invested between 1/1/2000 and 12/31/2010.

     •	 494 of these companies that had reported information on jobs (83% of investments).

     •	 Total investments by the funds in these companies were $4.0 billion.

     •	 The portion of IFC investment in these companies was $405 million, or 10% of the total.

  Here a small or medium-size enterprise (SME)2 is defined as a company with at least two of three characteristics:

     •	 Less than or equal to $15 million in revenues.

     •	 Less than or equal to $15 million in assets.

     •	 Fewer than or equal to 300 employees.

ing to over 87,000 employees (with an           Source: DOTS
annualized job growth rate of 29.5%).
Another investee, a commercial bank in
China, created more than 22,000 jobs, more than doubling employment from fewer than 21,000 employees to more than
43,000 in just over five years (job growth rate of 14.8%). A third, a restaurant franchise operator in Latin America, created
more than 22,000 jobs, starting with about 64,000 employees and growing to more than 86,000 in less than two years (job
growth rate of 22.1%).

Collectively, the 114,000 jobs represented by these three companies account for more than one-third of the jobs created by
the PE funds in the portfolio. This group also accounted for the largest employer of women, with the restaurant franchise
reporting 49,000 women employees (57%). Given the nature of the business, it is not surprising to see this sector account
for the most jobs created.

All these companies started with many employees and high revenues. The companies were established and operating when
they raised money from the investment funds. IFC capital was leveraged and supported by other investors’ money to achieve
the impressive job creation results. While these companies did not experience the high job growth rate that many start-ups
experienced, they did create more jobs than other companies in the dataset (figure 2).

Job creation in the portfolio mirrored regional economic activity during the timeframe. The three highest job creators were
in China and Latin America. These companies took advantage of economic growth happening in their locations to support
the expansion of their businesses.

had job growth of over 20%. As compa-

                                                  Source: DOTS
to maintain such aggressive growth, and
growth rates fell to 11% or less.

Identifying and supporting winners is a powerful strategy for PE funds. A cosmetics company in China started with 60
employees and within four years had more than 9,200 (job growth rate of 284%). Another SME, a transportation company
in India, started with 99 employees and in just over two years had more than 1,500 employees (job growth rate of 239%).
These are examples of the fast job growth rate that can be achieved by SMEs, which is one reason why investors are interested
in them. These two companies’ employment creation numbers are dwarfed by any of the expansion-stage companies discussed
earlier. However, none of the high job creation companies comes close to the growth rates exhibited by these companies.

PE funds combine capital and expertise to drive returns
Fund managers’ incentives are aligned with the successful performance and exit of portfolio investee companies. Fund
managers provide capital, guidance, contacts, and resources to support their companies. This alignment of incentives is
created by the bonus structure of the PE industry. The incentives explain why fund managers are willing to put in time, net-
working, talent, and capital to help their investee companies succeed. The data show that PE funds can help drive the growth
and development of their portfolios.

Some fund managers support a company in an earlier fund and then follow on with investment capital from successive
funds. One example is an African telecom company. It was a start-up in 2001 but grew to 2,200 employees with $4 billion in
revenues in 2010. This growth was assisted by multiple investments from the fund management team that ran several funds in
Africa. Three funds invested in the company for a total of $4.5 million. The first fund was considered an SME fund; the other

Fund managers typically support portfolio companies by sitting on
the boards of their companies, giving guidance and direction. The
manager usually helps by providing contacts to customers, suppli-
ers, and other groups along supply or distribution chains. Business
models that can fully utilize the financing, support, resources, and
relationships of investment managers are best suited for investment
by PE. These are the scenarios where the fund managers can have
the greatest influence on a successful investment, and the company
can have the greatest impact for their investors.

Fund performance and job creation
are correlated
Among the PE funds in this sample there was a strong positive
correlation between fund returns and job creation.4 This indicates
that good financial performance can accompany expanding com-
panies, their valuations, revenues, and jobs. Figure 4 shows the
linkage at the fund level.

Conclusion
PE activity has created jobs. This segment of the portfolio reaches
into many countries, regions, and industries. For strong job cre-
ation, both investments in smaller companies (that enjoyed higher
job growth rates) and subsequently in expansion-stage companies,
probably in services or a customer-facing operation, were important.
There was a strong positive correlation between fund returns and
job creation, indicating that job creation can be achieved without
sacrificing financial returns.
