                        Latin America and the Caribbean (LCR) will be center stage
                        in the global development debate this month as leaders from
                        around the world convene in Lima, Peru for the Annual Meetings
                        of the World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund.

                        Critical progress in poverty reduction has been made in the
                        region over the last decade. Extreme poverty was halved.
                        Inequality declined. The region’s bottom 40 percent of the
                        population saw growth eclipsing that seen by the group in
                        every other region in the world. However, a global slowdown in
economic growth and activity challenges these positive strides. Sustaining the advances
despite the slowdown will certainly be an issue discussed at the Annual Meetings.

Learning and sharing the experiences from our development results is even more critical
in the face of these challenges.

The stories in this book embody concrete successes of countries working together with the
World Bank. Innovative development approaches were designed and implemented. The
lives of citizens improved. Opportunities expanded. Individuals, communities, countries,
and even regions benefited from better health, education, governance, disaster risk
management and more.
Emilia Galeano is a perfect example. The Argentinian small business owner now has
access to basic supplies and faster emergency care because of a new road that connected
her small town of La Cumbrecita with larger cities in the area. Specialty coffee producer
Natan Nieto enjoys the benefits of productive alliances between rural producer
organizations and private agribusinesses that the World Bank helped to establish,
strengthen, and promote.

These stories show how important collaboration and strategic partnerships are in
achieving results. I am confident that if we continue to work together to find ways to
improve our solutions, we can indeed achieve the twin goals of eradicating extreme
poverty and boosting shared prosperity by 2030.

IMPROVING ROADS IN CÓRDOBA
The provincial government of Córdoba improved the province’s competitiveness
and opportunities for economic growth by boosting its capacity to encourage
efficient planning policies and adequate resource allocation for the rehabilitation
and maintenance of the core provincial road network, especially through the use of
innovative performance-based contracts.

ENHANCING THE PUBLIC SECTOR’S
EFFICIENCY, TRANSPARENCY, AND
ACCOUNTABILITY
Argentina’s ongoing efforts to modernize the governance and management of
the public sector are improving the efficiency, transparency, and accountability
of public service delivery to its citizens. Based on earlier progress, these
improvements were accomplished through five pilot programs designed to
automate public services and institutionalize monitoring dashboards, digital
signatures, and citizen charters.

ADDRESSING CHALLENGES IN
HEALTH AND EDUCATION IN
SAN JUAN
The province of San Juan implemented several programs to improve the equity,
quality, and efficiency of health service delivery and to tackle the high levels of
school failure in the first few years of primary education. The programs also
addressed the unequal access to education for children from disadvantaged
backgrounds and their ability to remain in school.

MOVING FORWARD
The programs that were financed are now included
in the budgetary process of San Juan Province.
This guarantees their funding and continuity.
Public officials internalized the institutional and
procedural reforms adopted during implementation
and will likely continue applying them. Although
there is currently no discussion about a follow-up
operation, the provincial authorities have expressed
interest in a second loan of the same type.


BENEFICIARIES
The primary project beneficiaries are the users of
public health and education services in San Juan
Province. Many of these beneficiaries are among the
poorest in the province. The institutions benefiting
from the project include the provincial Ministries of
Health and Education, the Ministry of Finance, and
the San Juan Investment Promotion Agency, which
is linked to the Ministry of Economic Development
and Production, and had the responsibility for the
overall management of the project.

PROVIDING PRODUCTIVE
AGRICULTURAL LAND FOR THE POOR
Bolivia’s pilot program developed land access mechanisms to benefit
predominantly indigenous families organized in productive associations. These
associations were granted more than 150,000 hectares of land, and through grants
and technical assistance, average family income increased by 39 percent. Women
participated actively through training sessions on agricultural production and the
management of the associations.

EXPANDING COVERAGE AND
IMPROVING QUALITY OF PRIMARY
HEALTH CARE
Brazil has expanded coverage to mostly low-income populations that rely on
public providers, reducing infant mortality in participating municipalities.
Introducing performance-based financing and management arrangements into the
government’s transfers to the municipal and state levels strengthened the
Ministry of Health’s capacity to monitor and evaluate health services.

IMPROVING ACCESS TO JUSTICE
SERVICES
Colombia is improving its delivery of timely, efficient, effective and quality dispute
resolution services to its citizens. The government expanded access to quality
justice services, particularly to vulnerable groups. It created 50 new mediation
centers, and 14 decentralized court facilities and information centers, reaching
350,000 potential users in six major cities. Typical case processing times were also
reduced to a few months.

RESPONDING TO THE CHOLERA

During the health crisis that followed the 2010 earthquake, Haiti met the challenge
to control the growing cholera epidemic. The country’s health services and non-
governmental organizations provided over 3 million citizens with expanded health
services and health prevention and hygiene campaigns.

as it is seen as the program for spearheading the
implementation of an ambitious reform launched in
2013 to improve the quality of education through,
among others, strengthening SBM. The SBM policy
is currently implemented through different national
programs such the PEC, PETC, and the AGE.
In addition, based on the lessons learned from
this program, the use of evaluations to improve
pedagogical strategies and managerial capacities at
the school level is being introduced.

BETTER HEALTH AND EDUCATION
FOR KIDS
Panama has implemented a conditional cash transfer (CCT) program to reach
the poorest and most vulnerable populations living in rural areas and indigenous
communities. The CCT provides a cash transfer to families with children attending
school or complying with regular health visits. The program also provides health
and nutrition services to traditionally excluded indigenous communities.




                                          CHALLENGE
                                          Panama is one of the fastest growing economies in
                                          Latin America, but its growth has not translated
                                          into poverty reduction or economic inclusion.
                                          Although between 1997 and 2003 real per
                                          capita gross domestic product (GDP) grew at 1.5
                                          percent per year, poverty fell by only about a half
                                          a percentage point, from 37.3 to 36.8 percent.
                                          Nearly all (98.4 percent) of the communities in the
