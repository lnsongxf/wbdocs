About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

       Seguridad Eléctrica (A.P.S.E.)

       The customer must obtain an internal wiring certi cate (“DCI - Declaración
       de conformidad”). The DCI is issued by an electrician registered with the
       Association for the Promotion of Electrical Safety ("Asociación para la
       Promoción de la Seguridad Eléctrica -A.P.S.E."). The internal wiring of the
       building is the responsibility of the user/owner of the building.

       electrical contractor, obtains the relevant approvals from the municipality to
       do the excavation works in public spaces and nalizes the connection works.
       The installation of the meter happens on the same day that the connection
       works are carried out and the electricity starts owing right away.


       The signed supply contract is a prerequisite for EDESUR to start its part of
       the connection works. By means of the supply contract the client commits to
       paying the electricity that will be consumed and to not lower the initial load
       estimate on which the connection works are based. At this moment, the
       client also has to present the electrical plans approved by the relevant
       Municipality ("Habilitacion Municipal del plano electromecánico and del
       plano de la instalación eléctrica"). After the supply contract has been signed,
       EDESUR inspects the part of the connection works that was carried out by
       the customer’s electrical contractor, and nalizes the connection works.


       Since August 2012, according to the Resolución ENRE 0215/2012, the EDESUR
       charges a contribución especial reembolsable (CER) for new connections.
       The CER is reimbursed to the client through electricity bills. The
       reimbursement happens in a maximum of 48 equal payments reimbursed
       with interests.

      Province of Buenos Aires require a “Valor Inmobiliario de Referencia (VIR)”
      (Real Estate Reference Value”). The VIR was introduced by Resolutión Nº 67-
      AGIP-10 of February 10, 2010 and later amended by Resolutión Nº 435-AGIP-
      11 of August 3, 2011. A VIR is assigned to every property by the revenue
      agency and it sets a minimum base to calculate the stamp tax. The VIR aims
      to prevent the undervaluation of properties done to pay less stamp duty on
      property transfers.


      The notary has the responsibility to check the VIR, since the stamp duty will
      be calculated on the greater value between VIR, the scal valuation
      ('valuación scal') and the sale price agreed by parties. The procedure is free
      and it can be obtained online by the notary through the revenue agency
      website www.agip.gob.ar. However, not all the properties in the City of
      Buenos Aires have been assigned a VIR yet. In these cases the notary must
      obtain a certi cate stating that there is no VIR for the property.

Credit bureau coverage (% of adults)                      Special emphasis is given to how the collateral registry operates (if
  Number of individuals and firms listed in largest       registration of security interests is possible). The case scenarios involve a
  credit bureau as a percentage of adult population       secured borrower, company ABC, and a secured lender, BizBank.

Credit registry coverage (% of adults)                    In some economies the legal framework for secured transactions will allow

                                                          Several assumptions about the secured borrower (ABC) and lender
                                                          (BizBank) are used:
                                                          - ABC is a domestic limited liability company (or its legal equivalent).
                                                          - ABC has up to 50 employees.
                                                          - ABC has its headquarters and only base of operations in the economy’s
                                                          largest business city. For 11 economies the data are also collected for the
                                                          second largest business city.
                                                          - Both ABC and BizBank are 100% domestically owned.


                                                          The case scenarios also involve assumptions. In case A, as collateral for the
                                                          loan, ABC grants BizBank a nonpossessory security interest in one category
                                                          of movable assets, for example, its machinery or its inventory. ABC wants
                                                          to keep both possession and ownership of the collateral. In economies
                                                          where the law does not allow nonpossessory security interests in movable
                                                          property, ABC and BizBank use a ﬁduciary transfer-of-title arrangement (or
                                                          a similar substitute for nonpossessory security interests).


                                                          In case B, ABC grants BizBank a business charge, enterprise charge, ﬂoating

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the          - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                      and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11
  Attorney fees                                          economies the data are also collected for the second largest business city.
                                                         - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                         - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the
  Enforcement fees                                       equivalent in local currency of USD 5,000, whichever is greater.
Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)               - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                         commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                         - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                  - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                 - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                   - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s
                                                         movable assets.

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding            foreclosure      After Mirage's default, it is very likely that BizBank would enforce its security interest over
                                       Mirage's assets and initiate foreclosure proceeding. Foreclosure in this case will be an
                                       expedited proceeding in which other creditors’ participation is not required.

Outcome               piecemeal sale   Based on the assumptions of the case at stake, it is likely that BizBank will require the sale of
                                       the property used as collateral in satisfaction of secured loan. Mirage consequently will
                                       enforce the collateral through formal foreclosure. At this point, the hotel would cease
                                       operating and all its assets will be sold piecemeal.

Time (in years)       2.4              The foreclosure procedure in Buenos Aires will take approximately 29 months from the
                                       moment of Mirage’s default until the debt is repaid to the secured creditor. The procedure
                                       will be temporarily suspended after its commencement (articles 21 and 26 of the LCQ) due to
                                       a procedural objection by the debtor, this stage would take about 1.25 years to be resolved.
                                       Once the foreclosure recommences, the procedure would last an additional year and a half
                                       until the debt is fully paid. The procedure will involve setting up an auction, third parties’
                                       notification and finally the sale of the property.

Cost (% of            16.5             The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 16.5% of the value of the
estate)                                debtor's estate. The cost breakdown is the following: Court fees: 3% as regulated by Law
                                       23,898. Notification costs: are minimal and are part of the court fees; service occurs with the
                                       publication in the official gazette and in local newspapers. Attorney’s fees: 13.5% as regulated
                                       by articles 6 and 31 of Law 21,839 which set forth a rage between 11% - 20%. Professional
                                       Appraisers and Auctioneers fees are regulated by articles 260 and 262 of Law 24.522.
                                       However, this fee is not applicable because it is paid by the purchaser of the real estate not
                                       by the parties.
