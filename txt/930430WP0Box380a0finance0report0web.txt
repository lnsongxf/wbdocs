                         A basic value-added pitch has been developed, but no deeper monetization approach has been

                                   Through sustained advocacy, this option would build a common commitment among
                                   existing BDS providers to adapt a new business model that bases a substantial
                                   portion of their revenue stream on royalties gained by marginal increases in profits
                                   for the entrepreneurs/SMEs they advise (royalty of X percent based on difference
                                   between sales after BDS and sales before BDS for a certain period). This is in
                                   contrast to technical support fees (or equity), which has been the customary
                   Description     remuneration of BDS providers. Direct advocacy would be undertaken to BDS
                                   providers on the basis that reduced up-front costs to entrepreneurs would allow
                                   them to be perceived as more competitive, thereby stimulating demand for BDS.
                                   Policy advocacy may be necessary to ensure legal environment is conducive for
                                   collection of royalties. Some donor-focused advocacy may be undertaken in order
                                   to exert pressure through existing and ongoing grant support to BDS providers in-

                                   guarantee would expire after a reasonable period (18–36 months) and be recycled

                                      Establishment of a detailed IT system and web portal to build a knowledge base for
                                      diaspora investments, with the ultimate goal of mobilizing crowd-sourced equity
                                      and/or debt instruments to be managed by an affiliated in-country manager. The
                                      platform would feature investee profiles (akin to Kiva and IndieGoGo) accompanied
                       Description    with sound investment analysis provided by in-country manager. Would seek to build
                                      partnership with existing authorities, such as the Investment Promotion Centre
                                      in Mozambique and the ZDA in Zambia, in order to facilitate referral of interested
                                      investors. Would result in a comprehensive database of entrepreneurs with
                                      investment potential analysis for some profiles.
