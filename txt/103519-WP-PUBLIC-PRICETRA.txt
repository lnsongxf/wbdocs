Executive Summary

1. This study aims to improve our understanding of the extent and speed of the transmission of
   international cereal prices to local markets in developing countries. We undertake three types of
   analysis:
            a. First, we extract a sample of estimated measures of cereal price transmission (PT)
               from a comprehensive literature sample of published papers and studies.
            b. Second, we use the FAO’s GIEWS dataset to estimate our own sample of measures of
               cereal PT. In a subsequent meta-regression analysis we measure how much of the
               variation in each of the resulting samples of PT estimates (the literature sample and
               the GIEWS sample) can be explained by factors that might be expected to influence
               the strength of PT such as whether the country in question is landlocked.
            c. Third, we present the results of simple, non-parametric analysis of price transmission
               using the GIEWS data. This analysis measures the share of periods in which domestic
               and international prices have jointly increased or decreased.
2. 79% of the international/domestic price pairs in our sample of PT studies from the literature are
   cointegrated compared with 43% in our own estimates based on FAO GIEWS data. Hence,
   regardless of which database is used, many of the studied price pairs are not cointegrated and
   thus do not provide evidence of stable PT. This is especially the case if we consider that the
   literature sample most likely suffers from publication bias that leads to an overrepresentation of
   findings of cointegration.
3. Overall, maize markets are characterized by a below-average prevalence of cointegration, and
   rice markets by an above-average prevalence. Which regions of the world display higher/lower
   shares of cointegration depends on which dataset is considered: according to the literature
   sample, domestic prices in Africa are less likely than average to be cointegrated with
   corresponding international prices, but the estimates generated with GIEWS data suggest that
   domestic prices in Asia are least likely to be cointegrated with international prices.
4. Both the literature and the GIEWS-based estimated point to average long-run PT coefficients of
   roughly 0.75 and average short-run adjustment parameters of roughly 0.09-0.11. This suggests
   that on average roughly three-quarters of a change in international prices will be transmitted to
   domestic markets, and that it takes approximately 6-7 months for one-half of a given price shock
   on international cereal markets to be transmitted to domestic markets.
5. Comparing PT in the period prior to July 2007 with PT in the period thereafter reveals no clear
   pattern. On maize markets the long-run PT coefficients have fallen considerably since mid-2007.
   This could be interpreted as evidence of a decoupling of domestic from international prices. On
   rice and wheat markets there is evidence that the long-run PT coefficients have increased, but at
   the same time the short-run adjustment coefficients have fallen, suggesting that PT has become
   more complete but slower since mid-2007 for rice and wheat.
6. Employing meta-regression analysis to explain variations in long-run PT coefficients between
   domestic and international prices fails to generate compelling results. The meta-regressions for
   the short-run adjustment parameters provide evidence of more rapid PT for maize than for
   wheat and rice, and more rapid PT in West Africa than in other regions. An increasing ratio of net
   imports to domestic consumption is associated with slower PT, which may be an indication of
   increased intervention on politically more sensitive markets. There is evidence that trade
   openness is positively associated with the speed of PT, but this effect is only significant in the
   pre-July 2007 period. Finally, there is some counterintuitive indication that improved logistics are
   correlated with slower PT.

                                                                                                     2
7. The analysis of agreement in the direction in price changes on international and domestic
   markets suggests that the frequency of agreement is quite low at the monthly level, and only
   somewhat higher at the quarterly level. This lack of agreement is especially pronounced when
   international prices are falling; in this case domestic prices only fall as well in roughly 50% of all
   cases, which is what one would expect if price movements on international and domestic
   markets were completely independent. When international prices are increasing, there is a
   higher probability that domestic prices will increase as well, especially at the quarterly level for
   Europe, Asia, East Africa and Latin America. Overall these results support the findings of generally
   weak PT that were derived from the cointegration analysis.
8. The analysis of domestic price volatility reveals that median volatility has increased since July
   2007. But there is no difference between the median volatilities of those prices that are
   cointegrated with the corresponding international prices and those that are not. This suggests
   that on average, local factors play the major role in determining volatility of local food prices
   even for countries where local prices are cointegrated with international prices. The analysis
   reveals that in general, domestic prices are most volatile in East and West Africa, followed by
   Latin America and Asia. Furthermore, on average domestic maize and wheat prices are more
   volatile than the corresponding international prices, while domestic rice prices are less volatile.

1. Introduction

This study aims to improve our understanding of the extent and speed of the transmission of
international cereal prices to local markets in developing countries. Spurred by the recent peaks in
international food prices, many studies of world-to-domestic price transmission (PT) have been
produced. However, to date no one has attempted to extract general lessons about the factors that
determine the strength of PT from this extensive empirical literature. Neither has anyone attempted
to extract such lessons by estimating PT processes with a consistent set of price data for a large
number of countries using a uniform methodology.
To address this gap, we undertake three types of analysis in this study. First, we extract a sample of
estimated measures of cereal PT from a comprehensive literature sample of published papers and
studies. Second, we use the FAO’s GIEWS dataset to estimate our own sample of measures of cereal
PT. In a subsequent meta-regression analysis we measure how much of the variation in each of the
resulting samples of PT estimates (the literature sample and the GIEWS sample) can be attributed to
factors that might be expected to influence the strength of PT. Third, we present the results of
simple, non-parametric analysis of price transmission using the GIEWS data. This analysis measures
the share of periods in which domestic and international prices both either increased or decreased.
This enables us to determine whether domestic prices at least tend to move in the same direction as
international prices, even if they are not linked by a stable parametric relationship.
The rest of this study is structured as follows. In section 2 we begin by providing a brief summary of
the vector error correction model that has been used in the great majority of empirical studies of PT
over the last decade. In section 3 we then describe how we assembled our literature sample of PT
estimates (section 3.1), and how we used the GIEWS dataset to generate our own set of PT estimates
(section 3.2). In Section 4 we then describe the meta-analysis that we use to explain differences in
the estimated strength of PT, beginning with a description of the covariates that we employ as
possible determinants of PT (section 4.1) followed by a discussion of the results (section 4.2). Section
5 then presents the results of the non-parametric analysis of the direction of price movements.
Section 6 presents some evidence on the volatility of domestic compared with international prices
for different cereals and regions, and section 7 concludes.


2. Methods: the vector error correction model
2.1 The structure of the vector error correction model
The study of PT for homogeneous commodities in space, or for a product as it is transformed along
the stages of the marketing chain (e.g. wheat – flour – bread), has attracted the interest of
agricultural economists for many decades (Meyer 2004). Early empirical studies of PT were based on
simple correlation and regression analyses that did not account for dynamics and lead-lag
relationships in price data (for a survey, see Fackler and Goodwin, 2001). In the course of the 1980s,
these methods were increasingly replaced by dynamic regression models that include lagged prices
(e.g. Ravallion, 1986) and studies based on the concept of Granger causality (Gupta and Mueller,
1982). The emerging cointegration literature highlighted several pitfalls associated with the
regression analysis of price data. In particular, since price data are often non-stationary, regression
can lead to spurious results (Hassouneh et al, 2012). The basic insight of the cointegration approach
is that to avoid the pitfall of spurious regression one must test whether non-stationary prices series
(also referred to as ‘integrated’ price series) are not only correlated with one another but are rather
‘co-integrated’. Cointegrated means that there exists a linear combination of the non-stationary
series that is itself stationary, in other words that the series share a common form of non-stationarity
and cannot drift apart indefinitely.



                                                                                                      5
Ardeni (1989) published the first study of PT on agricultural markets based on cointegration
methods. It is fair to say that with the exception of a comparatively small literature based on so-
called parity bounds models (Barrett and Li, 2002) today essentially the entire empirical PT literature
draws on cointegration methods and, in particular, the so-called vector error correction model
(VECM). The VECM is a re-parametrization of the standard vector autoregressive (VAR) model which
relates the current levels of a set of time series to lagged values of those series. A simple VECM that
captures the interactions between international or world prices and domestic price takes the
following form:
    (1)                                                                                      (a)

                                                                                             (b).

    where
      is the domestic price;
       is the world price; and
     , , , , and are parameters to be estimated.
In matrix notation, and allowing for more than one lag of the price difference terms, this VECM can
be written compactly as:

    (2)                                                                                             .

From the perspective of empirical PT analysis, the main advantage of the VECM over the VAR is that
it separates the long-run equilibrium (or ‘cointegrating’) relationship between       and      – which is
captured by the error correction term                      – from the short-run dynamics that ensure
that any deviations from this long-run equilibrium are ‘corrected’ and thus only temporary. The key
parameters in the VECM are , which describes how one price reacts to changes in the other in the
long run1, and the so-called ‘adjustment’ parameters and . If             and    are cointegrated, then
    and    must have negative and positive signs, respectively. If this is the case, then if for example
    becomes too large relative to        and the error correction term is correspondingly positive, a
decrease in     in the first equation of the VECM, and an increase in       in the second equation, will
drive the prices back towards their long-run equilibrium. One-to-one price transmission in the long
run requires that         , while              , with large (small) values of and        indicating that
errors are corrected rapidly (slowly).2
Figure 1 outlines the basic empirical strategy for estimating PT. The first step is to determine whether
the individual price series        and     are both non-stationary (also referred to as ‘integrated’ or
‘I(1)’). This is usually carried out using the ADF (Dickey and Fuller, 1979) and KPSS tests (Kwiatkowski
et al., 1992). If the prices are not both I(1), they cannot be cointegrated. If they are both stationary or
‘I(0)’ they can be studied using Auto-Regressive Distributed Lag (ARDL) models. If the series are both
I(1), the null hypothesis that they are not cointegrated can be tested using a two-step OLS procedure
proposed by Engle and Granger (1987) or a maximum likelihood procedure developed by Johansen
(1988). If the null of no cointegration is rejected, the VECM in equation (2) can be estimated, again

  If estimation is based on prices in logarithms then can be interpreted as the long-run elasticity of price
transmission.
2
  The speed of error correction captured by the magnitude of an adjustment parameter must be interpreted
relative to the frequency of the data that is used to estimate it. An of 0.4 estimated with annual data implies
that 40% of any deviation from long-run equilibrium is corrected within the space of one year. An of 0.25
estimated with monthly data is smaller in magnitude but would nevertheless lead to over 95% correction of
any deviation from long-run equilibrium in the course of one year. Some authors transform ’s into so-called
half-lives that indicate how many units of time are required for the correction of one-half of a deviation from
the long-run equilibrium. An of 0.25 estimated with monthly data corresponds to a half-life of 2.41 months.
                                                                                                             6

2.2 Limitations of the vector error correction model, and alternatives
While the VECM underlies most empirical work in PT analysis, it is restrictive is some settings. In
particular, the VECM in equation (2) is linear in two senses (Hassouneh et al., 2012). First, it is linear
in the sense that all of the parameters in the model are assumed to be constant over the entire
sampling period. Second, it is linear in the sense that the dependent variables react linearly to
changes in the independent variables. Numerous studies have shown that in many applications one
or both of these types of linearity cannot be expected to hold (Hassouneh et al., 2010; Serra and
Goodwin, 2003; Serra et al. 2006; von Cramon-Taubadel, 1998; von Cramon-Taubadel and
Amikuzuno, 2012).
For our purposes, the first type of linearity is especially restrictive. The PT relationship that links an
international price to a country’s domestic market price need not be constant over time. Changes in
the country’s trade policy (for example an increase or reduction of import tariffs) can alter the nature
of the PT relationship, as can a switch from a net export to a net import position. Furthermore,
spatial equilibrium theory (Takayama and Judge, 1971) predicts that short-run price adjustments due
to arbitrage will take place only if the difference between international and domestic prices exceeds
a threshold that is determined by transport and transaction costs (Barrett and Li, 2002). If the
difference between prices is less than this threshold, there is no incentive for traders to engage in
arbitrage, and prices can move independently of one another.
In such cases PT will be characterized by different so-called ‘regimes’ (for example, one regime
before and one regime after an import tariff change; or one regime for the net export situation, and
one for the net import situation). In recent years several models of regime-dependent PT have been
developed and applied in the literature. Most of these can be described as piecewise linear models in
which each regime is characterized by a standard VECM as in equation (2) above, and some trigger or
transition mechanism determines when the model jumps from one regime to another. This trigger
can be exogenous (e.g. coinciding with the date of a policy change) or endogenous (e.g. determined
by whether the distance between the international and the domestic prices exceeds a certain
threshold). Hassouneh et al. (2012) review a number of the regime-dependent PT models that are

                                                                                                              7
common in current research, including the threshold VECM (Goodwin and Piggott, 2001), the
asymmetric VECM (von Cramon-Taubadel, 1998), and the smooth transition VECM (Teräsvirta, 1994).
Estimating regime-dependent PT models is considerably more complicated than estimating a
standard VECM. Some of these models require additional exogenous variables in addition to the
endogenous prices, for example information on the timing of policy changes or other exogenous
shocks that lead to regime changes. Others regime-dependent models such as the threshold VECM
can be estimated using prices alone, but require additional information and testing to determine the
appropriate number of thresholds.3 Finally, there is no unified testing framework for comparing
these regime-dependent models with one another.
Authors who are interested in analyzing PT in a specific product/country setting, or who use such a
specific setting to illustrate a new regime-dependent PT model that they have developed or refined,
can afford to engage in the additional data collection, specification, testing and interpretation that
this entails. As outlined in section 3.2 below, however, the FAO GIEWS data provides us with
domestic price series for three main cereal products (maize, rice and wheat) in 71 countries. It is
beyond the scope of this study to carry out detailed regime-dependent PT analysis for each of these
individual settings. Instead, we are obliged to use a comparatively simple PT model, such as the
VECM, the estimation of which can be automated to permit the analysis of a large number of
domestic-international price pairs. We recognize that the simple VECM specification in (2) will not be
appropriate for all of the domestic-international price pairs in the GIEWS data. The additional insights
that can be generated by estimating PT for a large number of price pairs and then analyzing the
resulting cross-section sample of results come at the cost of a necessarily simple method of analysis
that is not appropriate for each of these pairs individually.
In an attempt to deal with the shortcomings of the simple VECM, we propose two alternative
methods of analysis. First, to allow for at least one possible source of non-linearity we modify the
basic VECM in equation (2) to include a structural break which we postulate to have taken place in
July 2007. This roughly corresponds to the beginning of the first agricultural price peak and the
beginning of the recent phase of increased volatility on international commodity markets. Hence, we
estimate the following model which allows the nature of price transmission between international
and domestic cereal prices to change with the onset of higher and more volatile price in recent years.
The resulting specification is as follows, where the superscript * distinguishes between pre-break and
post-break parameters:


                                                                                         uly
(3)



Equation (3) is thus a regime-dependent VECM that links two standard VECMs, one for the period
prior to July 2007, and one for the period thereafter. To check whether July 2007 is a plausible cut-
off, we applied the Gregory and Hansen (1996) test of the null of no cointegration against the
alternative of cointegration with a possible regime shift to each domestic/international price pair in
the GIEWS data. Figure 2 shows the distribution of the break dates selected by the Gregory and
Hansen test. While there is evidence of regime shifts in some domestic/international price
relationships in 2003/04 for rice and 2004/05 for maize, for all three products (rice, maize and
wheat) by far the most regime shifts are indicated in 2007/08. July 2007 therefore appears to be a
reasonable choice for the cut-off date in the regime-dependent VECM in equation (3).



3
 Furthermore, Greb et al. (2011) demonstrate that the maximum likelihood method used to estimate
threshold VECMs in the literature to date is biased.
                                                                                                      8
Our second alternative to the standard VECM abandons the assumption of a parametric relationship
between domestic and international prices entirely. Instead, we simply measure how often domestic
and international prices have increased or decreased together in the past, and how often they have
moved in opposite directions. Hence, for each of the GIEWS price series in each month we code
whether it has increased or decreased. We do the same thing for the corresponding international
price and then count the number of agreements (i.e. months in which both the domestic price and
the corresponding international price increased or decreased) and the number of disagreements (i.e.
months in which one price increased while the other decreased). The result is the simplest possible
measure of price co-movement that indicates how often producers and consumers on domestic
markets are at least receiving the correct qualitative price signals. To account for possible delays in
price responses and short-run fluctuations we repeat this analysis using quarterly and annual price
changes, and we also modify the analysis with monthly data to measure the agreement between the
direction of international price changes in month t and the direction of domestic price changes in
month t+1.

3. Literature-based and GIEWS data-based estimates of international-
domestic cereals price transmission
Following the discussion of methods in the previous section, we follow a three-part approach to
generate insights into the nature of international to domestic PT for major cereal products. First,
many studies that report VECM estimates for international to domestic PT have been published in
recent years. As outlined in section 3.1, we have collected these studies and analyze the estimates of
  and that they report. Second, using the extensive FAO GIEWS price data set, we generate our
own estimates of and for a large number of countries using the VECM in equation (2) and the
regime-dependent VECM in equation (3). This work is outlined in section 3.2 below. Third, using the
GIEWS price data we carry out the non-parametric analysis of agreements and disagreements in price
increases and decreases described above. In all three types of analysis we consider maize, rice and
wheat.

                                                                                                     9
Each of these approaches has its advantages and disadvantages. Most studies in the literature only
report a few PT estimates, typically for a single product and one or relatively few counties. As a
result, the estimates in these studies can be expected to reflect detailed work by authors who have a
comprehensive understanding of the markets that they study, and who have undertaken careful
specification searches, for example to determine appropriate lag-lengths for the VECMs that they
estimate, etc. As discussed above, the FAO GIEWS price data includes hundreds of price series.
Hence, we are obliged to automate the estimation and work with simple uniform specifications that
may not be appropriate in all cases. On this count the literature-based estimates might be more
reliable.
The other side of this coin, however, is publication bias. The literature might be biased towards
studies that report evidence of cointegration, and authors might be inclined to experiment with
different specifications and only report on those that provide such evidence. Indeed, in some of the
studies we surveyed, the authors openly state that they only report results for those markets for
which they find evidence of cointegration. In this regard, our own estimates with the GIEWS price
data might provide a more representative picture of PT (or the lack thereof) around the world.
Moreover, a problem that is common to all meta-analyses of existing publications is that results can
be presented in numerous ways and standards of documentation often differ considerably from
study to study. In our context, some studies present only ’s and others only ’s; some work with
prices data in levels, others with price series in logarithms; and not all studies clearly explain the
nature of the price data that they use (for example, what international reference price was
employed).
Finally, the advantage of the analysis of agreements and disagreements in price increases and
decreases is that it is free of any assumptions about the functional relationship between domestic
and international prices. If this relationship has been subject to numerous changes over time,
imposing a parametric model such as the VECM (with or without a single structural break) will lead to
inappropriate results. The non-parametric approach avoids this pitfall. However, it also produces
results that are correspondingly less informative. Even if we find that domestic and international
prices show a tendency to increase and decrease together, this does not mean that producers and
consumers on domestic markets are receiving undistorted price signals; it could be that the
magnitude of the domestic price changes is considerably larger (or smaller) on average than the
magnitude of the corresponding international price changes.

3.1 Estimates of cereal price transmission in the literature

The set of literature-based estimates of cereal PT is based on a thorough literature search including
journal publications, institutional reports, conference papers, thesis and dissertations. We consider
only studies that estimate error correction models of PT from international to domestic markets for
maize, rice and wheat. We therefore exclude studies that assess only cointegration, causality, or
pass-through effects. We also exclude studies that analyze domestic PT, i.e. within country markets,
or bilateral country PT. In the end, we consider the 31 studies listed in Appendix Table 1, 30 of which
were published in the last 10 years. Since most studies cover more than one country/location, the 31
studies provide 678 individual estimates of PT, 215 for rice (32%), 271 for wheat (40%), and 192 for
maize (28%).
16 of the 31 studies consider one or two countries, while 15 consider between 3 and 15 countries. In
total, the literature-based estimates of PT cover 52 countries, 9 of which are in East Africa, 7 in West
Africa, 14 in Asia, 13 in Latin America, 6 in Europe, 2 in North America, and 1 in Oceania. 15 of the 31
studies were published in institutional reports or as working/discussion papers, 8 were published in
peer-reviewed journals, and the rest are conference papers, book chapters or theses/dissertations.
23 of the studies are based on monthly price data, while 5 use annual and 5 use weekly prices. 26 of
the 31 studies analyze prices in logarithms, while the remaining 5 work with prices in levels. Beyond
simple VECMs, 3 out of 31 studies also test for asymmetric price transmission (Meyer and von
                                                                                                     10
Cramon-Taubadel, 2004), 3 articles estimate so-called threshold VECMs (Goodwin and Piggott, 2001),
and 3 consider both thresholds and asymmetry.
There is no consensus on what constitutes ‘the’ international or world price for a commodity such as
maize, rice or wheat. However, certain prices or export markets do dominate (see Appendix Figures
1-3). In our literature sample, US No. 2 yellow FOB Gulf is used as the international price in 67% of all
estimations involving yellow maize. Thailand export prices are used for 72% of all rice market pairs.
While Thailand 5% brokens dominate (55%), several studies also use other qualities such as Thai A1,
Thai 100B, Thai 15%, and Thai 35%. For wheat a greater variety of international references prices are
used, but 68% of the observations are based on US prices, and US No. 2 hard red winter (HRW) is
used in 24% of all cases. The domestic price underlying 36% of the observations is a border price, but
producer (21%), wholesale (14%), and retail (15%) prices are also used.

3.2 Own estimates of cereal price transmission based on FAO GIEWS data

The FAO Global Information and Early Warning System (GIEWS) food price data set was established
in 2009 as part of the FAO Initiative on Soaring Food Prices (ISFP).4 The prices reported in GIEWS are
collected from national official sources and non-official institutions. The GIEWS price series are
monthly and most run through to the end of 2011; some start as early as 1995, others as late as
2008. We impose a minimum length of 10 observations for a time series to be considered in our
analysis and analyze PT between domestic and the following international prices:
     wheat -> US No. 2 HRW
     rice -> Thai 5%
     yellow maize -> US No. 2 yellow Gulf
     white maize -> Randfontein (South Africa).
The GIEWS data includes a total of 57 domestic prices for wheat, 262 domestic prices for rice and 180
domestic prices for maize. As is the case with the literature sample, GIEWS mainly provides results
for countries in Africa, Asia/Pacific and Latin America. However, while the literature sample also
provides results for countries in Europe and North America, GIEWS only includes a small number of
observations (7 of 499) for Europe. To estimate the VECMs in equation (2) and (3) above with the
GIEWS data a decision about the number of lags (k) to include must be reached. As shown in Table 1,
the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC – Akaike, 1974) indicates that k=1 in the great majority of cases,
so for simplicity we employ one lag throughout.

3.3 Comparing literature and GIEWS-based estimates of price transmission
3.3.1 Cointegration

Tables 2 and 3 present information on the numbers and shares of international/domestic price pairs
which are found to be cointegrated according to the literature sample and the GIEWS estimates,
respectively. Overall, the literature sample suggests that international and domestic prices are
cointegrated more often than is indicated by our own estimation with GIEWS data. 79% of all market
pairs reported in the literature sample are cointegrated, compared with 55% in the GIEWS sample.

    We are grateful to David Hallam for providing us with this data in electronic form.
                                                                                                               11
This is presumably due to the literature bias discussed above, i.e. the fact that the literature tends to
report findings of cointegration. The literature sample indicates the lowest prevalence of
cointegration for East and West Africa compared with Asia/Pacific and especially Europe and the
Americas, but this pattern is not confirmed by the GIEWS results. In the literature sample, the lower
prevalence of cointegration for East and West Africa primarily is due to maize (46 and 58% shares of
cointegration for East and West Africa, respectively) rather than rice, for which most African prices
are cointegrated with international prices (83 and 73%, respectively), or wheat, for which there are
only 8 observations for Africa. In both the literature and the GIEWS results there is less frequent
evidence of cointegration for maize than for rice. For wheat, however, the literature indicates that
cointegration is relatively frequent (88% of all international/domestic price pairs), while the GIEWS
results suggest that it is less so (44%). However the wheat results in the literature are strongly
influenced by a single study that produces over 100 observations for North America, all of which
indicate that domestic and international prices are cointegrated.

3.3.2 Estimates of the long-run price transmission coefficient ( )

Table 4 summarizes the average estimates of the long-run PT coefficient taken from the literature
and GIEWS samples by cereal product and region, and Figures 2a and 2b provide an overview of the
averages by region and by cereal, respectively. On average the literature and the GIEWS estimates of
  are similar (0.74 and 0.76, respectively). These averages indicate that on average changes in
international prices are transmitted by roughly three-quarters to domestic prices. However, for all
regions with the exception of West Africa, the GIEWS estimates are on average roughly 0.2 higher
than the literature estimates, and Figure 2a reveals that the literature average is boosted
                                                                                                 12
considerably by a large number of observations from North America with an average = 0.89.
Otherwise, Figure 2b shows that the average s are similar for maize and rice, but that the GIEWS
average for wheat is much higher than the corresponding average from the literature sample. These
results change very little if only those product/country combinations are retained in the comparison
for which there are observations in both the GIEWS and the literature samples (Appendix Table 3).

3.3.3 Estimates of the adjustment parameter ( )

Table 5 present average estimates of the adjustment parameters taken from the literature and
GIEWS samples by product and region. We focus on the adjustment parameter from the first
equation in (2) above, i.e. the equation that explains changes in domestic prices, because in the
majority of all cases, only this is statistically significant. In other words, the dynamics of
international/domestic cereal PT are such that domestic prices adjust to deviations from the long-run

                                                                                                               13
price relationship, but international prices do not. The only notable exception to this rule is rice, to
which we return below. As discussed above, the adjustment parameter from the first equation in (2)
above is expected to be negative.

The results presented in Table 5 and summarized by region and by cereal in Figures 3a and 3b,
respectively, point to relatively slow PT for most cereal products and regions, irrespective of whether
literature averages or averages based on own estimates with GIEWS price data are considered. The
average estimated using GIEWS data is slightly larger in magnitude than the average in the
literature (-0.11 as opposed to -0.09) but both indicate a relatively slow rate of PT whereby roughly
10% of any deviation from the long-run equilibrium relationship between international and domestic
prices is corrected in the course of one month. This implies that it will take between 6 and 7 months

                                                                                                            14
to correct one-half of any disequilibrium that emerges due to unexpected price movements on
international or domestic markets.
Somewhat more rapid responses are indicated by the GIEWS averages across all cereals for East and
West Africa (average = -0.16 and -0.14, which correspond to a half-lives of 4 and 5 months) and in
particular by the literature estimates for Latin America (average = -0.26, corresponding to a half-life
of somewhat more than 2 months). However, the literature also produces positive average estimates
of for maize in Asia and the Middle East as well as for rice in East Africa. This is counterintuitive,
because it suggests that deviations from the long-run equilibrium are not corrected but rather
amplified, which would drive domestic and international prices apart over time. However, the
average of = 0.10 for maize in Asia and the Middle East is based on only one observation, and the
average of = 0.37 for rice in East is based on only 15 observations. Finally, viewed by product the
only obvious discrepancy is that the average literature estimates of for maize are considerably
lower (= -0.02) than all other averages (Figure 3b). 99 of the 103 observations that underlie this
average are from East Africa, which also explains why the average literature-based estimates of for
East Africa as a whole are so low (compare Table 5 and Figure 3a). If only those product/country
combinations for which there are observations in both the GIEWS and the literature samples are
included in the comparison (see Appendix Table 4), the results point to slightly slower PT on average
in the GIEWS sample (average = -0.09 rather than the -0.11 above), but considerably more rapid PT
on average in the literature sample (average = -0.17 rather than the -0.09 above).

If the adjustment parameters from the second equation in (2) above are considered, we see that
these are generally insignificant, except for rice (Appendix Table 6). Hence while countries are mostly
price takers for wheat and maize, this is not always the case for rice. Specifically, there is evidence of
statistically significant reaction by international prices to disequilibrium between domestic and
international prices in 121 market pairs (24%), of which 111 involve rice. Roughly 40% of all rice
prices are affected, and in most cases the adjustment parameter in question has the appropriate
(positive) sign. These pairs involve many countries and are not confined to a few ‘large’ countries

                                                                                                               15
such as China or India. As pointed out above, the simple linear VECM is restrictive and probably not
appropriate for many of the individual price pairs in the GIEWS data. Hence, a certain number of
spuriously significant adjustment parameters for international prices can be expected. Nevertheless,
the fact that significant adjustment parameters for international prices occur, if at all, almost
exclusively for rice price pairs suggests that the determination of international rice prices differs
fundamentally from the determination of international wheat and maize prices. We can conclude
that most countries are price takers on wheat and maize markets, but the evidence for rice is mixed.

3.3.4 Before and after July 2007

Table 6 contrasts median estimates of the coefficient of PT on cereal markets before and after the
onset of the recent phase of price peaks and increased price volatility in mid-2007. If we compare the
median estimates from the period prior to July 2007 with the median estimates from the period
thereafter, no clear pattern emerges. On maize markets the long-run PT coefficients () have fallen
considerably since mid-2007, from 0.385 to 0.116 or from 0.438 to 0.103 depending on whether all
price pairs or only cointegrated price pairs are considered. On rice and wheat markets the results Are
ambiguous. If we consider only the international/domestic price pairs that are cointegrated, the
median long-run PT coefficients have increased, from 0.547 to 0.705 for rice and from 0.576 to 1.013
for wheat. However, at the same time the short-run adjustment coefficients () have fallen, from
0.201 to 0.140 for rice and from 0.683 to 0.212 for wheat. This suggests that PT has become more
complete but slower since mid-2007 for rice and wheat. However, these results must be interpreted
with caution. We have used the median rather than the mean because the median is more robust
vis-à-vis outliers (for example, implausibly large estimates of for some international/domestic price
pairs). The prevalence of such outliers is nevertheless high in particular in the post-July 2007 VECM
results, presumably due to the short length of the available time series.

4. Analysis of the determinants of the strength of price transmission
4.1 Method

The averages presented above hide considerable variation in the literature-based and GIEWS-based
estimates of and for individual country/product combinations. To explain this variation, and thus
to generate insights into the factors that influence the strength of PT from international to domestic
markets, we estimate meta-regressions. In each regression a set of estimated parameters ( ’s or ’s)
from the literature or from GIEWS is regressed on a set of covariates that might be expected to
influence PT. These covariates are listed and described in Table 7 and cover geographic (e.g.
landlocked), infrastructural (e.g. logistics), institutional (e.g. STE) and market or commodity specific
factors (e.g. net importer). We include dummy variables for cereals (omitting rice) and regions
(omitting Asia/Pacific) to capture any corresponding fixed effects.

4.2 Results

We first present the results of logit regressions that predict whether pairs of international and
domestic prices are cointegrated. The dependent variable equals 1 when the two prices are
cointegrated, and 0 otherwise, and this variable is explained using the covariates listed in Table 7 –
for example whether the country in question is landlocked, whether it has an STE for cereals, etc.

The results for the literature estimates in the first column of Table 8 indicate that wheat markets
have an almost 50% higher probability of being cointegrated than rice or maize markets, and that
West African prices have a roughly 14% lower probability of being cointegrated with international
prices than prices in the default region, Asia. A high net import ratio for a product reduces the
probability of cointegration with international prices by 31%; a high import ratio may lead to more
policy intervention to insulate domestic markets from international price movements. If an STE is
responsible for trading the product in question, the probability of cointegration increases by roughly
11%, and if the domestic price being considered is a retail price, the probability that it is cointegrated
with international prices falls by almost 30%. The former result is puzzling but the latter is plausible,
as retail prices are further removed from international prices than wholesale or border prices.

Note: * See Appendix Table 5 for a list of the countries with STEs.
The logit results for the GIEWS sample in Table 8 also indicate that retail prices are less likely to be
cointegrated with international prices, but otherwise they differ in several respects from the logit
results for the literature sample. Maize and wheat are less likely to be cointegrated with the
corresponding international prices than rice prices are (by roughly 30 and 20%, respectively), and
domestic prices in East Africa, West Africa and Latin America are more likely to be cointegrated with
international prices (by 25, 32 and 19%, respectively). If an STE is in place, the probability of
cointegration falls by almost 22%. Improvements in logistics have a surprising negative impact on the
probability of cointegration between domestic and international prices. Ease of trade has the
expected positive impact, and being landlocked the expected negative impact on the probability of
cointegration, but neither of these effects is significant. Most of these results also hold if only the
time period after July 2007 is considered. However, if the period prior to July 2007 is considered the
logit regression is much less informative. This is probably due to the fact that many GIEWS price
series are very short prior to July 2007, leaving too few observations for dependable cointegration
testing. Hence, the logit regression for the pre-July 2007 period is based on fewer and less
trustworthy test results.

Meta-regression results for individual estimates of and are summarized in Tables 9, 10 and 11.
Table 9 presents results for all of the estimates of and derived from the literature sample, and for
the GIEWS estimates of and from all domestic/international price pairs. Table 10 again presents
results for all of the estimates of and derived from the literature sample. However, in Table 10
the Heckman procedure is used to generate results for the literature sample that are conditional on
cointegration. Moreover, in Table 10 the GIEWS estimates are based only on and from
cointegrated domestic/international price pairs. Finally, Table 11 presents only GIEWS-based
estimates, in this case only for estimates of and from non-cointegrated domestic/international
price pairs.

Consider first the meta-regressions based on estimates of and derived from the literature. We
see first that the results in the first column of Table 9 (estimated with OLS) are very similar to the
results in the first column of Table 10 (estimated with the Heckman procedure). This suggests that
estimating these meta-regressions conditional on cointegration does not have a significant impact on
the results.5 Similarly, the GIEWS-based meta-regressions in Table 9, which are based on all estimates
of and , are generally quite similar to the corresponding GIEWS-based meta-regressions in Table
10, which are based only on estimates of and from cointegrated domestic/international price
pairs. For example, in both tables we see in the second column that is roughly 7 percentage points
more negative for maize prices than for rice and wheat prices, suggesting that PT on maize markets is
somewhat more rapid. This supports the finding in Table 5 and Figure 3b that ’s for maize tend to
be somewhat larger (in magnitude). Indeed, this result is also corroborated by the results in Table 11
which are based only on non-cointegrated price pairs. Here the estimated coefficient for maize
indicates that is roughly 8 percentage points more negative for maize prices.
Similar parallels can be found across all three tables for example for the West Africa fixed effect (-5.1
percentage points in Table 9, -3.1 percentage points in Table 10, and -7.7 percentage points in Table
11) and for the ratio of net imports to consumption (5.4, 5.3 and 5.8 percentage points less error
correction according to the results in Tables 9, 10 and 11, respectively). Some parallel findings are
counter-intuitive, however. In particular, in both Table 9 and Table 11 we see that improvements in
logistics are associated with large (less negative) values of , and therefore with slower PT.

 This conclusion is supported by the fact that the inverse Mills Ratio is only significant at the 10% level in the
equation for in Table 10, and not significant in the equation for .

Moving to the GIEWS-based results for the pre-July 2007 period, we again see many parallels
between Tables 9, 10 and 11. In particular, all three tables display evidence of significantly more
negative ‘s (and therefore more rapid PT) for East and West Africa, for Latin America, for more
trade open countries and, surprisingly, for countries with STEs. In the post-July 2007 period, the
results in all three tables point to significantly more negative ‘s for maize and wheat, and for West
Africa.
These parallels are less apparent for the meta-regressions in Tables 9, 10 and 11 that explain the
variation in the ’s. Overall, the meta-regressions indicate that the selected covariates are able to
explain a larger proportion of the variance in the adjustment parameters (the ‘s) than of the
variance in the long-run price transmission coefficients (the ’s). The meta-regressions for the
GIEWS-based estimates of generally produce fewer significant coefficients, and they also produce
many coefficients that are implausibly large, especially in the pre- and post-July 2007 subsamples.
Since is expected to be close to 1, it is difficult for example to interpret coefficients that suggest
that increases by over 7 for price pairs involving wheat, or falls by almost 6 in the presence of an
STE (see the second column of Table 11).
In summary, the meta-regressions for the ‘s do generate a few signals. In particular, there is strong
evidence of more rapid PT for maize across all of the GIEWS results regardless of what period is
considered and whether cointegrated and/or non-cointegrated results are considered. Similarly,
evidence of more rapid PT in Latin America appears repeatedly in Tables 9 through 11. There is
weaker evidence for a positive relationship between trade openness and the speed of PT, and a
negative relationship between net import ratios and PT. Before July 2007 it appears that PT was
stronger in the presence of STEs, and when estimation is carried out without allowance for a break in
July 2007, it appears that better logistics are associated with slower PT. These last two results run
counter to our a priori expectations. The meta-regressions for the ’s have lower explanatory power
than those for the ‘s, and they fail to produce many robust and plausible results.6

 We also experimented with weighted meta-regressions that account for the fact that some studies provide
more observations to the literature sample than others, and that some countries are more prevalent in the
GIEWS data than others. These meta-regressions did not generate any additional insights.
                                                                                                          21
5. Analysis of agreement in the direction of domestic and international
price movements
The analysis presented in section 4 above is based on the assumption that PT is characterized by the
specific parametric structure embodied in the VECM. The VECM is a popular and powerful model, but
it might be too restrictive in present setting. For example, the VECM assumes that a domestic price
will adjust by a fixed proportion of any given change in the international price, regardless of the
magnitude of this change. To relax this assumption, we next study whether domestic prices and
international prices simply move in the same directions in most periods, regardless of the
magnitudes of these movements. If domestic and international prices tend to move in the same
directions, then producers and consumers are at least confronted with appropriate qualitative price
signals.
Table 12 first presents results for monthly price changes by region and by cereal, and Figures 4a and
4b provide corresponding visual summaries by region and cereal. Table 13 and Figures 5a and 5b
present corresponding results for lagged monthly price changes (international price change in month
t compared with the domestic price change in month t+1);Table 14 and Figures 6a and 6b present the
results for quarterly price changes; and Table 15 and Figures 7a and 7b for annual price changes.

The results indicate that there is a slight preponderance of positive changes in international market
prices over the time periods covered by the GIEWS data; international price increased in 55% of all
months (32% + 23% in the last row of Table 12), and decreased in 45% of all months.7 In 58% of the
months in which international prices increased, domestic prices increased as well (32 of 55%).
However, domestic prices decreased in only 49% of the months in which international prices
decreased, as well (22 of 45%).

 Note that the share of months in which international prices increase is not the same over all regions or cereals
because for each region and cereal different periods in which domestic prices overlap with international prices
are available in the GIEWS data.

Overall, the agreement between the direction of price changes on international markets and on
domestic markets is quite low, especially when international prices are falling. Table 12 and Figures
4a and 4b show that this result holds quite uniformly across regions and products. The only slight
exception is that prices in Europe tend to move in the same direction as international prices in a
slightly higher proportion of all months (56%), while prices in Latin America tend to move in the same
direction somewhat less often (51%). While falling international prices tend to be passed on to
markets in Europe (27 of 47%, or in 57% of all cases), this is not the case in Latin America, where
falling international prices are only passed on in 42% of all cases (19 or 45%).

Table 13 and Figures 5a and 5b show that these results do not change appreciably when lagged price
changes are considered (international price changes in month t and domestic price change in month
t+1). The only perhaps notable change is that the share of agreements between international and
European price changes falls from 56% to 52% when lagged changes are considered. Hence, to the
extent that European prices co-move with international prices, they appear to do so
contemporaneously at the monthly frequency.

As expected, agreement between the direction of international and domestic price becomes more
frequent when quarterly rather than monthly price changes are considered (Table 14). Focusing on
quarterly rather than on monthly price changes eliminates smaller short-run price fluctuations and
accounts for possible lags in PT. With quarterly data the overall share of agreements in the direction
of price changes increases to 56% (from 54% with monthly data in Table 12). This increase in the
share of agreements takes place only in phases of increasing international prices. With monthly data
58% of all increasing international prices coincide with increasing domestic prices; with quarterly
data this share increases to 61% (35% of 57%). In contrast, the share of decreasing international
prices that coincide with decreasing domestic prices is unaffected by the shift from monthly to
quarterly data, remaining unchanged at 49% (21% of 43%).
The share of agreements increases in particular in Asia (from 53% with monthly data to 60% with
quarterly data) and in Europe (from 56% with monthly data to 72% with quarterly data). The share of
agreements also increases for East Africa and for Latin America, but it decreases (from 53% with
monthly data to 51% with quarterly data) for West Africa (see also Figure 6a). Comparing Tables 12
and 14 also reveals that moving from monthly to quarterly price changes leads to an increased share
of agreement for all cereals except white maize (see also Figure 6b).
Finally, Table 15 reveals that with annual data the overall share of agreements in the direction of
price changes remains unchanged at 56% as with quarterly data. However, the share of agreements
in phases of increasing international prices increases strongly; with quarterly data 61% of all
increasing international prices coincide with increasing domestic prices; with annual data this share
climbs to 67%. In contrast, the share of decreasing international prices that coincide with decreasing
domestic prices falls from 49% with quarterly data to 38% with annual data. Especially striking are
the increases in the shares of agreements for Asia (from 60% with quarterly data to 65% with annual
data) and Europe (from 72% to 100%) and for rice (from 59% to 64%) and wheat (from 58% to 69%)
(see also Figures 7a and 7b).

Overall, the results presented here support the findings of generally weak PT that were derived from
the VECM analysis in the previous sections. They suggest that co-movement of international and
domestic prices is more frequent than movement in opposite directions, but the imbalance is not
pronounced and movement in opposite directions occurs often (47% of all monthly price
movements, 44% of all quarterly price movements, and 44% of all annual price movements). Perhaps
surprisingly, differences in the direction of change are as often due to falling international prices that
are not reflected in falling domestic prices (23%, 22% and 24% of all cases in monthly, quarterly and
annual data, respectively) as they are to increasing international prices that are not reflected in
                                                                                                               26
increasing domestic prices (23%, 22% and 20% of all cases, respectively). Intervention to shield
domestic markets from increasing international prices would lead to the latter type of disagreement,
but cases in which domestic markets fail to fall with international prices are equally common.

6. Price volatility

In this section we compare cereal price volatility on international and domestic markets. Volatility is
measured as the standard deviation of returns (the log ratio of prices in month t to prices in month t-
1). Results are summarized in Figures 8 through 11 and Table 15.
First, Figure 8 illustrates that median volatility over all domestic cereal prices in the GIEWS dataset is
higher after July 2007 than before (see also Table 15). There is no difference between the median
volatilities of those prices that are cointegrated with the corresponding international prices and
those that are not. This suggests that on average, local factors play the major role in determining
volatility of local food prices even for countries where local prices are cointegrated with international
prices.

Table 16 and the results presented in Figures 9 through 11 for maize, rice and wheat respectively
indicates that in general, domestic prices are most volatile in East and West Africa, followed by Latin
America and Latin America. This pattern is interrupted somewhat for wheat, but the calculated
volatilities for wheat are based on relatively few observations and, therefore, are less reliable. For
maize in all regions we observe that median volatilities are lower for prices that are not cointegrated
with the corresponding international prices, suggesting that decoupling prices does results in lower
volatility on average for maize. However, this is not the case for rice and wheat, where non-
cointegrated domestic prices are more, rather than less volatile than cointegrated prices.

Finally, comparing domestic price volatility with international price volatility (first lines of Table 15)
reveals that on average, domestic maize and wheat prices are more volatile than the corresponding
international prices, while domestic rice prices are less volatile. Figures 9 through 11, in which
international price volatility is depicted by the dashed vertical lines, break this comparison down by
region. Figure 9 shows that the great majority of domestic maize prices in all regions are considerably
more volatile than the international maize price. For rice (Figure 10), domestic prices in East Africa
are more volatile than the international price, equally volatile on average in West Africa, and less
volatile in Latin America and Asia. For wheat the picture (Figure 11) is very mixed, with domestic
prices in East and West Africa considerably more volatile than the international price, and Latin
America and Asia showing mixed results. Again, as Table 15 shows, there are relatively few
observations for wheat in some regions in the GIEWS data, so these last results must be interpreted
with caution.


7. Discussion
The analysis above generates a number of insights into the nature of PT from international to
domestic cereal markets. First, 79% of the international/domestic price pairs in our sample of PT
studies from the literature are cointegrated compared with 43% in our own estimates based on FAO
GIEWS data. Hence, regardless of which database is used, many of the studied price pairs are not
characterized by cointegration and thus do not provide evidence of stable PT. This is especially the
case if we consider that the literature sample most likely suffers from publication bias that leads to
an overrepresentation of findings of cointegration. Overall, maize markets are characterized by a
below average prevalence of cointegration, and rice markets by an above average prevalence. Which
regions of the world display higher/lower shares of cointegration depends on which dataset is
considered: according to the literature sample, domestic prices in Africa are less likely than average
to be cointegrated with corresponding international prices, but our own estimates generated with
GIEWS data suggest that domestic prices in Asia are least likely to be cointegrated with international
prices.
Overall, both the literature and our own GIEWS-based estimated point to average long-run PT
coefficients of roughly 0.75 and average adjustment parameters of roughly 0.09-0.11. This suggests
that on average roughly three-quarters of a change in international prices will be transmitted to
domestic markets, and that it takes approximately 6-7 months for one-half of a given price shock on
international cereal markets to be transmitted to domestic markets. If we compare PT in the period
prior to July 2007 with PT in the period thereafter, no clear pattern emerges. On maize markets the
long-run PT coefficients () have fallen considerably since mid-2007. This could be interpreted as
evidence of a certain degree of decoupling of domestic from international prices. On rice and wheat
markets the results depend on whether all price pairs or only cointegrated price pairs are considered.
In the latter case there is evidence that the long-run PT coefficients have increased, but at the same
time the short-run adjustment coefficients () have fallen, suggesting that PT has become more
complete but slower since mid-2007 for rice and wheat.
Employing meta-regression analysis to explain variations in long-run PT coefficients () between
domestic and international prices fails to generate compelling results. The meta-regressions for the
adjustment parameters () do produce some more suggestive results. All other things being equal,
there is some evidence of more rapid PT for maize than for wheat and rice, and more rapid PT in
West Africa than in other regions. An increasing ratio of net imports to domestic consumption is
associated with slower PT, which may be an indication of increased intervention on politically more
sensitive markets. There is evidence that trade openness is positively associated with the speed of
PT, but this effect is only significant in the pre-July 2007 period. In this period there is also robust
evidence that the presence of an STE is associated with more rapid PT. Finally, there is some puzzling
indication that improved logistics is correlated with slower PT.
                                                                                                       34
The analysis of agreement in the direction in price changes on international and domestic markets
suggests that the frequency of agreement is quite low at the monthly level, and only somewhat
higher at the quarterly level. This lack of agreement is especially pronounced when international
prices are falling; in this case domestic prices only fall as well in roughly 50% of all cases, which is
what one would expect if price movements on international and domestic markets were completely
independent. When international prices are increasing, there is a higher probability that domestic
prices will increase as well, especially at the quarterly level for Europe, Asia, East Africa and Latin
America. Overall these results support the findings of generally weak PT that were derived from the
cointegration analysis.
The analysis of domestic price volatility reveals that median volatility has increased since July 2007.
There is no difference between the median volatilities of those prices that are cointegrated with the
corresponding international prices and those that are not. This suggests that on average, countries
that have decoupled their domestic cereal prices from international prices have not benefited from
reduced price volatility as a result. The analysis reveals that in general, domestic prices are most
volatile in East and West Africa, followed by Latin America and Latin America. Furthermore, on
average domestic maize and wheat prices are more volatile than the corresponding international
prices, while domestic rice prices are less volatile.
The results presented here must be interpreted with caution. First, a lack of cointegration between
two prices does not necessarily mean that there is no PT between (McNew and Fackler, 1997). The
underlying PT relationship may be characterized by regime-dependence, for example as a result of
policy intervention or shifts between net import and net export positions. Hence, failure to find
evidence of cointegration might be due to a failure to test for the right type of cointegration. The
higher share of cointegrated price pairs in the literature sample is likely due to publication bias that
leads to an overrepresentation of ‘significant’ results. However, the authors of studies in the
literature might also find more evidence of cointegration because they employ models and tests that
are better tailored to the specific country/product settings that they study. The strength of the
GIEWS price data is that it provides broad and consistent coverage of a large number of
country/product combinations. However, the sheer number of price series available in GIEWS means
it is not possible to implement a detailed modeling strategy for each individual series. Instead, we
must resort to a uniform modeling strategy that can be automated. We have estimated one slightly
more flexible VECM that allows for a regime shift in July 2007, but this is no substitute for careful,
case-by-case specification and estimation of an appropriate model for each individual price pair.
Second, the GIEWS price series are quite short. Few series have more than 150 monthly
observations, and many have considerably less. It is reasonable to expect that the nature of cereal
price transmission from international to domestic markets has changed in recent years at prices have
increased and become more volatile, and some of the results that we produce with the GIEWS data
appear to confirm this expectation. There are, however, only roughly 55 monthly observations
available for the period since 2007.
Additional work might lead to additional or more robust insights into PT. First, the simple VECM
employed to estimate the GIEWS price data might be made somewhat more flexible. It could be
modified to allow for asymmetric price transmission, i.e. to test whether increases in international
prices are transmitted to domestic prices in the same manner as decreases (von Cramon-Taubadel,
1998). The results of the simple non-parametric analysis of agreement in the direction of
international and domestic price changes suggests that increasing international prices are being
transmitted more often to domestic prices than decreasing international prices. Alternatively, it
might be possible to estimate threshold VECMs (TVECMs) with the GIEWS data (Goodwin and
Piggott, 2001; Greb et al., 2011). The TVECM can account for phases with and without trade and
trade reversals and by distinguishing between these phases or regimes provide better estimates of
PT parameters.

Second, the analysis of agreement in the direction of price changes on international and domestic
markets could be extended to consider half-yearly and annual price changes, and to explore possible
delays in the response of domestic to international prices. It may be that more agreement in the
direction of price changes is found if current international price changes are aligned with domestic
price changes several months later, and that the length of this lag varies between countries and/or
products.
