          1. Lack of access to finance is a critical issue in the Indian state of Meghalaya,
             particularly in rural and tribal areas: Meghalaya is situated in the North East Region
             (NER) in India which remains the most financially excluded region in the country. An
             estimated 63% of the population is financially excluded in Meghalaya, particularly in
             rural and tribal areas. Bank branches are distributed at the rate of only 16 branches per
             1,000km2, compared with the national average of 30.4 branches per 1,000km2, and
             financial services are largely concentrated in Shillong (capital city). Also, the
             distribution of bank branches is highly uneven, with bank branches per 1,000km2
             ranging from 58 in East Khasi Hills to about 4 in South Garo Hills. Similarly, in South
             Garo Hills, on an average, one bank branch covers a population of over 20,000 as
             compared to 5,000 in East Khasi Hills. The number of deposit accounts per 100 adults
             is 41 (national average: 59.3), and the loan accounts is 8.3 (national average: 13.3).
             Therefore not only is outreach of financial services significantly lower than the national
             average, within the state variations exist (see Table 1). The reasons are difficult terrain,
             low population density in many parts of the state, poor infrastructure and a mix of
             demand and supply side factors (discussed further below). On the supply side, financial
             institutions have been constrained due to relatively low risk appetite, internal capacity
             constraints to manage risks or design products suited to local needs, as also poor
                                                                  5
               network connectivity and inadequate physical infrastructure that hinders effective
               delivery of services. It was noted by the mission team during the field visits as well as
               through earlier studies that loan origination has been poor on account of low levels of
               financial awareness, even though there is willingness and interest among the people to
               learn how to manage finances Also, for low value transactions, often the costs of
               owning and operating an account outweigh the benefits. For instance, technology and
               connectivity failure leads to poor customer experience, more so when customers have
               to travel a substantial distance at a cost to reach the nearest bank branch and transaction
               completion is uncertain.

          2. Viability of the Banking Correspondent (BC)-Customer Service Point (CSP)
             model, set up to overcome these challenges, is at best uncertain and the experience
             has been uneven. Of the over 5700 villages allotted under the financial inclusion plan,
             930 are covered by itinerant BCs who make weekly visits. It is observed that
             households access multiple channels to meet their financial needs. It is typical for a
             micro entrepreneur or household to access post offices for remittance, Self Help Groups
             for small savings and short term personal loans, and formal bank channels for Kisan
             Credit Card [KCC] based agricultural loans. Microfinance institutions in Meghalaya
             are mostly focused on East Khasi Hills and Ri-Bhoi districts and have been exploring

                                                         6
               the possibility of expanding their outreach and product basket.

           3. Institutional appetite and capacity for credit is low as well. Risk perception on credit
              amongst banks and other lenders in Meghalaya is high because of the low recovery
              rates, even though part of the problem is with limited appraisal and lax monitoring on
              the part of banks themselves. Credit culture issues also appear to have impacted
              recovery rates where borrowers even with good credit history of payments have at times
              chosen not to repay, or delayed repayment in anticipation of a debt waiver scheme. In
              this context, there is a case for strengthening product design, credit appraisal and risk
              management competencies of banks and identification of appropriate delivery and
              monitoring channels, while ensuring credit risks are priced and allocated in a manner
              that best reflects the capacity to absorb them. Willingness to lend on the part of banks
              is evidently low unless loans are guaranteed by the Credit Guarantee Fund Trust for
              Micro & Small enterprises (CGTSME) or an equivalent entity that allows banks to
              secure their exposure 1 . The GoM views the absence of credit histories [for micro
              borrowers] as a contributor to credit market failure and one that needs to be addressed
              on priority.

           4. The problem of access to financial services is compounded by lack of financial
              capability among the low income population. Studies indicate that there is a
              preference for utilizing own savings and informal sources to fund occupational activity.
              General cultural factors and attitude towards monetary savings and formal credit have
              hindered penetration of financial services. Traditionally, society has focused on
              meeting subsistence needs and links with micro-enterprises and local livelihood
              requirements have been weak: It is observed that most livelihoods are carried out on
              subsistence scale and not oriented towards the market. Limited surpluses from such
              low scale operations therefore limits access to finance from both a demand and supply
              side perspective, rendering livelihoods risky.

           5. Financially excluded sections of the population are also more vulnerable to risks
              of crop loss or sudden job loss, as has been the case post the coal mining ban in
              Meghalaya. Since their savings are often are not monetized, it further curtails their
              capacity to access formal financial services. Awareness about availability of financial
              products is low as well. According to the survey conducted by PwC in 2012, less than
              50% are aware of non-saving and non-loan products which leads to involuntary
              exclusion. It is also noteworthy that majority of the survey respondents (at least 65-
              70%) who borrowed for starting their own business lie in the 25-49 age categories. This
              reveals an inherent desire for enterprise amongst the young and middle age people in
              Meghalaya.

        6. In terms of gender, the survey revealed that women are active savers but are less
           willing than men to use financial intermediaries to deposit their savings and instead
           prefer to keep their savings at home. Majority of females fund their investment (66%)
           through savings and therefore, demand for loans is lower among them. 2 Women and
           young people are, thus, the priority target groups for this program in Meghalaya.
           Meghalaya’s demographic profile supports the gender focus given its favorable
           literacy rate and lowest gender gap for literacy in India. Responses from field
           missions have also been encouraging in terms of the potential for positive development
           outcomes from gender focused interventions.

    B. Intervention

        7. The Government of Meghalaya (GoM) is keen to enhance financial inclusion to support
           its flagship Integrated Basin Development and Livelihood Program (IBDLP) by
           facilitating financial education and institutional capacity. To better understand the
           baseline situation IFC commissioned a statewide assessment of access to finance in
           Meghalaya in 2012. The findings from the supply side (across banks, NBFCs, MFIs,
           others) and demand side surveys (across farmers and enterprises) in the state were used
           to develop a DFID funded World Bank executed Non-lending Technical Assistance
           (NLTA).

        8. The objective of the NLTA (worth USD 315,000) was to support the financial
           inclusion initiative of the Government of Meghalaya (GoM), through piloting
           financial awareness, providing capacity building to select financial institutions,
           and designing a roadmap for responsible finance in the state. The focus regions for
           activities under this NLTA include ones where concentration of poverty is likely higher
           and therefore expected to be more excluded.

        9. The NLTA aims to take early steps in implementation to address the inclusion
           challenge in Meghalaya. These build on a range of diagnostic work already carried
           out in the area of Financial Inclusion and identified issues in varying degrees of
           granularity for households, firms and institutions in Meghalaya. The knowledge
           takeaways from this TA provide among the first empirical cases of work in this area
           including in some measure on technical specifications on intervention design that could
           be useful in other LIS/NER.

        10. The NLTA was organized around two core activities: (i) financial awareness
            component to support designing and piloting the roll-out of financial awareness and

              tribes; and (ii) capacity building component for selected Partner Financial Institutions
              (PFIs), with the aim to strengthen risk management capacity of the PFIs, develop
              customized financial products to meet the needs of the underserved population, and
              design a framework for responsible finance.

        11. The activities under the program support the state of Meghalaya in meeting its growth
            target of 11 per cent under the Government of India’s XII Plan (2012 -17) with thrust
            on reducing poverty; ensuring better livelihood opportunities for its citizens and
            creating necessary infrastructure for long term sustainable development. The NLTA is
            aimed at strengthening micro entrepreneurship / livelihoods in the state so as to
            encourage a move towards market based solutions and reducing dependence on state
            subsidies in this regard. It addresses these through synchronized demand and supply
            side interventions as demonstrated below. The project design is expected to enable
            GoM scale up the demand and supply side interventions subsequently.

       12. The activity supports pillar 3 of the CPS (Inclusion), calling for improved access to
           services to excluded segment of population. Increasing access to financial services is
           one of the key focus areas under the pillar. The activity is also integral to the CPS in
           that it focuses on a LIS, that too in the especially backward north eastern region (NER)
           of the country. In addition, the activities are also aligned with the CPS’s gender focus
           as women are the key beneficiaries of the activities.

   D. Details of activities under the NLTA

The Financial Inclusion NLTA-Meghalaya is delivered on the following fronts:

       Component 1: Financial Awareness


       13. The scope of work under this subcomponent is to help evolve financial literacy
           content , through pilot roll-outs in different districts and among the more excluded
           tribes and regions [Khasi, Jaintia, Garo] , which contributes to increasing
           awareness on financial products and improving capability in daily financial planning.
           The activities completed under this component are summarized below:

       14. Preparation of financial literacy

                                                                                             Bankofficial         the
                                                                                                           duringthe
           curriculum customized for Meghalaya training in Khasi Hills
           to reflect local profiles and financial
           priorities. Financial literacy material
           tailored for Meghalaya was designed by
           the World Bank drawing from Parinaam
           Foundation’s literacy curriculum, the
           World Bank’s Indonesia project on
           financial education and with inputs from
           the local trainers and GoM. The modules
           covered aspects of 1) Financial Planning
           and     basic     numeracy       skills,   2)
           Understanding the importance of saving,
           3) How to borrow within one’s capacity to
           repay and 4) Preparing a simple business plan and simple record keeping. The training
           used creative comic strip for story-telling, a workshop format and unique incentives
           (such as free calculator, savings box, financial diary and certificates). [Reports enclosed
           in Annex 1] Since many villagers were shy to approach a bank branch and speak to a
           bank official, staff from the nearest bank branch was invited to distribute the certificates
           at the completion of the 4-week training and have an open dialogue with the

                                                      10
             participants. The perception barriers which inhibited the rural people from approaching
             a bank are likely to be reduced by means of such informal interaction with the bank
             officials held in the village setting.

         15. Trainer training and building local capacity for scale through involvement of local
             staff. A week long training was conducted by the Parinaam foundation for 9 trainers
             and 20 Enterprise Resource Personnel (ERPs)3. The trainers chosen were persons with
             local language competence in the three regions of the state. The feedback from the
             training was used to further refine the financial literacy material.

         16. Delivering the training at the last mile. The pilot trainings were conducted from April
             27-June 3, 2015 in a representative sample of villages in each district identified as per
             agreed criteria4 to ensure adequate participation from the target population,. Baseline
             data of the selected villages was captured in a format provided by the World Bank
             Team. The financial literacy training imparted under the program was given at a neutral
             location in the village, in the local language and at a time suitable for the villagers (e.g.
             early morning or late evenings when most people are not at work). Stories, group
             exercises, games, etc., kept the class engaged and made the training fun for the
             participants. This ensured better attendance and interest in the program. The training
             was attended by 1780 participants in 45 villages spread across the three tribal regions;
             Khasi, Jaintia and Garo Hills. 5Women constituted about 67% of the total trainees and
             the average age of the trainees was 32.8 years. Most participants were involved in
             agriculture or piggery activities. (Refer to Figure 2). In order to prepare a video guide
             for future trainers and document the learnings, GoM requested filming of the sessions
             being conducted in select villages covering all the three regions. Consequently, a GoM
             appointed media team, facilitated by the World Bank covered the videographing of all
             modules including reactions of select participants and the trainers. A shorter video will
             be used to showcase the program to various stakeholders while a longer video will serve
             as a practical guide for delivery of the training by future trainers.

  Enterprise Facilitation Centres (EFCs) are set up in all 39 blocks of the state to act as a single window public
interface agency under the IBDLP programme at the grass root level. EFCs coordinate with different agencies to
facilitate the inception and growth of enterprises. The EFCs are manned by two enterprise resource persons (ERPs)
and one enterprise support person (ESP).
4
  Primary criteria for selection of villages: a) villages with more than 100 house holds, b) less than 5km bank access
and Secondary criteria are: a) preferred Enterprise Facilitation Centres and LIFCOM linkage, b)villages/blocks that
have expressed interest in literacy training.

           17. Production of an entertaining educational video. An entertaining film containing
               financial literacy messages was shot in Meghalaya using local actors.6The idea was to
               produce an educational film which resonates with the audience in rural Meghalaya
               where characters are believable and reflect the lives of the targets. The creative team
               worked with the World Bank team and the GoM to craft an appropriate storyline. The
               half an hour film contains a narrative story as well as animation to convey educational
               messages. A shorter primer video and radio content will also be developed with the
               film.

Box 1: Case of village Saka Boldamgre, West Garo Hills

                                                         There is visible excitement in one classroom
                                                        of the village primary school even though
                                                        school hours are over. About 45 adults
                                                        eagerly await their teacher while curious
                                                        bystanders peek through the windows.
                                                        Willingstone Mara who had come to attend
                                                        the third week of the training describes his
                                                        experience “This is the first training program
                                                        in the village! I have learnt how to save for
                                                        the future even if it is Rs.10 or Rs.15. I can
                                                        give advice to my children now on managing
                                                        money. I have learnt how to tackle
                                                        emergency situations.” However, he says that
                                                        the modules are not always easy for the
 participants, many of whom have only studied upto class 5; but the desire to learn is palpable in the
 classroom. As another participant proudly shares” I sat all night with the calculator to practice
 calculations. Now I know how to calculate!”



Key observations

         18. Based on target profiles and range of subjects that needed coverage, designing
             appropriate content and identifying suitable interventions was thought critical to
             implementation success of the sub-component. The pedagogy adopted combined
             content and format in an innovative manner to address gaps in knowledge, skills,
             attitudes and behavior. A classroom based training format using highly interactive
             methods which had been widely tested and found more effective relative to traditional
             teaching methods was used in training the villagers.

         19. Criteria for selecting trainees ensured that women were adequately represented, since
             exclusion indicators for women were found to be more adverse. ‘Teachable moments’
             were factored in through selection of trainees who were either embarking on or
             considering scaling up micro enterprises and therefore more receptive to investments
             in financial capacity. In designing the financial literacy modules, the Bank Team built
             on Parinaam Foundation’s core modules which had been tested and well received, and
             added fresh content (particularly the sections on savings and small business finance)
             from other Bank projects where financial literacy interventions have been designed,
             duly adapted to reflect local profiles and financial priorities. The participants were
             provided with diaries to record their financial dealings to enable them keep track of
             their finances. The diary recordings were reviewed by trainers from the second module
             onwards. The literacy material was further fine-tuned to reflect socio-economic and
             cultural nuances of different districts of Meghalaya in which the literacy trainings were
             administered. Finally, to complement the classroom sessions the entertainment video

                                                         13
             was designed to reinforce valuable information and messaging on financial literacy
             through a narrative that makes the characters and situation credible in a Meghalaya
             context, thereby helping create favorable attitudes and possibly change overt behavior.7

         20. The trainings were closely monitored by the implementation firm, Basix Consulting
             and independent field visits were conducted by Parinaam Foundation and the World
             Bank team with close participation of GoM. Adequate coverage of geography and
             participation was achieved. The trainers were found to be fully conversant with the
             modules and proficient in delivering the training. The GoM also indicated interest in
             customization of the prepared material for inclusion in the school syllabus, either as
             part of the text book or as a classroom exercise or a co-curricular activity. However,
             several challenges (as also envisaged during the conception of the TA) were faced
             during the implementation due to the need for careful coordination among the
             components and a tight timeline. Key observations and learnings from the pilots are
             summarized below.

         21. The initial level of financial awareness varied among the regions which affected
             the uptake and absorption of the training. The financial priorities among the
             regions also differed depending on their level of financial access and awareness .
             This suggests need to further customize content to the local context for financial
             literacy initiatives. For example, participants in the remote areas felt that the modules
             on savings and financial planning were most useful. The session on business planning
             was found to be too advanced for a class where most participants were illiterate and
             therefore, class duration had to be extended. Thus, selection of the participants has to
             be carefully done to ensure that the training is relevant and interesting for them. Since
             the selection is routed through the village headman, biases may creep in and various
             sensitivities need to be managed. Where most participants are illiterate, the pace of
             teaching should be slowed down to enable better understanding.

         22. Finding locally-based, educated trainers who are willing to travel to rural areas
             of the state was difficult. We saw a drop-out even as the recruitment process was going
             on. While selecting candidates for such assignments, it is necessary to build in
             redundancies to take care of possible attrition and have some additional persons
             identified. The ERPs who received the training and complemented the trainer’s role
             during the pilots were found to be very effective for running the program. The program
             also gave an opportunity to the ERPs to visit the villages in their blocks and interact

7
  A World Bank Policy Research Paper (Lisa Xu and Bilal Zia, 2012) indicates that it is especially important to
tailor both content and format of education program to their target audience. The FinScope surveys demonstrate that
lack of awareness of financial products and institutions is likely a major barrier to the take-up of financial products,
particularly insurance. Moreover, Carpena et al. (2011) indicates that it may be easier to design interventions to
improve financial awareness and attitudes than traditional numeracy skills

                                                          14
   with the community. Using the pool of ERPs for conducting the financial literacy
   sessions is seen to be a good idea and should be explored in future.

23. The law and order disruptions affected the continuity of the trainings. It also led
    to several logistical rearrangements at the last minute causing further delays. In
    addition, the safety concerns prevented the bank officials from making visits to the
    villages in remote areas of Garo Hills. Given the difficult terrain, limited infrastructure,
    different local languages, and the law and order situation, extensive coordination is
    required for running the program. Dedicated resources that are locally-based should be
    recruited to ensure seamless implementation.

24. The last session with the bank branch official helped the participants overcome their
   inhibitions in approaching the bank. However, field reports reveal that bank staff is not
   always well-trained to facilitate such interactions and in such cases, this could lead to
   a possible loss of confidence in the bank. There is also a risk of the bank officials using
   this platform for marketing purposes, which needs to be contained. Prior discussion
   with bank staff by the project implementation team will likely enable them to deal with
   customer interactions better.

25. Feedback and early indications suggest that the intervention has i) been effective at
    engaging the audience (validation being the fairly robust attendance record despite
    challenging on-ground conditions), ii) provided useful feedback on differential appetite
    for financial products viz. some regions like to use formal channels for savings, G2P
    while others may have a greater need for credit, iii) identified that financial capacity
    varies with exposure to the ecosystem of financial services and therefore warrants a
    localized yet dynamic approach to literacy enhancement efforts iv) found good
    potential for technology led delivery channels (especially recommended for testing are
    mobile enabled channels) which can help improve awareness and access and thereby
    help bridge intra-state disparities; this becomes particularly relevant for conflict prone
    areas which is a key challenge that Meghalaya encounters.

26. Supporting initiatives by GoM in upgrading connectivity are in progress, an area the
    state government views as strategic and is therefore fully committed to. Where mobile
    connectivity is a challenge such as in the remoter parts of Meghalaya like the Garo
    Hills region, provision of reliable financial services in a comprehensive manner using
    mobile technology would be feasible once GoM’s initiatives to upgrade connectivity
    in such areas succeed.

Component 2: Capacity Building of Partner Financial Institutions (PFIs)

II A: Risk Management at PFIs

       27. The scope of work under this sub component of the TA is to assess gaps in risk
           management particularly credit appraisal and origination, credit risk monitoring and
           adequacy of MIS/IT systems to provide support; recommend improvements in risk
           management processes through a Risk Management work plan; and design and piloting
           of risk training modules. The risk management framework includes strategy, analytics
           on identification, response, containment, forecasting and prevention of risks. These
           have been drawn from field lessons on a range of PFI risk issues including credit
           origination and market failures in Meghalaya.

       28. A situational assessment exercise at MCAB and MRB [Reports enclosed in Annex 2]
           to identify gaps revealed the need for risk management to be structured as a separate,
           specialized function and for good risk control practices to be embedded in operational
           processes. Despite PFI risk management processes being unstructured in their current
           form, they are effectively practiced in narrow operational areas or silos. The objectives
           of current state of practice seemed to be compliance with regulations and identifying
           risks after they have occurred. Both for reasons of greater regulatory preparedness and
           to manage the envisaged increase in complexity of business, having a dedicated risk
           management function at PFI’s is seen as essential for building robust internal
           management systems. This is being encouraged by both regulators and the state
           government who have lent strong support to this TA activity. Consequently, senior
           management at respective PFI’s has been involved in the process of building internal
           consensus for it.


KEY RISK GAPS: MCAB AND MRB

In general, the lack of diversified economic structure, small sized agricultural holdings and low
scale of operations has constrained credit absorption in Meghalaya. MCAB faces significant credit
risks [gross non-performing loans at 7.82% in 2013-14] due to its relatively weak credit appraisal,
origination and monitoring capacity. These have remained underdeveloped due to a large share of
lending absorbed by government schemes or Food Corporation of India [as part of consortium
finance] which preclude the need for robust, independent credit appraisals.

MRB faces credit risks [gross non-performing loans in 2013-14 at 4.45% with expected
deterioration in 2014-15] from concentrated exposure to businesses like coal trading which have
seen major disruption, as well as rapid expansion of its branch network in recent years.



                                                16
Besides institutional capacity, a significant factor impeding the ability to carry out due diligence
at institutions is the unavailability of legitimate financial records and supporting documentation at
borrower level due to the exemption on filing of income tax returns in the state of Meghalaya.

At MCAB, staffing is a constraint across levels both on account of attrition and limited ability to
replace staff. Branches are unable to adequately monitor or serve customers and at the head office,
senior functional positions remain unmanned. These pose operational risks.
At MRB, meeting service delivery needs from the rapid branch expansion entails navigating
significant operational risks. This is because a significant number of these branches are in conflict
prone areas. Key to containing this is addressing recruitment policy for local staff where the State
and Central governments can play a key role. The recent increase in the number of accounts arising
from customer enrolments under Jan Dhan Yojana is likely to increase work pressure on already
thin staff in branches resulting in increased operational risks.

Related to the issue of weak service delivery is the issue of poor customer orientation in general
as reflected in the absence of customized products to meet local needs, or any mechanism to
integrate client feedback into product design. This has precluded the need for testing of new
product design and delivery capacity.

Both MCAB and MRB are exposed to interest rate risk and run significant risk on short term
dynamic liquidity. They do not have active asset liability management systems that track and
monitor liquidity in various time buckets. Asset liability committees (ALCO), key in any bank risk
architecture are yet to go beyond regulatory guidelines and actually help the banks understand
risks. Treasury functions are not separated and well defined as good practice demands segregation
of treasury functions viz. into front office [trading], mid office [settlement, monitoring and
controls] and back office [accounting]. The lack of segregation results in enhanced risk on the
investment portfolio.



Risk Management Framework

       29. Based on the study of current risk management practices in the PFIs the consultant
           team had prepared a risk management framework for both the banks. The framework
           contains the actions required to be taken by the banks to improve risk management
           practices in various areas – organizational structure, staffing, systems and processes,
           MIS and skills of staff. The major recommendations are – i) Risk Committee of the
           board to be strengthened through improved structuring of its agenda and improving the
           quality of reporting, ii) setting up a risk management department in the banks under a
           senior officer and have major initiatives and credit proposals examined through the
           department iii) Setting up a risk management committee of senior officers that meets
           frequently to examine cross-functional risks iv) introduction of risk registers to record

                                                 17
          risk events, v) improve the analysis of MIS to identify actual and potential risks and
          develop a early warning system, vi) introduce additional MIS reports on risk-related
          aspects, vii) Introduce risk rating of branches, viii) improve staff skills in risk
          management through training and exposure. The document had been discussed with
          the PFIs and based on their feedback finalized (Annex 3).

Training modules and possible next steps

       30. The need for training of senior officials of both the PFIs in risk management, especially
           to increase their capacity to implement the risk management framework was strongly
           felt by the banks as also the stakeholders such as RBI, NABARD and GoM. The risk
           management framework documents were utilized to prepare training modules for the
           PFIs.

       31. Risk training courses were conducted during May 29th – June 4th 2015. The design of
           modules has been derived from the gap assessment exercise for PFIs carried out earlier
           in this NLTA and mentioned above. Deploying participant group exercises and case
           studies, the trainings have been structured around sensitizing the audience to risk
           concepts, its operational implications, management and early warning mechanisms for
           control and mitigation.

       32. PFI-wise modules are enclosed in Annex 4. Among others, the modules include the
           recommended organizational structure for Risk Management commensurate with the
           size and nature of PFI operations; respective responsibilities of Risk Committees,
           Owners and Managers; understanding various forms of risk that can potentially impact
           PFI operational segments and measures to mitigate them; understanding the concept
           and utility of building Risk Registers for an institution; Asset Liability Committees and
           the use of Asset Liability Management (ALM) tools; and conducting Risk Management
           Committee meetings.

       33. The approach has been to recommend a few steps beyond regulator mandated
           structures. They derive from the expected trajectory of the operating profile of PFIs,
           factor in good governance principles and leave open the path to graduate to a more Risk
           Mature organization. Upgrading capacity of state level Co-operative and Rural Banks
           by bringing in risk orientation in business processes would allow deployment of more
           advanced supervisory approaches like Risk Based Internal Audits or Risk Based
           Supervision at a future date that would contribute to systemic stability.

       34. In addition to the role of PFIs in implementation, there is a legitimate role for the state
           government in helping put in place appropriate mechanisms and incentives to address
           gaps, which could include policy reform. The state government being a key shareholder

                                                 18
          in the PFIs has a fiduciary responsibility towards sustainable PFI operations given the
          latter’s dominant role in rural and development finance, as also ensuring that its
          investments are well managed and productive.

      35. The consultative and collaborative approach adopted for capacity building at PFIs has
          helped mitigate the risk of resistance to change. The gap assessment and development
          of the risk management framework was done in partnership with the PFIs. After the
          draft reports were ready, these were discussed and the inputs from institutions were
          taken on board. The training modules were prepared in a way that the framework can
          be seen by banks as an operational document. Classroom activities entailed use of
          banks’ data for some of the critical analysis. Further the Registrar of Co-Operatives,
          Reserve Bank of India and NABARD (regulators) were kept apprised of the progress
          of work through the period of engagement. The training courses were well appreciated
          by the staff and respective CEOs of PFIs. The trainees identified a list of priorities and
          developed a roadmap for implementing risk management practices in their banks
          towards the end of training. RBI, NABARD and GoM in their roles of regulators,
          funders and members on the Boards of the PFIs have assured continuing attention to
          implementation of the framework by the PFIs. That said, the ability of PFIs to
          streamline data / information flow and build requisite technical and strategic capacity
          will require sustained effort.

      36. The State Level Bankers Committee coordinates financial inclusion efforts and
          provides the interface of banks with the state government. The formation, governance,
          roles of different members and review of performance of financial sector has been
          developed over the years and the SLBC is now a well settled body. The involvement
          of Reserve Bank of India and other apex development banks makes this body most
          effective. The learnings from the NLTA will be channeled through RBI and GoM in
          to the SLBC to ensure that banks become aware of field developments and expectations
          and adapt the learning to their context.


II B: Product Development at PFIs

      37. Scope of work included (i) an assessment of the capacity gap in designing financial
          products customized for the underserved population of Meghalaya (ii) preparing an
          action plan (iii) development of two customized financial products (product options
          could be agriculture or allied sector credit product packaged with an appropriate crop
          insurance product; savings products through cooperatives as BCs for banks) (iv)
          designing product methodologies relating to the two new products (v) training staff on
          the methodologies for product development.



                                               19
           38. Based on an assessment of capacity gaps in PFIs and demand side surveys carried out
               across 200 customers and potential customers of PFIs, two product prototypes [Product
               Methodology enclosed in Annex 5] have been developed for piloting and further testing.
               In summary, key requirements of customers in the target segment are flexibility in loan
               size and terms in relation to the specific cash flow generation cycle of the activity or
               enterprise; need for products to cater to marginal farmers including through minimum
               (secondary) collateral 8 requirements; need for storage and warehousing facilities to
               protect value of produce and lower market risks; and need for financing agricultural
               implements for productivity enhancement. Pig rearing was found to be a viable and
               scalable activity in most parts of Meghalaya whereas preference for dairy production
               was less broad based even if found strong in some areas.

           39. Loans for pig rearing and broiler farming are two products suggested for piloting. These
               are common economic activities across Meghalaya which makes them amenable to a
               fair degree of standardization in loan structuring, processing and documentation on the
               part of PFIs. These help reduce transaction and monitoring costs and processing times,
               critical attributes of small rural finance. Standard loan products from institutions
               typically meet part of the financing needs leaving the balance to be accessed from other
               less formal channels. This by itself could impair viability depending on the levied rate
               of interest or terms of repayment from less formal channels. If PFI lending criteria
               allows for higher exposure, with appropriate structuring or perhaps even credit
               enhancements, outcomes could be more productive, sustainable and welfare enhancing.

           40. The proposed products attempt to reduce this credit gap, provide a longer term, flexible
               repayment structure and minimum margin requirements with a back-ended performance
               based subsidy structure to address risks of moral hazard. Through such product
               customization, access to formal financial systems by groups previously without or with
               limited access, become possible. Monitoring requirements under such structures are
               more rigorous to ensure asset quality is maintained. The design entails the use of
               Business Correspondent [BC] services both for delivery and monitoring of credits to
               address this need in a cost effective manner, subject of course to appropriate oversight
               mechanisms to contain principal-agent risks being in place. The BC channel would also
               facilitate small and marginal borrowers to use bank accounts for G2P transactions and
               other financial products and services viz. savings, micro insurance, NREGA and
               remittance services. This could contribute both to BC channel viability and building
               financial buffers for low income households and microenterprises.

    Primary collateral would be the produce / livestock for which financing is being provided

                                                           20
      41. Staff training on product methodologies were administered during May 29th – June 4th
          2015 at MCAB and MRB in Shillong [Training presentations are enclosed as Annex 6].
          Next steps will hinge upon learnings from piloting the new products and evaluating
          performance. Measurement of performance is important both from the perspective of
          increasing ‘financial inclusion’ at the customer end and meeting desired credit standards
          for PFIs. Learnings could in the simplest case necessitate adjustments in design of
          individual products, or result in development of relatively more complex participatory
          risk sharing structures, or yield an even higher degree of innovation where these
          learnings combine with new public good like interventions like collating credit histories
          or mitigating risks through product aggregation, where possible. As explained earlier,
          the trained senior officer group in both these banks came out with a list of priority
          actions and a phased roadmap for implementing risk management practices. The CEOs
          of both PFIs have agreed to take the roadmap further after consultations with the board.
          The state government would have a large role to take it to the next level of development
          as would a range of participatory institutions.

II C: Responsible Finance Roadmap Design

      42. To support financial sector development at the sub national level, the responsible
          finance roadmap [Framework enclosed in Annex 7] looks at (a) mechanisms for
          improved sharing of credit information through credit bureaus and the key role of the
          state in facilitating this; (b) design of customer information kits to improve
          transparency; (c) simplified customer cards giving product details, costs, effective
          interest rates and grievance/complaints referral points with contact information in local
          languages; (d) inclusion of information on customer protection issues in financial
          literacy material and complaint resolution process; (e) feasibility of setting up
          Financial Inclusion Data Center for public access in District Level Consultative
          Committee of Bankers and/or EFCs; and (f) training of bank staff in local customs
          and culture to make them competent in customer interactions; (g) conduct of
          periodic demand and satisfaction surveys; (h) mainstreaming the roll-out of
          financial literacy training based on the experience of pilots and monitoring
          mechanism with RBI involvement to review customer protection, grievance handling
          and responsible practices. SBI, MCAB, MRB and HDFC Bank were consulted and
          their practices studied, and RBI and NABARD were consulted for developing the
          responsible finance framework.

      43. The public good nature of a responsible finance intervention gives the state government
          and regulatory authorities’ viz. RBI and NABARD legitimate roles in implementation.
          That said, the specifics of implementation design should be based on (i) a deep
          understanding of local credit markets, (ii) the likely effects the lending rules will have
          on lending markets to ensure that well-meant policies do not lead to financial exclusion

                                               21
               or increases in the price of delivered credit, and (iii) the willingness to sustainably
               invest in financial literacy efforts for the underserved population. Better data on lending
               markets before and after the rules are introduced and more detailed understanding of
               consumer behavior would help identify effective regulatory rules and supervisory
               actions that could ensure more responsible lending while not limiting financial
               inclusion and the growth of the credit market.

          44. Key to consider is the extent to which the regulator has a formal mandate and / or
              flexibility to set differential disclosure and oversight rules, if needed, at a sub national
              level. Inter institutional co-ordination may be required if disclosure norms are set in a
              standardized agreement between credit providers, and may need to be revised in the
              interest of say consumer protection.

          45. Finally, when publishing product comparisons and selection advice, the use of simple
              framing techniques that draws on behavioral research9 could help yield beneficial and
              responsible outcomes.

               and supply side inclusion activities and provided a platform for dialogue on related
               policy and investments for possible further work on financial sector interventions.

           48. The work can support GoM evolve an appropriate financial inclusion strategy 11
               (including responsible finance components) through data and diagnostics from baseline
               data captured through pilots as well as identifying a set of coordinated, prioritized and
               comprehensive framework for actions that ensures maximum impact within
               institutional and resource constraints. Further this can help implement a comprehensive
               package of reforms to encourage financial sector activity and innovation in line with
               the financial inclusion strategy targets, and setting monitor-able target indicators
               informed by data and diagnostics.

           49. This work can be useful for other states as well, particularly in learnings from demand
               and supply side interventions on bank account usage post first phase of Pradhan Mantri
               Jan Dhan Yojana, the Government of India’s financial inclusion program. The
               knowledge takeaways from this TA provide among the first empirical cases of work in
               this area, including not just broad program recommendations but to some degree
               technical specifications on intervention design that should be useful in other contexts.
