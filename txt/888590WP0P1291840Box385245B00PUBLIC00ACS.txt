           It is widely recognized that actions to reduce carbon emissions from deforestation and degradation must
           be undertaken with the full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities.
           Indigenous peoples and local communities around the world have long-standing customary rights to
           large areas of forest land, and have been key actors in maintaining forests that have more recently
           become targets for REDD+ programs. These rights and roles have received increasing formal recognition;
           as of 2013, Rights and Resources Initiative data show that Indigenous Peoples and local communities
           possess statutory rights to own or control approximately 30 percent of forests in lower and middle
           income countries.

           In this context, investment in Community Forest Management (CFM) must be a central strategy for REDD+.
           As research by IFRI and others has demonstrated, local governance of forest resources often leads to
           more effective forest management and socio-economic outcomes. Investment in CFM contributes to the
           equity of REDD+ initiatives, by ensuring that benefits reach the forest communities playing major current
           and historical roles in forest management and conservation. The widespread presence of CFM institutions
           and capacities that REDD+ initiatives could support and work through also enhances the efficiency of
           REDD+.

           This report by the International Forestry Resources and Institutions research network provides an
           important and timely contribution to discussions regarding the role of CFM in REDD+ implementation.
           Drawing on lessons from CFM experience, the report offers recommendations for how REDD+ can build
           in factors that contribute to successful forest and socio-economic outcomes, such as designating larger
           forest patches as community forests. It also documents current interactions between CFM and REDD+
           in Nepal, Tanzania and Bolivia, particularly how implementation of many REDD+ pilots is focusing in
           areas where CFM systems are already in place. The report highlights important cautionary notes for
           consideration by Indigenous Peoples and local communities regarding potential negative effects of
           REDD+ on community forestry, such as restricted access to forest resources, recentralization or increased
           local inequality.

           Despite significant attention to tenure in REDD+ discussions, recent analysis by the Rights and Resources
           Initiative (RRI) has concluded that REDD+ activities are not yet translating into increased recognition of
           community rights to own or control forests on the ground. While it may be early to judge, as many REDD+
           initiatives are still in early stages of readiness preparation, this finding points to the critical importance
           of providing concrete support for recognition of rights of Indigenous Peoples and local communities
           to forests as part of REDD+ implementation. Safeguards to ensure carbon rights do not conflict with
           customary rights to forests will also contribute to building synergies between CFM and REDD+ for
           improved forest and livelihoods outcomes.

     EXECUTIVE SUMMARY


    The urgent need to limit anthropogenic carbon emissions has led to a global initiative to
    Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+). But designing
    national architectures for REDD+ that integrate local actions on forests with national-level
    outcomes and do so effectively, efficiently, and equitably continues to be challenging. One
    option to facilitate the design and implementation of REDD+ is to learn from the experience
    of other programs that have historically been successful in achieving sustainable tropical
    forest management, such as community forest management (CFM). Lessons about the
    factors that contribute to CFM success will be useful in designing REDD+ programs. REDD+
    may also benefit from harnessing the capital developed by CFM. Of course, REDD+ and
    CFM represent both opportunities and challenges for each other. Identifying how CFM can
    contribute to REDD+ goals, and the potential benefits and risks in using CFM to achieve
    REDD+ implementation requires careful analysis of available evidence because the two
    sets of interventions do not have a complete overlap in terms of their objectives and
    mechanisms.

    In this study report, we use a thorough literature review and analysis of primary data
    collected by the International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research
    network from 57 CFM sites to achieve three objectives. First, we establish a framework for
    examining interactions and relationships between CFM and REDD+. Second, we empirically
    investigate these relationships in three countries: Nepal, Tanzania, and Bolivia. All three
    countries have a strong history of CFM and each is engaged in the development of REDD+
    or related institutional architectures. Finally, based on the analysis of our data, we
    provide key recommendations for communities, project developers, policy makers, and
    researchers.

    In Nepal and Tanzania, most REDD+ readiness activities and pilot projects are being
    implemented in CFM landscapes. These on-the-ground actions demonstrate that it is
    possible to leverage CFM interventions and experiences to support the achievement of
    REDD+ objectives, and that such an approach can be central to national REDD+ strategies
    in countries where CFM sites constitute a substantial proportion of the forest estate. These
    NGO-led REDD+ pilot projects harness and build on the substantial human, institutional,
    natural, and physical capital in CFM sites. In particular, the institutional capacity of
    community groups and their experience of working with NGOs and government agencies to
    bridge the local and national levels to achieve sustainable forestry have been catalytic in
    the implementation of REDD+ pilot projects.

REDD+ pilot projects in CFM landscapes have also made progress in building institutional capacity for
monitoring, reporting, and verifying carbon outcomes, explaining REDD+ to relevant stakeholders, and
developing new arrangements related to payments to communities and households. In at least one case in
Tanzania, REDD+ funding is being used to create additional Joint Forest Management sites. However, it is not
possible to attribute improvements in forestry outcomes to the design of REDD+ pilot interventions in the
three studied countries. Nor is there much evidence that REDD+ pilot interventions have incorporated design
lessons from past experiences and analyses of CFM interventions regarding the factors that contribute to
higher levels of carbon storage in community forestry sites.

It is also important to note that REDD+ pilot projects are in the early stages of implementation and have
had little opportunity to demonstrate additionality, with respect to avoided deforestation and degradation.
Second, payments under REDD+ pilot initiatives to date have not been performance-based. Rather,
distribution of funds by pilot projects has been linked to participation in the intervention. This approach is
simpler logistically, but risks creating false expectations in that communities may fail to understand that
future payments under a full REDD+ program will likely be contingent on changes in behaviors and outcomes
related to forest use and protection. Finally, the overall cash benefits through REDD+ payments in CFM sites
have been small compared with the livelihood benefits that community forests provide to users. We can
conclude that if there is no clarity during implementation about the operational aspects of REDD+ among
participating households and communities, it is likely that users will view REDD+ interventions as being no
different from other aid projects for resource transfers, threatening the very logic and also the outcomes
of REDD+. Additionally, without substantial increases in REDD+-based payments, the likelihood of altered
forest user behavior at a scale that matters for emissions is nearly non-existent.

In Bolivia, few formal REDD+ activities took place before the government rejected REDD+ as a market-based
mechanism for achieving climate change mitigation. Bolivia has instead developed a Joint Mitigation and
Adaptation Mechanism (JMAM), which focuses on communities, indigenous peoples, and equitable forest
resource management.

Given our sample size, statistical analysis of the CFM and REDD+ pilot data is not possible for the most part,
but we did assess how the two key goals of REDD+ and CFM‚Äîlivelihoods and forest conditions‚Äîare associated
with some of the key causal variables identified in the literature on CFM. We find a strong and statistically
significant association between livelihood benefits from CFM and forest dependence among households in
Nepal and Bolivia. We also find a strong and statistically significant association between community forest
size and forest condition/carbon outcomes in Tanzania.

REDD+ brings financial support to improve community forestry activities that have historically been
constrained by limited resources. Nonfinancial benefits include improvements in institutional capacity
and human capital. Better monitoring of resource extraction and greater enforcement of rules may result
in improved forest carbon and livelihood outcomes. At the same time, REDD+ poses challenges to CFM if it
reduces access to forest resources by local communities, or if it creates financial incentives for management
recentralization or for benefit capture by elites.




Executive Summary                                                                                                3
    Future interactions between CFM and REDD+, and indeed the very future of REDD+, depend on the level of
    available financing. REDD+ currently provides only limited incentives to influence households‚Äô forest use
    behavior, and the main incentive for continuing REDD+ readiness and pilot activities is the expectation of
    a much higher funding stream within a few years. The key contributions of current REDD+ activities are
    therefore to strengthen CFM through capacity-building and institutional development regarding terrestrial
    emissions reductions. These activities enable experimentation and the development of best practices around
    the design of small-scale, community-based REDD+ programs, and facilitate discussions and awareness-
    building among key stakeholders.

    In our case study countries, REDD+ has sought to take advantage of the prior experiences and capital
    developed by CFM. CFM can contribute toward achieving REDD+ objectives, but there are also other forest
    management programs from which REDD+ might benefit. These include government regulation (for example
    logging moratoria or bans), voluntary certification (for example, Forest Stewardship Council), and protected
    area management and integrated conservation and development programs. Ultimately, the success of REDD+
    as a forest-based climate change mitigation strategy will depend on improved funding, but readiness
    activities and pilot projects that engage with and learn from community forest management are a critical
    element of long-term, effective, efficient, and equitable REDD+.

    1            INTRODUCTION


                 Reducing the rate and extent of tropical forest loss is a critical component of climate
                 change mitigation policies. The need to reduce anthropogenic emissions has led to a
                 global initiative to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and forest Degradation (REDD+).
                 This agreement envisages transfers of funds from developed countries to developing
                 tropical forest countries in exchange for verifiable emissions reductions. A number of
                 recipient tropical forest countries are engaged in the challenging task of designing and
                 implementing REDD+ strategies that are effective, efficient, and equitable.

                 REDD+ is an objective and also a mechanism by which the global community is able to
                 reward individuals, communities, projects, and countries that demonstrate achievement
                 of that objective (Angelsen 2008). It is not a specific action or program; rather, it is a
                 broad set of approaches for forest conservation. It can be viewed as a form of Payments
                 for Environmental Services (PES) program, implemented within either a national or
                 a subnational REDD+ framework. There are two transactions within a national REDD+
                 model: (1) conditional payments from international donors to national governments that
                 pledge to reduce emissions; and (2) funding from national governments to subnational
                 organizations (for example, forest users, communities, or local governments) that either
                 make the land-use changes required for emissions reductions or demonstrate a history
                 of sustainable forest management (Campbell 2009). In the subnational model, national
                 governments are bypassed and payments are made directly by donors to specific projects
                 and programs. In either model, the distribution of funding may take the form of direct
                 cash transfers and also entail a variety of other interventions including tenure reform and
                 resources for improved forest management practices.

                 REDD+ has been widely discussed and broadly embraced, but the reality of designing
                 and implementing it has been challenging. A number of ‚ÄúREDD-readiness‚Äù and
                 pilot programs have been established, but no country yet has a fully operational national
                 REDD+ strategy. Designing architectures for REDD+ that are effective (at reducing
                 emissions), efficient (in doing so at an economically viable cost), and equitable (in
                 distributing costs and benefits) has proven difficult, in part because of the strict criteria
                 that must be met. Metrics of effectiveness (creating additionality, ensuring permanence,
                 avoiding leakage, scaling, allowing flexibility, and developing mechanisms for monitoring,
                 reporting, and verification), of efficiency (minimizing transaction, opportunity, and

    operating costs), and of equity (distributing benefits fairly, developing institutional capacity, reducing
    poverty, securing land and carbon rights, building community capacity, and implementing complaint
    mechanisms) are all required in order to satisfy different actors in donor and recipient countries (Angelsen
    2008; table 1.1). At the same time, programs must retain enough flexibility to adapt to dynamic political,
    economic, and environmental conditions.

    The urgency with which REDD+ strategies must be developed means that there is limited scope for long-
    lasting pilot initiatives or lengthy trials of alternative architectures to identify best practices. One option to
    facilitate the design and implementation of REDD+ is to harness the experience of other programs that have
    historically been successful in achieving sustainable tropical forest management.

    One set of programs that has been the focus of much attention in the context of REDD+ is that of community
    forest management (CFM) (Agrawal and Angelsen 2009; Corbera and Schroeder 2011; Hayes and Persha 2010).
    CFM programs have a strong history of sustainable positive outcomes for both forests and people. Lessons
    about the factors that contribute to CFM success can therefore be useful in the design of REDD+ programs,
    and REDD+ may also benefit from harnessing the capital developed by CFM. At the same time, REDD+ may
    bring both opportunities and challenges to CFM landscapes, and the impact that carbon finance will have on
    the future of decentralized forest management is unknown. But identifying how CFM can contribute to REDD+
    goals, and potential risks in using CFM to achieve effective, efficient, and equitable REDD+ implementation,
    requires careful analysis of available evidence because the two sets of interventions do not have a complete
    overlap in terms of their objectives and mechanisms.

    Studies of CFM clearly show that it can achieve a number of REDD+ objectives. On the other hand, REDD+
    potentially offers opportunities to further improve forest outcomes in concert with CFM arrangements.
    However, the extent to which the two programs are compatible and may benefit from, or negatively affect,
    each other has not been well documented.

    The objectives of this study report are:
    1.	 To establish a conceptual framework for exploring the interactions between CFM and REDD+. This
        framework will consider the potential for CFM to contribute to achieving REDD+ objectives, and also the
        range of possible effects that REDD+ architectures may have on CFM in its existing form.
    2.	 To characterize these relationships between CFM and REDD+ in three countries that have a strong history
        of CFM and where REDD+ architectures are being developed: Bolivia, Nepal, and Tanzania.
    3.	 To analyze these countries‚Äô experiences with CFM and REDD+ within the framework developed in (1), to
        draw some conclusions about the extent to which the two programs are compatible, and to identify those
        areas in which policy or capacity may need to be developed to fill the gaps.

Table 1.1. Criteria of Effectiveness, Efficiency, Equity, and Co-Benefits for REDD+
 Effectiveness criteria
 Depth and additionality        Reduction in absolute or relative emission compared with a business-as-usual (BAU) scenario.
                                Additionality is a more specific criterion that requires reductions to be additional to what would
                                occur in the absence of REDD+ (BAU).
 Breadth/scope                  Coverage of different sectors and type of forest users, type of forest and type of mitigation
                                measures included.
 Flexibility and robustness     Ability to adapt to meet both diverse local conditions and unknown future changes at all scales.
                                Potential trade-offs between flexibility and robustness need to be considered.
 Verifiability                  Verifiability depends on (i) the technology used to make accurate and complete measurements;
                                and (ii) the capacity to carry out such measurements.
 Displacement of emissions      Leakage can occur within or across countries, and also among land use activities (e.g. between
 (leakage)                      deforestation and degradation activities if only one D is included). Generally, the larger the scale
                                and the broader the scope of REDD+, the lower the risk of leakage.
 Permanence and liability       Permanence relates to ensuring long-term reductions, i.e., avoiding emissions reductions that are
                                simply postponed for a short period of time. Liability measures can take effect if permanence has
                                not been maintained.
 Effect on other mitigation     A real risk is that REDD+ efforts will come at the expense of other climate mitigation measures.
 measures                       Such crowding out effects are hard to measure.
 Efficiency criteria
 Start-up costs (upfront        Costs of setting up a REDD+ scheme, including establishing technical infrastructure and
 capacity-building)             governance structures, and, most importantly, training and capacity building.
 Running costs (forest          Operational costs of a REDD+ regime that, in addition to periodic monitoring, include a variety of
 protection costs)              policies and measures, such as forest law enforcement and tenure reforms.
 Landowners‚Äô opportunity        Opportunity costs are the forgone economic benefits from the best alternative (non-forest) land
 costs                          uses, e.g., the minimum amount a landowner must be paid to be willing to stop deforestation and
                                forest degradation/ DD (compensation payment). This will be a key cost component of a national
                                PES system.
 Landowners‚Äô transaction        To participate in the REDD+ scheme, the landowner is likely to incur additional costs (e.g. put up
 costs                          fences, get certified), which need to be factored into the compensation payments.
 Equity criteria
 Fair distribution among        One dimension relates to the poverty profile, i.e., (i) poor countries‚Äô abilities to participate in an
 countries                      REDD+ scheme (e.g. monitoring, reporting and verifying - MRV) and governance requirements);
                                and (ii) preferential treatment of the poorest countries (e.g. in setting reference levels). Another
                                dimension of fairness relates to not penalizing early action and not rewarding bad policies. And, if
                                basing reference levels on past deforestation, one should not penalize lack of development.
 Fair distribution within       This refers to intra-national fairness, i.e., the distribution of costs and benefits across
 countries                      administrative levels (local vs. national government) and across land use actors.
 Effects on local and           The Bali Action Plan acknowledges the role of local and indigenous communities in REDD+
 indigenous communities         activities. The practical implications are that traditional rights will be recognized and that
                                indigenous communities will be included in the REDD+ decision-making process.
 Co-benefits criteria
 Economic development and       REDD+ may enable or constrain economic development at the national and subnational levels,
 poverty reduction              and affect those economically dependent on forests as well as national economies as a whole.
 Biodiversity                   Carbon and biodiversity aims are largely compatible, but there could be trade-offs, for example, in
                                the geographical targeting of funds (biodiversity and carbon hotspots may not overlap).
 Rights and forest governance   REDD+ has the potential to improve forest governance and rights, e.g. through more transparent
                                forest information systems. But, it also entails risks if the potentially large sums of money
                                generated by REDD+ trigger corruption, mismanagement, and elite capture.

    2   METHODS


        Literature Review
        We conducted a thorough review of the literature to develop case studies for three
        countries‚ÄîBolivia, Nepal, and Tanzania‚Äîand to situate the fieldwork we conducted in
        these countries. Each of these countries (1) has an extensive history of community forest
        management and diverse forms of decentralized management systems, and (2) has
        played a leading role in developing and establishing REDD+ or similar national strategies.
        In addition, the three countries together represent geographically and institutionally
        distinct community managed forests in South America, Asia, and Africa, respectively. We
        synthesized information from a combination of peer-reviewed journals, grey literature
        (including government documents and nongovernment organization [NGO] reports),
        and websites (of government agencies, NGOs, and projects). Leading experts in CFM and
        REDD+ in each country provided additional information through interviews about recent
        developments around REDD+ in their country.

        The case studies aimed to characterize the status of REDD+ in relation to CFM in each
        country, in terms of geographic distribution, legal framework, institutional capacity, and
        the stage of design and implementation. We analyzed the relationships between CFM and
        REDD+, and assessed the prospects for compatibility.



        Forest Governance and Resource Outcome Data
        The International Forestry Resources and Institutions (IFRI) research network has
        developed a series of instruments for collecting data on local forest governance and forest
        resource outcomes in diverse ecological, social, and institutional contexts (Wollenberg
        et al. 2007). The analysis is based on primary data from 57 community forest sites across
        the three focus countries: Nepal (34), Tanzania (7), and Bolivia (16), collected from March
        1994 onward using the IFRI methodology (IFRI 2012). Data on ecological variables were
        collected using forest plots, with the number of plots ranging between 20 and 40 for
        each forest. Socioeconomic and institutional data were collected using semistructured
        interviews and focus group discussions with forest users and village, district, and state
        authorities involved in forest management. The 57 forest commons in our analysis do not
        represent all forest habitats, nor are they a random sample of all community forestry sites

from across the three countries. However, there was no known site selection bias with respect to the outcomes
or independent variables of interest to this analysis.

We used the data collected by IFRI surveys in community managed forests to assess the extent to which these
forests were likely to produce sustainable REDD+ outcomes, based on a subset of the criteria identified by
Agrawal and Angelsen (2009) as being associated with effective CFM (table 3.1). The REDD+ outcomes were
carbon (measured as above-ground tree biomass per hectare) and livelihoods (measured as an index of
contributions from the forest commons to basic subsistence needs of local users‚Äîa composite of proportions
of firewood, fodder, green biomass used as fertilizer, and timber for domestic use). The criteria for successful
CFM (and the IFRI data used as proxy independent variables for these) included: Forest size (ha), commercial
and subsistence value of the resource (higher than normal or not), user group size (number of people),
resource dependence (number of types of benefit gained from the forest [max. nine]), past experience with
forest management (age of settlement), effective local enforcement and sanctions (whether or not users
always comply with imposed penalties), and tenure security (whether or not forest is owned by the state).
For each independent variable we calculate the mean value (¬± SD) for continuous variables, or the mode (and
N of the mode) for categorical variables. We also calculated the level of association with each of the two
outcome variables, using Pearson correlations (continuous variables) or Mann-Whitney U tests (categorical
variables).

    3           CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK


                Community Forest Management
                Community forest management refers broadly to land tenure as well as forest use and
                governance arrangements under which the rights, responsibilities, and authority for
                forest management rest partially or fully with local communities of forest users (Agrawal,
                Chhatre, and Hardin 2008). CFM is thus a subnational approach to forest management that
                empowers communities to control and manage their resources. Such forests account for
                more than 10 percent of the world‚Äôs forest cover, covering 378 million hectares globally,
                and are therefore a key component of the contemporary forest governance landscape
                (Agrawal, Chhatre, and Hardin 2008; Charnley and Poe 2007; White and Martin 2002). This
                area is even greater if informal use and control are included (Agrawal, Chhatre, and Hardin
                2008). The growth of CFM has been rapid: Local communities currently govern 200 million
                more hectares of forest than they did in 1980 (Sunderlin, Larson, and Cronkelton 2009).

                Community forest management arrangements vary widely within and between countries,
                with different categories of management arrangement involving varying degrees of rule-
                making and management autonomy. For example, Tanzania‚Äôs Community Based Forest
                Management and Joint Forest Management are two alternative arrangements that fall
                under the broader banner of Participatory Forest Management‚Äîitself a form a community
                forest management. In many countries, community members have customarily had the
                right to use and manage patches of forests near their settlements and over time these
                arrangements have been formally recognized by governments through legislative actions.
                Countries such as Nepal have an extended history with CFM, with the first community
                forests established in the 1970s, a network of more than 18,000 community forest user
                groups (CFUGs), and institutions specifically created to govern these. In other countries,
                such as Tanzania, national strategies to decentralize forest management and formally
                recognize community rights to forests are more recent, and alternative models of forest
                management delineate roles for the state and communities.

     Community Forest Management Can Lead to Sustainable Forestry Outcomes
     The local governance of forest resources under CFM systems has in many cases been effective at producing
     improved environmental, economic, and social outcomes. In contradiction to the ‚Äútragedy of the commons‚Äù
     (Hardin 1968), CFM often leads to more sustainable socio-ecological and forest management outcomes
     (Charnley and Poe 2007). Demonstrated positive outcomes associated with CFM include greater carbon
     sequestration, biodiversity conservation, reduced rates of deforestation, and livelihood development
     (Dietz, Ostrom, and Stern 2003; Ostrom 2009; Pagdee, Kim, and Daugherty 2006). CFM has additionally
     been associated with greater implementation of forest rights; more equitable access to, and benefits from,
     forest resources; increased investment in future forest productivity; greater fulfillment of local needs;
     improvements in living standards; alleviation of poverty; reduction of conflict between communities and
     government; control of corruption; resolution of forest management problems; and reduced instances of
     forest misuse by individuals (Charnley and Poe 2007). Most of these outcomes result in greater satisfaction
     among forest users and an increased incentive to pursue sustainable management strategies in the long
     term.

     Researchers analyzing CFM have also identified a suite of variables that are generally associated with
     improved forest outcomes, and which characterize successful community managed forests. These conditions
     include environmental (for example, larger forest size), socioeconomic (for example, greater dependence
     on community forests for subsistence livelihoods), and institutional (for example, greater community
     autonomy in decision making)‚Äîvariables that, in concert, can lead to positive outcomes for forests and
     communities within a formal tenure system of community forest management (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009;
     Persha, Agrawal, and Chhatre 2011).



     CFM and REDD+
     There is considerable overlap between the goals of REDD+ and community forest management for long-
     term protection of forests. The key common objective for both CFM and REDD+ is to maintain forest cover
     by reducing forest conversion to other land uses and to maintain forest integrity by reducing unsustainable
     resource extraction. The two programs have a shared approach to achieving this objective: by creating local
     incentives for avoiding deforestation and forest degradation.

     These synergies exist despite some fundamental differences in the underlying objectives of the two
     programs. CFM was developed principally to protect forests in order to support the subsistence and income-
     generating extractive activities of forest-dependent communities. In contrast, REDD+ was developed
     principally to mitigate climate change by reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation. In
     much of the earlier literature and developmental stages of REDD+, compensation for opportunity costs and
     the generation of livelihood benefits were considered secondary ‚Äúco-benefits.‚Äù Funding and momentum for

REDD+ would not exist outside of climate change mitigation policy, and‚Äîat least in theory‚ÄîREDD+ programs
could be developed and implemented independently of any social development policy, if carbon gains could
be made in forest sites that did not affect local livelihoods.

In practice, the development of REDD+ programs is principally within developing countries where the
livelihoods of forest-dependent people are a central component of all forest management policies. The main
REDD+ programs, including the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility and UN-REDD, therefore view carbon,
biodiversity, and livelihood goals as being inseparable, and these multiple conservation and development
objectives are intertwined within the REDD+ discourse.

We ask two related questions about the design and implementation of REDD+ strategies in the context of
CFM: (1) How can REDD+ benefit from community forest management? and (2) How might REDD+ affect
community forest management?



How Can REDD+ Benefit From Community Forest Management?
The fundamental synergies between CFM and REDD+ suggest that the former could be a useful mechanism by
which to achieve effective, efficient, and equitable REDD+ design and implementation.

We distinguish two principal mechanisms by which REDD+ could benefit from CFM:

1.	 By applying the lessons learned from the accumulated extensive experience of community forest
    management to REDD+ project design.
2.	 By enabling REDD+ programs to harness, or be appended to, the capital, assets, and institutions
    associated with existing community forest management arrangements.
Here, we discuss these two mechanisms and how each might help to advance the design and implementation
of REDD+ programs at a national or subnational level.

Applying the Lessons of CFM to REDD+ [adapted from Agrawal and Angelsen 2009]
The scholarly literature and documented case studies on CFM go back as far as the 1970s, so the experience of
CFM and the evidence base for its outcomes is strong (Agrawal and Angelsen 2009). Many of these outcomes
are to some degree congruous with the objectives of REDD+, and some of the core elements that have enabled
CFM success may help to inform the development of strong REDD+ strategies. Extracting lessons from CFM
could therefore be a valuable contribution to the process of designing REDD+ strategies, but there have been
few systematic efforts to apply the lessons and experiences of CFM to REDD+ to date (although, see Agrawal
and Angelsen 2009; Hayes and Persha 2010).

     The variables and conditions under which CFM has been most successful may contribute to the design of
     REDD+ programs, either within or outside of formal CFM sites (table 3.1). All CFM governance structures
     confer a greater recognition of rights and more power over forests for communities. However, differences
     in the characteristics of the forests, user groups, local institutional arrangements, and other contextual
     factors that vary between CFM sites determine which community forests are more successful than others.
     By identifying the attributes that contribute to successful CFM, it is possible to extract generalizable lessons
     that may be useful to the design and implementation both of future CFM sites and of REDD+ projects that
     could be established in either CFM or non-CFM contexts.

the strength and extent of interactions between forest users and forest resources. Studies of CFM systems
suggest that small to medium-sized communities that are interdependent, are relatively well-off, have
adequate technical and institutional capacity, and depend on their forests are more likely to create and
sustain institutions to regulate forest commons more effectively (Agrawal 2001).

Institutional factors
Common property studies of CFM have shown how resource management is enhanced by three institutional
characteristics. First, tenure security for communities is essential for two reasons. It enables them to create
rules and management plans for the medium to long term, with sustainability and future payoffs in mind. It
also provides a legal basis on which to exclude nonlocal actors who may be more invested in short-term gain
than long-term sustainability. Second, communities need to be able to create rules that are locally relevant,
easily understood, and locally enforceable, rather than having these rules devised and imposed by external
agencies. Finally, there need to be mechanisms for sanctions, conflict resolution, and accountability of both
users and officials (Dietz, Ostrom, and Stern 2003; McKean 1992; Ostrom 1990).

Contextual factors
Community forest user groups and community institutions occur within a context, broadly defined by
demographic, cultural, technological, and market-related factors; the nature of state agencies; the
involvement of NGOs; and international aid. Summarizing the variables that are most likely to determine
whether communities can manage their forest resources successfully is difficult: market pressures,
demographic shifts, technological changes, and state policies may all interact in different ways. But to
simplify greatly, a stable context coupled with government efforts to reduce the cost of community collective
action are positively associated with successful CFM (Agrawal 2007).

These lessons from CFM have been well documented, and have undoubtedly informed the development
of forest policy with respect to communities in many countries. The question of how CFM and REDD+ may
physically and directly interrelate is less well addressed, and for this we discuss our second proposed
mechanism:

Harnessing CFM Arrangements
Approximately 25 percent of forests in developing countries are managed by communities, and CFM systems
have developed substantial natural capital (healthy forests with relatively intact biodiversity and carbon
stocks), institutional capital (specifically designed local and national forest user groups), human capital
(forest management, monitoring, and enforcement capacity), and social capital (experienced forest user
communities with high buy-in to CFM). There is significant potential for REDD+ interventions to harness
this capital, either by establishing REDD+ programs within existing CFM sites, or by using REDD+ funding to
expand the existing CFM network.

     1.	 Use REDD+ funding to achieve mitigation objectives in current CFM sites.
        CFM governance arrangements aim to maintain forest conditions for sustainable resource use, but were
        not designed with the objective of achieving verifiable emissions reductions or carbon stock values.
        Therefore, existing CFM institutions may not address all of the specific demands of REDD+ programs.
        However, existing CFM institutions and practices can be strengthened or modified to align better with
        climate change mitigation goals and to achieve REDD+ objectives in CFM sites.

     2.	 Use REDD+ funding to expand the existing CFM network.
        CFM may be one of the more effective, efficient, and equitable routes to sustainable forest management.
        Increasing the national and global extent of forests managed by communities could be an alternative
        mechanism to subnational payments for environmental services (PES) programs as a means to invest
        REDD+ funds toward achieving reduced deforestation and degradation goals, while satisfying REDD+
        requirements such as additionality and permanence.

     Both mechanisms could be an effective and efficient means to achieve climate change mitigation objectives
     in forests. Identifying the congruence between CFM and REDD+ would effectively facilitate the direct use of
     CFM as a tool to achieve REDD+ goals, as an alternative to in-country PES programs.

How Might REDD+ Affect Community Forest Management?
The development and implementation of REDD+ could bring both opportunities and challenges to CFM, by
reshaping many forest management practices and also the conservation landscapes in which CFM is located.
On the one hand, REDD+ may increase the financial, administrative, and technical resources available to CFM
institutions and forest users, making forest conservation more financially viable and further improving the
chances of CFM success. But the emergence of REDD+ objectives and programs may also alter the existing
ecological, socioeconomic, and institutional dynamics in the forest landscapes in which it is developed and
implemented. CFM is a dynamic set of institutional arrangements, and changes initiated or catalyzed by
REDD+ could result in either positive or negative ecological and socioeconomic outcomes. Identifying these
potential impacts early, through the experience of REDD+ readiness activities and pilot projects, could be an
important way to maximize the positive effects and to reduce the negative ones.

Additionally, if the anticipated expansion of REDD+ does occur, from its current status of relatively isolated
pilot projects and readiness activities to a full set of national programs, then it could be that implementation
within CFM landscapes has advantages relative to implementation in forest landscapes where community
rights are less well established. That is, if REDD+ is an inevitable set of changes in the forest management
arena, then implementation in CFM or non-CFM landscapes could result in different ecological and
socioeconomic outcomes.

       4            COUNTRY CASE STUDY: NEPAL


                    Distribution of Forests and Tenure
                    Forested Land
                    Nepal has a land area of just 14.8 million hectares (ha), of which approximately 39
                    percent (5.8 million ha) is forested (Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation 2009).
                    These forests can be divided into five bioclimatic zones (alpine, sub-alpine, temperate,
                    subtropical, and tropical) and three topographical regions (Mountains, Middle Hills, and
                    Terai Plains). Six forest tenure classifications exist, determined by the allocation of forest
                    management rights: government forests (including protected forests), community forests,
                    collaborative forests, leasehold forests, religious forests, and private forests. Of these six,
                    the government formally owns all but the private forest lands. However, the government
                    manages approximately 4.6 million ha, while communities manage approximately 1.2
                    million ha. The distribution of forest carbon is roughly proportional to land area: the
                    government owns almost 890 million metric tons (79.1 percent) of the total carbon stored
                    in Nepal‚Äôs forests, while communities own 20.6 percent (Oli and Shrestha 2009). The scope
                    for forest-based climate change mitigation in Nepal therefore depends in part on how well
                    the government encourages and implements forest management policies in consultation
                    with communities.

                    Community Involvement in Forest Management
                    Nepal has dramatically altered its mode of forest governance on at least three occasions
                    over the past 60 years. First, it moved from privately owned forested estates to a state-
                    oriented model, driven by the 1957 Private Forest Nationalization Act, which aimed
                    to ‚Äúprevent the destruction of national wealth‚Äù by nationalizing private forests while
                    nonforest land would remain privately owned. The policy backfired when many landowners
                    chose to retain their rights by collectively converting almost 500,000 hectares of forests
                    to agricultural land between 1957 and 1976 (Bushley and Khatri 2011; Ojha 2003; Pokharel
                    2005; Sherpa et al. 2010). Second, in response, the central government reversed its forest
                    management strategy and, through the 1976 National Forestry Plan, began a program of
                    decentralization and community involvement (Chhetri 2006; Gilmour, King, and Hobley
                    1989; Ojha, Persha, and Chhatre 2009; Pokharel, Stadtmuller, and Pfund 2005). Finally,
                    Nepal more strongly embraced community forestry management in the 1990s, beginning




Chapter 4. COUNTRY CASE STUDY: NEPAL                                                                                  19
     with the 1993 Forest Act, which included local forest users in forest management decision making and provided
     mechanisms for these users to benefit from the forests that they managed (Acharya 2002). This led to the
     creation of community forest user groups (CFUGs) and, in 1995, to the Federation of Community Forestry
     Users Nepal (FECOFUN), whose role is to advocate for the rights of CFUGs and to strengthen their role in the
     policy-making process. Since 1993, Nepal has formally devolved management rights over 1.2 million ha of
     forest to more than 18,000 CFUGs (ANSAB 2011). Most of these community forests and associated CFUGs are
     in the Middle Hills of Nepal, with relatively little development of CFM in the Terai. In part, this heterogeneity
     is a consequence of the Nepali government‚Äôs unwillingness to implement CFM in these commercially high-
     value forests (Ribot, Agrawal, and Larson 2006).

     While the government retains forest ownership in Nepal‚Äôs community managed forests, all management
     decisions are made by individual CFUGs, and each member in a user group has equal rights and access to the
     forest‚Äôs resources. The government of Nepal provides technical assistance to CFUGs when needed, in return
     for improved forest management (Acharya 2002). Decentralized forest governance in Nepal has thus enabled
     forest users to develop autonomous organizations and to reclaim traditional forestry practices.



     Characterizing CFM in NEPAL: IFRI Data
     The analysis of IFRI cases reported in this section is based on data from 34 forests and 36 forest user groups.
     The national government owns all forestland in the surveyed sites (N = 57). We characterized Nepal‚Äôs forests
     in relation to a subset of the factors associated with successful CFM (table 4.1).

     Factors Associated with Effective CFM
     Environmental
     Community forests in Nepal were small: the average size of community forests surveyed by IFRI was 174.5 ¬±
     158.6 ha (N = 33). Only one forest site was larger than 400 ha. Forest size was not correlated with per hectare
     biomass (Pearson = 0.182, P = 0.311). Neither the subsistence value nor the commercial value of forests was
     considered by foresters to be higher than normal (table 4.1).

Socioeconomic
Forest user groups were large: The average size was 2484.6 ¬± 2389.5 individuals (N = 34). Forest users gained
multiple benefits from the forests: The mean number of types of benefit was 4.6 ¬± 2.0 (N = 34). Forests that
offered more benefits were significantly associated with improved livelihood outcomes (Pearson = 0.369,

The majority of users did comply with imposed penalties when in violation of forest rules (20/23). All 31 of the
surveyed forests were owned by the state government, rather than by communities or by private individuals.

     Features of Forest Management Specifically Relevant to Effective REDD+
     Carbon storage
     The carbon gain from reduced deforestation depends in part on the volume of carbon stored within a forest.
     Forest carbon is closely related to tree size, as measured by tree diameter at breast height (DBH). The average
     DBH of trees >10 cm DBH was 22.4 ¬± 9.5 cm (N = 58 forests).

     Forest dependence
     Local communities used the forests for subsistence and commercial livelihoods: 69.7 ¬± 37.2 percent of
     households within forest user groups depended on forests for their subsistence livelihoods (N = 90 forest
     user groups), and 4.2 ¬± 12.1 percent for commercial livelihoods (N = 107 forest user groups). In particular,
     community managed forests were an important source of fuelwood. Forest user groups depended on
     community forests for 34.9 ¬± 34.8 percent of their fuelwood (N = 95 user groups).

     Capacity for monitoring, reporting, and verification
     Many user groups had prior experience of conducting (defined as coordinating, passing rules for, or
     modifying rules for) a variety of activities associated with monitoring, reporting, and verification (MRV). In
     Nepal, 59 of 60 user groups had experience monitoring forest conditions, 58 of 60 had experience monitoring
     conformance with forest rules, 55 of 60 had experience sanctioning rule breakers, and 55 of 60 had experience
     interacting with higher authorities. User groups had less experience maintaining records of forest conditions:
     33 of 60 user groups in Nepal had done so.



     REDD+ in Nepal
     The government of Nepal‚Äôs REDD+ strategy is led by the Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation. As of
     2010, different donors have provided a total of about US$7.8 million to finance REDD+ readiness and pilot
     projects in Nepal (Government of Nepal 2010). The primary donor has been the World Bank‚Äôs Forest Carbon
     Partnership Facility (FCPF), which has awarded Nepal US$3.5 million for consultation, outreach, terms of
     reference development, REDD+ strategy preparation, monitoring efforts, and investments for long-term
     REDD+ implementation and management. The government of Finland has also worked with Nepal on a Forest
     Resources Assessment (FRA) in order to generate baseline data on national forest coverage, carbon stocks,
     timber products, and other forest resources in protected areas (Government of Nepal 2010). Other major
     donors include the Swiss Agency for Development and Cooperation, the United States Agency for International
     Development, and the Japanese International Cooperation Agency.

     The Readiness Preparation Proposal (RPP) was developed for Nepal with the above support. The process
     involved 57 local-, regional-, and national-level consultation workshops, which convened forestry experts,
     government officials, media representatives, academics, and forest user groups. (Government of Nepal
     2010). As a consequence of the RPP, a number of pilot projects have been initiated, led by a combination of
     community groups and national and international NGOs.

Pilot Projects
At least seven REDD+ pilot projects have already been implemented in Nepal (Government of Nepal 2011;

building and benefit sharing (table 4.2, figure 2.1).

     The most comprehensive pilot project under way in Nepal is the ‚ÄúForest Carbon Trust Fund‚Äù (table 4.2). Four
     unique features characterize this project. First, it has actually made payments to local communities: initially
     in 2011 and again in July 2012 when a US$95,000 seed grant from the Norwegian development agency (Norad)
     was distributed. These payments represent the delivery of significant financial resources to community
     forest users: the Chanarwati, Ludhikhola, and Kayerkhola watersheds received US$44,188, US$26,122, and



24                                                                             community forest management and redd+
US$24,691, respectively. Second, payments take into account the condition of the forest before project
implementation, so that communities were rewarded for having historically taken care of their forests
(Gurung 2011). This deviates from the often-cited expectation that REDD+ can and will pay for only additional
reductions in deforestation relative to a recent baseline. Third, the project has designed and implemented
a nested system for distributing payments, combining national and subnational strategies. Payments are
made to three Watershed REDD+ Networks, each made up of one representative from each CFUG, for their
contributions to sustainable forest management. The Watershed REDD+ Networks are then responsible for
distributing the money to individual CFUGs (ICIMOD, ANSAB, and FECOFUN 2011). This mechanism bridges
the community and the national levels, satisfying both the need to administer payments centrally and the
need to make payments to households that reflect local heterogeneity in participation and costs (Newton
et al. 2012). Fourth, CFUGs receive payments based on a system that not only recognizes the amount of
carbon stored and sequestered, but also takes into account social variables. Only 40 percent of payment
values are based on forest carbon enhancement, with the remaining value weighted to favor households with
a greater number of indigenous (10 percent), Dalit (15 percent), and female (15 percent) members, in order
to favor households in poverty (20 percent). This mechanism may help to ensure that REDD+ benefits reach
marginalized groups, and to avoid elite capture.

In sum, the Forest Carbon Trust Fund‚Äôs differentiated payments are intended to encourage equality and
provide social co-benefits, and have led to an increase in wealth for many households and have incentivized
sustainable forest management (West 2012). The project was designed to meet the requirements of the RPP,
and of all the pilot projects, it comes closest to providing a functioning system that could work for REDD+
nationally. The Watershed REDD+ Networks could be the basis of a model system for designing payment
distribution mechanisms that effectively transfer funds from a national to a local level, if REDD+ is eventually
implemented more widely (ICIMOD, ANSAB, and FECOFUN 2011).

Finally, several pilot projects engage with community forest management and with collaborative forest
management in the Terai region. The Terai forests represent 62.4 percent of Nepal‚Äôs total above-ground
carbon stock and are capable of storing and sequestering more carbon due to the local climate and tree
species composition (Baral et al. 2009). However, the Terai forests also have a higher deforestation rate than
those in the Middle Hills in Nepal owing to the higher value of their timber (Panta, Kim, and Joshi 2008).
Because these forests are high-value and high-threat, it is particularly important to understand the impact
that REDD+ on them and on the communities that depend on them (West 2012).



What Additional Institutions Are Needed for
REDD+ Implementation in¬†Nepal?
The government of Nepal has placed community forestry at the center of its REDD+ strategy, in part because
of the country‚Äôs successful history and confidence in decentralized forest management (West 2012). However,
REDD+ carries an additional set of requirements, not all of which may be met by existing CFM institutions.

     Additional elements include: institutions to administer REDD+, a payment mechanism for distributing
     benefits, and increased capacity for monitoring, reporting, and verification.

     Institutions
     The success of REDD+ in the context of community forest management in Nepal will depend on the
     coordination and cooperation of state and civil society actors at the national and local levels to present a
     unified plan of Nepal‚Äôs REDD+ strategy to the international community (Dahal and Banskota 2009). Nepal‚Äôs
     Ministry of Forests and Soil Conservation has demonstrated its recognition of the importance of nonstate
     involvement both through the RPP‚Äôs emphasis on multistakeholder engagement (Government of Nepal
     2010), and through the central role it has given to community forest groups such as FECOFUN and to the
     Association of Collaborative Forest Users in Nepal‚Äôs planned REDD+ strategy (Luintel 2006; West 2012).
     Likewise, several civil society organizations have proactively sought government involvement in REDD+ pilot
     projects. For example, the Forest Carbon Trust Fund created positions for government employees on several
     of its leadership committees (Government of Nepal 2011; ICIMOD, ANSAB, FECOFUN 2011). This suggests that
     both government and civil society organizations are committed to cooperating with each other in order to
     further Nepal‚Äôs climate change interests in relation to REDD+, and that community forest groups are well
     placed to have a voice in the development of REDD+ strategies in Nepal.

     However, Nepal‚Äôs existing institutions were not sufficient to facilitate the development and implementation
     of REDD+, and Nepal has invested in developing new institutional arrangements at the national level to
     facilitate carbon market transactions even as it waits for the resolution of the uncertainty surrounding
     REDD+. Soon after the FCPF approved Nepal‚Äôs Readiness Proposal Idea Note in 2009, the government created
     three national-level institutional mechanisms for implementing REDD+ in Nepal: (1) the REDD+ Forestry and
     Climate Change Cell (RFCCC), (2) the higher-level REDD+ Working Group (RWG), and (3) the Apex Body, the
     Multi-Stakeholder Coordinating and Monitoring Committee (MSCMC) (Bushley and Khatri 2011; Government
     of Nepal 2010). The RFCCC is responsible for communication and outreach among stakeholders, measurement
     of carbon assets, and initial policy development. The RWG is the planning committee, responsible for approving
     and monitoring REDD+ activities such as workshops and ensuring that all stakeholders are represented in the
     decision-making process. The MSCMC approves all REDD+ policies developed by the RFCCC (Government of
     Nepal 2010). These three institutions developed Nepal‚Äôs RPP together, and were designed so that they would
     transition into useful roles during a future implementation phase of REDD+ (although it remains unclear what
     these roles would be) (Government of Nepal 2010).

     Payment Mechanism
     The RPP envisions international payments being made into a national carbon trust fund (West 2012). A critical
     component of all REDD+ architectures is a mechanism to distribute payments from this national level to a local
     level, and specifically to groups involved in community managed forests (that is, CFUGs), leasehold forests,

collaborative forests, and protected forests. The Nepali government favors a national approach, such as the
bundling of forest sites, in order to retain centralized transaction records and to prevent leakage of forest
extraction into non-community forests (Dangi 2012). The RPP proposes the distribution of payments from
the national level to districts through District Forest Coordination Committees (DFCCs), which are existing
multi-stakeholder institutions and may therefore be an efficient means to fulfill this role (Government of
Nepal 2010). However, DFCCs have been critiqued for not being inclusive of nonstate actors (Sunam et al.
2010).

Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification
REDD+ implementation requires monitoring, reporting, and verification to satisfy the demands of carbon
buyers (Corbera 2012), but Nepal currently lacks the financial and institutional capacity to undertake all the
MRV tasks necessary for REDD+ (Jha and Paudel 2010).

Techno-bureaucratic and centralized MRV strategies could stimulate recentralization of forest management
activities, while the technical nature and cost of monitoring, especially remote sensing, may exclude CFUGs
from participation (Government of Nepal 2010). In any case, collection of district- and community-resolution
data is beyond the scope of national-level projects such as the FRA, and will need to be completed more locally
(Kandel 2010). Subnational MRV may better account for forest degradation and for local heterogeneity;
failing to do so could compromise both environmental and socioeconomic outcomes in forest-dependent
communities (Bushley and Khatri 2011).

Nepal does not have a national-level land use change detection program (Jha and Paudel 2010). Nor is
there yet a system in place that could conduct local MRV (Government of Nepal 2011), although there are
indications that monitoring and measurement by CFUGs could be just as accurate as alternative high-tech
approaches (Karky and Skutsch 2010, Puliti 2012).



How Might REDD+ Affect Community Forest Management?
Civil society organizations, local communities, academic researchers, and government officials in Nepal
have all expressed concerns about the possible negative impacts of REDD+ on communities and community
forests. These concerns relate to uncertainties about how REDD+ may alter forest resource access, incentivize
forest management recentralization, or lead to benefit capture by elite groups.

Altered Forest Resource Access
REDD+ readiness activities in Nepal are focused on community forests, but uncertainties about the direction
and magnitude of REDD+ mean that the future impacts on forest use by communities are unknown. In the
short term, a REDD+ focus on maximizing carbon additionality in Nepal could reduce other forest benefits

     (Bushley and Khatri 2011) and lead to less access to forests for community users. Plantations of fast-growing
     tree species may maximize carbon outcomes, but can reduce biodiversity and access to subsistence livelihood
     resources (Ludwig, Hilborn, and Walters 1993; Putz 2009). Tighter control of forest use, such as prohibiting
     either agriculture or the extraction of forest products, could reduce the value of community forests for
     subsistence livelihood strategies, income-generating opportunities, or adaptive capacity (West 2012). There
     have been some attempts to reduce fuelwood consumption by providing electricity and by incentivizing
     a switch to kerosene or alternative fuel sources, but not all households can afford these transitions
     (West 2012).

     In the longer term, an absence of firm funding commitments from developed countries means that initiatives
     that started as REDD+-readiness and pilot projects may not be funded for long. Discontinuities between
     REDD+ pilot projects and full REDD+ implementation may have implications for forest users who have been
     incentivized to alter their traditional livelihoods. For example, the Forest Carbon Trust Fund pilot project
     encouraged a Chepang community to plant Chiuri fruit trees to replace shifting agriculture. The Chepang
     complied because of the large seed grant (US$1,176), but are worried about the continuity of payments
     (Sherpa 2012). Because it takes 15‚Äì20 years for the trees to mature, the Chepang are concerned that they will
     face food insecurity and poverty if REDD+ does not immediately fill the payment gap once the project ceases
     (Sherpa 2012).

     Recentralization
     Forest management in Nepal has been extensively decentralized, and strong community-level institutions
     have developed as a result. However, REDD+ could create lucrative financial flows that could incentivize the
     central government to slow, or even reverse, forest management decentralization in Nepal. One mechanism
     by which this could occur is if the District Forest Office (DFO) of the central government failed to approve the
     renewal of CFUG Operational Plans (Kanel 2006).

Centralized or Elite Capture of Benefits
Two trends suggest that benefits brought by REDD+ may to some degree be captured by the central government
or by elite groups. First, although the rights for CFM have been devolved to CFUGs, the government retains
ownership rights over all forestlands nationally except for in private forests. CFUGs therefore have the
rights to carbon stored in the trees, but not the rights to carbon stored in the soil, which remains with the
government. The government could legally claim all revenues from carbon financing that result from soil
carbon, unless those rights are formally transferred to CFUGs or other community groups. The REDD+ program
currently makes no distinction between below-ground and above-ground carbon, and this discrepancy has
fueled conflicting claims and confusion (Bushley and Khatri 2011; Pokharel and Byrne 2009).

Second, the highly profitable timber forests of the Terai are governed predominantly by Collaborative Forest
Management. Community forest management has not been extended into the Terai, and this has been
interpreted as an indication of the Nepali government‚Äôs unwillingness to devolve management rights for
high-value forests to communities (Ribot, Agrawal, and Larson 2006). Collaborative Forest Management
allows more timber extraction and affords fewer rights to local communities than community forestry
(Bampton, Ebregt, and Banjade 2007); 75 percent of forest-derived income under this tenure arrangement
goes to the government (Bushley and Khatri 2011).

    5            COUNTRY CASE STUDY: TANZANIA

                 Distribution of Forests and Tenure
                 Forested Land
                 Approximately 34 million ha of forests cover more than 38 percent of Tanzania, with nine
                 main forest types (MNRT 2001). These include miombo woodlands in the lowland areas
                 across central, western, and southern Tanzania; acacia woodlands in the northern regions;
                 coastal woodland mosaics in the east; mangroves along the Indian Ocean; and ancient
                 closed canopy in the Eastern Arc Mountains (Mwakalobo et al. 2011). This heterogeneity in
                 forest types across Tanzania results in varied livelihood opportunities and carbon storage
                 capacity.

                 Of the total forest area, 18 million ha are designated as forest reserves, national parks,
                 or other types of protected areas where resource extraction is limited or prohibited. The
                 remaining 16 million ha are not formally protected at the national level and are classified
                 as Village Land Forest Reserves or General Land (Blomley et al. 2008; Mwakalobo et al.
                 2011; Zahabu et al. 2008). Village Land Forest Reserves are overseen at the local level
                 by village councils, while General Land is managed neither by the national government
                 nor local village councils, and is subject to de facto open access use. Much General Land
                 is becoming degraded at a rapid pace due to pressure to convert forests to agriculture,
                 increase charcoal production and harvest firewood (Chiesa et al. 2009). The deforestation
                 rate of General Land is estimated to be between 130,000 and 500,000 ha per year and is
                 greatest in areas where populations are expanding (Zahabu et al. 2008).

                 Community Involvement in Forest Management
                 Throughout the 1990s, Tanzania shifted from a centralized to a more decentralized
                 forest governance system, as the Tanzanian government encouraged more community
                 participation in the conservation and management of forests (Wily 2001). In 1998, the
                 Tanzanian government passed forest policy legislation that created Participatory Forest
                 Management (PFM) as an official land tenure category. This included the creation of village
                 councils, which were intended to create greater local governance autonomy and to increase
                 community participation in land management (Akida and Blomley 2006; Naughton-
                 Treves and Day 2012; Veit, Vhugen, and Miner 2012). However, this legislation was not
                 operationalized until 2002, when two subcategories were implemented within PFM: Joint
                 Forest Management (JFM) and Community Based Forest management (CBFM) (Mukama,
                 Mustalahti, and Zahabu 2012). PFM is a system of forest governance that devolves

     authority from the national to the local level, and occurs in both national forest reserves and Village Land
     Forest Reserves (VLFR). JFM and CBFM are legal land tenure regimes that have been implemented to improve
     and restore forest quality and the livelihoods of the local communities through community participation.
     Under JFM, the government owns the forest while the community assists with forest management. However,
     the communities‚Äô access rights to the forest depend on the unique benefit-sharing mechanism established
     for each JFM site. As a consequence, there are commonly more restrictions for communities and less clear
     distribution of benefits to the communities in JFM than in CBFM. In contrast, CBFM provides villages with de
     jure rights over VLFRs, allowing them to define who may access and use forest resources (Blomley and Iddi
     2009). As of 2008, more than 2,300 villages (18 percent of all villages nationally) had become engaged in
     PFM, with 1.6 million ha of forest under JFM and 2.1 million ha under CBFM, representing about 11 percent
     of all forested land in Tanzania (Blomley et al. 2008). All of these management plans are legally recognized,
     but all land in Tanzania remains owned by the president on behalf of the nation. Thus, only the rights to the
     land can be bought or sold, not the land itself (Naughton-Treves and Day 2012). As a consequence, it is very
     difficult to define clear property ownership, which can complicate forest use and management.



     Characterizing CFM in TANZANIA: IFRI Data
     The analysis of IFRI cases reported in this section is based on data from 7 forests and 18 forest user groups.
     We characterized Tanzania‚Äôs forests in relation to a subset of the factors associated with successful CFM (table
     5.1).

     Factors Associated with Effective CFM
     Environmental
     Community forests in Tanzania were medium-sized: The average size of community forests surveyed by
     IFRI was 1922.9 ¬± 3217.0 ha (N = 6). Only two forest sites were smaller than 100 ha. Forest size was loosely
     correlated with per hectare biomass (Pearson = 0.803, P = 0.054). Neither the subsistence value nor the
     commercial value of forests was considered by foresters to be higher than normal (table 5.1).

     Socioeconomic
     Forest user groups were large: The average size was 1320.5 ¬± 964.7 individuals (N = 6). Forest users gained
     multiple benefits from the forests: The mean number of types of benefit was 5.4 ¬± 3.2 (N = 7). Forest users
     had extensive experience with forest management: The average age of settlements in Nepal was 42.4 ¬± 6.2
     years (N = 7).

Features of Forest Management Specifically Relevant to Effective REDD+
Carbon storage
The carbon gain from reduced deforestation depends in part on the volume of carbon stored within a forest.
Forest carbon is closely related to tree size, as measured by tree diameter at breast height. The average DBH
of trees >10 cm DBH was 18.4 ¬± 7.7 cm (N = 2).




Chapter 5: COUNTRY CASE STUDY: TANZANIA                                                                                                                    33
     Forest dependence
     Local communities used the forests for subsistence and commercial livelihoods: 43.2 ¬± 47.7 percent of
     households within forest user groups depended on forests for their subsistence livelihoods (N = 19 forest
     user groups), and 12.8 ¬± 29.5 percent for commercial livelihoods (N = 17 forest user groups).

     In particular, community managed forests were an important source of fuelwood. Forest user groups depended
     on community forests for 50.4 ¬± 43.4 percent of their fuelwood (N = 16 user groups).

     Capacity for monitoring, reporting, and verification
     Many forest associations had prior experience conducting (defined as coordinating, passing rules for, or
     modifying rules for) a variety of activities associated with MRV. In Tanzania, half of the forest associations
     had experience monitoring forest condition, half had experience monitoring conformance with forest rules,
     neither had experience with sanctioning rule breakers, and half had experience interacting with higher
     authorities. Forest associations had less experience maintaining records of forest conditions: Only half of the
     forest associations in Tanzania had done so.



     REDD+ in Tanzania
     The Government of Tanzania acknowledges the benefits that could accrue to both the nation and local people
     through carbon markets and REDD+, and is researching viable emissions reduction programs (Chiesa et
     al. 2009). Tanzania is one of nine pilot countries for the UN-REDD program, and pilot projects are being
     developed and implemented throughout the country (Burgess et al. 2010). It has elected to pursue a two-
     tiered national REDD+ model rather than a subnational system of direct payments from international donors to
     local communities. Land conversion to agriculture is the main driver of deforestation and forest degradation
     in Tanzania, and so programs that address land use practices have the potential to mitigate forest conversion.

     Tanzania has been proactive in seeking funding and support from various REDD+ programs and donor
     countries to implement REDD+ pilot projects. The major donor of the REDD+ program in Tanzania has been
     the Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has committed NKr 500 million (US$91.7 million) in a series
     of bilateral agreements with Tanzania since 2009 to enable the creation and implementation of subnational
     REDD+ pilot projects, as well as research and capacity building (Norad 2011). Tanzania has also received
     about US$4.28 million from the UN-REDD Programme aimed at supporting national-level institutional reform
     (Burgess et al. 2010). Other major donors include the government of Finland, for a national forest monitoring
     system (US$5 million); and the German Climate Change Initiative (US$3.5 million), for improving forest
     management in the Eastern Arc Mountains (Burgess et al. 2010).

Pilot Projects
Tanzania has created a draft National REDD+ Strategy, which an interim National REDD+ Task Force is
implementing through pilot projects and the development of new institutions. Pro-poor implementation and
poverty reduction have been national priorities since 2008, and the REDD+ program accordingly focuses on
the involvement of local communities in design, implementation, preparation, and monitoring (Mwakalobo
et al. 2011; Naughton-Treves and Day 2012).

At least nine different REDD+ pilot projects have been developed, all in PFM forests‚Äîtwo in JFM and the rest
in CBFM forests (table 5.2). National and international NGOs have been involved in implementing these pilot
projects in Tanzania, in collaboration with local communities and governmental agencies (Deloitte 2012d)
(table 5.2). The projects focus on building REDD+ capacity at community and national levels, helping to
formulate the national REDD+ strategy, and developing existing PFM and regional and district-level forest
institutions (Burgess et al. 2010; MJUMITA and TFCG 2009).

Implementation goals for the pilot projects include the creation of monitoring plots to calculate baseline
reference emissions and training communities to monitor, report, assess, and verify carbon data. These
pilot projects have been created to integrate within, and to support existing, community forest management
structures while additionally achieving the goal of reduced emissions from deforestation.

The Tanzania Forest Conservation Group (TFCG) project ‚ÄúMaking REDD Work for Communities and Forest
Conservation in Tanzania‚Äù (hereafter, TFCG project) is one of the most advanced pilot projects. It has already
made trial payments to five villages, and so its experience may be a useful illustration of how a full national
REDD+ program might be expected to roll out. The project aims to develop a voluntary market REDD project
under the verified carbon standard (VCS) in communities within CBFM landscapes (Deloitte 2012g). Three
features of the project are particularly worth noting. First, payments to date have been based on projected
carbon market values, and have consequently been relatively low (about US$10‚Äì15 per person) (Deloitte
2012g). This may reflect both the low base rate of carbon trading and the level of mitigation additionality
that conservation of dry forests can contribute. In either case, the payments present project participants
with a realistic expectation of REDD+ as a future income-generating opportunity, allowing them to balance
the gains against the opportunity costs. Second, communities have been granted considerable autonomy
in designing payment-distribution systems (Deloitte 2012g). Villages have in many cases accounted for
opportunity costs (as determined by deforestation) and community engagement, and have chosen different
combinations of direct payments and community development projects. Third, 15 Village Natural Resource
Committees (VNRCs) have been established to support the development and implementation of REDD+
payment distribution and forest management plans (Deloitte 2012g).

     What Additional Institutions Are Needed for
     REDD+ Implementation in¬†Tanzania?
     The Tanzanian government aims to implement REDD+ programs in partnership with communities at the
     local level. Institutional capacity at various levels is needed to achieve this. Challenges include the need to
     engage effectively with the international carbon market, to distribute benefits equitably and efficiently, to
     coordinate all in-country actors, as well as needs for education and outreach both to explain the concepts and
     details of the REDD+ program to forest users and potential REDD+ participants, and to train them to assist in
     data collection, monitoring, reporting, and verification (Mukama, Mustalahti, and Zahabu 2012). Additional
     equipment and technology may be needed to facilitate some of these tasks (URT 2010a). Obstacles such as
     land tenure ambiguity and a lack of clear guidelines for payment mechanisms will need to be addressed to
     ensure a positive integration of REDD+ within existing PFM structures (Blomley and Iddi 2009).

     Institutions
     Coordination between government agencies and between state and community actors is a central
     challenge confronting Tanzania‚Äôs preparations for entry into a global carbon market (Chiesa et. al. 2009).
     Two interministerial committees have been established, the National Climate Change Steering Committee
     (NCCSC) and the National Climate Change Technical Committee (NCCTC), which will eventually oversee all




40                                                                            community forest management and redd+
REDD+ activities although the National REDD+ Task Force and a National REDD+ Secretariat are serving
interim advisory and coordinating roles (URT 2010b). The task force is a partnership between the Division
of Environment (DoE), within the Vice President‚Äôs office, and the Forestry and Beekeeping Division (FBD) of
the Ministry of Natural Resources and Tourism (MNRT), and is tasked with planning and overseeing all REDD+
readiness activities.

Formal institutional structures that link local, regional, and national levels of government are operational in
Tanzania and may aid vertical coordination to achieve effective REDD+ implementation in the context of PFM.
A network of Regional Administrative Secretariats serves as a bridge between local governments and central
government ministries throughout mainland Tanzania (Blomley 2006). Further, the PFM system in place
throughout the country provides an institutional foundation for coordination between the national and local
governments for REDD+-related activities. PFM represents a hybrid local-national arrangement in which
national staff from the FBD and Tanzania Forest Services (TFS) partner with local forest managers and user
groups, providing guidance, training, and capacity building, and channeling funds to support sustainable
forest management (Blomley 2006). These are exactly the sorts of activities that would need to occur through
REDD+ project implementation, and the fact that they are already happening under the PFM system is a
positive sign that the vertical coordination needed for REDD+ implementation can be achieved.

While these various committees have set the stage for positive collaboration among numerous government
offices and ministries at national and subnational levels, they have been less effective in encouraging the
participation of civil society organizations (CSOs), including community forest users. The REDD+ Task Force
includes only one CSO representative, the Tanzanian Forest Conservation Group (TFCG), and it is an observer
only (Nhantumbo 2012). As a result of their exclusion from the REDD+ planning process, CSOs have adopted
a critical stance to government policies, leading to tension between the government and the civil society
sector. Some analysts contend that the failure to include CSOs in REDD+ planning will hinder effective REDD+
implementation, because CSOs are uniquely equipped to bridge the gap between national policy and local
implementation (Nhantumbo 2012).

The REDD+ pilot projects have been more effective in supporting existing village governance institutions
as well as in creating new institutional arrangements to foster effective forest management at the village
level (Deloitte 2012g). For example, the African Wildlife Foundation pilot project created new connections
between communities surrounding the project forest area. It helped communities to draft a joint forest
management plan with input from the district and local government, to create an inter-village management
committee to guide project implementation, and to form an inter-village patrol team to monitor and enforce
the rules described in the forest management plan (Deloitte 2012b). Similarly, on Unguja and Pemba Islands,
37 Village Conservation Communities (VCC) have been formed and integrated into existing village structures;
the VCCs are the signatories on the Community Forestry Management Agreements (CoFMAs). These village
institutions have been integrated into training for REDD and CoFMA to facilitate vertical knowledge sharing
(Deloitte 2012c). REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania may thus have the potential to develop institutional and
human capital among forest users.

     Payment Mechanism
     Another institutional challenge related to the facilitation of carbon transactions is the need to design and
     operationalize a system for facilitating carbon payments. The Tanzanian government is planning to create a
     National REDD+ Trust Fund that would centralize the management of all carbon payments (URT 2010b). The
     national fund would purchase certified emissions reductions from subnational REDD+ projects using revenue
     obtained from the sale of emissions reductions on the international market. Progress is being made toward
     this goal through partnerships among governmental, civil society, and community-based agencies (Burgess
     et al. 2010).

     A centralized management system may be preferable for emissions reductions generated on government-
     owned land, and could provide assistance for communities that lack the capacity to sell their credits
     autonomously (MJUMITA and TFCG 2011a). However, NGOs such as TFCG have expressed concerns that this
     system would incur high transaction costs and could be prone to corruption and the misuse of funds (MJUMITA
     and TFCG 2009, 2011a). TFCG is advocating for a decentralized payment mechanism that would allow local
     forest user groups to interact directly with buyers on the international market, arguing that this approach
     would lead to greater economic returns for the communities generating the carbon credits (MJUMITA and
     TFCG 2009).

     Many of the pilot projects currently under way have encountered significant difficulties in designing and
     implementing revenue sharing mechanisms at the village level. Pilot projects in JFM forests have had
     particular difficulty, as revenue sharing in these forests requires the participation of the national government.
     The African Wildlife Foundation pilot project in a JFM forest in the Kondoa District, for example, has been
     unable to forge an agreement concerning revenue sharing with the national government; this disagreement
     has prevented payments from reaching the village level (Deloitte 2012b). An exception to these challenges
     is the TFCG project being implemented in a CBFM forest in the Lindi and Kilosa Districts, which has piloted a
     scheme of direct payments from the NGO to villagers (Deloitte 2012g).

     Whether a centralized or decentralized payment approach is ultimately chosen, the ability to effectively
     facilitate carbon market transactions will require enhanced institutional capacity at the national, regional,
     and local levels in order for these various scales of government and civil society to effectively coordinate.

     Monitoring, Reporting, and Verification
     A major obstacle to Tanzania‚Äôs participation in a global carbon market is the absence of accurate,
     comprehensive baseline data needed to calculate reference emission levels for forest areas nationally
     (Burgess et al. 2010). The national system of carbon accounting required for REDD+ participation depends on
     these reference emission levels. A National Forest Resource Monitoring and Assessment project (NAFORMA)
     has been developed through collaboration between the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization
     (UN-FAO) and the FBD (Otsyina et al. 2008).

     The REDD+ pilot project of the World Wide Fund for Nature is gathering carbon stock data (biomass and
     soil carbon) on forests nationally, utilizing NAFORMA guidelines to ensure that its data and results can be




42                                                                     community forest management and redd+
integrated into the national system (Deloitte 2012j). These data will play a key role in the establishment of
a National Carbon Monitoring Center needed for Tanzania to access global funding for REDD+ in the future
(Deloitte 2012d). The project is engaging communities by building capacity in the form of well-trained field
crews to take part in forest carbon stock assessments. Village committee members and students from each
study site have been involved.



How Might REDD+ Affect Community Forest Management?
Scholars, development NGOs and activists, research analysts, and communities interested in CFM in Tanzania
have voiced a number of concerns about the potential negative impacts of carbon markets and REDD+ projects
on community forest management.

Altered Forest Resource Use
REDD+ may alter local livelihoods. Although REDD+ programs often recognize livelihoods as an integral part
of forest management priorities, REDD+ has an integral, minimum set of carbon sequestration and storage
objectives, and many forest users are concerned that attainment of these objectives may alter their access
to forest resources, for either subsistence or income (Mukama, Mustalahti, and Zahabu 2012). For example,
REDD+ projects could lead to a decreased supply of fuel in the form of wood and charcoal due to the increased
economic value of forest carbon (Chiesa et al. 2009). Access to the carbon market will not provide the same
benefits to these villagers because they will lack the resources they previously obtained from the forest
(Chiesa et al. 2009). An emphasis on the ecosystem benefits over social benefits could lead to disadvantaged
communities that would have been more sustainable or have reaped greater benefits without a REDD+ project.

Additionally, it is not clear that the price of carbon paid to communities will be equal to or exceed the value
of timber and other products that can be extracted from the same forests (Mukama, Mustalahti, and Zahabu
2012). Communities are worried about the opportunity costs from giving up valuable land from which they
can receive immediate benefits for a process that will compensate them at a lower level sometime in the
future. For instance, many households obtain 50 percent of their income from the sale of products derived
from miombo trees (Mukama, Mustalahti, and Zahabu 2012). Villagers would lose income if they gave up
harvesting timber to participate in the carbon market, if the net value of forest carbon were lower than the
value of the products that would otherwise be obtained from the miombo forest timber. A decrease in income,
even if only in the short term, could negatively affect community livelihoods.

In combination, these problems have the potential to lead to increased poverty among communities because
their sources of subsistence or cash livelihoods could be reduced or eliminated, particularly if the central
government receives the revenues from REDD+ projects. All of these concerns show the importance of
considering communities‚Äô needs in the creation of a REDD+ strategy, because livelihoods could be greatly
affected by the program.

     Recentralization
     Of primary concern is the possibility that the progress that has been made toward decentralized forest
     management could be reversed and that‚Äîin an effort to capture revenue from the country‚Äôs forests‚Äîthe
     national government may reappropriate communally managed forests (MJUMITA and TFCG 2011b). This
     recentralization would likely occur in areas where local governance is weak and land tenure is unclear
     (Tanzania Natural Resource Forum 2011). Preliminary suggestion of this possibility is provided by the
     government‚Äôs decision to base the 2010 draft National REDD+ Strategy on a version of land classification that
     denotes nearly half of all forested land in the country as General Land, rather than on an alternative version
     that denotes the same land as VLFR (MJUMITA and TFCG 2011b; Veit, Vhugen, and Miner 2012). NGOs such as
     the Tanzanian Forest Conservation Group are proactively resisting these signs of potential recentralization
     and are advocating for formal recognition of village rights to forested lands (Deloitte 2012g).

     Centralized or Elite Capture of Benefits
     There is concern over the equitable distribution of benefits for implementing REDD+ in villages. It is
     uncertain that REDD+ payments can or will be distributed throughout villages (Mustalahti et al. 2012). The
     majority of the pilot projects have experienced a lag between the start of the project and the receipt of funds,
     generating concern that villages may not receive expected benefits (Deloitte 2012d). Because many of the
     REDD+ forests would be under CBFM or JFM, the revenues may go to the community government (or, in the
     case of JFM, to the central government because they own the forest) and may not be distributed to local
     forest users (Chiesa et al. 2009).

Positive Impacts
On the other hand, Tanzania‚Äôs entry into a global carbon market could potentially have many positive effects on
forest-dependent communities. Specifically, there is great potential for the integration of REDD+ payments
into Tanzania‚Äôs existing PFM framework. One of the central problems with the PFM model within Tanzania is
that while it allows communities to manage forested lands, it does not provide the resources and incentives
necessary to enable this management to be effective. Furthermore, income-generating activities such as
timber harvesting are often temporarily or permanently prohibited under PFM arrangements, particularly
in degraded or high conservation value forests. The costs of managing forests under PFM can therefore, in
many instances, exceed the benefits to local communities (MJUMITA and TFCG 2009). REDD+ financing could
provide the revenue stream necessary to ensure the long-term sustainability of PFM, and to improve forest
management outcomes (MJUMITA and TFCG 2009). By assigning monetary value to intact forests, communities
would receive payments in proportion to their forest management activities, and REDD+ programs would
have the potential to serve as a strategic missing component in the current PFM arrangement (Burgess et al.
2010; Chiesa et al. 2009; Hayes and Persha 2010). For example, payments resulting from REDD+ participation
could empower local communities to carry out enforcement activities, enabling more effective monitoring of
communally managed forests (Hayes and Persha 2010; URT 2010a). Second, REDD+ project implementation
may generate employment opportunities for communities, including jobs to undertake MRV tasks. Various
REDD+ pilot projects have had success introducing beekeeping and honey production as an activity that both
generates income and maintains ecosystem services (Deloitte 2012d).

Thus, REDD+ payments to communities engaged in PFM have the potential to contribute positively to both
the health of the forest and the livelihoods of forest users. Distributed equitably, payments may incentivize
and enable more sustainable forest resource use and management practices.

                 Distribution of Forests and Tenure
                 Forested Land
                 Of Bolivia‚Äôs total land area of 109.9 million ha, nearly half (50 million ha) is covered
                 by forests and woodlands (Steininger et al. 2001). Ten million ha of forest are located
                 in the western highlands of the Andes Mountains and 40 million ha are in the eastern
                 tropical lowland plains of the Amazonian basin (figure 2.1; Steininger et al. 2001). These
                 lowland plains contain three broad forest types: humid tropical Amazonian forests in the
                 north, seasonal dry forests in the south and east, and semi-arid woodlands in the south
                 (Killeen et al. 2007). Dispersed across these three forest types, this land is classified into
                 three land-use categories: approved farming lands (planes de ordenamiento predial
                 aprobados), permanent forest product lands (tierras de producci√≥n forestal permante),
                 and multiple-use lands (tierras de uso multiple) (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a).

                 Distinct from these categories, forested land in Bolivia can be classified as one of three
                 property types: collective, individual, or state-owned properties (Plurinational State of
                 Bolivia 2012a). Collective property is land for which community groups have ownership
                 rights, and is subdivided into indigenous territories (territorio ind√≠gena originario
                 campesino; TIOC) and properties owned by peasant farmers. Individual property is land
                 for which individual users and corporations have ownership and resource access rights,
                 and is subdivided into small, medium, and ‚Äúcompany‚Äù properties. State-owned forest
                 property consists of areas leased to an individual or corporate body under ‚Äútemporal use
                 agreements‚Äù and areas protected under the framework of the National System of Protected
                 Areas (though these can overlap with TIOCs) (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a).

                 Bolivia has experienced recent high rates of deforestation, averaging 300,000 ha per
                 year from 2000 to 2008, compared with 47,000 ha per year in the 1960s (Killeen et al.
                 2008; Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a). The vast majority of this deforestation is
                 attributable to forest clearance for agriculture and cattle ranching, with the highest rates
                 in the department of Santa Cruz due to mechanization of forestland clearing and as a result
                 of new road networks that allow forest users, farmers, and ranchers easy access to new
                 territory (Killeen et al. 2007, 2008).

     Subsistence farming by indigenous and peasant groups has resulted in a relatively small proportion
     of total deforestation. However, the contribution to forest conversion by these groups appears to have
     increased (Killeen et al. 2008). For example, in the 1990s the state granted large areas of forestland in the
     northern Bolivian Amazon that were previously owned by a single individual (for Brazil nut harvesting) to
     former laborers on the estates. These new landowners supplemented income from Brazil nut harvests with
     subsistence agriculture, increasing the rate of forest conversion (Ruiz 2005). These deforestation trends
     position Bolivia as a priority country for forest carbon mitigation and ecosystem service protection policies
     (Andersen et al. in review; M√ºller et al. 2013; Sangermano, Toledano, and Eastman 2012).

     Community Involvement in Forest Management
     Approximately 9 million ha of forest were formally titled under Forest Management Plans for timber
     extraction in 2010, of which 2.8 million ha were managed by communities (INRA 2010). Indigenous and
     traditional communities jointly hold another approximately 22 million ha of forestlands without formal
     title. With such a large area of forest managed by nonstate actors, community forest management is also an
     important potential avenue for mitigation of terrestrial carbon emissions in Bolivia (Cronkleton, Bray, and
     Medina 2011).

     The current land titling procedures for forest-dwelling communities were established in the mid-1990s
     through a series of three land reform laws. First, the Popular Participation Law (1994) established elected
     authorities for the purpose of decentralizing power, resulting in greater autonomy of decision making at the
     local level (Cronkleton, Bray, and Medina 2011; Le√≥n et al. 2012). Second, the Land Reform Law (1996) aimed
     to consolidate the land rights of indigenous communities by providing a pathway to obtain land titles from
     the central government (Le√≥n et al. 2012). In the forested lowlands, competing land claims have drastically
     slowed the official titling process; at least 50 percent of forested lands have not been titled or have multiple
     claimants, and many communities are still uncertain about their rights to customary lands and the resources
     on them (Andersson et al. in review; Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a). As of 2009, 60 requests for TIOC
     formation in the lowlands had been received by the government, but only a small fraction of these demands
     have been titled (Cronkleton et al. 2009; Le√≥n et al. 2012). Finally, the Forestry Law (1996) sought to allow
     indigenous communities exclusionary rights to extract forest resources from communal territories through
     the creation and implementation of official forest management plans (Le√≥n et al. 2012).

     In Bolivia, formal community management of forests (with a state-approved forest management plan,
     typically for timber extraction) primarily takes place in titled TIOCs and non-indigenous community
     properties. The bureaucratic and technical challenges associated with creating approved forest management
     plans means that formal community forest management in these two types of collective properties remains
     uncommon. However, informal (not sanctioned by the state) self-governance of community forests
     can also be effective at maintaining forest cover over time. Land cover change data from the years 2000
     to 2007 indicate that nearly half of communities informally managing forests in the Bolivian lowlands
     experienced either no change in forest cover or less than 1 percent loss of forest cover (Andersson et al.
     in review).



     Characterizing CFM in Bolivia: IFRI Data
     The analysis of IFRI cases reported in this section is based on data from 16 forests and 36 forest user groups.
     We characterized Bolivia‚Äôs forests in relation to a subset of the factors associated with successful CFM
     (table 6.1).

Factors Associated with Effective CFM
Environmental
Community forests in Bolivia were large: The average size of community forests surveyed by IFRI was 9370.2 ¬±
12,342.6 ha (N = 13). All forest sites were larger than 1,000 ha. Forest size was not correlated with per hectare
biomass (Pearson = 0.133, P = 0.665). Neither the subsistence value nor the commercial value of forests was
considered by foresters to be higher than normal (table 6.1).

Socioeconomic
Forest user groups were small: The average size was 328.4 ¬± 176.6 individuals (N = 14). Forest users gained
multiple benefits from the forests: The mean number of types of benefit was 3.9 ¬± 2.5 (N = 16). Forests that
offered more benefits were significantly associated with improved livelihood outcomes (Pearson = 0.641,
P = 0.007). Forest users had extensive experience with forest management: The average age of settlements
in Bolivia was 119.3 ¬± 120.7 years (N = 13).

     Features of Forest Management Specifically Relevant to Effective REDD+
     Carbon storage
     The carbon gain from reduced deforestation depends in part on the volume of carbon stored within a forest.
     Forest carbon is closely related to tree size, as measured by tree diameter at breast height. The average DBH
     of trees >10 cm DBH was 26.8 ¬± 3.5 cm (N = 11 forests).

     Forest dependence
     Local communities used the forests for subsistence and commercial livelihoods: 40.4 ¬± 43.0 percent of
     households within forest user groups depended on forests for their subsistence livelihoods (N = 31 forest
     user groups), and 38.3 ¬± 42.1 percent for commercial livelihoods (N = 32 forest user groups). In particular,
     community managed forests were an important source of fuelwood. Forest user groups depended on
     community forests for 48.1 ¬± 47.9 percent of their fuelwood (N = 36 user groups).

     Capacity for monitoring, reporting, and verification
     Many forest associations had prior experience conducting (defined as coordinating, passing rules for,
     or modifying rules for) a variety of activities associated with MRV. In Bolivia, 9/23 forest associations
     had experience monitoring forest condition, 18/24 had experience monitoring conformance with forest
     rules, 17/24 had experience sanctioning rule breakers, and 21/24 had experience interacting with higher
     authorities. Forest associations had less experience maintaining records of forest conditions: Only 1/20
     forest associations in Bolivia had done so.



     REDD+ in Bolivia
     Bolivia was granted support for the development of a UN-REDD National Programme in 2008, as one of the
     nine original pilot countries. Support for Bolivia‚Äôs REDD+ National Program Document was signaled during
     early discussions, in January 2010, by participants including the central government and several civil society
     organizations, including the Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia (CIDOB), the National Council of
     Ayllus and Markas of Qullasuyu, the Unified Syndical Confederation of Rural Workers of Bolivia (CSUTCB), the
     Trade Union Confederation of Bolivian Colonizers, and the Bartolina Sisa National Federation of Peasant Women
     of Bolivia (UN-REDD 2012). In March 2010, the UN-REDD Program Policy Board approved US$4.7 million for

the development of Bolivia‚Äôs REDD+ National Program. Other major donors have subsequently included the
German Agency for International Cooperation, which pledged ‚Ç¨10 million, the Danish development agency
(DANIDA), and the Norwegian Agency for Development Cooperation (Norad). The last two have supported
civil society organizations such as CIDOB, CSUTCB, and the Friends of Nature Foundation (FAN), which have
been active in REDD+ discussions and payment for forest carbon storage projects (Norad 2012). DANIDA has
also supported the process of titling indigenous territories in Bolivia, which is central to the development of
community forest management.

Pilot Projects
Two REDD-like pilot projects have been established in Bolivia: the Noel Kempff Climate Action Project
(NKCAP) and the Bolivian Amazon Indigenous REDD Program (Programa Ind√≠gena REDD Amazonia Boliviana)
(Benton-Connell 2011) (figure 2.1, table 6.2). Both projects have the goals of promoting economic
development and carbon sequestration and storage through forest conservation. The NKCAP began in 1997,
whereas the Bolivian Amazon Indigenous REDD Program was initiated only in 2008.

The NKCAP was one of the first global payment for forest carbon storage projects, and aimed to protect forest
biodiversity and carbon in and around the Noel Kempff Mercado National Park. The project greatly expanded
the park by additionally incorporating 831,689 ha of adjacent former timber concessions and local community
lands. It then implemented various carbon protection and monitoring activities within this expanded project
area, and was certified for carbon credits under the Clean Development Mechanism by the Soci√©t√© G√©n√©rale
de Surveillance.

NKCAP was initially funded with a US$10.9 million investment from The Nature Conservancy (TNC) (24
percent), American Electric Power (AEP; 53 percent), PacificCorp (16 percent), and BP America (7 percent)
with an endowment fund of more than US$3 million as of 2006 (The Nature Conservancy 2009). Revenues
from certified emission reduction credits were intended to be divided between the corporate investors (AEP,
BP, and PacifiCorp) (51 percent) and the Bolivian government (49 percent).

     The NKCAP has been criticized for insufficient consultation or participation in the project design by the seven
     communities within the project area, as well as inadequate community benefits, as either direct financial
     gains or alternative livelihood opportunities (Asquith, Vargas Rios, and Smith 2002; Densham et al. 2009).
     The project restricted resource access by local communities, and the termination of logging resulted in lost
     income from sawmill employment (Asquith, Vargas Rios, and Smith 2002; Calder√≥n 2005).

     Two sequential, five-year community development programs (APOCOM and PRODECOM) sought to address
     these negative effects (Calder√≥n 2005). They were designed to provide basic education, health, and
     livelihood services for the communities, as well as to improve roads, facilitate land titling, and promote
     income-generating activities such as sustainable community forestry (Asquith, Vargas Rios, and Smith 2002;
     Calder√≥n 2005).

by four indigenous territories and six municipalities in the Amazonian departments of Beni and Pando (FAN-
Bolivia 2013). It was one of the first REDD pilot projects in indigenous communities. However, changes in the
Bolivian government‚Äôs support for PES-type REDD projects (see below) mean that no carbon credits from the
project were ever sold and the project was ended in its current form (Benton-Connell 2011).

Responses to REDD+ in Bolivia
Concerns about a forest carbon market program
The Bolivian government announced its opposition to the UN-REDD program in April 2010 at the World
People‚Äôs Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth, held in Tiquipaya, Bolivia. The
People‚Äôs Agreement produced at the conference stated: ‚ÄúWe condemn market mechanisms such as REDD‚Ä¶
which are violating the sovereignty of peoples and their right to prior free and informed consent as well as
the sovereignty of national States, the customs of Peoples, and the Rights of Nature‚Äù (Plurinational State of
Bolivia 2010a). Bolivia‚Äôs president, Juan Evo Morales Ayma, published an open letter to indigenous peoples
that also plainly expressed his opposition to the concept of forest carbon markets associated with REDD+
(Morales Ayma 2010).

The Bolivian government elaborated on their concerns about REDD+ as a forest carbon PES-type program in
a 2012 submission to the UNFCCC, listing four ethical objections to the commodification of forests as carbon
sinks (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a). First, new commodity market values may lead to the corruption
of social values. Second, the transfer of forest carbon rights to external parties would remove sovereignty
over forest resources from the state and local communities and would open the possibility of dispossession
of indigenous peoples from their customary lands (Okereke and Dooley 2010; Plurinational State of Bolivia
2012b). Third, REDD+ focuses on the role of forest carbon sequestration and storage in climate change
mitigation, without regard for the multiple other benefits (for example, food and energy, from agriculture
and firewood) that land provides to local users. Finally, a market-based REDD+ program would allow
industrialized countries to continue to emit greenhouse gases. The Bolivian government presented a view
that industrialized countries owe a historical climate debt to developing countries, which should be repaid
through funding climate change mitigation and adaptation measures rather than through the quantification
of greenhouse gas emissions reductions (Okereke and Dooley 2010).

The Joint Mitigation and Adaptation Mechanism
Bolivia tabled an alternative proposal to the prevailing PES-type REDD+ program, which would also promote
climate change mitigation and adaptation, but would do so without market mechanisms. The proposal,
originally called ‚ÄúSustainable Life of Forests‚Äù (Vida Sustentable del Bosque) was presented at the UNFCCC
Conference of the Parties (COP) in December 2011, and was subsequently developed into the ‚ÄúProposal for the
Development of the Joint Mitigation and Adaptation Mechanism for the Integral and Sustainable Management
of Forests‚Äù (hereafter, JMAM), submitted to the UNFCCC in August 2012 (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a).
At the COP in 2012, Bolivia negotiated further support for the JMAM under two programs: (1) the program
of ‚Äúreduction of emissions of deforestation and forest degradation,‚Äù while rejecting the acronym ‚ÄúREDD+,‚Äù




Chapter 6: COUNTRY CASE STUDY: BOLIVIA                                                                          53
     which it views as a market-centered approach; and (2) the program of ‚Äúmitigation and various approaches,‚Äù
     for further development of non-market-based mechanisms (D. Pacheco Balanza, Bolivian Delegation to the
     UNFCCC, personal communication 01/20/2013).

     The JMAM aims to reduce carbon emissions from forest conversion while simultaneously reducing climate-
     change-related risks to, and vulnerability of, people and ecosystems. The priority of the JMAM is to ‚Äúachieve
     sustainable development and eliminate poverty‚Äù (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a). The JMAM‚Äôs goals
     are therefore much broader than those of a forest carbon PES program under REDD+, because they explicitly
     focus on both climate change mitigation (through sustainable land management) and adaptation (through
     improving local livelihoods). Community forest management is a central component of the JMAM, as part
     of a broader commitment to the continued decentralization of forest and natural resource management to
     municipal governments and local land users.



     What Additional Institutions Are Needed for
     JMAM Implementation in¬†Bolivia?
     Implementation of the JMAM in Bolivia will require the modification of existing institutions, the development
     of new ones, and careful coordination and communication across multiple stakeholders. A principal goal of
     the JMAM is to strengthen the capacity of community-based user groups for the purposes of more sustainable
     forest management.

     Institutions
     Currently there are various government ministries and agencies that are responsible for different aspects
     of forest management: the Ministry of Environment and Water (MMAyA), the National Protected Area
     Service (SERNAP), the National Institute of Agriculture and Forestry Innovation (INIAF), semi-autonomous
     territorial governments, and the Authority for Monitoring and Oversight of Forests and Lands (Autoridad de
     Fiscalizaci√≥n y Control Social de Bosques y Tierras; ABT) (Rojas Quiroga et al. 2013). Currently the ABT is the
     principal government agency overseeing forest management in Bolivia (M√ºller et al. 2013).

     To oversee the implementation of the JMAM and coordinate activities across the abovementioned government
     departments, a new government agency is being created, called the Plurinational Authority of Mother
     Earth (APMT) (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012b). External sources of revenue for the development and
     implementation of the JMAM will include the UNFCCC‚Äôs Green Climate Fund, the UN-REDD Policy Board,
     and private donors (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012b; D. Pacheco Balanza, personal communication
     01/10/2013). Financial resources received for the implementation of JMAM initiatives will be directly
     transferred to public entities, autonomous subnational government agencies (regional and municipal),
     community-based organizations, and private sector actors (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a).

     Coordination
     Implementing Bolivia‚Äôs new JMAM will require cooperation between multiple stakeholders: all levels of
     government, civil society organizations, and communities (Herold 2009). In particular, the often-strained



54                                                                    community forest management and redd+
relationships between rural communities and the local, departmental and central government will need to
be strengthened. Communities are often geographically remote from administrative centers, and larger
communal properties often span multiple municipalities, which complicates community-state communication
(Cronkleton, Bray, and Medina 2011). Relationships between TIOCs and municipal governments and central
government have historically been tested by jurisdiction disputes and by conflicts over expectations about
forest management methods, respectively (Hern√°iz and Pacheco 2001; Le√≥n et al. 2012).

Civil society organizations will need to actively support community efforts to engage with the JMAM
development and implementation process with respect to community practices that affect forests.
NGOs currently play an important role in supporting the development of community forest management
organizations and institutions (Cronkleton, Bray, and Medina 2011). Such external assistance is particularly
important because formal community forest management through TIOCs and non-indigenous community
properties is still uncommon, but will likely play an important role in advancing the goals of the JMAM.

Even achieving collaboration and consensus within TIOCs can be challenging, partly because many are made
up of multiple distinct communities. Communities have little experience in carrying out democratic decision
making or in coordinating activities above the village level, which may contribute to poor communication
and a lack of transparency (Cronkleton, Bray, and Medina 2011). Strengthening channels of communication
throughout the network of government, civil society, and community-based organizations will be essential
to the success of the JMAM in the context of community forest management.



How Might the JMAM Affect Community Forest Management?
Details about how the JMAM will be implemented are still not well defined, and so it is difficult to infer
outcomes and impacts, but it is almost certain that community forest and land management practices
will be included in, and affected by, the mechanism. The nuances of JMAM policy have yet to be fully
developed, but it will broadly safeguard against the mismanagement of forest resources, such as the
extraction of timber or charcoal in locations where harvesting is prohibited (Plurinational State of Bolivia
2012b). Enforcement policies will be designed through a multistakeholder participatory planning process in
individual jurisdictions, involving user groups, private actors, and local government agencies. Sanctions will
be imposed on communities or individuals not complying with management plans for the sustainable use of
forest areas (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012a).

In sum, Bolivia‚Äôs Joint Mitigation and Adaptation Mechanism has broader aims than the previously developed
PES-type REDD+ program. Its goals are to reduce carbon emissions from forest conversion while also
achieving sustainable development in rural communities. Implementation of this new integrated forest
management policy will require a greater level of cooperation across multiple stakeholders and levels of
government, as well as broad-based modifications to some land use practices at the local level. This poses
institutional challenges in the short term, but holds longer-term potential for socioeconomic and ecological
benefits in Bolivian community forests.

     7   DISCUSSION


         Community forest management has a strong history in Bolivia, Nepal, and Tanzania.
         The tenure arrangements in all three countries are characterized by the retention of
         ownership of community forestland by the state, with the devolution of some degree
         of use and management rights to communities. The degree of devolution ranges from
         complete autonomy in rule making and decision making (for example, community forest
         management in Nepal), to shared responsibility and benefit distribution between the
         state and the communities (for example, collaborative forest management in Nepal, and
         Joint Forest Management in Tanzania). In Bolivia, the government is making a concerted
         effort to devolve land ownership as well as some natural resource management rights to
         communities. In all three countries, strong institutions have developed to facilitate the
         management of community forests at various scales (for example, CFUGs and FECOFUN in
         Nepal).

         With the emergence of negotiations over, and funding for, forest-based climate change
         mitigation, there is an opportunity to connect CFM with emerging REDD+ architectures.
         The existence of this possibility is concretely demonstrated by the overlap between the
         implementation of REDD+ pilot projects in CFM sites and landscapes in both Nepal and
         Tanzania, and the similar interest evidenced in Bolivia. It is important therefore to examine
         the extent to which CFM may contribute to REDD+, as indicated through the development
         of policy and practice in these three case study countries, and how REDD+ may affect
         established CFM dynamics (table 7.1).



         Applying the Lessons of CFM to REDD+
         The institutional design principles that contribute to successful CFM provide important
         guidance about the factors that may also improve outcomes for REDD+. Many of the
         factors associated with successful CFM are likely to also lead to better REDD+ outcomes.
         However, successful CFM is defined in terms of maintenance or improvement in both forest
         condition and local livelihoods. REDD+ has a stronger emphasis on forest condition and
         carbon than CFM does. Under REDD+, livelihoods and other measures of forest conditions,
         such as biodiversity, are considered co-benefits, which are important but of somewhat
         lesser importance than the principal goal‚Äîto sequester and store terrestrial carbon in the
         long run, so as to reduce emissions. Factors that principally contribute to livelihood or

biodiversity outcomes in CFM may therefore be less critical to the design of successful REDD+ programs;
those associated more strongly with forest conditions and higher levels of forest biomass in CFM sites are
likely to be viewed as being of greater importance from the carbon sequestration perspective.

 Applying lessons from CFM to REDD+
                    There is limited explicit evidence of the lessons from CFM being applied to the design and development of
                    REDD+ programs either within or outside of CFM sites.

Harnessing CFM Arrangements
Modifying Current Community Forest Management to Achieve REDD+ Goals
The underlying aims of CFM and REDD+ differ, and CFM practices do not necessarily optimize carbon outcomes
because communities extract forest resources (including timber, firewood, and charcoal) for subsistence and
to generate incomes (Benneker and McCall 2009). However, the two programs share the broad objectives
of sustainable forest management, sustainable resource use, and the generation of socioeconomic benefits
for forest-dependent people. Harnessing, moderating, and expanding the existing capacity of community
forest sites can certainly be used to achieve REDD+ objectives, and it is the principal manner in which the two
programs currently interact. CFM plays a central role in both the long-term national REDD+ strategies and the
short-term pilot projects and readiness activities in all three case-study countries.

National REDD+ strategies
All three countries have put community forests at the center of national REDD+ policy. The central REDD+
planning documents of each country (Nepal: Readiness Preparation Proposal; Tanzania: National REDD+
Framework; Bolivia: Joint Mitigation and Adaptation Mechanism) emphasize the mechanisms by which
community forest sites and institutions can contribute to, and be adapted for, the realization of REDD+ goals
(table 7.1). For example, a stated aim of the JMAM is to create a nonmarket alternative mechanism to REDD+
to achieve ‚Äúfull integration of the multiple benefits of forests into mitigation and adaptation to climate
change‚Äù by simultaneously improving forest governance and the livelihoods of local people (Plurinational
State of Bolivia 2012b).

Pilot projects
REDD+ pilot projects themselves have only limited significance at the national and global levels, in terms
of absolute carbon sequestration or livelihood improvement. However, they are relevant to the longer-term
and broader-scale development of REDD+ in at least two important ways. First, they highlight some of the
operational issues likely to be encountered during the development and implementation of a full national
REDD+ program, and provide an early opportunity for learning lessons and finding solutions. Second, they
enable capacity development relevant to the integration of CFM and REDD+, particularly in relation to MRV
mechanisms that will be critical to the full implementation of future REDD+ initiatives.

The majority of pilot projects in all three countries are located in and around community forestry sites
(table 7.1). These sites are attractive because they are characterized by relatively intact forest landscapes;
communities that have experience working with government agencies, NGOs, and projects; forest users who
strongly support sustainable forest management; and existing institutional capacity that can facilitate project
implementation. These characteristics provide an existing infrastructure to which REDD+ pilot projects can be
attached, and a strong baseline from which to develop further institutional and human capital.

The payments made in pilot projects such as the Forest Carbon Trust Fund in Nepal and the TFCG and MJUMITA
project in Tanzania do not add up to substantial behavior-altering incentives‚Äîbut they are useful in preparing

     communities for carbon-based benefit flows, for example by developing benefit-distribution mechanisms.
     Even though these payments have not to date been based on precise carbon accounting, they differ from
     more general development aid in that they are at minimum participation-based, and contingent upon
     demonstrated adherence and commitment to sustainable forest management activities.

     Effective, Efficient, and Equitable REDD+
     Here, we discuss the ways in which CFM arrangements are able to achieve the main requirements of REDD+
     architectures (table 7.1).

     Effectiveness
     Additionality

     REDD+ programs are usually expected to demonstrate additionality relative to the status quo. There are
     several reasons for which CFM arrangements may not be considered by all parties to be delivering maximum
     possible additionality, in terms of climate change mitigation. First, if a CFM site is already independently
     achieving REDD+ objectives, it is unclear whether incorporating existing CFM forests into REDD+ programs
     achieves any additional gains. Second, CFM balances conservation with socioeconomic and development
     objectives, and so may achieve lower carbon sequestration and storage than a forest tenure arrangement
     that has the sole objective of climate change mitigation. Third, the carbon gain from reduced deforestation
     depends in part on the volume of carbon stored within a forest. Community forests tend to be small: The
     average size of those surveyed by IFRI was less than 100 ha in Nepal. Small forest sites may result in high
     administrative transaction costs, unless these costs can be spread across bundled forest sites. In all three of
     these respects, and relative to other areas with higher deforestation pressure, CFM sites incorporated into
     REDD+ may be an inefficient means to achieve additionality.

     On the other hand, CFM has a record of improving environmental outcomes, both in terms of reduced rates
     of deforestation and forest degradation, and in terms of forest improvement (Chhatre and Agrawal 2009;
     Herold and Skutsch 2011; Persha, Agrawal, and Chhatre 2011). CFM may also be a socially and politically
     more favorable proposition than forests managed with a focus on carbon objectives alone. For example,
     PFM in Tanzania is more effective in preserving forested lands than are arrangements in which the national
     government maintains sole management authority over forests (Blomley et al. 2008). If CFM achieves
     better carbon outcomes than the next-most-likely alternative, such as land conversion to agriculture, then
     it is achieving additionality toward REDD+ goals. In this context, viewed as a tool by which to ensure low
     deforestation rates nationally, CFM is an attractive mechanism to employ.

     Additionally, while CFM has been more successful than alternative arrangements in many areas, there is
     often room for improvement in individual sites. For example, the creation of village land use plans and forest
     management plans by the AWF pilot project has slowed agricultural expansion into Tanzania‚Äôs JFM forests
     (Deloitte 2012b).




60                                                                    community forest management and redd+
Further, it can be argued that communities should be rewarded for their past and present performance in
maintaining forests. Models of REDD+ credits that include previous conservation and reforestation efforts
(such as those used by the Forest Carbon Trust Fund pilot project in Nepal) effectively acknowledge and
reward CFUGs for years of continued sustainable forest management. In addition to avoided deforestation,
carbon sequestration can be significant: In the forests of three Nepali CFUGs, in the districts of Ilam, Lamatar
and Manang, sequestration was estimated at 6.89 tons of carbon dioxide per hectare (Staddon 2009).

Finally, additionality can also be considered to include gains in co-benefits such as biodiversity conservation
and improved livelihoods. Because CFM also improves social and environmental outcomes, in addition to
carbon maximization, it may give greater visibility to co-benefits and may attract an additional set of
interested buyers and donors.

Permanence

Although REDD+ projects provide a financial incentive for forest conservation, they do not necessarily
directly address the underlying drivers of deforestation. For example, few REDD+ programs make payments
directly to farmers, yet agriculture is a key driver of deforestation in many places. Permanence may be
more assured when these drivers are incorporated into planning. In Tanzania, two of the principal drivers are
subsistence agriculture and fuelwood extraction (Chiesa et al. 2009; MJUMITA and TFCG 2011a; Nhantumbo
2012). Accordingly, REDD+ pilot projects in Tanzania aim to improve yields on existing agricultural land
and to increase the efficiency of fuel use (Deloitte 2012d). Similarly, a stated aim of the JMAM in Bolivia is
to address the drivers of deforestation, and evidence suggests that substantive engagement of municipal
governments with local forest users, particularly through law enforcement related to land tenure and forest
management, can reduce unauthorized deforestation in the Bolivian lowlands (Andersson and Gibson 2006).
This pairing of REDD+ program implementation with targeted interventions (‚ÄúSmart-REDD‚Äù) may reduce
regional leakage and lead to more sustained emissions reductions in addition to greater carbon, biodiversity,
and social benefits (Fisher et al. 2011).

The longevity of CFM arrangements‚Äîas demonstrated in countries such as Nepal‚Äîindicates the likely
satisfaction of the need for permanence in achieving REDD+ goals. CFM institutions do not necessarily
depend on perpetual influxes of financial support, because the communities are incentivized by the benefits
that they receive directly from the forests that they manage. In Tanzania, the Hifadhi Mapafu project has
extended the duration of Community Forestry Management Agreements (CoFMAs) to 25 years, enabling
longer-term planning (Deloitte 2012c).

Community forestry is also a strong platform for vertical coordination, which is a prerequisite of effective
mitigation in the long term. Community organizations have experience in working with local and central
governments, and specific organizations that bridge that gap, such as FECOFUN in Nepal, could be invaluable
in helping to facilitate the development of benefit-distribution mechanisms from the national to the
subnational level.

     Monitoring, reporting, and verification

     The need to develop MRV mechanisms for REDD+ projects was highlighted by all three country case studies.
     IFRI data used in this study show that community forest institutions have enabled monitoring and recording
     of forest condition in prior years, but they must be strengthened if systematic quantification of carbon and
     ecological outcomes need to be documented. Currently, few CFM user groups or organizations in the studied
     countries have the needed capacity for monitoring carbon storage or sequestration. For REDD+ programs to
     operate in CFM sites at a national scale, existing CFM structures need to be adapted and strengthened, and
     linked across planned intervention sites.

     Involvement of communities in monitoring forest conditions, and forest carbon in particular, is likely to be
     most effective if integrated into a mixed-level approach that combines local- and national-level systems.
     National-level institutions are likely to be better positioned to determine national baselines, to calculate
     reference emission levels, and to conduct large-scale monitoring of forest cover using satellite imagery and
     other technical, high-cost options. Local communities will likely play a crucial role in monitoring variations
     in forests locally, accounting particularly for forest degradation (Burgess et al. 2010). The inclusion of
     local communities in forest monitoring would therefore play a complementary role in accomplishing data
     collection tasks.

     Conducting MRV at the community level can be effective, efficient, and more equitable. Data collected by
     communities in the Forest Carbon Trust Fund pilot project in Nepal were only ‚Äúslightly worse‚Äù than the data
     collected by professionals (Puliti 2012); participatory monitoring would reduce the costs of technology and
     experts (Skutsch et al. 2009); and it would engage and empower communities of forest users (Dangi 2012)
     while alleviating fears of negative impacts from top-down REDD+ implementation (Burgess et al. 2010).

     Although communities currently lack the capacity and resources to make the necessary measurements,
     several pilot projects are developing community capacity for MRV in CFM contexts. For example, Nepal‚Äôs
     diverse and numerous civil society organizations, provided with government support, should be able to
     quickly train forest users on the use of the tools and methods required for carbon measurement (Jha and
     Paudel 2010). Community-appropriate methods are available to aid decentralized monitoring, which can
     include the use of forest plot inventories, GPS units, measuring tapes, and cameras (Asia REDD+ Working
     Group 2012).

     Efficiency
     Transaction costs

     The cost of reducing deforestation rates is likely to be considerably lower when achieved by communities
     and community institutions such as those associated with CFM than it is when enforced by either private or
     government agencies. Incorporating CFM into REDD+ architectures is therefore likely to be an economical
     option for achieving REDD+ objectives.

     REDD+ strategy design has mainly been focused at the national level, to maximize efficiency by reducing
     transaction costs. In contrast, CFM is by definition a subnational arrangement, with individual forest sites




62                                                                    community forest management and redd+
managed by multiple, local community user groups. Subnational programs and payments are likely to incur
greater transaction costs than national-level institutions, but may be necessary to ensure that REDD+
benefits reach forest users in rural communities. Existing community forestry institutions that bridge the
national and subnational scales of governance, such as the Federation of Community Forest Users (FECOFUN)
in Nepal, may play a critical role. Such a model could be replicated elsewhere, facilitating the integration of
CFM within a national or mixed-scale REDD+ strategy.

Opportunity costs

Forest conservation policies may bear opportunity costs for local communities that use those forests for
subsistence and commercial livelihoods. In sites surveyed by IFRI, 70 percent of households depended on
forests for their subsistence livelihoods in Nepal, 40 percent in Tanzania, and 43 percent in Bolivia. More
than a third of all fuelwood in all three countries was sourced from community forests. Changes in forest
governance or rules that restricted access to fuelwood (for example, to decrease carbon removal from forests
as part of an REDD+ strategy) would therefore affect subsistence livelihoods in a way that carbon payments
are unlikely to fully compensate (Karky and Skutsch 2010).

Subnational REDD+ mechanisms to distribute benefits in a manner that reflects the opportunity costs incurred
by the communities, is one element of the solution. The Watershed REDD+ Networks of Nepal‚Äôs Forest Carbon
Trust Fund pilot project demonstrates an emerging institution that could carry out this function, with local
contextual knowledge informing the relative distribution of benefits among watersheds, communities, and
households.

Equity
inclusion

An important element of equitable benefit sharing is that of ensuring that REDD+ payments reach marginalized
groups, and that they do so in a manner that does not treat those groups as recipients of charity (West 2012).
Greater inclusion will likely increase social capital across the country. In Nepal, the safeguards built into
the RPP include provision for benefit flows to indigenous groups, women, and poorer households, and the
weighted payments of the Forest Carbon Trust Fund could represent a model mechanism for ensuring benefit
gains by these marginalized groups. The Noel Kempff Climate Action Project in Bolivia illustrates the dangers
of excluding local communities: Communities did not participate in the design of the project and were not
given the option to modify or reject it, resulting in mistrust, resentment, and confusion in the affected
communities (Asquith, Vargas Rios, and Smith 2002). In contrast, policy instruments for the implementation
of the JMAM focus on community-generated natural resource management rules (Plurinational State of
Bolivia 2012a).

Institutional capacity

Preparations for the introduction of REDD+ into the forest landscapes of each of these countries have
required new institutional capacity. REDD+ pilot project funding has supported existing institutions, either
in their current form or with modification, and the establishment of new ones, at both the national and local

     levels. For example, the RFCCC in Nepal was created to facilitate communication and outreach; NAFORMA in
     Tanzania was established to facilitate monitoring; and the JMAM‚Äôs Territorial Management Plans in Bolivia will
     enable better land-use planning.

     In Bolivia, the JMAM proposal cites ‚Äústrengthening forest governance‚Äù as a primary issue at the core of
     sustainable forest management (Plurinational State of Bolivia 2012b). Focal aspects of community forest
     governance in Bolivia include the development of self-organized community rules about forest use, the
     monitoring and enforcement of these rules, and the sanctioning of those who break the rules (Andersson et
     al. in review).

     Using REDD+ Funding to Expand the Existing CFM Network
     Community forest management has demonstrable success in achieving sustainable forest outcomes, and has
     been afforded a central role in the national REDD+ strategies of all three case study countries. Expansion
     of the community forest network could logically form part of these countries‚Äô REDD+ approach: REDD+
     funding could overcome the transaction costs involved in establishing additional community forest sites, the
     selection of which could be guided by the key lessons outlined above. The legal framework for designating
     forests to communities has been established in all three countries.

     There are however, few examples of national policies to expand community forestry beyond its current
     extent. Uncertainty over the future of REDD+ could be constraining such efforts, which would incur high
     financial and time costs. This hypothesis is tentatively supported by the strategy of the Mpingo Conservation
     and Development Initiative project in Tanzania of using REDD+ funds to expand FSC certification programs
     for sustainable timber. Sustainable timber management under FSC is considered by project managers to have
     a greater record of longer-term benefit flows, relative to the uncertainty that REDD+ funding will continue
     beyond the immediate term.



     Impacts of REDD+ on CFM
     Positive Impacts
     Improving forest governance and strengthening community institutions is a critical goal of all three countries‚Äô
     REDD+ programs (Andersson et al. in review; Cronkleton, Bray, and Medina 2011). The ability of community
     forestry institutions to fully conduct all management activities has historically been constrained by limited
     financial resources, which has hampered the effectiveness and extent of the enforcement of local regulations
     on sustainable resource use. Local institutional capacity and human capital, in the form of trained personnel
     with the knowledge and skills to conduct forest management, have also often constrained community forestry
     effectiveness. REDD+ could represent a stream of funding, and also a source of training and support, both of
     which could improve community forestry activities, increasing their capacity to monitor resource extraction




64                                                                    community forest management and redd+
and to enforce rules, and resulting in better forest management that is likely to contribute to greater carbon
additionality (table 7.1). For example, the TFCG and MJUMITA projects in eastern Tanzania are supporting
the improvement of PFM capacity. In the long term, a permanent stream of REDD+ funding could ensure
sustainable forest outcomes in terms of both carbon and livelihood goals.

Negative Impacts
The resources and attention that REDD+ could bring to forests could also pose a new suite of difficulties
and even threaten the integrity of CFM. Here, we issue a series of cautions in trying to connect the two
mechanisms, based on the three country case studies.

Altered access to forest resources
There is widespread concern that, in an REDD+ landscape that aims to enhance carbon maximization, the
rules of forest use could change, with the effect of reducing community access to valuable subsistence and
income-generating resources such as firewood, charcoal, and construction timber. It may therefore not be in
the best interests of communities to buy into management plans that prioritize the maintenance of carbon
services. Socioeconomic (livelihood) objectives may be more important to local communities, yet are usually
considered secondary ‚Äúco-benefits‚Äù in an REDD+ context.

Recentralization
There are concerns that the financial opportunities associated with REDD+ may promote a recentralization of
forest governance and a weakening of CFM structures in countries where CFM has been widely established
(Phelps, Webb, and Agrawal 2010). That is, an injection of REDD+ funding may act as an incentive to
governments to roll back toward a centralized forest system in order to reap rewards more centrally
(Sandbrook et al. 2010). Given the high financial values at stake, there is a real possibility that governments
could justify recentralization by ‚Äúportraying themselves as more capable and reliable than local communities
at protecting national interests‚Äù (Phelps, Webb, and Agrawal 2010). Emerging conflicts in both Nepal and
Tanzania demonstrate this concern. The Bolivian government has rejected the mainstream market mechanism
of REDD+ and seems more intent on ensuring equity and community benefits from forest management.

Greater inequality
Establishing a system of equitable benefit sharing is a challenging task, further complicated in situations
where communities and governments share forest rights. This is the case with JFM in Tanzania, and with CFM
in Nepal where the government may claim its rights for revenues from soil carbon. Even when decision-
making processes remain at, or are devolved to, the community level, increased cash flows in communities
could incite local elite capture of project benefits, and marginalized groups could remain peripheral (Toni
2011).

     Continuity
     REDD+ pilot project payments may be incongruous with eventual national REDD+ program funding in one or
     more ways. Pilot project structures may not be representative of permanent national REDD+ architectures,
     or there may be a temporary discontinuity between REDD+ pilot project payments and longer-term funding,
     or a national REDD+ program may never be agreed on. In any of these cases, communities may have been
     presented with false promises. This could damage community relations with government agencies or NGOs,
     or even cause loss of income if resource-use behaviors have changed because of the pilot project‚Äîsuch as
     with the Forest Carbon Trust Fund tree-planting program in Nepal. Embedding REDD+ in the existing legal
     framework may increase the likelihood of continuity beyond donor commitment.

     Community perceptions of forest management
     Finally, attaching direct financial values to forests that have been managed principally for extractive resource
     benefits could alter community perspectives about the underlying philosophy of forest management. CFM
     sites are currently being managed by communities for local benefits, whereas a REDD+ focus would imply
     that communities are managing the forests at least in part for exogenous benefits derived by donor countries.

    8            conclusions



                 As a climate change mitigation strategy, REDD+ seeks to reduce carbon emissions
                 from deforestation and forest degradation. Biodiversity conservation and equitable
                 socioeconomic livelihood outcomes were initially included in REDD+ planning as ‚Äúco-
                 benefits‚Äù (for example, Angelsen 2008) but are now considered by most national
                 REDD+ strategies to be an integral part of the program. Community forest management
                 aims to achieve improved local livelihoods for forest-dependent communities, through
                 sustainable forest resource use. Sustainable ecological outcomes are an objective of CFM,
                 but principally because these are an integral part of sustainable, enhanced livelihoods.

                 CFM and REDD+ forest management goals therefore have different underlying motivations,
                 but their practical objectives in terms of sustainable forest management are closely
                 aligned. Because of this congruence, there is significant potential for accomplishing
                 REDD+ objectives in CFM landscapes. REDD+ pilot projects are being implemented in
                 CFM sites in Nepal and Tanzania, and Bolivia is beginning to explore ways to connect
                 communities managing forests with support from the JMAM.

                 REDD+ could benefit from the established successes of CFM in one or more ways.
                 First, REDD+ could adopt the design principles associated with improved outcomes in
                 community forests, for example by identifying large, well-defined forests governed by
                 small to medium-sized user groups with extensive experience of forest management.
                 Second, REDD+ could use the natural, human, social, and institutional capital associated
                 with existing community forest sites as a tool to achieve REDD+ goals. REDD+ funding
                 could help to overcome the historical financial barrier to effective CFM, by increasing the
                 capacity for management activities such as rule enforcement.

                 Our case study countries of Nepal and Tanzania demonstrate the significant extent
                 to which REDD+ pilot projects are utilizing and strengthening existing institutions in
                 CFM forests. In particular, we find that larger forests and communities with a moderate
                 dependence on forests have a substantial association with improved forest condition
                 outcomes. Attending to these characteristics of CFM in the selection of REDD+ sites and
                 design of REDD+ programs has the potential to advance the REDD+ objectives of higher
                 carbon sequestration. We should note that these relationships between characteristics
                 of CFM programs and forest outcomes based on observational data should be considered
                 as preliminary findings‚Äîmore rigorous studies using matched or randomized research
                 designs for case selection will be needed for greater confidence.

     CFM practices are certainly not a silver bullet in promoting REDD+ outcomes and do not present solutions
     to all REDD+ design and implementation challenges. Pilot projects and readiness activities are investing
     particularly in the development of benefit-distribution mechanisms, and the capacity for monitoring,
     reporting, and verification of carbon objectives. Finally, REDD+ funding is being used to expand the existing
     network of CFM forests, for example, in Tanzania where new JFM forests are being established.

     REDD+ also brings challenges to CFM landscapes. There are widespread fears, tentatively supported by early
     evidence, that REDD+ programs could restrict traditional patterns of resource access for forest-dependent
     communities. In both Nepal and Tanzania, there is a concern that REDD+ benefits may motivate a partial
     recentralization of forest management rights. And fundamentally, there is a distinct difference between the
     underlying motivation for CFM, which is driven by local benefits, and REDD+, which is driven by the carbon-
     oriented objectives of nonlocal actors. An awareness of these possible impacts may increase the likelihood of
     optimal environmental, economic, and social outcomes during REDD+ program design and implementation.

     Climate change mitigation policy is evolving in a dynamic economic and political context. As a consequence,
     many uncertainties about the future of REDD+ remain. However, given the urgency of forest-based mitigation
     and given the vast experience and significant successes of CFM, it seems probable that CFM will play an
     important role in the pathway by which many forested, developing countries achieve REDD+ objectives.

    9           RECOMMENDATIONS


                Based on our findings, we offer 10 recommendations, categorized by their relevance
                to policy makers, project developers, communities, and researchers engaged in REDD+
                design, implementation, and analysis.



                Policy Makers
                1.	 Support community forest management (CFM) as an effective mechanism to achieve
                    both carbon and livelihood benefits for REDD+. The principal interaction between
                    CFM and REDD+ to date has been to strengthen existing community forestry sites.
                    Although the underlying motivations for CFM and REDD+ differ, there is substantial
                    synergy between REDD+ and CFM objectives, and the dual forest conservation and
                    livelihood development focus of both programs means that policies that strengthen
                    and support existing CFM institutions and sites will advance REDD+ objectives.
                2.	 Formally allocate larger forest patches to communities to make more effective use
                    of REDD+ funding. Forests managed by communities already account for about 25
                    percent of forested land in developing countries, and these have a strong record of
                    sustainable forestry and livelihood outcomes. Given that CFM is an effective means
                    to achieve both carbon and livelihood goals, expanding CFM by designating larger
                    forest patches as community forests will advance REDD+ objectives without hurting
                    livelihoods. Such expansion should build on the lessons and experience of CFM to
                    guide site selection and institutional design.
                3.	 Use REDD+ pilot projects to build community-level capacity, particularly for tracking
                    forest and livelihood outcomes, essential for engagement with future national REDD+
                    programs. Communities need to build on their existing capacity in order to meet
                    REDD+ criteria, including functional payment structures, equitable benefit-sharing
                    mechanisms, and operational systems for monitoring, reporting, and verification
                    (MRV). Even though the future of REDD+ remains uncertain, communities need to
                    have these structures in place in order to be well positioned to capitalize on more
                    extensive and lucrative REDD+ opportunities if and when they eventually emerge.
                    Pilot projects and readiness activities are the principal mechanism by which these
                    structures will be developed.




Chapter 9 : Recommendations                                                                                 69
     Project Developers
     4.	 Ensure that REDD+ interventions are linked to performance, and not just to payment transfer. Many REDD+
         pilot project payments are contingent only on participation, with little or no valuation of opportunity
         costs or carbon. Payment structures that represent probable future REDD+ program approaches, which
         are likely to be based on altered behavior, would better prepare communities and would create more
         realistic expectations. Conditional, performance-based payments are more costly to monitor, and so
         development of indicators for low-cost monitoring of REDD+ outcomes may be a necessary additional
         activity.
     5.	 Strengthen and support the development of higher-level community forestry institutions around which
         interactions among CFM institutions can coalesce and which can coordinate the experiences of local CFM
         organizations. Several REDD+ pilot projects have demonstrated the effectiveness of deploying existing
         CFM institutions to bridge the gap between national and subnational elements of REDD+. This is likely to
         be an effective strategy to overcome the barriers to vertical coordination in REDD+, to ensure credibility
         and legitimacy.
     6.	 Some REDD+ activities should be conducted by communities and local institutions rather than, or in
         addition to, national-level organizations. It is advantageous to include communities in the design and
         implementation of REDD+ structures. In particular, equitable benefit distribution in local contexts is a
         challenge for national institutions. Empowering community forestry institutions to help determine the
         local distribution of benefits may ensure that this process is representative of local opportunity costs
         and that marginalized groups are included in REDD+ activities and benefit sharing. Likewise, community-
         based MRV may offer a degree of resolution that complements national-level MRV programs.


     Communities
     7.	 Take advantage of the financial and capacity-building opportunities offered by REDD+ pilot projects
         and readiness activities. REDD+ may be able to strengthen existing CFM arrangements, both through
         direct funding that supports better monitoring and enforcement of forest rules, and through training
         that generates stronger human and institutional capital. Because CFM is a dynamic set of institutional
         arrangements, the changes brought by REDD+ are not always threats but could also represent
         opportunities.




70                                                                    community forest management and redd+
       8.	 Mobilize to secure the possibility of continued implementation of REDD+ pilot projects and the flow of
           REDD+-related benefits. Although current REDD+ interventions are temporary and the future of a full
           REDD+ program at the national and international levels is uncertain, it will be more likely to come into
           existence with local support and mobilization. Although it might seem prudent for communities to be
           cautious of any temporary initiative that requires significant or nonreversible alterations in patterns
           of traditional resource use, contributing to the processes that encourage policy makers to create and
           implement such programs is more likely to bring them into existence.


       Researchers
       9.	 Identify the nature of interactions between CFM and REDD+ more widely and with greater country-
           level evidence. In some countries, many or all REDD+ pilot projects are being implemented within CFM
           landscapes. There are multiple possible interactions between the two programs, with both positive and
           negative implications for CFM and for effective, efficient, and equitable REDD+. Carefully designed
           research, based on case studies and primary data collection, could usefully examine REDD+ within and
           outside CFM sites, and should evaluate the impact of emerging REDD+ structures on CFM arrangements.
       10.	 Examine the trade-offs and synergies among additionality, leakage, and livelihood impacts of REDD+ in
            CFM landscapes. If REDD+ programs attempt to reduce local carbon extraction by restricting community
            access to timber, charcoal, and fuelwood in community forests, then two outcomes are probable. Either
            leakage will occur, and these products will be sourced from neighboring, less strictly protected forests,
            or local livelihoods will be negatively affected (unless alternative subsistence and income-generating
            opportunities are provided). Optimizing CFM and REDD+ outcomes is a priority for decision makers that
            requires improved understanding of socioecological dynamics.

   s report examines the linkages between community forest management (CFM)
and Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+). While
these approaches have different underlying motivations, their practical objectives
in terms of sustainable forest management are closely aligned. Because of this
congruence, there is significant potential for accomplishing REDD+ objectives in
CFM landscapes. Drawing on policy developments, pilot projects and field data in
Bolivia, Nepal and Tanzania, the study offers an analytical framework for exploring
the interactions between CFM and REDD+, and provides a set of conclusions and
recommendations on how REDD+ could benefit from the established successes of
community forestry.


First, REDD+ could adopt the design principles associated with improved outcomes
in community forests, for example by identifying large, well-defined forests
governed by small to medium-sized user groups with extensive experience of forest
management. Second, REDD+ could use the natural, human, social, and institutional
capital associated with existing community forest sites as a tool to achieve REDD+
goals. Third, REDD+ funding could help to overcome the historical financial
barrier to effective community forest management, by increasing the capacity for
management activities such as rule enforcement.
