2   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) is a unique international partnership of
governments, international institutions, civil society organizations (CSOs),
Indigenous Peoples, and the private sector that supports actions to protect the
global environment.

The GEF finances activities that developing countries undertake to address drivers
of global environmental degradation and to fulfill their commitments under several
global environmental conventions, including the United Nations (UN) Convention
on Biological Diversity (CBD), the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change
(UNFCCC), the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants (POPs),
the UN Convention to Combat Desertification (UNCCD), and the Minamata
Convention on Mercury.




                 Indigenous Peoples’ traditional knowledge and
                 ecosystem management practices are recognized
                 by the GEF as highly relevant for protection of the
                 global environmental commons, environmental
                 management, sustainable development, and
                 increased resilience.

                 The GEF sees Indigenous Peoples as distinct
                 communities whose identity and culture are
                 inextricably linked to the land, territories and natural
                 resources they depend upon.

                 Through its operations and policies, the GEF
                 supports the realization of the provisions of the
                 United Nations Declaration on the Rights of
                 Indigenous Peoples.

4   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY
To fulfill its mandate, the GEF partnership has a multi-part structure. It is composed of
the Assembly, the Council1, the Secretariat, the Agencies2, the Scientific and Technical
Advisory Panel (STAP), and the Independent Evaluation Office.

The close interaction among these actors results in the development and management
of projects and programs. These on-the-ground actions are implemented through
collaboration between national and international stakeholders, under the coordination
of the GEF Operational Focal Point (OFP) in each country.

6   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY
The GEF supports developing countries by providing grants or concessional financing
for measures to achieve agreed global environmental benefits. The GEF only funds
the incremental—or additional—costs of activities that generate benefits to the
global environment while promoting national sustainable development initiatives.

To enhance effectiveness, sustainability, and partnership, GEF-financed projects
require co-financing. Co-financing is defined as the resources that are additional to
the GEF grant and that are provided by various sources, including GEF Agencies,
governments, CSOs, and the private sector, that support the implementation of the
GEF-financed project and the achievement of its objectives. Types of co-financing
include grants, loans, guarantees, and in-kind resources.3

The GEF provides project funding through the following modalities:

8   THE GLOBAL ENVIRONMENT FACILITY
Indigenous Peoples’ involvement in the GEF varies, ranging from directly accessing
GEF funds (e.g. leading a project or receiving benefits as a stakeholder) to
participating in processes that influence how funds are distributed and implemented
(e.g. through participation in relevant Conventions and GEF Council meetings or GEF
policy development and strategic planning).

There are many possibilities for Indigenous Peoples to access GEF funding. The type
of GEF funding that Indigenous Peoples may pursue depends on the size of the
project, community or organization capacity, competing priorities within a country,
previous and existing projects, and other considerations.

Most commonly, Indigenous Peoples pursue GEF project funding through the
following channels:

 Small Grants Programme (regular project grants $25000-50000; strategic projects up to $150000)
 n Indigenous Peoples or organization can be the project lead.
 n Indigenous Peoples can work in partnership with a national NGO for a project.
 n All GEF focal areas covered.
 n Indigenous Peoples’ representatives are often part of SGP National Steering Committees.
 n Implementing a pilot Indigenous Fellows Program.




 Medium and Full Sized Projects
 n Indigenous Peoples organization can be the project lead (Project Executing and Implementing Agency).
 n Indigenous Peoples organization can be a sub-contractor for a component of a project.
 n Indigenous Peoples can be a beneficiary of the project.
 n All GEF focal areas covered.




 Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund (small grants up to $50000, large grants up to $1 million; average size
 ~$150000)
 n Indigenous Peoples organization can be the project lead.
 n Indigenous Peoples can be a beneficiary of the project.
 n Projects focused in specific Biodiversity Hotspots.
 n Designated Regional Implementation Team (RITs) coordinates projects in the identified hotspots.

The GEF has adopted a number of policies and guidelines to ensure that Indigenous
Peoples are part of all relevant aspects of the GEF’s work. Most relevant to
Indigenous Peoples interested in the GEF’s approach to engaging with Indigenous
Peoples are the GEF documents Principles and Guidelines for Engagement with
Indigenous Peoples10 and Partnership in Practice: Engagement with Indigenous
Peoples.11 These publications include policies and strategies for the participation of
Indigenous Peoples at the GEF and an analysis of projects involving Indigenous
Peoples including highlights and lessons learned.

The GEF’s policies and guidelines have been developed in close consultation with
Indigenous Peoples, CSOs, and other partners. As a key mechanism to implement
these policies and principles, the GEF has established the Indigenous Peoples
Advisory Group (IPAG). It consists of Indigenous Peoples’ representatives, an
independent expert, a representative from the GEF Agencies and the GEF
Secretariat. The IPAG meets regularly to discuss and implement important elements
of the Principles and Guidelines, including capacity development, financial
mechanisms, and monitoring for Indigenous Peoples-related projects, among other
issues relevant to enhancing partnership between Indigenous Peoples and the GEF.
Indigenous Peoples are also actively represented in the GEF-CSO Network12 through
three Indigenous Peoples focal points.

The GEF supports the expansion of its project portfolio involving Indigenous Peoples
and regular review of its policies and guidelines to maintain consistency with
international standards. Several approaches have been identified through
consultations with Indigenous Peoples, including:

1)	 Further facilitate Indigenous Peoples’ participation in relevant GEF processes and
    projects by applying the relevant safeguards, public involvement, and other
    policies and guidelines in a consistent manner.
2)	 Strengthen Indigenous Peoples’ capacity and their organizational capacity in the
    longer term, to enable management of relevant initiatives and projects on the
    global environment.
3)	 Further explore options for establishing new and/or strengthening existing
    programs and funds that support Indigenous Peoples projects.

The GEF will continue to pursue all of these approaches and looks forward to
continued dialogue with Indigenous Peoples to expand its partnerships in the future.

ABOUT THE GEF
The Global Environment Facility (GEF) was established on
the eve of the 1992 Rio Earth Summit, to help tackle our
planet’s most pressing environmental problems. Since then,
the GEF has provided $14.5 billion in grants and mobilized
$75.4 billion in additional financing for almost 4,000 projects.
The GEF has become an international partnership of 183
countries, international institutions, civil society organizations,
and private sector to address global environmental issues.
