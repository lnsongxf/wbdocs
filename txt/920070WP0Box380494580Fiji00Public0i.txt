THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

Note: DB2014 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2014 that capture the effects of s uch
factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number
of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business website

Fiji is a set of specific procedures—the bureaucratic
and legal steps that an entrepreneur must complete
to incorporate and register a new firm. These are              Legal form: Private Limited Liability Company

used by Doing Business in collecting the data (see the

       Check the uniqueness of the proposed company name and reserve
       name

       The entrepreneur must first conduct a search of the Companies,
       Business Names, and Trade Marks Register to ensure that the name
       applied for is not confusingly similar (1–2 days). Computerized (basic)
       and manual search systems are both available. The Government of Fiji
       has introduced a website (www.egov.gov.fj) for all applications for name
       reservation to be made online. Hard copy applications are no longer
       accepted by the Registrar of Companies unless an online application is
       made first.

       Application fees for name reservation can be paid in person at the
       Registrar of Companies' Office or via the online portal at
   1   www.egov.gov.fj. Only MasterCards and VISA cards are accepted. Once          8 days             FJD 6
       the payment is completed online, hard copies of the payment
       confirmation and the name reservation approval are required to be
       submitted to the Companies Registry.

       The application will take a week to process, and if it is successful, the
       company name will be reserved for 30 days (with a one-time extension).
       Company incorporation documents must be lodged with the Registrar
       within this time.

       It costs FJD 5 for reservation of the name and FJD 1 for company name
       search(excludes VAT).

      Obtain declaration of due compliance sworn by lawyer

      Fees may vary from FJD 1,000 to FJD 2,000. The Declaration of Due
      Compliance can be sworn by a lawyer engaged in the formation of the
      company or by a director or secretary who is named in the Articles of
      Association of the company as a director or secretary.

      The Cost of FJD1200.00 outlined above for a lawyer is not limited to
      him/her swearing the Declaration of Due Compliance. The Cost includes
      searches of the various registers to check for similar names, submission
      of the name reservation application, preparation of the company's

      declaration of due compliance

      Where a company director or secretary swears the Declaration of Due
      Compliance, the Cost is not substantially (if at all) reduced because in
      practice and in most cases lawyers and/or accountants still prepare
      most of the documents necessary to register a company.

      Agency: Lawyer



      Register the company with the Companies Registrar

      Under the Fiji Companies Act 1985, companies must submit the
      following company documents to the Companies Registrar along with
      the following company incorporation documents in order to register
      the company and obtain a certificate of incorporation:
      - current reservation of company name;
      - Memorandum of Association and Articles of Association;                              Registration fee FJD

                                                                                                  articles of
      the formation of the company).
                                                                                             association ($FIJD
                                                                                             10 each) + FJD 12
      The Registrar of Companies now requires a Tax Identification Number
      (TIN) from Fiji Revenue & Customs Authority before issuing the                          (Forms 201, 203,
      Certificate of Incorporation of the company. This was communicated by                  208 -$FIJD 4 each)
      the Registrar of Companies by a circular dated 13 August 2010.

      Accordingly, the practice now is as follows:
      (a) After the documents are lodged at the Companies Office, the
      Registrar of Companies will release a stamped version of the
      Memorandum and Articles of Association to the applicant;
      (b) The applicant then needs to fill in an “Application for New or

                                                                                   complete
      Changes to Registration of Companies, Partnerships, Trust or Estates”
      form. The form is available from the FRCA website;
      (c) After the application form has been completed, the signed original
      version of the application form together with the stamped version of
      the Memorandum and Articles of Association (and any other
      documents that may be required by FRCA) needs to be submitted to
      the Fiji Revenue & Customs Authority (FRCA) for issue of a TIN (Tax
      Identification Number) to the company. This requirement is consistent
      with the circular dated 13 August 2010 issued by the Registrar of
      Companies and results in a situation which seems FRCA issue a TIN for
      a legal entity that has yet to come into existence;
      (d) FRCA will process the application and assuming the application is in
      order, will issue a letter to the company confirming its TIN.

      As a result, the process of business incorporation takes longer than
      before (about 20 calendar days - 15 working days) since the
      entrepreneur needs to wait until the TIN number is issued in order to
      incorporate the company at the Companies Registry.

      The registration fees vary depending on the authorized capital of the
      company. For example, for a company with an authorized capital of FJD
      65,470.00, the registration fee would be approximately FJD163.13 and
      stamp duty of FJD10.00 for the stamping of the Memorandum of
      Association and Articles of Association.

      It would be advisable to attach documentary evidence of all claims in
      respect of the ‘cost of the property’ so that there is timely processing of
      the application for CGT Clearance Certificate by FRCA.Where
      documentary evidence is not available, letters could be written or
      statutory declarations could be provided to FRCA to explain the reasons
      for non-availability of the required documents. This would assist FRCA to
      process and issue of the CGT Clearance Certificate.



      Where CGT is payable and the seller does not have the funds to pay the
      CGT, arrangements could be made with FRCA for issue of the CGT
      Clearance Certificate based on an undertaking from the seller’s lawyer to
      FRCA to the effect that the lawyer will hold the sale proceeds in the trust
      account and will pay the CGT to FRCA before paying the balance sale
      proceeds to the seller.

      Settlement takes place at the Registrar of Titles Office

      Parties meet at the Registrar of Titles Office for settlement. They first
      double check encumbrances on the property and then exchange the
      titles for the payment. When this formality is accomplished, they submit
      the transfer documents for registration. The registration fee (FDJ 11.5 for
      properties over FDJ 100,000 + VAT of 15.0%) is paid. The Registrar of
4     Titles must not register an instrument for the transfer of a capital asset    60 days       FJD 11.50
      unless the seller or the purchaser furnishes the Registrar with a CGT
      Clearance Certificate confirming that CGT has been paid or satisfactory
      arrangement for payment of the tax has been made or no tax is payable.
      It is possible that some new mortgages might still be in "the pipeline"
      and are not yet recorded on the property at the settlement (the
      mortgage has been submitted in the registry, but it has not been
      inscribed yet). To avoid finding later about a mortgage on the property,

        32 of the Land Transfer act) where the registry checks and certifies that
        there are no other mortgages registered. Under the Land Transfer Act
        Amendment Decree No. 34 of 2011, the Registrar of Titles now requires
        certified copies of any one of the following Identifications of both parties
        to be lodged with the Transfer: (a) letter from FRCA confirming the Tax
        Identification Number (for individuals and companies) or (b) certified

                   Fiji made paying taxes less costly for companies by reducing the

                   Fiji made paying taxes more complicated for companies by
