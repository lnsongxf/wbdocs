I. Objectives

This survey was designed to achieve the following objectives:

       Assist the World Bank in gaining a better understanding of how stakeholders in
        Argentina perceive the Bank;

       Obtain systematic feedback from stakeholders in Argentina regarding:
            Their views regarding the general environment in Argentina;
            Their overall attitudes toward the World Bank in Argentina;
            Overall impressions of the World Bank ’s effectiveness and results, knowledge
               and research, and communication and information sharing in Argentina; and
            Perceptions of the World Bank’s future role in Argentina.

       Use data to help inform the Argentina country partnership strategy.




II. Methodology
In May-July, 2012, 279 stakeholders of the World Bank in Argentina were invited to provide
their opinions on the Bank’s assistance to the country by participating in a country survey.
Participants in the survey were drawn from among the office of the President, Prime Minister,
Minister, or Parliamentarian; employees of a ministry, ministerial department, or implementation
agency; consultants/contractors working on World Bank supported projects/programs; project
management units (PMUs) overseeing implementation of a project; local government officials or
staff; bilateral agencies; multilateral agencies; private sector organizations; private foundations;
the financial sector/private banks; NGOs; community-based organizations (CBOs); the media;
independent government institutions; trade unions; academia/research institutes/think tanks; and
the judiciary branch. A total of 104 stakeholders participated in the country survey (37%).

Importantly, this survey was administered electronically – respondents were emailed invitations
to participate and the questionnaire was completed online. Respondents were asked about:
general issues facing Argentina, their overall attitudes toward the Bank; the World Bank’s
effectiveness and results; the Bank’s knowledge; working with the World Bank; the Bank’s
future role in Argentina; and the Bank’s communication and information sharing in Argentina.

A. General Issues Facing Argentina: Respondents were asked to indicate whether Argentina is
   headed in the right direction, what they thought were the top three most important
   development priorities, and which areas would contribute most to reducing poverty and
   generating economic growth in Argentina.

II. Methodology (continued)
B. Overall Attitudes toward the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their familiarity
   with the World Bank, the Bank’s effectiveness in Argentina, Bank staff preparedness, their
   agreement with various statements regarding the Bank’s work, and the extent to which the
   Bank is an effective development partner. Respondents were also asked to indicate the
   sectoral areas on which it would be most productive for the Bank to focus its resources, the
   Bank’s greatest values and greatest weaknesses in its work, the most and least effective
   instruments in helping to reduce poverty in Argentina, and with which groups the Bank
   should work more.
C. World Bank Effectiveness and Results: Respondents were asked to rate the extent to which
   the Bank’s work helps achieve development results in Argentina, the extent to which the
   Bank meets Argentina’s need for financial instruments and knowledge services, and the
   Bank’s level of effectiveness across twenty-two development areas, such as economic
   growth, poverty reduction, governance, and others.
D. The World Bank’s Knowledge: Respondents were asked to indicate the areas on which the
   Bank should focus its research efforts, and to rate the effectiveness and quality of the Bank’s
   knowledge/research, including how significant of a contribution the Bank’ s knowledge and
   research make to development results and the technical quality of the Bank’s knowledge and
   research.
E. Working with the World Bank: Respondents were asked to rate their level of agreement with
   a series of statements regarding working with the Bank, such as the World Bank’s
   “Safeguard Policy” requirements being reasonable, working with the World Bank increasing
   Argentina’s institutional capacity, and the Bank disbursing funds promptly.
F. The Future Role of the World Bank in Argentina: Respondents were asked to indicate what
   the Bank should do to make itself of greater value in Argentina.
G. Communication and Information Sharing: Respondents were asked to indicate where they
   get information about economic and social development issues, how they prefer to receive
   information from the Bank, and their usage and evaluation of the Bank’s website and PIC.
   Respondents were asked about their level of agreement that they use more data from the
   World Bank as a result of the Bank’s Open Data policy. Respondents were also asked about
   their level of agreement that they know how to find information from the Bank and that the
   Bank is responsive to information requests.
H. Background Information: Respondents were asked to indicate their current position,
   specialization, whether they professionally collaborate with the World Bank, their exposure
   to the Bank in Argentina, and their geographic location.
In addition, when possible, responses from respondents completing this year’s country survey
were compared to responses from the 253 respondents (29% response rate) who completed the
country survey in FY 2010 and the 279 respondents (53% response rate) who completed the
survey in FY 2005. Notations and/or charts are included when these comparisons were possible.

VI. Sectoral Effectiveness (continued)
Drivers of Effectiveness
To determine the key drivers of respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness and
ratings of its ability to help achieve development results in Argentina, bivariate correlational
analyses were conducted using respondents’ ratings of the twenty-two specific areas of
effectiveness.

Correlational analyses, however, are not able to tell us exactly what is causing respondents’
ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or ratings of its ability to help achieve development
results. Rather, these analyses tell us that as ratings of effectiveness in one area increase,
respondents’ ratings of the Bank’s overall effectiveness increase, or as ratings of effectiveness in
one area increase, ratings of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development results i ncrease.
Thus, it can be inferred that respondents’ perceptions of effectiveness in one specific area are
related to, or drive, respondents’ perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness or perceptions
of the Bank’s ability to help achieve development r esults.

       Overall Effectiveness: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-Moment
        correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the Bank’s
        overall effectiveness, suggesting that ratings of effectiveness in those specific areas are
        drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s overall effectiveness in Argentina. The areas
        determined to be key drivers from these analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at natural resource management;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at public sector reform;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at public financial management.

       Achieving Development Results: Those specific areas with the highest Pearson Product-
        Moment correlations were determined to be the most closely related to perceptions of the
        Bank’s ability to help achieve development results in Argentina, suggesting that ratings
        of effectiveness in tho se specific areas are drivers of perceptions of the Bank’s ability to
        help achieve development results. The areas determined to be key drivers from these
        analyses were:
             The Bank’s effectiveness at domestic private sector development;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at economic growth;
             The Bank’s effectiveness at natural resource management; and
             The Bank’s effectiveness at social protection.

The World Bank is interested in gauging the views of clients and partners who are either involved in
development in Argentina or who observe activities related to social and economic development. The following
survey is meant to give the World Bank’s team that works in Argentina, greater insight into how the Bank’s work
is perceived. This is one tool the World Bank uses to assess the views of its critical stakeholders. With this
understanding, the World Bank hopes to develop more effective strategies, outreach and programs that support
development in Argentina. The World Bank commissioned an independent firm to oversee the logistics of this
effort in Argentina. This ensures anonymity and confidentiality. We hope you’ll be candid. To complete the
survey, please circle/check the response that most accurately reflects your opinion. If you prefer not to answer
