This year’s Doing Business report presents a gender
dimension in four of the indicator sets: starting a
business, registering property, enforcing contracts and
labor market regulation. Three of these areas are
included in the distance to frontier score and in the ease
of doing business ranking, while the fourth —labor
market regulation—is not.
Doing Business has traditionally assumed that the
entrepreneurs or workers discussed in the case studies
were men. This was incomplete by not reflecting
correctly the Doing Business processes as applied to
women—which in some economies may be different
from the processes applied to men. Starting this year,
Doing Business measures the starting a business process
for two case scenarios: one where all entrepreneurs are
men and one where all entrepreneurs are women. In
economies where the processes are more onerous if the
entrepreneur is a woman, Doing Business now counts the
extra procedures applied to roughly half of the
population that is female (for example, obtaining a
husband’s consent or gender-specific requirements for
opening a personal bank account when starting a
business). Within the registering property indicators, a
gender component has been added to the quality of
land administration index. This component measures
women’s ability to use, own, and transfer property
according to the law. Finally, within the enforcing
contracts indicator set, economies will be scored on

THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2016 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 114 of the Doing Business 2017 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

time recorded among all economies in the DB2017 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business

       State registration of legal entity

       Registration of medium-sized and large-sized business entities is
       performed based on a “one-stop-shop” principle: all the registration
       documents should be submitted to one state authority, the
       Public/Population Service Centers:

       The relevant justice authority shall issue a certificate of state registration
       of a company not later than 1 day following the day of submission. If
       documents are filed online via electronic government portal the state
       registration shall be performed within 1 hour from the moment of
       documents submission. SMEs are exempted from payment of a
       registration fee as of January 1, 2015.

       The list of the required documents includes the following:                        1 day         no charge

       signature. An electronic signature can be obtained at public registration

       it already. It is common for entrepreneurs to have an individual e-
       signature or have an ID with a chip. To validate a new signature, in-
       person presence in the center is required.

       Besides individual electronic signature of company founders, company
       should have a separate electronic identification. It can be obtained in
       the Public/Population Service Center on the same day as company

        and Health Tort to The Employee in Discharge of Labor and (Official)
        Duties (February 7, 2005) that became effective on July 1, 2005.The
        amount of insurance premium payable by an employer depends on
        insurance risks and wages. To assess risks, the insurance companies
        place all insurable personnel into three categories: administrative,
        operational, and support. Amounts of the insurance premium vary from
        0.04% to 9.99%. According to 7 May 2007 amendments to the law on
        obligatory insurance, an employer is required to get an insurance policy
        within 10 business days from the date of state registration indicated in
        the company's Certificate of State Registration                                    1 day

        1. The amount of the insurance premium depends on insurance risks
        and the amount of annual payroll fund and is calculated as the amount
        of insurance coverage multiplied by an insurance tariff which as set out
        by the law in the range of 0.12% to 2.96%.
        2. Insurable personnel is not divided into three categories
        (administrative, operational and support) as previously for the purposes
        of risk assessment.
        3. An employer is required to get an insurance policy within the first 10
        days of the month following the month of company registration.

   1    Resolution No. 237 came into force on 14 June 2012. According            10 days               no charge
        to the amended Rules, a customer who is willing to construct a
        building must obtain a decision of Akimat on issuance of a land
        plot for construction purposes. The amended Rules further
        provide that the term of consideration of an application to
        obtain such a decision is stipulated by the Land Code.

        Request and obtain architectural planning assignment (APZ)
        and technical conditions for utility connections

        To obtain an architectural-planning assignment, BuildCo must
        submit a business plan and project feasibility study to the city
        architecture department. The application must include any plans
        for construction, a description of the business activities to take
        place on site, and estimated utility hook-up and consumption
   2    requirements. In addition, BuildCo must submit a copy of the             10 days               no charge
        property title along with the plot document, approval of
        engineering-geological estimation of the plot, and company
        registration documents.

        The architectural planning assignment is a permit to develop a
        building plan/design/project. It includes some provisions and
        requirements that must be taken into account while developing
        the project and building.

      Submit project documentation to the single window to
      undergo expert evaluation




      Once the investor has obtained the architectural planning
      assignment (APZ) and technical conditions for utility
      connections, all project documentation is submitted to the single
      window to conduct an expert evaluation of the construction
      project by various involved agencies. The single window is
      managed by the Committee for Construction, Housing and
      Communal Services and Land Resources Management, which is
      in the jurisdiction of the Ministry of National Economy of the
      Republic of Kazakhstan. Everything is submitted online at
      www.epsd.kz and must be electronically signed.

      After submitting the application materials through the single
      window, the investor signs an agreement with the expert
      organization(s) that will be conducting the evaluation of project
      materials. After all documents are submitted and experts are
      assigned through the single window, the fee for their services is
      calculated based on the complexity, size, and location of the
      construction project. The contract is sent to the investor through
      the single window portal. After the investor pays the fee and
      signs the contract, the expert examination begins. If the            14 days     KZT 321,248

      submitted application, along with supporting documents, is not
      complete, the investor is contacted by a representative of the
      single window portal and is asked to supply the missing
      materials. The expert evaluation through the single window takes
      14 days, provided that there are no delays due to missing or
      incomplete application materials.

      Included in the expert evaluation are: project clearance from the
      Sanitation and Epidemiological Authority (SES), project clearance
      from the the electricity company, project approval from the Fire
      Service Department, project evaluation and approval by the
      Environmental Protection Agency, seismological project opinion
      from the Republican Enterprise Kazakhstan Scientific Institute
      "Kaz NIISA," project clearance from the Almaty City Architecture
      and Town-Planning Department, and other approvals as deemed
      necessary based on specific project documentation. Whereas
      previously these project clearances and approvals were obtained
      at separate agencies, now the process has been simplified and all
      project evaluation is done through the single window portal.

      The single window portal was introduced by amendments to Law
      No. 242 on Architectural, Town-planning and Construction

      works through the single window.

      There is no need to submit any documents at this stage because
      all the necessary reviews have already taken place and this is
      simply a notification. When the client comes to submit a form of
5     notification, he receives an approval document, based on which         1 day        no charge
      the client can begin construction works. This procedure is
      completed in 1 day and there is no waiting period before
      beginning construction.

      The notification requirement is stipulated in Law No. 242 on

      Center for Immovable Property of Almaty City.

      Application for technical passport is done online through the e-
      gov website. In order to obtain a technical passport, BuildCo
      must submit the following documents:

      1) application in the form specified in the Rules, where such an
      application contains the name of the authorized body, the type
      of the immovable property with its address, and information on a

        The technical conditions for electricity are received together with
        technical conditions from other utilities (water, gas, etc.).

        With the application the customer must submit the following documents:

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

                     Kazakhstan strengthened minority investor protections

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2015 lending rates.

                    Kazakhstan strengthened its insolvency process by introducing
                    an accelerated rehabilitation proceeding, extending the period
                    for rehabilitation, expanding the powers of and improving
                    qualification requirements for insolvency administrators,
DB2013              changing requirements for bankruptcy filings, extending the
                    rights of creditors, changing regulations related to the
                    continuation of operations, introducing a time limit for
                    adopting a rehabilitation plan and adding court supervision
                    requirements.
                    Kazakhstan made resolving insolvency easier by clarifying and
                    simplifying provisions on liquidation and reorganization,
                    introducing the concept of creditors’ meetings, expanding the
DB2015
                    rights of creditors during insolvency proceedings, authorizing
                    payment in kind to secured creditors and clarifying the process
                    for submitting creditors’ claims.
                    Kazakhstan made resolving insolvency easier by allowing
                    creditors to initiate reorganization proceedings and
                    encouraging sales of assets as a going concern. Kazakhstan

                    also improved its bankruptcy regime, by explicitly authorizing
                    post-commencement finance and granting it priority over
                    existing unsecured claims.
                    Kazakhstan made resolving insolvency easier by changing
                    voting procedures for reorganization plans and providing
                    protections to creditors who vote against such plans.

                    Additionally, creditors were granted greater access to

                    and allowed to challenge decisions affecting their rights.

To make the data comparable across economies, several
assumptions about the worker and the business are
used.

The worker:
       Is a cashier in a supermarket or grocery store,
        age 19, with one year of work experience.
       Is a full-time employee.
       Is not a member of the labor union, unless
        membership is mandatory.
The business:
       Is a limited liability company (or the equivalent
        in the economy).
       Operates a supermarket or grocery store in the
        economy’s largest business city. For 11
        economies the data are also collected for the
        second largest business city.

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
