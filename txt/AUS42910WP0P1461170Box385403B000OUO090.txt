   Box 3.1: Oecusse’s Unique Challenges

   Oecusse’s enclave geography, surrounded by Indonesian West Timor, presents special challenges for a cen-
   trally procured and delivered maintenance and repair system. Interviews in Oecusse at both district- and
   community-level confirmed that all maintenance and repairs, except tire repairs, were being carried out in
   Dili. Transporting vehicles by ferry involves US$300 in transport costs and a minimum three-day delay as
   ferries travel only twice a week. Land crossing requires a visa of US$90 per person each way and involves
   delays at the border with Indonesia.19
        Without doubt, decentralization of some routine maintenance and minor repair functions would be
   beneficial. One possibility, suggested by health staff, would be to use Indonesian mechanics in West Timor,
   where there is believed to be sufficient mechanical capacity and good road conditions.

        Box 3.2: The Two and a Half Year Multifunction Vehicle Repair

        A multifunction vehicle broke in July 2011 in a community.20 The DHS waited for the MoH to bring it to Dili
        until September 2012 (14 months). When there was still no action, they transported it to the DHS using the
        imprest/operating funds. In August 2013, they again used operating cash to hire a tow truck to send the ve-
        hicle to Dili. Only after the vehicle arrived in Dili was the part needed ordered from abroad, introducing a
        further delay.
             Eventually, in December 2013, about two and a half years after the breakdown, the vehicle was re-
        turned. In the opinion of the district staff, the actual repair could have easily been done in the district if the
        parts had been available from Dili and the MoH could have organized to have the parts sent to the district.21

  Box 3.3: Privatization of Fleet Management, Repair and Maintenance:
  An Alternative?

  Given the many challenges and delays in requisitioning, obtaining, and paying for repair and maintenance
  services, a question that arises is whether improving the existing public system of vehicle provision, main-
  tenance and repair is the best approach, or whether consideration should also be given to a more ambitious
  approach of contracting out not only the repair and maintenance services, but also the entire provision of
  the vehicle fleet to the private sector.
       This approach is already being piloted for the ambulance fleet. In addition, the International Finance
  Corporation (IFC) is exploring the feasibility of the privatization of select health inputs with the Ministry of
  Health, including vehicles.30
       While this chapter did not investigate the feasibility of a more extensive privatization option, its find-
  ings on the experience with the contracting out of repair services and maintenance services—as well as
  purchasing fuel (see Chapter 2)—raised some important issues.


  •	   In Timor-Leste, there may be some limitations to the normal cost advantages that can be achieved via
       the competitive bidding process. An assessment of private sector capacity—and interest—would be
       essential.
  •	   Ministry of Health capacity to manage straightforward goods and services contracts is currently ex-
       tremely lacking, and any effort to introduce a system of framework contracting for fleet management
       would require a major effort to upgrade contract management capacity, as well as to improve national
       regulatory capacity.
  •	   This upgrading would either require support to existing MoH structures to improve their performance,
       for example through introducing performance criteria as outlined above, or through the wholesale cre-
       ation of a new MoH contract management unit and national regulatory institutions.
  •	   The latter approach would entail a large international development assistance effort and considerable
       expense, and therefore should be carefully assessed to ensure (a) a reasonable prospect of success
       and (b) significant impact to justify the investment.


       Taking all these factors into consideration, it seems prudent to go down two paths in parallel: first,
  continue to work on improving the contracting arrangements for currently privatized functions and gradu-
  ally build capacity, while secondly, and simultaneously, exploring the more ambitious possibility of moving
  towards further privatization over the medium-term. The latter would likely require buy-in from across the
  government and a large investment in management capacity that is possibly best undertaken as part of a
  broader inter-ministerial capacity-building in contract management.
