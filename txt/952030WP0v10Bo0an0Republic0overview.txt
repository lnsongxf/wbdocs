 Note: The distance to frontier captures the difference between the performance of each economy and the best observed performance (the frontier) at a global level in each measure
 for the 3 indicators under study (starting a business, dealing with construction permits and registering property). An economy’s distance to frontier is indicated on a scale from 0
 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 the best global practice or “the frontier”. A higher score denotes a more efficient regulatory environment. This measure
 provides a more accurate view of the performance of each economy and how much progress it has made over time. The global ranking on the ease of doing business is based on an
 average of the distance to frontier for the 3 indicators. For more details, see the section About Doing Business and Doing Business in Central America and the Dominican Republic 2015.

BOX 1.1 WHAT IS THE LEGAL STATUS OF WOMEN IN CENTRAL AMERICA AND THE DOMINICAN REPUBLIC?i

 During the last century, the role of women has been key for the world’s economic development. The removal of legal obstacles
 for women—representing half the population and the potential human capital available in their countries—generates eco-
 nomic benefits beyond gender equalityii. In Central America and the Dominican Republic, more women of working age have
 entered the labour force over the past 12 years. However, out of the total number of women of working age, 48% participate
 in the labour force, a figure below the average for Latin America and the Caribbean (54%) and OECD high-income countries
 (55%)iii. The study Women, Business and the Law, published every 2 years by the World Bank Group analyses the incentives and
 legal and regulatory restrictions affecting women when it comes to starting their own business or entering the labour market.

 Between 1960 and 2010, 15 countries in Latin America and the Caribbean reduced approximately 84% of the legal restrictions
 on women to purchase and manage property and to act on their own, for example, obtaining financing, opening a checking
 account, or signing a contractiv. Based on the evaluation carried out by Women, Business and the Law, in the Dominican
 Republic as well as in other 14 countries such as Canada and Spain there have been no differences in the law for men and
 women since 2013. However, in the six Central American countries, some restrictions diminishing women’s legal status as
 head of household or restricting them access to certain jobs still persistv. The civil legislation of Hondurasvi, for example,
 grants priority to men within marriage to act on behalf of the couple’s young children. As for Nicaragua, a woman may act on
 behalf of her family only in the absence of the husbandvii. Concerning labour, laws in Costa Ricaviii, Hondurasix, Panamax and
 Nicaraguaxi forbid women’s access to certain jobs. Limitations such as not being allowed to work night shifts, for example, as
 is the case in Costa Rica, could reduce women’s involvement in labour in sectors operating 24 hours a day. In the Philippines,
 high labour demand at call centers encouraged the government to remove in 2011 the prohibition for women to work night
 shifts. In India, a legal exception was established to enable work at night for women hired by technology service companies.

 Establishing by law a mandatory retirement age that is lower for women as compared to men may also limit their profes-
 sional careers over time, thus negatively impacting their pensions and other retirement benefits. This happens in El Salvador,
 Honduras and Panama.

 On the other hand, incentives such as the prohibition to fire a woman during pregnancy, compensated maternity or paternity
 leaves and laws protecting the equality principle in remuneration promote women’s participation in the labour force. In the six
 Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, governments have adopted a good practice consisting of subsidiz-
 ing maternity leave payment, with a percentage participation of employers; in El Salvador, the government subsidizes 100%
 of these leaves. Another incentive is granted through laws seeking to increase women’s participation in high decision-making
 positions. In the six Central American countries and the Dominican Republic, laws establishing quotas for women’s participa-
 tion in electoral lists for seats in congress and at a municipal level have been approved.

 The most significant challenge for the countries in the region is effective implementation of laws protecting women against
 violence. Despite the existence of all kinds of laws against domestic violence and different types of abuse (physical, sexual
 and psychological), the Economic Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean estimates that up to 40% of women in
 the region could be affected by physical violencexii. In addition to the direct suffering of the victims, violence against women
 has economic consequences for society, including higher costs associated with health and justice systems and a loss of
 productivity for local companies.

 activities and in the labor market in 143 economies in the world. The 3 studies in the series may be reviewed on the website http://wbl.worldbank.org/

 in Latin America and the Caribbean that were analyzed in the study had a total of 5 restrictions; among them, Bolivia, Chile, Honduras and Nicaragua. These restrictions are related
 to a woman’s status as head of household, the property rights of married women and women’s capacity to get a job without the need to ask the permission of their spouse.

 Note: The performance by indicator depends on the “distance to frontier” score for each city compared to that attained by the others. In addition, the global ranking is the average of
 the distance to frontier score for each city in the 3 indicators (starting a business, dealing with construction permits and registering property). For example, in Choluteca (Honduras),
 despite the fact that its lowest performance is in the dealing with construction permits area (20th position), its average score in the 3 indicators is 61.63, the lowest across the 22
 cities.
