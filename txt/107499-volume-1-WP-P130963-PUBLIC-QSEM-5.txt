The Qualitative Social and Economic Monitoring of Livelihoods in Myanmar
(QSEM) research program is a study of rural life in Myanmar.
QSEM examines people’s livelihood strategies and activities, the wider factors that
shape those strategies and how the broader social and institutional features of
community life affect livelihood choices and outcomes. The research covers 54 villages
in three states and three regions spanning the agro-ecological zones in which the
Livelihoods and Food Security Trust Fund (LIFT) operates: (i) the dry zone (Magway and
Mandalay regions); (ii) coastal zones (Rakhine State and Ayeyarwady Region); and (iii)
hilly zones (Chin and Shan states). This report documents findings from the fifth round
of research, which took place between December 2014 and February 2015.
Unlike previous QSEM reports, which focused on changes between respective research
rounds, this report looks at changes over a three-year period from the beginning of
QSEM in early 2012 to the most recent period of field research. The report draws on
panel data documented in each village across all five rounds, as well as findings from
previous QSEM reports.


A number of significant changes have been observed over QSEM rounds:
1.	 Myanmar presents a mixed picture for agricultural livelihood development: Some
    areas have experienced improvement, while some remain vulnerable. Wages have
    increased but peak season labor scarcity remains a challenge.
2.	 Access to credit has been a focus of both government and donor assistance. QSEM
    research indicates that villages across the country now have greater access to low-
    interest loans.
3.	 Village governance has continued to change following the introduction of a Ward
    and Village Tract Administration Law. Village tract administrators have experienced
    increased levels of authority, while the influence of village administrators has
    declined.
4.	 People have higher expectations of government, including in delivering
    government services, and are more willing to express discontent when their
    expectations are not met.


THE LIVELIHOODS CONTEXT
Mixed changes in agricultural livelihoods across QSEM villages.
Some QSEM research areas have seen notable improvements, while in other areas
agricultural development has remained stagnant. Ayeyarwady Region has benefitted
from NGO assistance and improved access to credit, while the movement toward
permanent cultivation in Chin State has improved agricultural livelihoods across
most villages there. In Shan State, increased access to the Chinese market has driven
improvements in agriculture. However, in the Dry Zone and Rakhine State, farmers
remain vulnerable to the frequent market and weather shocks that have featured
across QSEM rounds. Farmers in these areas have been particularly affected by water
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                         III




shortages. Farmers across the country remain affected by high labor costs that have
constrained their productivity and in some cases forced them to change to less labor
intensive and less profitable crops.


Laborers have seen wage increases and nonfarm income is playing a larger role
in more households.
The QSEM study has documented steady wage increases across the states and regions
where research was conducted, though laborers continue to struggle to find enough
working days to make a living. There is evidence of changing pay structures in response
to high demand for labor at peak times in the year.
Nonfarm enterprises have become more common as households have experienced
improved access to capital through remittances, NGO or microfinance credit, or
expanded government programs. In some areas, the study found evidence that public
works projects were stimulating investment in local businesses.


Migration has increased consistently across research areas with Mandalay,
Ayeyarwady and Chin seeing the most significant increases.
Since 2012, the factors driving migration have evolved. Findings across QSEM rounds
show that migration can no longer be understood predominantly as a coping
mechanism for people facing economic shocks. Instead, many people see migration as
an economic opportunity to build capital or diversify their household income. People
also have increasingly nuanced understandings of the risks and benefits of migration,
with certain types and destinations falling out of favor due to perceived higher risks or
lower returns.


There are some risks that particular groups may be left out of the transition
process, leading to growing inequality.
QSEM reports have consistently documented the declining position of subsistence and
small-scale fishermen. In addition, some households are less able to take advantage
of the trend toward diversifying income from a variety of agricultural, nonfarm and
migrant sources. This is particularly the case for households lacking both capital and
productive labor.


The rural credit market has changed significantly.
Access to credit for rural communities has improved significantly. Perhaps the most
noticeable expansion has come from the Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank
(MADB), which has gone from a presence in 13% of QSEM villages in round one to over
70% in round five. Borrowing limits per acre have also increased which, together with
evidence of increased flexibility in how MADB loans are managed, has led to positive
impacts for farmers.
In addition to MADB, donor-funded microfinance and revolving fund programs, as
well as government programs such as Emerald Green, are also increasingly providing
LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                            IV




low-interest sources of finance for nonfarm livelihoods. However, as MADB remains
the most widespread source of credit, and as it limits its loans to those holding land
registration documents, the current system of credit provision favors larger, better-
off farmers. Women, youth and the landless are among those who face continued
constraints in accessing credit.
In addition, monthly interest rates have seen a small but noticeable decline across all
types of credit sources. This has been driven by improved access to formal, low-interest
credit sources and the resulting reduced need for high-interest loans provided by local
moneylenders or personal networks.


THE VILLAGE CONTEXT
The rise of the village tract administrator (VTA) and the decline of the village
administrator (VA)
Since the implementation of the Ward and Village Tract Administration Law in 2012,
the center of power in village-level governance has changed. Between QSEM 3 and
QSEM 4, all village tracts in the study held elections for new VTAs and almost half
were replaced. Local-level governance functions have been consolidated into the VTA
position in villages across the country. Previous QSEM rounds identified the VTA’s salary
and influence over government assistance to the village as driving their increased
authority. Research in this round identifies additional factors reinforcing this trend,
particularly the VTA’s position as sole intermediary and source of information between
the village and the township.
There has been a corresponding decline in village administrator influence, with
variations between the central regions of Ayeyarwady, Magway and Mandalay and
the states of Chin, Rakhine and Shan. In the case of the regions, villagers are seeking
assistance directly from the VTA, reducing the influence of village leaders. In Chin,
Rakhine and Shan, there is a continued reliance on village administrators but less
incentive for those administrators to perform their functions.


Social capital remains strong despite signs that social bonds in villages may be
weakening
Despite changes to governance, social capital in Myanmar villages remains generally
strong: the research shows that approximately 80% of surveyed villages report “good”
or “average” social relations. Despite this, some villagers face socio-economic barriers
to participation in village activities, while social stigma toward people in lower socio-
economic groups was also reported.
While a definitive trend is not clear, the research suggests that social bonds within
villages may be weakening due to increased mobility and migration, and increasing
reliance on economic activity beyond the village community. Combined with the
decline in influence held by the village administrator and several examples of villages
having difficulty mobilizing for communal activities, this is a trend that merits further
examination.
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                             V




Limited change for other village-level institutions
There were limited changes to other village institutions. The presence of recently
constituted village development support committees was inconsistent, and where
they did exist their influence was mostly limited. NGO-led village development
committees were normally focused on specific projects with limited impact on
broader village governance. Established socio-religious groups have remained largely
unchanged, although Village Elder and Respected Persons (VERP) groups show some
signs of declining influence. Individual elders often retain their influence however,
through their relationships with the VTA or township-level officials.
The role of women remains a major challenge for local institutions, with few examples
of women in village leadership positions. Even in examples where donor programs
mandated female involvement, greater participation has not resulted in more influence
in wider decision-making processes.


ENGAGING BEYOND THE VILLAGE
Rural communities continue to have limited abilities to inform decision-making
processes about their development needs.
Government assistance to QSEM villages has increased significantly throughout the
study, most noticeably in education, local infrastructure and access to credit. However,
this assistance is generally provided from above and rural communities have limited
influence over what kind of assistance they receive and how it is targeted. Many
of the decisions regarding government assistance are made at the township level,
far removed from the lives of most villagers. The Township Development Support
Committee is charged with representing the population’s interests, but is generally
comprised of local elites who reside closer to township centers.


Villagers have increased expectations for government services.
Over the last several years, expectations among villagers have increased. People
now expect increased levels of government services and are more willing to
express dissatisfaction when they feel their expectations are not met. This change
has provided space for local interest groups—both political parties and activist
organizations — to mobilize around service delivery.


There have been significant variations across regions/states in the number
of donor projects in QSEM villages. LIFT remains the main donor providing
assistance.
Although the aggregate level of aid across the QSEM villages remained constant, there
was a significant fluctuation at the region/state level. Significant decreases in the
number of donor projects were identified in Mandalay, Ayeyarwady and Rakhine, in
part due to the closure of humanitarian projects. With the exception of Chin State,
there is limited access to alternative sources of donor assistance beyond support
provided through LIFT partners.
LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                        VI




Village development committees (VDCs) have lacked continuity, often disbanding
once a project is completed. As a result, there is limited evidence that donor project
mechanisms have successfully supported development of stronger village governance
structures.


RECOMMENDATIONS
Develop a fuller understanding of how groups balance the range of available
livelihood opportunities.
People have access to a small number of livelihood options and generally look to
diversify in an effort to ensure food security, develop resilience to shocks and build
capital. It is important that development actors identify which activities, and in what
combinations, provide the greatest prospects for improved economic wellbeing within
a given context.


Implement effective social protection mechanisms.
Development actors should particularly target groups that are less able to benefit from
the transitions that are occurring in village life and help to establish effective social
protection mechanisms or income generation schemes to support these groups.


Re-examine village governance structures.
There is increasing evidence that current village governance structures do not ensure
active village participation in their own development processes. Ultimately, there is a
need to review the current regulatory framework and develop effective governance
mechanisms that provide villages with increased voice and improve accountability. This
could involve re-investing authority in the village administrator, or strengthening some
other form of representative body such as village development support committees.
There is also a need to ensure that villages have access to information from the
township level and that there is clarity about the roles and responsibilities of different
stakeholders.


Build capacity at the township level and strengthen links to villages.
Under Myanmar’s current reform process, many of the important local development
decisions are being taken at the township level, either by township officials or
by Township Development Support Committees (TDSC). Evidence suggests that
many townships lack the capacity to implement projects or involve villages in the
development process. In the future, it is important that development assistance
focuses on linkages between townships and villages.

VILLAGE PROFILE - SHAN STATE
This village in Shan State has seen significant developments over the three years
the QSEM team has been visiting. The village has a population of approximately
515 people in 115 households. Almost 13 percent of households are headed by
women.
There has been a large increase in corn cultivation. In late 2012, paddy was the
primary crop, with corn, sweet potato and radish as secondary income sources.
Increases in the price of corn caused farmers to clear vacant land and expand the
amount of corn grown from 174 acres in QSEM 2 to 250 acres in QSEM 5. Paddy
cultivation has fallen from 86 acres to 13 acres, grown by only three or four house-
holds in the most recent season. Corn is grown mostly for chicken feed which is
exported through brokers to China. As supply of corn has increased, brokers have
found it difficult to pay upfront and instead make farmers wait until they can sell
on the produce. The returns from corn cultivation can be seen in the number of
houses with new television sets and other appliances. Farmers are also increasingly
buying plow machines, with the added benefit of reducing reliance on cattle as
access to pasture land decreases.
The village is surrounded by three military bases, and has reported having to
deal with land confiscation since the 1980s. With the start of political reforms in
the early rounds of QSEM, villagers were given more flexibility to farm some of
the confiscated land. In late 2013, one of the military bases decided to transfer
ownership of over 60 acres of land back to previous owners. A female respondent
proudly showed researchers the signed agreements acknowledging the return of
10 acres to her family.

  “It is not easy being an administrator: it’s very busy and yet there is no salary.
   But if there is no administrator it will not be easy because people have differing
   opinions.”

It has become progressively more difficult to appoint a village administrator. There
is very little interest in the job. When the team visited the village in QSEM 3 the
position was vacant. This created difficulties both for resolving land problems and
for any tasks that involved working with the township government. A village monk
suggested to elders that they hold a village meeting to select a new administrator.
The previous administrator was selected on the understanding that he only serves
a one-year term.
Although located in a conflict area, the village has remained neutral as most of the
population is from a different ethnic group. This changed a little in late 2014. For
the first time, the village was asked to contribute to the ethnic armed group, selling
some natural resources to make the payment. Some suggested that the ceasefire
has allowed these groups to operate more freely closer to township centers.
The village has been relatively successful in accessing external assistance. There has
been a long association with one donor, supporting education and microfinance
activities. Microfinance, in particular, has facilitated the initial move to cultivating
corn. These activities have subsequently been handed over to the Department of
Cooperatives. Government programs have also increased, with a new water pump
providing accessible water and solar panels distributed to poorer households.

The Qualitative Social and Economic Monitoring (QSEM) research program aims to
monitor and understand rural livelihoods in Myanmar. The research examines how
people in rural Myanmar make a living, the wider factors that shape their ability to
do so, and how the broader social and institutional features of community life affect
people’s livelihood choices and outcomes. Through this research, the program aims to
provide an understanding of what kinds of external assistance are likely to succeed in a
given context.


THE CONTEXT
QSEM research has coincided with a period of rapid economic and political change
in Myanmar. The first round of research was undertaken from March to May 2012,
soon after the Government of the Union of Myanmar began to implement significant
reforms following elections in 2010. Since then, a panel of 54 villages covering three
states and three regions have been visited on four separate occasions, with the most
recent round of research finishing in February 2015. The QSEM villages are located
across Ayeyarwady, Chin, Magway, Mandalay, Rakhine and Shan.
When the QSEM research commenced in early 2012, rural livelihoods in Myanmar were
constrained by a broad range of factors. Although nearly two thirds of the workforce in
Myanmar is employed in agriculture, the sector was described in 2009 as “stretched to
breaking point”. 1 Profit margins for major crops such as paddy and pulses were slim.
Farmers had high levels of debt and limited access to alternative means of credit aside
from private moneylenders. Prices for crops were depressed as a result of an overvalued
currency and an inefficient agricultural value chain. In addition, farmers living in
Ayeyarwady Delta were still recovering from the destruction caused by Cyclone Nargis.
In 2009/2010, over a quarter of the population was living in poverty.2
Social capital within villages was relatively strong. During the period before transition,
villages had limited access to external development resources. In effect, they were
largely left to look after their own needs. This appears to have fostered high levels of
social capital in villages in Myanmar. Communities worked together to address their
development priorities, with the village unit the primary social protection mechanism
for those in need. 3
This social capital was necessitated in part due to scarce access to services or
development resources from external actors. Villages had limited opportunities to
access resources from higher levels of government. Assistance from international
actors expanded significantly in Ayeyarwady Region following Cyclone Nargis in
2008, and Rakhine State following Cyclone Giri in 2010. Prior to this, villages had
limited experience with development projects from the donor community. When
LIFT commenced, its implementing partners were the sole external providers of
development projects in many villages.

It is important to place the QSEM research in the context of the significant changes that
have occurred in Myanmar from early 2012 to the present. These changes include:
A raft of regulatory initiatives took place at the national level, with wide-ranging
implications locally. In February 2012, the national parliament passed the Ward and
Village Tract Administration Law, which significantly re-defined village governance
structures across Myanmar. Among the changes, the law implemented a form of
election for village-tract administrators (VTA) who had previously been appointed by
township-level officials. It also removed reference to 100 household leaders (commonly
the same as village administrators or VAs). The implications of this law first became
clear in QSEM 3, which documented the first VTA elections.
In the same year, two laws were passed that changed land management structures
and provided people with the means to formally buy, sell, and trade farmland. The
Farmland Law provided farmers with the right to register land use certificates in their
names, effectively formalizing a type of private ownership of land. It also created new
structures to register and manage land disputes and provided a right to compensation
for compulsory acquisition of land. The Vacant, Fallow and Virgin Land Management
Law provided individuals with the right to apply for leases of vacant, fallow or virgin
lands and enabled farmers to apply to register such land if they can prove current
usage of the land.
Myanmar’s economy has responded to a number of key policy decisions, with
implications at the village level. In early 2012, the government made changes to the
regulation of Myanmar’s exchange rate by introducing a managed float. This has been
seen as a positive in providing additional fiscal contributions to Myanmar’s budget
from natural resource earnings. Other changes to the financial regulatory framework,
including the passage of the Microfinance Law in 2011, have resulted in improved
access to credit.
Other important policy changes have included the passage of the Foreign Investment
Law and an opening up of the telecommunications market. These new policies are
not directly targeted at the livelihoods of people living in rural Myanmar. Their impact
has, however, been felt at the village level. In the year following the passage of the
Foreign Investment Law, foreign investment was reported to have increased from
US$300 million to $1,400 million. Over 80 percent of newly approved projects were in
the manufacturing industry, a source of employment for people migrating from rural
areas.4
The liberalization of the telecommunications market in 2014 has driven down the
price of mobile phone ownership and made them accessible for many people in rural
communities, with important economic and social implications.
These changes are indicative of the changing role of government in the lives of people
in rural Myanmar. Government budgets for provision of basic services and local
infrastructure have increased since the 2010-11 fiscal year. Expenditure on health tripled
to 3 percent of the budget between 2011-2012 and 2014-2015, while the education
budget increased from 310 billion kyat in 2011-2012 to 1.4 trillion kyat in 2014-2015.
Despite this, as a proportion of overall budget expenditure these categories remain

the lowest of all ASEAN countries.5 Sub-national parliaments have also been formed.
Budget flows managed by these parliaments represented 7.2 percent of the total
national budget in fiscal year 2011-2012, increasing to 11.8 percent in 2013-2014.6 In
April 2013, the national parliament also introduced a Constituency Development Fund
providing 100 million kyat per township to be spent on local infrastructure, water
supply and health or education needs.
The context has also influenced how the international community engages with
Myanmar. At the time QSEM commenced in 2012, there were few donors working
extensively in rural Myanmar, apart from assistance targeted for areas affected by
cyclones Nargis and Giri. LIFT was the major exception, with its programs supporting
over 2.8 million people since 2009. After sanctions were lifted in 2012, donor assistance
grew both through a proliferation of aid programs from countries re-engaging with
Myanmar and through renewed relations with international financial institutions.7 On
the latter front, in early 2013, this resulted in negotiations to cancel some 60 percent
of Myanmar’s external debt and provide access to concessional loans from institutions
including the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.
Beyond the impacts from policy changes, climatic conditions have varied across QSEM
rounds, with initial rounds seeing some regions seriously affected by adverse weather.
This was particularly the case across the dry zone (represented by Magway and
Mandalay regions in the QSEM sample), which experienced lower than usual rainfall
during the first three rounds of QSEM and before that since 2010. Additionally, rice
growing areas in Ayeyarwady Region and some parts of Rakhine State were suffering
from salt-water intrusion and poor soil quality as a consequence of cyclones Nargis and
Giri, respectively.
There have been mixed dynamics in the security situation across the country. From
2011 to 2013, the government agreed to ceasefires in conflicts with sixteen separate
armed groups. These were a precursor to negotiations on a more permanent
nationwide ceasefire agreement. As a result, the security situation in most of these
areas has improved. This is not the case in Rakhine State, however, which has seen
noticeable spikes in communal tensions. In particular, the Muslim population was
targeted in extensive communal violence across large parts of northern Rakhine State
in late 2012.

million in 2011 to US$505 million in 2012 (www.aidflows.org accessed on 1 April, 2015). Overall figures are likely to have
increased significantly since 2012. For example, the EU announced a package of €900 million for six years from 2014 to
2020. The United Kingdom aid budget for Myanmar has also increased from £32 million in 2010/11 to £56 million for
2014/15 (DFID, “Burma: Operational Plan 2011-2015”, August 2012).

                                  THE SAMPLE
                                  The research covered 54 villages purposively selected to represent variations across
                                  six states and regions. Two states or regions were selected from each of the three
                                  agro-ecological zones within Myanmar: the dry zone; the hilly areas; and the coastal
                                  area (including the Ayeyarwady region). Three townships were selected in different
                                  geographical areas within each state or region, – one in each of the three districts with
                                  the highest poverty levels in the state/region, conditional on LIFT presence – yielding
                                  18 townships in total.
                                  Within each township, three villages were selected based on variation in proximity to
                                  a trade center and access to water resources or roads, yielding 54 villages in total. In
                                  each township, one ‘A’ village was selected that was closer to the township center or
                                  had better access to roads, markets or water. A ‘B’ village was selected representing
                                  average levels of access in that township. ‘C’ villages were generally more remote or
                                  had worse access than other villages in that township. This sample approach allows
                                  for some comparison of villages based on their relative access within a given township.
                                  In this report, ‘A’ villages are referred to as ‘accessible’ villages, ‘B’ villages are ‘average’
                                  villages and ‘C’ villages are referred to as ‘remote’.


                                  THE FIELDWORK
                                  Each region or state was visited four times over the five rounds of research. The initial
                                  rounds of research aimed to cover both temporal and seasonal variation. For this
                                  reason the initial design was developed to stagger research locations across rounds.
                                  From QSEM 1 to QSEM 3, four of the six states or regions were covered in each round.

As the research developed, comparisons between locations were identified as being
equally important as comparisons within locations. As a result, all six states/regions
were visited in each of the final two rounds, with nine months between each round of
research rather than the six-month intervals in earlier rounds.
The most recent round of research was conducted from December 2014 to early
February 2015. Figure 1 provides a summary of the different rounds of research relative
to major crop cycles. QSEM 5 research was conducted in the months following the
2014 monsoon harvest of paddy and a number of other key crops, including corn and
sesame. Separate research teams of four researchers covered each state or region. Each
team spent approximately three days and four nights in each of the nine villages in
their region.
In total, 593 interviews and over 200 focus group discussions covering approximately
1,000 participants were conducted for QSEM 5. As with previous rounds of QSEM, the
research primarily involved in-depth qualitative fieldwork using a range of research
instruments. The main approach was to conduct key informant interviews and focus
group discussions with representatives of a wide cross-section of villagers. These
included the village head and other village leaders; village elders and religious leaders;
individuals involved in decisions over aid; representatives from different livelihood
groups including farmers, fishermen, laborers and returned migrants; and people from
(potentially) vulnerable groups, including female-headed households, religious or
ethnic minorities, disabled people and the elderly. New to this round, researchers were
specifically requested to conduct a number of repeat interviews with respondents
from lower socio-economic backgrounds who had been interviewed in earlier QSEM
rounds. Researchers also documented standardized village level data for comparison
across rounds.
More than 4,600 people have participated in interviews or focus group discussions
in all five QSEM rounds.8 Across the five rounds, researchers have spent more than
six months in the target villages in each region/state documenting changes. Table 1
provides a breakdown of the number of respondents per round.

Unlike previous QSEM reports, which focused on changes between respective research
rounds, this report looks at changes over a three year period from the beginning of
QSEM in early 2012 to the most recent period of field research. The report draws on
panel data documented in each village across all five rounds, as well as findings from
previous QSEM reports. Case studies are drawn from the most recent QSEM round
on the grounds that studies from earlier rounds have already been documented in
previous reports. The exception to this is a series of case studies and village profiles
based on repeat interviews with respondents across rounds.


REPORT STRUCTURE
The report is structured as follows:
Section 2 examines changes in livelihoods since the start of QSEM, focusing on the
main livelihood categories. It also includes a focus on vulnerability and groups that are
not benefiting as much as others. Finally, the section looks at the external factors that
have most influenced livelihoods across rounds, in particular the availability of credit
and the management of land.
Section 3 looks at changes in the village context, with a particular emphasis on
social dynamics. This includes an examination of social capital at the village level and
an analysis of the factors that influence changes in social capital. It also looks at the
implications of new village governance arrangements.
Section 4 focuses on the interaction between villages and actors beyond the village
level, with particular emphasis on the evolving role of the government and assistance
provided by donors and NGOs.
Section 5 provides some conclusions and recommendations.

VILLAGE PROFILE - MAGWAY REGION
This relatively large and easily accessible village in Magway Region has a population
of almost 1,600 people in 400 households. Well over half of the households
are landless and work as laborers, close to 20 percent of families work on their
own farmland and the rest are evenly divided between subsistence fishermen,
government employees and small businesses. Laborers have more opportunities
than in most rural villages with readily available work on farms, in clay production
and as porters at the nearby river port.
Unlike other QSEM villages in the dry zone, this village has seen some positive
changes in the agriculture sector. In the first round of QSEM, only three or four
farmers grew sugar cane. The rest focused on beans and sesame in addition to
paddy. A combination of government incentives and a better market has led to
an increase in sugar cane cultivation, with over 15 farmers now combining sugar
cane with some paddy. Farmers can obtain loans of 100,000 kyat (1 lakh) per acre
from MADB which, for sugar cane, has risen from 20,000 kyat per acre in QSEM 1.
They can also receive cheap loans for fertilizer from sugar cane mills. In addition,
whereas farmers previously had to sell to government-owned mills at unfavorable
prices, since QSEM 4 they can legally sell to private mills, including one in the
village that used to operate illegally but became legal in 2014. Growing sugar cane
also requires less labor.
Small landowners have not benefited: Whereas larger farmers diversify by growing
various crops, smaller farmers have to stop growing paddy to grow sugar cane.
As the upfront costs are high and farmers need to wait longer for returns, small
farmers are not willing to take the risk. As a result, they have not seen any
improvements in their agricultural livelihoods. They have, however, benefited
from nonfarm activities, including additional income from small businesses or
through remittances from family members working in Yangon.
Fishing households have suffered as a result of the sugarcane industry. One
fisherman complained that his nets were frequently damaged from the sugarcane
mill’s waste dumped in the river and that his catch had decreased. He has since
stopped fishing and works both as a porter and a farm laborer. Although work was
available, these jobs didn’t provide the regular income he earned from fishing.
The most significant changes in livelihood options in this village are related to
migration. In early 2012, 53 villagers had migrated, mostly to Yangon, where a
businessman from the village had set up a factory. As the factory became
successful more villagers, mainly landless laborers, moved to Yangon. By the
most recent round of QSEM, 150 people had moved to work in the factory.
Another seven people decided to migrate to Thailand, following the advice of a
broker who visited the village.
Because of the size and location of this village, it has always received government
services including a high school and health clinic. In addition, the last three
years have seen the construction of a small dam and an increase in electricity
access from just over 10 percent of households in 2012 to almost 40 percent of
households in 2015.

                         INTRODUCTION
                         In the three years since QSEM began, there have been some noticeable changes in
                         people’s livelihoods. QSEM research coincided with a period of economic and political
                         reform in Myanmar. In some cases, these reforms have had significant impacts at
                         the local level. Some regions have seen observable improvements in agricultural
                         livelihoods. There has also been a significant increase in migration and a smaller but
                         still noticeable expansion in nonfarm rural businesses.
                         Not all have benefited. Some groups have found it more difficult to take advantage
                         of these emerging opportunities or have been adversely affected by reforms. Others
                         continue to face ongoing challenges or remain vulnerable to shocks that send their
                         households further into poverty.
                         This section examines how different livelihood groups have fared over the last three
                         years across different regions. The types of challenges faced by rural communities are
                         discussed. This analysis is used to develop a picture of vulnerability across the regions
                         where QSEM research was conducted. Finally, the section looks at a small number
                         of important factors that affect livelihoods, the extent to which these factors have
                         changed over time and the implications for livelihoods.


                         LIVELIHOODS
                         Across most QSEM villages the main livelihood options are farming (either as a
                         landowner or casual laborer), engagement in local nonfarm businesses and migration.

                           BOX 1: HOW HOUSEHOLDS MAKE A LIVING IN AYEYARWADY
                           AND MAGWAY REGION
                           In all interviews, researchers documented the types of work being undertaken by
                           the respondent’s household members. These were divided into three categories:
                           agricultural activities (farm income) as a landowner or casual laborer; local nonfarm
                           activities as a business owner or employed laborer; and income from household
                           members who have migrated. The results provide an insight into how households

  QSEM reports documented that land ownership often correlates closely to
  socio-economic status. Small landowners and landless households, with some
  exceptions, are likely to be poorer.
  In Ayeyarwady Region respondents across socio-economic groups were more
  likely to rely solely on income derived from agricultural activities. Casual laborers
  were, on the whole, slightly more likely to have other sources of income, in
  particular nonfarm income, than small farmers and medium farmers. At least half
  the large farmers interviewed had another source of nonfarm income.

 In Magway Region, there was a significantly greater degree of income
 diversification (with the exception of large farmers). Almost 90 percent of laborers
 interviewed had alternative sources of income, with 10 percent of those relying on
 both migrant income and nonfarm income.

                           FARMERS
                           Three years on, farmers in QSEM villages in Ayeyarwady Region and Chin and Shan
                           states were benefiting from changes in the agricultural sector, even though in the
                           early rounds of QSEM they struggled to make ends meet. The reasons behind these
                           improvements varied from area to area. In villages in other regions, returns from the
                           agricultural sector were more variable with fewer net improvements overall.

FARMERS IN CHIN, SHAN
                           In Chin State, farmers benefited from a shift to permanent cultivation. QSEM 4
AND AYEYARWADY             provided some detailed analysis of this trend. About a decade ago, farmers in a
HAVE BENEFITED FROM        number of villages covered by QSEM in Chin State began moving away from shifting
BETTER ACCESS TO           cultivation and toward permanent cultivation of vegetables in terrace plots or fruit
CREDIT AND MARKETS         trees such as oranges and Myauk Ngo.9 Over the course of the QSEM research, this
AND IMPROVEMENTS IN        trend had been identified in seven of the nine villages in Chin State, involving 50-70
AGRICULTURAL PRODUCTION.   percent of households in these villages. The move was initially driven by technical
                           support from NGOs and financial assistance through remittances from migrant
                           networks. Over the QSEM rounds, entrepreneurship is progressively playing a more
                           important role, as farmers invest after seeing the returns of others and due to the fact
                           that permanent cultivation requires less onerous labor. Government investment in
                           roads has also supported this move, providing better access to markets.
                           Despite these underlying changes, farmers in Chin still remain susceptible to weather-
                           related shocks. The season preceding QSEM 5 was an example of this. Across all nine
                           villages, farmers claimed that water shortages had affected their harvest in 2014. This,
                           combined with instances of pests affecting plantations and decreases in the price of
                           key crops such as onion, provided some challenges this season. Yet farmers remained
                           more optimistic about the future compared to three years ago.

                             “Business this year is better than last year. We can eat rice instead of porridge
                              now.” – Farmer (Male), Chin State
                             “I will change from shifting to permanent cultivation…shifting cultivation
                              can’t ensure a constant yield unless the soil quality is normal and the weather
                              conditions are normal.” – Farmer (Male), Chin State

                           In more recent rounds, farmers in Ayeyarwady Region have seen positive returns.
                           In part, this is the result of a move toward farmers growing two crops per season
                           in some villages. At the start of QSEM, only four of the nine villages covered in the
                           research were capable of producing two crops because of salt-water intrusion. A
                           number of farmers in two other villages are now capable of producing two crops,
                           and it is currently being trialed in an additional two villages. Technical assistance from
                           NGOs and improved access to credit to address the additional inputs for a summer
                           crop played an important role in this expansion. Laborers have also benefited, with
                           an estimated additional 20-30 days of employment per year in locations where a
                           summer crop is grown. These changes have also been accompanied by a perceived
                           return of soil quality to pre-Nargis days, a better international market due to the
                           increasing use of bay gyar10 variety of seeds and perceived improvements to the rice

                            Two thirds of villages in Shan State have also seen improvements in the agricultural
                            sector. As was highlighted in the Shan State Village Profile in the introductory
                            chapter of this report, these regions have responded to an increase in demand
                            for corn from China. As prices have risen, farmers have increased corn cultivation,
                            either at the expense of other crops or through clearing otherwise unused land.
                            Most of this expansion has been driven by entrepreneurship from the farmers
                            themselves with advice on markets, seeds and inputs from brokers and other
                            private sector actors.

                             crop failure as described in Box 2 below. Farmers in the other two townships in
                             Mandalay were somewhat fortunate: although the rest of the region faced water
                             shortages, rain fell at the right time for their sesame crops, saving the harvest in
                             these two townships. With the exception of an expansion into the growing of
                             sugarcane, as described in the village profile above, farmers in both Magway and
                             Rakhine faced water shortages affecting their crops. In Rakhine, this was offset
                             slightly by increases in the price farmers received for their rice harvest.

                             BOX 2: THE IMPACTS OF TOTAL CROP FAILURE IN MANDALAY
                             In one township in Mandalay Region all three QSEM villages experienced massive
                             losses on the 2014 monsoon paddy crop. The three villages have populations of
                             between 340 to 820 people, comprised mostly of farmers and agricultural casual
                             laborers.
                             Farmers used transplanting methods, moving seed plants into the paddy fields
                             partway through the growing process. Many farmers lost their crops at this
                             stage, as a lack of rain killed off the young rice plants. Other farmers transplanted
                             successfully, but continued drought meant the paddy never matured.
                            As in previous years, farmers took loans from MADB and the local cooperative
                            funds, but because of the crop failure they had difficulty paying them back when
                            the December due date arrived. The loan repayment process is rigid, and most
                            farmers do not have access to insurance services to mitigate the loss. As a result,
                            many farmers were forced to sell their working cattle to pay off the debt. This has
                            long-term effects on the ability of these farmers to return to profitable agriculture:
                            Without working cattle they are unable to plant more than subsistence paddy.
                            Buying new cattle requires either an infusion of capital, or access to cheap credit
                          LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                                                          24




                            that is not currently available. Interviews by QSEM researchers indicated that there
                            was no outside assistance provided, either by the government or from NGOs.
                            The largest effect of the crop failure was a significant increase in migration.
                            Previously, few farmers engaged in migration of any sort. Prior to the bad weather,
                            farmers rarely faced food insecurity because they were able to plant enough
                            paddy to live on and, in some cases, to sell. Now, without cattle and facing
                            continued indebtedness and food insecurity, many moved to find seasonal work as
                            casual laborers. Food insecurity became a driving force for migration. In one village,
                            over 20 percent of the population moved to find work. Only the wealthiest farmers
                            remained in the village.
                            The experience of this township highlights the vulnerability of much of the
                            farming population to one-off shocks. The failure of one harvest, and the lack of a
                            social, government, or NGO safety net, has driven a large number of farmers out of
                            their livelihood and into casual labor or migration.



                          Farmers consistently cited peak-season labor shortages as their most significant
                          constraint. Farmers reported that the price of labor is an important consideration in
                          determining whether or not to grow crops, what crops to grow and how to grow them.
                          First, there are indications that farmers are limiting their production because of labor
FARMERS VIEW THE
SHORTAGE OF LABOR         costs. This involved either allowing land to remain fallow or leasing the land to others.
IN PEAK-SEASON AS A       There were notably increased instances of the latter in the dry zone in later rounds.
SIGNIFICANT CONSTRAINT.   In Magway Region, for example, researchers identified some increase in the leasing
                          of land to third parties by larger landowners. Leasing was invariably undertaken
                          on a crop-share basis, with landowners receiving a proportion of the harvest often
                          negotiated based on the quality of the land in question. Leasing land has also provided
                          the landless with an opportunity to access Myanmar Agricultural Development Bank
                          (or MADB) loans as farmers often split the loans.
                          Second, farmers in the dry zone are varying the crops they grow, in part due to
                          labor costs. Farmers noted that the cost of labor was one factor that influenced
                          their increased planting of sugarcane in some parts of the dry zone and thanakha11
                          elsewhere. Both crops require less labor than more routine crops.12 However, both
                          also have limitations as replacement to paddy or as cash crops. Thanakha has limited
                          profitability given its long maturation period (minimum of seven years, and more than
                          30 years for high quality thanakha). Sugarcane is more profitable: in QSEM 5 farmers in
                          Magway reported prices of 32,000 kyats per metric ton. But sugarcane also requires
                          good access to transportation infrastructure and processing facilities in order to be a
                          successful cash crop.
                          Finally, there have been some increases in small-scale mechanization to reduce reliance
                          on labor. As was discussed in some detail in QSEM 4, there was a small but noticeable
                          increase in the use of small-scale agricultural machinery with significant variation
                          across regions.13 The increase was most noticeable in QSEM villages in Shan and
                          Ayeyarwady, the former being driven by private investment, whereas in the delta NGO
                          programs and improved access to credit played an important role.

LABORERS

  ”There are more casual jobs for us this year. Also there are even job opportunities
   such as cutting wood to use as the raw materials for making bricks.” –
   Casual laborer (Male), Chin State
   “It is difficult to find labor. We even ask the elderly and children if they can work.” –
   Large farmer (Male), Magway Region

In most regions, wages earned by casual laborers have increased across rounds. As
the 2013 LIFT Household Survey makes clear, approximately half of the population in
surveyed regions is landless, with the figures rising to two-thirds in coastal areas.14 Casual
agricultural labor is the main source of income for 15.7 percent of households across
regions,15 with less variation between regions. Table 2 to Table 5 below show wages
respondents claim to have received or paid at peak and non-peak times across QSEM
rounds for all areas except for Chin State. 16 As tables 2 and 3 indicate, there has been a
steady increase in the daily wage rates across rounds for both peak and non-peak times.

The wage increases are equally applicable to women. Some tasks were distinctly
divided on gender grounds, such as plowing (male) and weeding (female), while others,
such as harvesting and post-harvest activities, involved both men and women equally.
Table 4 and Table 5 show women received comparable wage increases to men in
QSEM villages across all five rounds.



13. A qualitative methodology such as that used by QSEM is not ideally placed to capture changes in use of machinery.
The approach does not offer a reliable method of measuring ownership of machinery but, instead, is based on the
perceptions of respondents of increases in ownership across rounds. The responses, though, are consistent with findings
in LIFT’s Household Survey 2013, which showed increases in ownership of, in particular, power tillers in LIFT areas from
4.4 percent in of households in 2011 to 6.6 percent in 2013.
14. In 2013, 52.5 percent of households in LIFT villages and 55.9 percent in control villages owned land. Regional
variations were significant with 75.6 percent owning land in hilly zones, 63.5 percent in the dry zone and 34 percent in
the delta and coastal areas.
15. Casual labor was the primary source of income for 18.5 percent of households in the dry zone, 17.5 percent in coast
and delta areas and 11 percent in the hilly zone.
16. For a variety of reasons, analysis of wage data in Chin State is less reliable. First, access to land is more readily
available and as a result the number of households relying on income from casual agricultural labor is significantly
lower. Agricultural labor is also relatively more likely to be undertaken through kinship networks, limiting the value of
quantifying payment in monetary terms. The data that was collected collated agricultural and non-agricultural (e.g.:
work on government infrastructure projects) labor in Chin State, providing for significant variation across daily rates.

  “The poor (laborers) become well off and the well-off (farmers) become poor.” –
   Medium farmer (Male), Mandalay Region

In some areas these increases in wage conditions have resulted in some improvements
for casual laborers. Box 3 below provides the example of a casual laborer in Magway
Region who has benefited from the stronger negotiating position of laborers in his
village. However, these improvements are dependent on a steady supply of labor
opportunities throughout the year.



  BOX 3: CASUAL LABORERS MAKING ENDS MEET IN MAGWAY REGION
 A landless laborer, 52, and his wife, 50, along with their two children aged 12 and 7,
 live on the edge of a remote village in Magway Region. The family was identified
 by village leaders as one of the poorest in the village.
  Both husband and wife work as laborers, planting or harvesting rice paddy or
  sesame, or collecting firewood or jaggery.17 Although employment opportunities
  are sufficient, in the lean season of May and June the family sometimes faced
  difficulty with food security. Twice in recent years they have had to borrow on their
  future labor for rice from one of the larger farmers.
 The family previously lived in a village nearby where they owned 10 acres. They
 incurred high levels of debt and when, about five year ago, a fire destroyed most
 of that year’s sugarcane crop and the husband’s father was struck ill with malaria,
 they were forced to sell the land just to cover their basic needs. They attempted
 to subsist on casual labor, but had insufficient work to make ends meet. Four years
 ago they moved to this village, the wife’s birthplace.
  In recent years they have seen their situation improve somewhat. Through the
  wife’s family network, they were able to access small amounts of capital and initial
  casual labor opportunities through which they established their own network. The
  husband was able to develop a network with other casual laborers. This improved

                                    his access to regular work and strengthened his negotiating position with farmers.
                                    As farmers in the village are able to grow a number of different crops, laborers
                                    have access to sufficient paid days of work throughout the year. The man earns
                                    daily wages of 3000 – 4000 kyats on a fairly regular basis. In the lean summer
                                    months they borrow small amounts from friends to cover basic needs. They now
                                    also access more formal credit for investing purposes: last year, with a loan from
                                    the revolving fund, they purchased a pig, which was sold this year for 2 lakh kyats.
                                    They hope that they will soon be able to make larger livestock investments.


                                    “We have no savings for a rainy day, as we have as many days with no income as
                                     we do with work.” – Casual laborer (Male), Ayeyarwady Region

                                    “Previously, if you had 4000 kyats, you could buy one viss of pork, which was
                                     enough to feed a whole family for a day. At present, if you have 4000 kyats you
                                     can get only about half a viss of pork.” –

OVER THE COURSE OF A YEAR.        the increases in wages need to be placed in the context of increased price inflation
                                  affecting living costs for laborers. As a result laborers still need to either identify
                                  secondary income sources, as in Box 3 above where the laborer commenced investing
                                  in livestock, or find other jobs, such as through migration.
                                  Farmers believe that a consequence of laborers looking for alternative sources of
                                  income is that it reduces the overall supply of labor resulting in increased pressure to

                           pay higher wages. It would appear that in many QSEM villages, farmers are reaching
                           a point where they can no longer meet wage demands while still making a profit. In
                           response, both farmers and laborers have had to seek increasingly innovative ways
                           to reach labor agreements. Across rounds, researchers heard of different approaches
                           farmers are using to secure casual labor. Table 6 provides some examples. Initial efforts
                           focused on changing the modes of payment from indebted labor to upfront payments.
                           This progressed to payments based on output rather than daily rates. In the most
                           recent rounds, examples of farmers offering incentives in the form of co-ownership of
                           livestock were identified in Ayeyarwady and the dry zone. These examples highlight
                           the stronger bargaining power of casual labor.


                           NONFARM BUSINESS
                           A majority of respondents interviewed had some form of income from nonfarm
                           activities in their households. Using figures from QSEM 4, of the almost 500 people
                           interviewed, 57 percent of households had income streams from local, nonfarm
                           enterprises. Levels of reliance on nonfarm income vary significantly both across regions
                           and across socio-economic groups.
                           The types of nonfarm enterprises have not changed significantly over time. QSEM 1
                           identified the most common examples as livestock, food production (for example
                           jaggery and sugar processing) or cottage industries relying on available natural
                           resources (charcoal, brick-making and the like) as well as small businesses such as
                           money lending or small shops. These enterprises remained the main types of nonfarm
                           business activities across all rounds. Businesses that have emerged more recently
                           in some villages include motorbike taxis, solar panel distribution and vocational
                           occupations such as hairdressing or tailoring.

                             “People in the village are doing better. They can buy TVs and solar panels. Mainly
                              it is because of charcoal makers providing jobs for laborers. They have regular
                              income. The village is more developed since the charcoal-making began.” –
                              Village leader, Rakhine State

                           Researchers identified a steady increase in participation in nonfarm enterprises. Some
                           villages, benefiting from improved markets for specific goods, saw dramatic increases

                           A combination of factors is driving the increase in nonfarm enterprises. First,
                           remittances have consistently played a role in enabling households to establish
                           nonfarm businesses. As discussed in the section below, increased migration and
                           remittances result in more funds to invest in local opportunities.Better access to
                           credit has also had an impact. NGO programs providing microfinance and revolving
                           funds have played a role, as described in Box 4 below. Increasingly, this is being
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                                                          29




complemented through expanded government programs such as the Mya Sein
Yaung (or “Emerald Green”) program.18 These forms of credit have been particularly
important in providing poorer villagers with opportunities to invest in nonfarm
enterprises where they would otherwise not have had the means to do so. The
breeding of livestock was one activity that saw observable changes in the most recent
round as a result of improved access to credit. In particular, across Magway, Mandalay
and Rakhine, researchers documented more households investing in goats and, to a
lesser extent, pigs, with these livestock viewed as being able to provide more rapid
returns. Commercial credit, including the availability of installment plans for purchasing
income-generating items such as machinery or motorbikes, has also been beneficial.



  BOX 4: USING MICROFINANCE TO BUILD SMALL BUSINESSES IN MANDALAY
  AND RAKHINE
  A family in Mandalay Region has eleven members, seven of whom are old enough
  to work. Several daughters are hairdressers while other members are casual
  laborers. In 2010, the family got a loan from an NGO allowing them to buy two
  goats. Since then they have grown the business to approximately 50 goats, selling
  between 10 and 15 goats each year, each for up to 150,000 kyats. In 2014, this
  generated 2.5 million kyats in income for the family. The business has become the
  head of household’s sole occupation.
  The family generally uses the children’s income from hairdressing work and
  casual labor for their daily expenses, allowing them to reinvest their income
  from the livestock business. In 2013 they bought pastureland for their goats
  (having previously used communal land) and in 2014 renovated their house. This
  household, the most successful example of the NGO’s project in the village, is now
  seen as a role model for other villagers who are increasingly turning to livestock as
  a supplementary livelihood.
  A family from Ayeyarwady moved to a QSEM village in Rakhine in 2012 so the
  husband could work in illegal logging, shipping trees back to Ayeyarwady. The

  She works as a casual laborer in paddy fields.
  Two years ago she received a loan of 80,000 kyats from a local NGO at 2 percent
  interest. Using the funds she opened a small shop. She was able to pay off the loan
  in 10 months using the profits from the shop and her wages from laboring. Last
  year she took another loan, this time at 3 percent interest. Combining this money
  with savings she opened a rice bank, lending rice to nearby villages. In the eight
  to nine months before harvest she lent 100 tins19 of rice valued at 200,000 kyats.
  As the price of rice at harvest was 4,200 kyats per tin this has provided a healthy
  return on the loan. As an ethnic Bamar she wants to use her savings to leave
  Rakhine and move her family back to her native village in Ayeyarwady.

                     ”They called tenders before. But then all tenders were already settled within
                      networks. We couldn’t participate before, but now it is more transparent to call
                      for tender process.” – Medium farmer (Male), Magway Region
                     “At the present, government gives permission to the VTA [to organize] tender
                      processes that have a budget below one hundred lakh. The advantage of
                      getting that permission is the villagers can get more job opportunities.” –
                      Small farmer (Male), Chin State

Finally, there are some examples that government investment in public works has
created nonfarm opportunities in a small number of villages. Since early 2014, increased
government rural development projects have been perceived by respondents as a
factor contributing to nonfarm business opportunities. In a small number of villages,
local businesses have benefited directly: A villager in Magway Region said that he was
able to obtain government contracts to supply rocks for a road construction. Similarly,
in Rakhine a village benefited from being able to sell meals to construction workers
working on a local road. Some respondents also identified more indirect benefits: in
Chin State in particular, respondents have identified the benefits from better access to
markets as a result of government investment in roads, as well as government salary
increases resulting in increased spending and a better market for products.


MIGRATION

                     “The migrants come back and show off. Then the ones who envy them also
                      migrate.” – Small farmer (Male), Ayeyarwady Region
                     “I told my two daughters, who migrated, to return. But they never return as
                      they believe the income of farming is not enough to feed their children.” –
                      Small farmer (Female), Chin State

There has been a consistent increase in migration levels across regions since 2012.

across the five rounds. 20 Although the figures are estimates, they indicate an increase

                                  in migration in all regions between 2012 and 2015. The biggest increases were in
                                  villages in Mandalay (from 10.2 percent to 16 percent) and in Ayeyarwady and Chin
                                  (both from approximately 5 percent to 10 percent). The villages in Rakhine and Shan
                                  states had the lowest migration levels overall and the smallest change: Rakhine increased
                                  from 2.5 percent to 4.1 percent while Shan increased from 0.8 percent to 2.6 percent.

                                      “Nearly everyone in the village migrated to another area this year because of the

                                  As Figure 6 above highlights, vulnerability in a small number of villages can influence
                                  the overall numbers in some regions. The increase in Mandalay Region since QSEM 4
                                  is one example. Two of the nine QSEM villages drove this major increase: In one village,
                                  crop failure led to a sharp increase in people seeking work elsewhere. The other village

                                  by respondents in interviews.21 Whereas people from states prioritized international
                                  migration, respondents from regions opted more for long-term domestic migration
                                  and, to a lesser extent, seasonal migration. The variation is driven both by a history of
                                  international migration from states and the proximity to urban areas driving long-term
                                  domestic migration from the regions.

                                  Gender is a determinant of migration patterns. Overall, women were less inclined to
                                  migrate then men. The vast majority of women who migrated undertook long-term
                                  domestic migration, primarily looking for work in factories in the manufacturing
                                  sector in urban areas of Yangon and, to a lesser extent, Mandalay. The main exceptions
                                  were women from Shan and Chin States, who migrated internationally either as




                                   21. Researchers documented whether respondents had family members who had migrated and the type of migration
                                   of those family members. Overall numbers as a percentage are likely to be higher than actual migration levels as
                                   respondents with migrants in their household are oversampled to document their livelihood situation.
                                   22. In Table 7, “Number of migrants” refers to the number of people identified to have migrated from households where
                                   a key informant was interviewed. As there are instances of more than two people migrating from the same household,
                                   the proportion of key informants with family migrating is not equal to the proportion of migrants by the number of key
                                   informant interviews.

                             on pre-existing migration patterns and geographic locations. Women from Chin State
                             moved to Malaysia, the United States and Singapore, whereas women in Shan State
                             predominantly migrated to Thailand.
                             Migration patterns vary significantly by socio-economic group. Figure 7 below provides
                             information on the types of migration undertaken by different socio-economic groups.
                             The most significant variation exists in domestic long-term and international migration.
                             Casual laborers strongly favored domestic long-term migration whereas landowners,
                             whether small, medium or large, were equally likely to turn to international migration.

                             more considerable. Casual laborers, on the other hand, view the benefits of migration
                             relative to the employment opportunities available to them locally in their village. The
                             incentives are less about the size of potential remittances and more about reducing
                             burdens on households or attempting to make incremental improvements to living
                             standards. Domestic migration opportunities therefore become more attractive.

  BOX 5: REMITTANCES ENABLE A FAMILY IN MANDALAY TO PURCHASE LAND
  In a village in Mandalay Region, approximately 50 people have migrated, either
  to Mandalay to work in a brick kiln, or internationally to Malaysia. The husband of
  one interviewee is in Malaysia, where he works in the livestock industry. While he is
  away his wife continues to work in small-scale agriculture and as a casual laborer in
  the village. Their two children attend school.
  When interviewed in QSEM 1, the family owed two million kyats for migration
  expenses. For the first few years the husband would send 200,000 kyat in
  remittances most months and this was used to repay the debt. After several years
  later the debt had been fully paid off. Over the past year, the husband has been
  remitting up to 1.5 million kyats every five to six months. His wife used this money
  to purchase five acres of agricultural land (1.35 million kyats) and a house (1.5
  million kyats). She continues to work to support herself and the children, saving
  the remittances for future investments.
  Before moving to Malaysia the head of household worked as a goat herder. His
  work overseas is still with livestock. The decision to move overseas was driven by
  a lack of opportunities to improve their lot domestically. The head of household
  realized wages would be higher internationally. He has succeeded in turning his
  family from landless to landowning, and has generated significant capital that can
  be invested in a business or agriculture upon his return.



  “It is not Malay anymore. Now it is A-Ma-Lay (Myanmar expression for a negative
   expression similar to ‘oh my God’).” –

   “We have no interest in migrating to Thailand. We can become rich here if we eat
  two meals in place of three meals a day.” – Small farmer (Male), Shan State

Despite high returns, there are continued concerns over the risks involved in
international migration. In the early rounds of QSEM, examples of people facing
negative international migration experiences were invariably anecdotal, with
respondents repeating stories they had heard from neighboring villages. Across
locations it is becoming increasingly common for researchers to hear directly from
respondents or their families descriptions of incidences of failed migration. Examples in
this round included households in a village in Rakhine State, who reported they were

though the families were not aware in which city the men were located. In Magway
Region, 20 villagers used a freelance agent to migrate to Thailand. They were stopped
by the police at the bus terminal and returned to their village. These stories highlight
the risks of using informal brokers in international migration. The increased risks,
combined with improved local economic opportunities, have also led to a perceived
reduced interest in international migration, in particular in Shan State. Rakhine State
was an exception: some youth prioritized illegal international migration as it was seen
to offer more flexibility and carried a less onerous debt burden compared to migrating
through legal means, such as through legitimate brokers.

                                                      QSEM research across rounds has identified a range of ongoing problems and shocks
                                                      with varying negative impacts on livelihoods for rural communities. This section

                                                      Three significant persistent problems were identified in QSEM: the negative impact
                                                      of ongoing weather variation across seasons, worsening conditions for fishermen (in
                                                      particular small and subsistence fishermen) and land degradation in a small number of
                                                      villages. In each round, researchers documented shocks identified by villagers that had

                            As the figure above identifies, a majority of villages faced adverse weather conditions
                            in QSEM 5.24 This included villages in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady where houses were
                            damaged by storms. In Shan State, five villages faced unusual rainfall patterns, with
                            rain falling shortly after planting of a corn crop resulting in a small number of farmers
                            having to replant their crops.

                            The degree of severity of these weather related problems varied across regions and
                            rounds. Research in 2012 and 2013 highlighted significant negative consequences
                            for livelihood outcomes as a result of poor weather conditions across a number of
                            regions. Conditions improved somewhat for the monsoon harvest in late 2013, with
                            the exception of areas in the dry zone that continued to face difficulties. Although
                            weather-related incidents were not as widespread across villages in QSEM 5 as they
                            were in earlier rounds, several villages felt significant impacts. Researchers were asked
                            to rank the impacts of shocks in QSEM 5 on a scale of one to five. The drought felt in
                            one township in Mandalay was identified as having the most significant impact, rating
                            five, as it destroyed paddy crops across all three villages visited.25 Similarly, the lack




                              24. In earlier rounds of QSEM, labor shortages were identified as a significant shock across a number of regions. Labor
                              was examined in this context in those rounds. Given that casual labor comprises the primary income source for at least a
                              third of households across a number of regions covered by QSEM, issues relating to labor are no longer covered from the
                              perspective of shocks but rather are dealt with as a livelihood option in itself.
                              25. It is understood that a number of townships in Mandalay faced significant rainfall shortages last season, including in
                              the remaining two townships covered by QSEM. However, in those townships some rain fell at exactly the right time for
                              the sesame harvest, resulting in limited impact on agricultural returns.

                             of rainfall in Chin State (see Box 6 below) affected all villages reasonably significantly
                             (rating four), impacting both crop production and access to drinking water for
                             household use. Although variable rainfall affected most villages in Rakhine State, it had
                             less impact because small decreases in paddy harvest were offset with increases in price.



                               BOX 6: A LACK OF RAIN AND LOWER ONION PRICES CREATE HARDSHIP FOR A
                               FAMILY IN CHIN STATE
                               The combination of a lack of rainfall and low market prices for onions has caused
                               difficulties for a household in Chin State over the last twelve months. Last harvest,
                               because the price of onion and garlic was high (between 300 and 500 kyats per
                               viss) the family grew a full acre of onions. They also sold 10 pigs for additional
                               income and received a good return from their store due to limited competition
                               and demand from workers rebuilding the township road.
                               This year, however, has not been as successful. Firstly, the onion price dropped to
                               200 kyats per viss. In addition, a lack of rain meant they were only able to grow
                               one quarter of an acre of onions. This caused a dramatic drop in their income,
                               worsened by a decline in their shop income as the completed road repair enabled
                               people to shop in the township and as several new shops opened in the village.
                               As more farmers invested in pigs, it also became more difficult to find feed for
                               livestock.
                               As a result of these shocks, and to deal with health issues, the household borrowed
                               200,000 kyats, double what it had in the previous year. They borrowed partly from
                               relatives (0 percent interest) and partly from the local UNDP sponsored community
                               fund (2 percent interest). The family head emphasized the decline in the onion
                               market combined with the lack of rain as the most damaging shocks.

are no longer able to compete against medium- and large-scale fishermen and, as
a result, their fish catch has decreased to the point where it is no longer profitable.
In Ayeyarwady Region, as explained in Box 7 below, a combination of worsening
quality of catch for important types of fish such as hilsa and less oversight of fisheries
management as a result of changes to regional regulations has affected subsistence
fishermen.



  BOX 7: CHANGES TO FISHING REGULATIONS AFFECT FISHERMEN IN THE DELTA
  In two townships in Ayeyarwady Region, villagers perceived a recent relaxation of
  fishing regulations as having negative impacts on their livelihoods.
  According to the freshwater fishing laws set in place by the regional government,
  fishermen using certain types of nets require licenses, which cost between 3,000
  and 5,000 kyat. Previously, this regulation was enforced by township level officials
  visiting villages. Since late 2012 there has been a significant reduction in village
  visits, with villagers reporting they only see township officials when they have
  been ordered to visit by a higher authority.
  As a result, respondents in one village reported that outside fishermen were
  fishing in their village more frequently and were said to be using illegal fishing
  methods such as chemical poisons and electric shocks. When confronted, these
  outside fishermen claimed to have paid for licenses. In interviews, local fishermen
  attributed their declining catches to the presence of outsiders and the illegal
  methods being used.
  In another village, similar reports of chemical usage led to some small fishermen
  leaving their livelihoods for casual labor jobs. Villagers also noted that chemicals
  used for fishing were affecting livestock grazing along the riverbank.



Fishermen have responded to this decline in livelihoods in several ways. As identified
in the profile at the beginning of this section, a number of villagers have increasingly
turned to either agricultural casual labor or nonfarm businesses as alternative sources
of income. In Rakhine State, where subsistence fishing overlaps with a commercial
fishing industry, some small-scale fishermen have become low-skilled and low-paid
casual laborers for larger-scale operations. Some have also attempted to overcome
the challenges by investing in better equipment. This approach is high-risk, with few
examples of fishermen succeeding.
Potentially linked to climate change, a small number of villages have seen deterioration
of their natural environment creating hardship for some villagers. The decline in fish
catch for subsistence fishermen in Magway Region, for example, has primarily been
the result of deteriorating conditions in the river system. In another village in Magway
Region, erosion has progressively reduced access to alluvial land. The land is allocated
in plots to villagers and provides an important income source through cash crops.
However, the amount of land available has decreased from approximately 250 acres in
LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                            38




2012 to fewer than 60 acres now as a result of current changes in the Ayeyarwady River.
Similarly, farmers in several villages close to the coast in Rakhine State believe their land
has become progressively more impacted by saltwater intrusion since 2012.
Within villages there are households that are more susceptible to shocks or have less
capacity to benefit from the changes taking place in rural Myanmar. The 2013 LIFT
Household Survey identified that better off households were more likely to claim
improved incomes over the previous two years.26 However, certain factors acted as
constraints on efforts by households to improve their living standards. Households
affected by ill health or disability, or those with aging family members, face particular
challenges. Box 8 below provides examples of the impact of health problems on a
household’s capacity to earn income and on the consequences of shocks for the
poorest villagers.



  BOX 8: CHALLENGES FACED BY THE POOREST OF THE POOR
  A household in Chin State has two working-age adults, four children and an elderly
  family member. The two adults have poor eyesight, which greatly reduces their
  ability to work. Last year, with the help of several villagers, they harvested enough
  corn to provide for just two weeks of consumption. They also worked at reduced
  rates for other farmers and carried firewood. But their poor eyesight limited the
  amount they were able to work to approximately one month.
    “We receive 1500 –2000 kyats per day. Some days we have to accept 1000 kyats.
     While others get 2000 –3000 kyats per day. We can’t work like others because
     of our poor eyesight.” – Disabled casual laborer, Chin State.
  This family is the most vulnerable in the village. They receive no government
  assistance and find it difficult to access donor programs. Instead, they rely on the
  good will of villagers. In the dry months, when food is frequently in short supply,
  they depend on contributions from relatives. Their status limits their ability to
  access formal credit. However, the local grocery store allows them to buy items on
  credit in the more critical months.
  For another, less well-off family in Shan State, a legal case has sent them spiraling
  further into poverty. This family has four children. The family’s main income comes
  from gathering food and wood from the forest and casual labor. Last year the
  eldest daughter was caught stealing jewelry and cash from another house in the
  village. The village administrator, after consulting with elders, reported the matter
  to the village tract administrator, who called the police. The 15-year-old girl was
  arrested and sentenced to two years at a youth reformation school in Mandalay.
  The family has had to find money to pay for costs involved in going to hearings
  following the girl’s arrest and to provide her with support over the period. The
  financial costs, in addition to the stress that the incident has created, have resulted
  in the family taking two of their children out of school. The boy, who was just
  twelve years old, wanted to move to a city to find money to help his family. Instead,
  he is now helping his father gather produce from the forest. Since the arrest,
  villagers claim the father has more of a problem with drinking alcohol and this is
  disturbing others in the village.

  “We don’t eat any expensive food at all. Salt, corn and steamed beans is our
   regular meal. If there is no food we have to ask our relatives. But, we do not
   always dare to ask them every day. So on some days we have to drink to fill our
   stomachs.” – Casual laborer (Male), Chin State

In summary, taking advantage of the developments occurring in the rural economy
requires access to capital, labor or vocational/technical skills. Development of the rural
economy was being fuelled primarily by a combination of traditional investment in
agriculture combined with increased efforts to diversify into local nonfarm businesses
and migration. Some villages face context specific constraints. Within villages,
households that face the greatest challenges are those that lack access to capital to
invest in nonfarm businesses or better regulated migration strategies, as well as those
with fewer family members, who are therefore less able to participate in migration,
benefit from demand for labor or are forced to pay higher agricultural labor premiums.


CHANGES IN INFLUENCING FACTORS
Access to credit and land management issues have seen the most prominent changes
among external factors that influence livelihoods. In early rounds, QSEM reported on
a range of external factors that influence how people earn a living in rural Myanmar.
As rounds have progressed, the focus has narrowed. The research has increasingly
placed less emphasis on issues relating to markets, brokers, machinery and the price
of inputs and outputs as consistent trends in these areas have been less noticeable.27
However, two issues were consistently identified as being of significance and subject
to important changes across the entire period of research: access to credit and land
management.


ACCESS TO CREDIT

  “Only the people sleep, but the interest on loans never sleeps” –
   Casual laborer (Female), Mandalay Region
  “Before, if we wanted to take a loan, we had to pay an 8 percent to 10 percent
   interest rate. Now we have UNDP loans which have only a 2 percent interest rate.
   It is much better for us” – Medium farmer (Male), Shan State

Since research began in early 2012, important increases in availability of credit and
decreases in interest rates have led to positive outcomes for rural communities. In
QSEM 1 a lack of credit supply was seen as a reason for “villagers overwhelmingly
borrowing from informal moneylenders at very high interest rates.” 28
Over time, reliance on private moneylenders has diminished as at first NGOs and
then the government progressively increased access to alternative sources of credit.
Through microfinance and revolving fund programs, donors and NGOs were at the
forefront of providing improved access to credit. Across research locations, examples


26. The Household Survey (p50) states: “The higher the income households had, the more likely they were to declare
that their average income had increased over the past 12 months. This was the case for 36 percent of households
with an average monthly income of over 100,000 kyat per month, compared to 24 percent of those earning between
50,000 –1000,000 kyat and 18 percent of those earning less than 50,000 kyat per month (p<.001).”
27. Qualitative research, particularly at the village level, is also not particularly well suited to monitoring some of these
issues, which are reliant on documenting variations in prices and supply and often require research above the village
level.

                          were identified of villagers, often landless or casual laborers such as those identified
                          in Box 4 above, using financing from these credit sources to invest in productive
                          small enterprises or livestock. More recently, the Government of Myanmar has been
                          increasing its role in providing credit both through the MADB and government-
IMPROVEMENTS IN ACCESS    managed cooperative funds.
TO CREDIT, DRIVEN BY
BOTH GOVERNMENT AND      Perhaps the most noticeable changes have occurred in MADB financing provisions.
NGO INVESTMENTS, HAVE    A number of changes have occurred relating to MADB loans. Firstly, as Figure 10
PRODUCED TANGIBLE        below shows, the proportion of villages where MADB loans were being accessed
POSITIVE OUTCOMES FOR    has increased across rounds.29 Farmers were only able to access MADB loans in
RURAL COMMUNITIES.       approximately 40 percent of villages during QSEM 1 and QSEM 2. In QSEM 5, this had
                         increased to approximately 70 percent of villages. Policy changes that led to increased
                         demand for loans from farmers were the primary cause. Secondly, MADB started
                         providing different loan sizes depending on the type of crops grown, enabling farmers
                         to borrow more. Loans for rice farmers increased from 20,000 kyat per acre to 100,000
                         kyat per acre. However, MADB coverage and demand for their services remains limited
                         in Chin State and, to a lesser degree, Shan State. Chin State farmers show limited
                         participation largely because of low loan amounts for their primary crop. MADB
                         provides only 20,000 kyats per acre for corn, barely covering transportation costs to
                         access the loans.

                         The growth in demand for MADB loans is also changing how loans are accessed.
                         Previous rounds of QSEM reported that some large landowners were registering their
                         land in 10-acre blocks under the names of different household members, including



                                29. Note that only 36 villages were covered per round in QSEM rounds 1-3, whereas all 54 villages were covered in QSEM
                                4 and QSEM 5.

women, to overcome MADB restrictions limiting loans to 10 acres per borrower. More
recently, in Magway Region there was evidence that landowners and laborers were
entering into tenancy agreements enabling casual laborers to access MADB loans
in return for a guarantee of their labor. In Ayeyarwady Region, in response to a large
number of borrowers failing to pay back loans and the limited effectiveness of group
lending mechanisms, as reported in QSEM 3, the MADB has changed practices linking
loans to land registration (see Box 9 below).



  BOX 9: MADB CHANGES ITS LENDING PRACTICES IN AYEYARWADY REGION
  In 2014 MADB changed the process by which it lends, moving from a group loan
  structure to individual loans for qualifying farmers. MADB administrators in all three
  townships covered by QSEM in the delta reported this change, noting it was in
  response to repayment issues in 2013.
  Traditionally, MADB distributed loans to collective groups of farmers; groups of 10
  (a “big collective”) or five (a “small collective) received a loan and the obligation
  was to the group. Group members were not able to obtain subsequent loans until
  all other members had repaid prior loans.
  Until 2012, most farmers successfully repaid loans on time. However, in 2013, a
  significant number of farmers with monsoon-season paddy crops defaulted,
  resulting in a large number of farmers in good standing also losing access to future
  credit. In addition, the implementation of land registration meant that farmers had
  identifiable assets against which loans could be leveraged.
  The Ayeyarwady regional government ordered a change to the township-level
  MADB distribution system. Farmers in good standing regarding previous group
  loans and with registered land are now able to receive new loans individually. The
  process of loan distribution was delayed this year as a result of this change being
  implemented, but the new focus on individuals is likely to benefit farmers in
  coming growing seasons.



There is some evidence to suggest that more remote villages have less access to credit
sources. As described in the methodology, QSEM villages were selected on the basis
of proximity to urban centers.30 Researchers in QSEM 5 calculated the types of credit
available in each village.31 Table 8 below shows that in all regions/states (with the
exception of Ayeyarwady) ‘accessible’ villages closer to urban areas were more likely
to have access to different sources of credit. More remote villages had less access to
different sources of credit. It is interesting to note that in the research ‘sources of credit’
was the category that showed the most consistent variation across the three types of
village.




30. Villagers closer to urban centers and with better road or infrastructure access are classified as ‘A’ villages. ‘B’ villages
are average villages, while ‘C’ villages are more remote or less accessible.
31. Some care needs to be used in confirming these figures. Sources of credit vary at the household level, whereas
researchers primarily asked village leaders for this information. It is possible that not all sources are captured, or that
village leaders vary in their approach to documenting sources. Qualitative research is not always the best method for
capturing information on household approaches to debt and savings.

interest rates for government credit sources, MADB and cooperatives. The increased
availability of credit has also resulted in less reliance on informal credit sources, such
as personal relationships, leading to a decrease in interest rates for informal sources as
well.

  “It looks like they are taking a loan from here and paying off the debt there” –
   Small farmer (Male), Mandalay Region

Indications are that debt burdens were not as onerous as they were in previous rounds
of QSEM. Qualitative research is not particularly suited to measuring and tracking debt
levels. However, across rounds researchers have found that the increased availability
of credit has not necessarily correlated to larger debt burdens for respondents. In part,
this is because agricultural outcomes in more recent rounds of QSEM have been largely
positive, enabling rural households to pay back debt. Farmers in Ayeyarwady Region,
for example, reported that in 2014 they were for the first time able to start paying
down debt incurred after Cyclone Nargis in 2008. In contrast, those areas where debt
burdens had increased for poorer households, in particular Rakhine State and Chin
State, were also those facing continued weather-related problems.


LAND
Land management is another area that has seen significant changes over the last three
years, although practical ramifications are less observable at this stage. The importance
that the Government of Myanmar is placing on land management in this reform period
is highlighted by the passage of new land laws in 2012. The land laws32 aim to increase
security of tenure for farmers. The Farmland Law provides farmers with private use
rights – enabling them to formally undertake transactions – and established a land
registration and certification system. The government’s subsequent prioritization of
the drafting of a National Land Use Policy to further clarify and harmonize existing laws
further highlights the political importance of land reform in Myanmar. 33
The reforms have yet to lead to significant changes in practice, providing important
insights into how reform processes play out at the local level. Previous QSEM research
rounds, in particular QSEM 1 and QSEM 2, documented levels of land ownership
and variations in ownership patterns across research areas. In more recent rounds,
the research has focused in more detail on the implications of land registration. The
following section examines changes in perceptions of security of land tenure following
land registration and the extent to which those changes have affected practices in
land management. Although the land registration process itself was a visible outcome
for villagers, land management approaches have overall yet to change.

Law.

Civil society and other interest groups were invited to comment on the draft policy. See GRET, “Myanmar Land Briefing:

                          Land registration was completed reasonably effectively across most QSEM villages.
                          Table 9 shows progress in land registration from QSEM 3 to the most recent round
                          of research. In half of regions/states land registration was completed effectively in
                          a short period of time. In Ayeyarwady and Mandalay regions, all agricultural land
                          was registered across the nine villages in each region. In Chin State, paddy land was
                          registered across all villages. However, as the quote above indicates, there was less
                          interest in registering other types of land.

                          Political and contextual factors have hindered land registration in some areas

                          conducted in some townships in Rakhine State and Magway Region because of

                          QSEM 4 was observed in one of the townships in Rakhine State, where the government
                          was completing land registration on a village-by-village basis, focusing first on villages
                          where there was no ownership of land by the Muslim population.
                          Registration in Shan State is constrained more by bureaucratic rather than political
                          obstacles, as well as the challenges of service delivery in conflict areas. Registration
                          has commenced in each of the three townships in Shan State covered by QSEM, but
                          applies to only one or two of the three QSEM villages in each township. Across rounds,
                          respondents noted that the inconsistency was the result of a combination of factors,
                          including alleged limited capacity within DALMS and concerns over safety in areas
                          affected by conflict. These factors, combined with complaints about bribe requests
                          as documented in Box 10, indicate bureaucratic shortcomings in the land registration
                          process in Shan State. Given that two of the townships were affected by conflict in
                          the past, the research also highlights the challenge of providing services, including
                          delivering key national-level reforms, in conflict areas.

  BOX 10: DEMANDS FOR ILLEGAL FEES FOR REGISTERING LAND IN SHAN STATE
  In May 2014, the Land Record Department arrived in a village in Shan State to
  begin the land registration process. In interviews, several villagers reported that
  staff from the department demanded illegal payments for services, such as
  documenting names of actual owners on certificates rather than previous owners
  if ownership had changed as a result of death or selling of the land.
  One villager reported that he had purchased an acre of land from a fellow villager
  five years previously under traditional land transfer methods and with the village
  head as a witness. When he applied for land registration, he was told he also
  needed to apply to change the name on the land certificate and that it would cost
  120,000 kyats. He was unable to pay the fee and did not register the land.
  The villager complained to a relative, an influential and well-off farmer with strong
  civil society networks. The relative challenged the officials, stating that the Shan
  people wanted to obey the land use law but would not pay illegal fees. According
  to the villager, his relative demanded an official receipt from the officials for any
  payment that was required. The officials refused to do so and left the village
  without completing land registration.



PERCEPTIONS OF LAND OWNERSHIP

  “It is difficult to say that it is your land if you do not register it according to the new
   policy.” – Village tract clerk (Male), Chin State

Government policy changes in recent years, including the implementation of land
registration, have resulted in increased confidence in land security. Early rounds of
QSEM identified concerns about the security of tenured farmland, consistent with
previous concerns about land confiscation. QSEM 1 documented both new cases of
land confiscation in QSEM villages and tensions relating to long-standing confiscation
that had yet to be resolved.
These concerns have started to abate. A combination of perceived stronger ownership
rights as a result of land registration and a decline in actual examples of land
confiscation in recent rounds has resulted in increased confidence in land security. The
transfer of ownership of previously confiscated land back to original owners also had
an effect. The village profile from Shan State at the beginning of Section 1 provides
an example: One of the three military bases responsible for confiscating land in that
village under the previous government returned 60 acres of land. Villagers were made
to sign agreements certifying that the military had been legitimate owners of the land.
Despite this condition, villagers reported being content with the development.

  “Magway used to be called "a big oil pot", but now almost no land can be used
   because of land grabbing.” – Large farmer (Male), Magway Region
  “If the government doesn’t pay anything (for land acquired as part of the
   gas pipeline), we won’t pay anything (referring to MADB loans) back to the
   government”. – Small farmer (Male), Rakhine State

                           In several locations, concerns remain about the potential for land to be unfairly
                           acquired. These concerns are more prevalent in locations where there are external
                           economic interests, such as gas pipelines and special economic zones in Rakhine or oil
                           interests in Magway, and where land registration has been relatively less effective. One
                           QSEM village in Rakhine State, for example, was subject to a recent land acquisition
                           in relation to the gas pipeline to China that ran through the village. Compensation
                           for land use was paid in the first year, but villagers had yet to receive payments for
                           subsequent years. As the quote above indicates, villagers are now more prepared to
                           advocate if compensation is not forthcoming.

                             “Now there is a fight for land as the price of corn is good.” –
                              Village administrator/large farmer (Male), Shan State

                           Villagers also perceive that land is a more valuable commodity, in part due to
                           land registration. Across rounds villagers claimed that land prices have increased
                           significantly. In part, reported increases in land prices were the result of the
                           increased certainty provided by land registration. In some areas, in particular corn
                           growing regions of Shan State and areas close to the special economic zone under
                           development in Rakhine State, this perception was also fuelled by increased local
                           commercial activity.
                           However, perceived increases in land value were rarely accompanied by an increase
                           in the number of land transactions or evidence of higher prices being paid. The vast
                           majority of land transactions continued to be between villagers from the same or
                           neighboring villages, with limited evidence of external buyers entering the market. The
                           only documented exception in the most recent round was the purchase of land along
                           the shore in one QSEM village in Rakhine State by an outside businessman, feeding
                           perceptions among villagers about potential increases in the value of land in the area.

                           There is also limited evidence of land registration resulting in increased land disputes.
                           Overall, researchers in QSEM 5 identified fewer ongoing or new land disputes than in
                           previous rounds. In QSEM 3 and QSEM 4 there was an increase in the number of land
                           disputes in response to the land registration process: Parties with pre-existing tensions
                           saw the registration process as a means of settling dormant disputes or reversing
                           previous decisions. The majority of these disputes were resolved relatively quickly. The
                           number of land disputes fell as land registration was completed in most QSEM villages,
                           with only a handful of new cases being reported in QSEM 5. These were primarily
                           inheritance cases. Despite the decline, a small number of complex long-standing cases
                           remained and, as shown in Box 11 below, efforts to resolve these cases were not always
                           successful.

  BOX 11: LAND REGISTRATION IN AYEYARWADY REGION REIGNITES OLD
  DISPUTES
  A village in Ayeyarwady was the location of a land dispute that impacted on
  village-level leadership. A number of years ago a farmer transferred rights to some
  of his land to pay off his debts. The new farmer regularly planted and harvested
  from that land until 2012, when the land law came into effect and the original
  owner tried to reclaim his land through the registration process.
  The village administrator (VA) at the time decided in favor of the original owner. The
  farmer who had recently worked the land complained to officials in the township,
  who replaced the VA and assigned a temporary VA to deal with the matter. After an
  investigation, this temporary VA ruled in favor of the new farmer and provided him
  with a certificate of land registration. Villagers were not surprised by this outcome
  since the temporary VA and the new farmer were related.
  Having made his decision, the temporary VA resigned his position. Ten household
  leaders selected a new VA. Meanwhile, the previous owner, despite losing his
  claim, nevertheless planted and harvested on the land the following year, with
  little response from the farmer who actually held the land certificate. When the
  previous owner tried to plant paddy again this year, the current owner went to the
  police, who enforced the land registration decision.



Despite the new land laws, people continue to resolve land disputes through
village-level mechanisms. The Farmland Law provided for the establishment of
farmland administration committees. However, there was limited evidence that
these mechanisms were being used to resolve disputes. As the example above
indicates, village leaders—in particular village administrators—continued to play
the primary role in dispute resolution. The research identified only four villages (one
each in Ayeyarwady, Mandalay, Rakhine, and Shan) in which farmland administration
committees had played an active role in resolving disputes. In Mandalay and Rakhine,
the committees were comprised solely of members from one village and therefore
villagers were effectively using pre-existing mechanisms under a new name. The lack
of activity by farmland administration committees indicates that most disputes involve
parties from within the same village and, as a result, local leaders are used.

  “Whenever I discuss land registration at township meetings, I get scolded.
   Township officials and villagers have different concerns and different ideas.
   So I am stuck in the middle.” –
   Village administrator/Medium farmer (Male), Magway Region

Ultimately, the research suggests that the changes to the land law are not yet
affecting how land issues are dealt with at the village level. Significant land reforms
at the national level have made their way down to the village level in the form of the
land registration process and changes in perceptions about ownership and value.
However, they have yet to result in changes in the practice of land administration.
Villagers in a number of areas claimed that it was not clear how township officials
were meant to handle land transactions or disputes under the new policy. As a result,
new transactions were not registered with the departments and villagers continued
to rely on pre-existing dispute resolution processes rather than turn to the farmland
administration committees.

THE VILLAGE CONTEXT

VILLAGE PROFILE - AYEYARWADY REGION
A village in Ayeyarwady Region highlights some of the effects of governance
changes since the start of QSEM. This reasonably large village has 230 households,
or close to 1000 inhabitants. About 40 percent of the population own land,
farming paddy and mung beans in the summer harvest. Another 20 percent rely
mainly on fishing although this fluctuates depending on the fish catch. As catches
declined in QSEM 2 and QSEM 3, fishermen turned increasingly to agricultural labor
or migration. Traditionally, landless households migrated for several months at a
time during the non-peak season. More recently, as networks have become more
established, they are increasingly migrating for more permanent work in Yangon
and even overseas.
When researchers first visited the village in QSEM 2, the 100-household leader
took responsibility for administrative affairs in the village. He had relatively strong
networks at the township level and was perceived as someone who could get
things done, although some villagers commented about the lack of openness in
his dealings. In addition to overseeing development activities, his tasks included
registering visitors, collecting data for national registration cards and providing
recommendation letters and organizing applications for farmers wanting to access
MADB loans. He even possessed an administrative stamp he could use as village
leader.
In 2013, ten-household leaders across the village tract elected a village tract
administrator (VTA). None of the leaders from the village were candidates, thinking
they didn’t have enough education to be elected. Shortly after the election,
the village leader was informed that under the new law his position no longer
existed. Another of the ten-household leaders, wanting to gain more influence in
the village, lobbied the new VTA to take over as a de facto village leader. But the
villager soon learned that under the new arrangements he wouldn’t have much
authority either.
Since the election, villagers are required to go to the village where the VTA lives
whenever they need official documentation. Villagers complained that land
registration was too time consuming because they had to register documents with
the VTA in the rainy season when the roads were bad. The changes in governance
have also altered perceptions about the role of village leaders. Nowadays, if the de
facto village leader tries to organize anything people are less willing to participate.
When the new school year was starting, he called a meeting to discuss recruitment
of new teachers. But only one third of villagers participated and so there was no
agreement on how to proceed. Similarly, some villagers believe that the change
in governance has affected their ability to access services from NGOs and the
government. Since the elections, there has been a reduction in the number of
NGO projects and only microfinance activities are now operating. The government
has provided some assistance to the local school, but this is part of a nation-wide
initiative. Some villagers complain that they are not receiving as much assistance
as neighboring villages.

The analytical framework includes an examination of social structures on the
assumption that these structures have an influence on people’s livelihoods. Across
rounds the research has documented the quality of social relations in villages, changes
in local-level institutions and the effects those changes may have on the lives of villagers.
This section lays out findings across these areas. First, the strength of social capital
across QSEM locations and changes in social capital over time are examined. QSEM
research across rounds has consistently identified strong social bonds within villages
developed in part through the need to deliver public goods where neither the state
nor other actors were present to provide these services. Next, the main factors likely to
influence social capital are identified. The most influential factors across rounds were
the quality of village leadership, contestation around external assistance, divisions in
management of religious affairs and the management of land and natural resources.
Finally, one of the more significant changes in rural Myanmar since 2012 has been the
restructuring of village governance arrangements following the passage of the Ward
and Village Tract Administration Law in 2012. Changes in village leadership subsequent
to implementation of that law are identified, along with a description of the limited
changes that have occurred in the role of women in leadership positions.


SOCIAL CAPITAL

  “If I volunteer for every task in the village, my wife will starve from hunger.” –
   Small farmer (Male), Mandalay Region

Since research commenced in 2012, social capital in villages has been reported as
being consistently strong. In QSEM 1, researchers observed that high levels of trust and
strong community bonds enabled people to act to improve their livelihood outcomes.
With several exceptions this has remained true across all rounds of research. In more
recent rounds, researchers have been asked to measure social relations within villages.34
Table 10 below provides a summary of social relations in villages for QSEM 5. There
were few changes from last year. In approximately 80 percent of villages, positive or
fair social relations were reported, evidenced by factors such as a lack of conflict within
villages and a high degree of communal activity. Box 12 below provides an example of
the importance of these types of communal approaches to livelihoods in Chin State.

34. Researchers were asked to rank each village in the regions they visited. Villages with good social relations had a high
degree of collective activities, such as socio-religious activities and contributions to village public goods. Villages with
fair social relations had a lesser degree of these activities but did not have conflicts or tensions. Where relations were
poor, different groups existed in the village and activities divided along group lines, occasionally with some disputes.
The categorization draws from the approach used in The World Bank’s Post-Nargis Social Impact Monitoring reports.

                                  BOX 12: VILLAGERS IN CHIN STATE COOPERATE TO OVERCOME WATER
                                  SHORTAGES
                                  Irrigation management in one village visited by the QSEM researchers in Chin
                                  State underlined the importance of community cooperation for livelihood
                                  outcomes. This village frequently faces water shortages, with particular impact on
                                  the irrigation of paddy fields. Villagers needed to cooperate in order to ensure a
                                  successful crop.
                                  In 2014 when there was reduced rainfall, only those villagers with land bordering
                                  streams and rivers had easy access to water. Instead of taking all the water for their
                                  crops, they worked with villagers whose fields were further away to ensure runoff
                                  would drain into those fields.
                                  This model of collective social action is not organized formally, but represents
                                  local cooperation for the good of the group. It usually includes a handful of
                                  farmers who are in the same area and would naturally depend on the same water
                                  source. While there is occasional low-level tension over usage, with certain farmers
                                  accused of using too much water, these disagreements are usually resolved by the
                                  farmers themselves and are rarely escalated to the village administrator level.


                                The high levels of social capital observed across rounds are somewhat at odds
                                with a recent survey that identified low levels of trust in communities. A public
                                perception survey conducted in 2014 35 found that almost 80 percent of respondents
                                believed most people could not be trusted, with lower levels of trust in regions (18
                                percent could trust others) than in states (27 percent). People in the respondent’s
                                neighborhood were the group most likely to be trusted, but even then the rate was
                                only just over half (56 percent). These results, which are well below similar surveys
                                conducted in other countries, could indicate several factors. First, the concept of social
                                capital in rural Myanmar is more complex than participation in collective pursuits. Even
                                though villagers may work together for the public good this does not by itself result in
                                the creation of trust. Alternatively, the results may have been shaped by the prolonged
                                period of military rule and a corresponding lack of confidence in social institutions.
                                Nevertheless, social capital plays an important role in protecting households from

                                against potential shocks. A quarter of QSEM villages had some form of community
                                fund established, while several villages in Magway and Mandalay had long-standing
                                rice banks in case of food shortages. As described in Box 13, dormant rice banks in
                                three villages in Chin State became active again as a result of improved investment in
                                local infrastructure.

  BOX 13: ROAD IMPROVEMENTS MAKE RICE BANKS VIABLE IN CHIN STATE
  In a township in Chin State, rice banks in three villages that had previously
  ceased functioning were restarted thanks to the initiative of local leaders. In all
  three villages, the rice banks had been started by an international NGO several
  years previously, but after the program ended in 2013 the rice banks stopped
  functioning. This was largely because unpaid debts by local farmers meant they
  were unsustainable.
  Between QSEM 4 and QSEM 5, however, the rice banks were restarted. In one
  village, a CSO chairman convinced the villagers to pay back the debt they owed,
  allowing the rice bank to be restarted with that repaid capital. In the two other
  villages, village administrators forced villagers to repay their debts.
  The impetus behind these initiatives was the completion of a road in the township.
  The remote nature of the township meant that all rice had to be purchased in Kalay
  and transported via the township capital to the villages for storage. Easier access
  to Kalay has meant better access to rice in bulk, lowering the costs for farmers and
  making the rice bank economically viable.



  “Only the rich are invited whenever there are ceremonies in villages and the poor

   people who are more educated and richer than me in the village.” – Small farmer
   (Male), Chin State

Socio-economic status is the primary barrier to participation in social activities, with
poorer families finding it more difficult to actively engage. Poorer families faced several
constraints in actively participating in village activities. First, a number of social and
religious activities require financial contributions that poorer households are less able
to meet. Earlier rounds of QSEM identified that, across regions, it was common practice
to take into consideration a household’s capacity to contribute to fundraising at the
village level. Second, poorer villagers often need to prioritize earning a livelihood
and may not have the time to actively participate in village activities. Third, as the
quotes above indicate, a form of social stigma exists whereby poorer families may feel
excluded or lack the confidence to participate in activities that are dominated by more
influential village leaders. As Box 14 identifies below, the lack of participation in village
affairs by poorer households can have significant repercussions for access to services.
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                               53




  BOX 14: VILLAGE ELITES MONOPOLIZE COOPERATIVE LOAN IN SHAN STATE
  In a small village in Shan State the village leader was told by the village tract leader
  that it was possible to obtain loans from the township-level cooperative board. As
  this program was new to the village, the village leader discussed it only with the
  households closest to him and then submitted a proposal with the names of 25
  villagers who had signed up.
  The village leader received the cooperative loan. However, he did not distribute
  it to the 25 households. Instead, he and three other elders from the village split
   the amount between them – a total of 2.5 million kyats (100,000 kyats for each of
  the 25 applicants). The elder with the most informal influence in the village took
  1 million kyats, while the three others took 400,000, 500,000, and 600,000 kyats
  respectively. In doing so they assumed significant financial risk, for if they have
  difficulty repaying the loan they would have to sell their cattle or land to avoid
  default.
  Although the 21 villagers who had signed up for the loan knew about the
  distribution to the four elders, no one complained about it. Given the small size of
  the village, this suggests that villagers considered the distribution to be consistent
  with practices in their village.



  “Men do not give a chance for women to provide opinions or ideas in meetings.
   They believe that men are better than women in thought.” –

  “Before this UNDP project, women assumed that village meetings were not
   their concern. But now, most of the attendees at village meetings are women” –
   Village Elder and Respected Person/Medium farmer (Male) Shan State

Gender too, remains a barrier to leadership in social activities. Although female
participation in the social sphere is strong across rural villages, it is still rare for women
to hold leadership positions in village institutions. The introduction of external
assistance, in particular microfinance or revolving fund programs, has provided an
additional means of encouraging active female participation in village structures. In
some instances, these projects are either targeted specifically at women or allocate
certain positions to women. Over time, as noted in the quote above, these can change
perceptions about the participation of women in broader village meetings. However,
even in villages where these changes were identified, greater participation did not
necessarily correlate to more influence in decision-making processes at these meetings.

  “It is hard to be a village administrator and I don’t want to be hated by others”. –
   Former village administrator/Medium farmer (Male), Shan State

Although it is not clear if it is a definitive trend, there are some indications that village-
level social bonds may be weakening. A combination of increased mobility and

reliance on economic activities beyond the village, together with diminished authority
of village leaders, may make it more difficult to mobilize villagers to participate in
communal activities compared to the past. Box 15 below provides an example in
which collective action may have weakened over time.



  BOX 15: MOBILIZING VILLAGERS IN RAKHINE STATE TO BUILD A SCHOOL
  Seven years ago a new village was established by a group of fishermen in Rakhine
  State. It has since grown to 60 households. Education levels in the village are low
  and until recently there was no nearby government school. In 2011, the village
  administration committee proposed to fund a school themselves by making a deal
  with a local auction house. The fishermen sold their catch to the auction house
  at a slightly reduced price. In exchange, the auction house funded the school. The
  building was finished in 2014 at a cost of 2.5 million kyat.
  Village leaders applied to the Township Education Office four times to receive
  recognition. The VA receives little support from the VTA and so the villagers
  themselves were responsible for convincing township officials. Each household
  contributed 1,000 kyats to cover the costs for applying. In February 2014, the
  government recognized the school. Soon after, three government teachers arrived.
  The village hired a house for the teachers, costing 30,000 kyats, with villagers
  paying 50 percent of the rent. In addition, a rotation system exists for parents to
  contribute rice to the teachers.
  When the teachers returned to school following the Thadingyut holiday in
  October last year, there was a dispute with the landlord. To resolve the problem
  village leaders collected 1.5 million kyats via a similar arrangement with the
  auction house and a new house for teachers was built.
   “Villagers do not want to sell at a low price to merchants anymore. We have
    to explain a lot to the villagers in order to get them to do it and it is hard to
    convince them. We will have to continue to use this method when the village
    has financial difficulties, otherwise, we won’t use it.”
  As the quote above highlights, now that the school is built, village leaders are
  having difficulties convincing villagers that they should continue contributing in
  this way.



VILLAGE GOVERNANCE

  “Village heads are rarely good. And good village heads are really rare.” –
   Village Elder and Respected Person (VERP), Magway Region

The quality of local leadership is crucial in influencing social relations. In a number
of case studies throughout the research, the role of local leadership is highlighted
as playing a primary factor in either mobilizing villagers to act for a collective good
or overcoming issues that affect social relations, or in fracturing relations through
generating competition or monopolizing space in villages.

                           Across the research period there have been significant changes to village structures
                           with a reduction in village-level authority to deal with issues that arise. Research
                           in QSEM 1 identified a range of formal and informal village institutions: Village
                           administrators and religious institutions were common to all villages. Most villages
                           also had one or more single-purpose groups, such as school, water or electricity
                           committees or funeral service groups. Where villages benefited from aid programs,
                           aid provider groups were typically established to facilitate those programs. In QSEM
                           1, village administrators were identified as the most important village level institution

                           TURNOVER OF LEADERSHIP POSITIONS
                           First, by way of context, Figure 12 below provides a summary of leadership changes
                           across each round. As the figure shows, almost half of the village tract administrators
                           were replaced in elections that were documented in QSEM 3 and QSEM 4.36
                           Subsequently, there has been limited turnover of VTAs. In the last round, only three
                           VTAs were replaced, all in Ayeyarwady Region and all as a result of administrative
                           decisions at the township level rather than resignations. The same does not apply for
                           village administrators, who continued to experience turnover rates of above 20 percent
                           during each research period, even following the elections for VTAs. 37

                             36. The Ward and Village Tract Administration Law enabled, for the first time, the election of village tract administrators.
                             The election process required each ten household leader from across the village tracts to cast a vote for their preferred
                             candidate. In almost all cases the candidates were themselves village administrators (one hundred household heads)
                             from one of the villages in the tract.
                              37. It should be noted that the position of village administrator no longer formally exists following passage of the Ward
                              and Village Tract Administration Law. However, villagers (and administrators themselves) invariably continue to recognize
                              one individual as the village leader (using local language versions of the terms “village administrator” or “one hundred
                              household head”).
                              38. N represents the number of villages covered by QSEM research in each round. QSEM 2 and QSEM 3 covered two
                              thirds of the village sample in each round. Both QSEM 4 and QSEM 5 covered all villages. Research in 	QSEM 4 included 36
                              villages where the results of changes to village leadership were documented in QSEM 3 and 18 villages where leadership
                              changes were documented for the first time in QSEM 4. Turnover was not captured in QSEM 1 due to it being the first
                              visit to those villages.

                            Village administrator leadership changes were more frequent in remote areas. In Shan
                            State in particular, changes occurred in at least half of the villages across each round
                            of research in QSEM 4 and QSEM 5. The village profile at the beginning of section 1 is
                            one example in which villagers had to convince a local leader to take the post of village
                            administrator.

                            Authority continues to be increasingly consolidated in the position of the village

ADMINISTRATION LAW.         importance of other committees within village tracts, such as farmland administration
                            committees and village development support committees, and the influence of VTAs
                            in nominating people to these committees was also identified as a factor.
                            Research in QSEM 5 identified several additional factors that have further strengthened
                            the authority of VTAs. First, in a number of regions leaders previously viewed as village
                            administrators are no longer officially allowed to act on behalf of the village. This
                            means they cannot perform acts such as authorizing letters for identity registration,
                            land transactions and so on. This is particularly the case in less remote areas in
                            Ayeyarwady, Mandalay or Magway regions. Similarly, in these regions, some village
                            leaders are now appointed by the VTA rather than nominated by villagers through
                            10-household leaders. As the village profile at the beginning of this section shows,
                            leaders are more likely to act on behalf of the VTA rather than in representing villagers.
                            Finally, as VTAs are the central liaison linking villages to townships, they have increased
                            control over information flows to the village level. As is discussed in the next sub-
                            section, this creates a perception that VTAs are more likely to favor some villages.
                            The increased authority of VTAs also makes them susceptible to increased risk. As Box
                            16 below shows, another way of highlighting the increased authority of VTAs is by
                            documenting their responsibilities. In the case below, a VTA became responsible for
                            the overall MADB loan portfolio of villagers in his tract. In previous years, when loan
                            sizes and demand were significantly lower, the VTA would have been able to mitigate
                            this risk by divesting some of the responsibility to village administrators.

                                 BOX 16: A VTA TAKES RESPONSIBILITY FOR MADB LOANS IN AYEYARWADY
                                 REGION
                                 A VTA lives in a village covered by QSEM research. In June and July 2014 villagers
                                 across the tract took their normal MADB loans, which were due to be repaid
                                 by January 2015. The six villages in the tract borrowed a total of 1000 lakhs kyat.
                                 However, bad weather meant that many of the farmers were unable to pay back
                                 the loans on time. This had the potential to affect farmers’ ability to grow paddy in
                                 the summer as they could not obtain new loans needed for seeds and fertilizer.
                                 At the time, responsibility for loans across the tract was with the VTA. The risk of his
                                 reputation being damaged at the township level forced him to act: He contacted
                                 a wealthy friend who lives in the township and arranged a direct loan for the full
                                 amount of 1000 lakhs kyat at 3 percent interest. He then paid off the debt to MADB,
                                 which meant the farmers now owed him money.
                                 As a result of the VTA’s actions, farmers could borrow for the summer paddy. To
                                 date, however, very few have paid back the VTA who still owes his friend a large
                                 sum of money.



                               THE VILLAGE ADMINISTRATOR

                                 “The village administrator works for the benefit of others but eats the meals
                                  prepared by his wife.” – Village administrator/Medium farmer (Male), Shan State

                               There has been a corresponding decrease in the influence of village administrators.
                               On paper, the law passed in 2012 did away with the position of village administrator,
                               retaining only 10 household leaders and VTAs and formalizing the role of VERPs for
                               specific tasks. In almost all QSEM villages, people typically still identify one individual
                               (who in the QSEM villages is consistently male) as holding a leadership position within
                               that village. However, in more practical terms, the abolition of the village administrator
                               position has played out in two distinct ways across QSEM research areas.
                               First, in more central locations, the abolition of the VA was progressively becoming
                               a reality. Researchers noted that across most of Ayeyarwady, Mandalay and Magway
                               regions, the influence of the VA was becoming less prevalent. Villagers were still
                               able to identify a leader within their community but for administrative matters were
VILLAGERS STILL PERCEIVE A     increasingly relying on the VTA. The village profile at the beginning of this section

                               However, the VA position was still seen as crucial in many villages. From the
                               perspective of VTA administrators and officials at the township level, the role of the VA
LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                             58




may have diminished, but for villagers in a majority of villages they still played a crucial
role. This was the case in Chin, Rakhine and Shan states and also in a number of villages
in the regions. A number of examples highlight the importance that villagers placed
on the role of village administrators. As reported in previous QSEM rounds, villagers
in Shan State provided financial assistance or made village land available to the VA to
enable them to supplement their livelihood in return for undertaking the role. Other
examples covered in this report include the VA who advocated at the township level
for recognition of a school in Rakhine State (Box 15 above) and the village elites who,
through the village administrator, monopolized cooperative loans in Shan State (Box 14).
Nevertheless, the authority of the VA position was being undermined. For village
leaders to effectively fulfill their functions they have traditionally relied on a
combination of respect or legitimacy from villagers, commitment to represent the
village, networks with external actors (in particular township officials) and jurisdiction
to undertake the tasks demanded of them. The increasing authority of the VTA has
limited the jurisdiction of village administrators and also limited their influence with
external networks. Villagers across a number of areas complained that this resulted in
village administrators who were no longer focused on or committed to their jobs.


OTHER VILLAGE INSTITUTIONS

  “It is impossible for the youth to participate in the village administration matters as
   we are young.” – Youth leader/Small farmer (Male), Chin State

There have been limited concrete developments in other village institutions over the
last three years. First, there have been few changes to village-level groups that pre-
dated QSEM research. QSEM 1 documented the types of institutions that existed at
the village level. Aside from village administration, these included aid-provider groups,
single-purpose groups, traditional groups such as VERPs, youth groups and religious
groups. Across rounds there is limited evidence that the role of any of these groups has
expanded or become more influential.
There are some indications that the VERPs are becoming less active across most
regions, with the exception of Rakhine State. Although difficult to document,
researchers noted a decline in the influence of VERPs across most locations. Whereas
in the past a group of influential village elites would act as a collective to manage
social and religious affairs and advise village administrators, this role was becoming less
institutional and more dependent on the influence of specific individuals rather than
a collective. One township in Rakhine State, however, provides an exception: Several
years ago, communities in this township established a microfinance program popular
among villagers and overseen by VERPs. The program existed in each of the three
QSEM villages in the township. One result was that VERPs in the township maintained
their traditional influence, with responsibility for the resolution of local disputes and
determining the composition of most village institutions.
Although new institutions have been established across rounds, very few have
taken hold. At first sight, the most significant change in village institutions beyond
the changes to VAs and VTAs outlined above was the establishment of village
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                           59




development support committees (VDSC) across all village tracts. The objective of
the VDSCs was to provide advice to township administration on village development
planning and to support village governments in implementing development
programs. Although VDSCs were established across research areas in QSEM 3 and
QSEM 4, there was little subsequent indication that they played an active role in village
affairs.
A number of other initiatives were established on an ad hoc basis, but few were
sustainable. Numerous examples existed of committees being formed to focus on
specific issues. These included numerous village development committees (VDCs)
created to administer the implementation of NGO programs, or initiatives such as
those detailed in Box 17 below that were initiated by villagers themselves. As with the
example in the box below, however, these initiatives were rarely sustained. There were
few examples of initiatives taking a role beyond their original mandates or influencing
village affairs more broadly.



  BOX 17: A VILLAGE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN CHIN STATE CEASES TO FUNCTION
  In November 2013, a village audit committee was set up in a village in Chin State at
  the direction of the village administrator. Members of the group were the VA, the
  VERPs, the president of one of the local community-based organizations (CBO) and
  representatives from youth and women’s groups.
  The VA encouraged the idea based on his experience of the activities of NGO
  groups. The village had received aid from various NGOs with their own auditing
  structures, and the VA thought it would be a good idea for the village to have
  its own institution to monitor cash flows and expenditures. The VA himself
  received large amounts of cash for aid projects and it is believed he saw the audit
  committee as protection from any accusations of corruption.
  The mandate of the audit committee was to go through the financial accounts of
  the village administrative groups and any NGO-formed bodies every six months.
  However, in practice they only managed one audit, in October 2014, covering
  the accounts of local CBOs. The VA changed his view and refused access to his
  financial accounts. As a result, other groups refused access to their accounts. The
  audit group ceased operations.
  Perceptions vary as to why this occurred: An informal leader gave the impression
  that there may have been some low level misuse of village funds. A more general
  perception in the village was that, although the CBOs and other groups had strong
  accounting methods and financial processes, the VA’s methods were slipshod, with
  little documentation of expenditures, causing him to block the functioning of the
  committee.

   of the monk. When they see a village tract, they focus on the main tract village
   before the other villages.” – VERP/Large farmer (Male), Mandalay Region

Three interrelated trends are emerging as a result of the changing nature of
governance structures in rural Myanmar. The first is a perception of inequality of
treatment between ‘normal’ villages (that is to say villages that are neither tract villages
nor where the VTA is a resident) and villages where the village tract administrator lives.39
Across research locations, there were claims from villagers that their village, which
were invariably ‘normal villages’, were at a disadvantage compared to the villages
where the VTA resided. These claims generally relied on the presumption that the VTA
had a vested interest in channeling resources to their preferred village and that their
influence over information, ability to determine membership of various committees
and access to township officials enabled them to do this. Box 18 below provides an
example of how this perception developed in a village tract in Magway Region.



  BOX 18: A TRACT VILLAGE DOMINATES DEVELOPMENT DECISIONS IN MAGWAY
  REGION
  In a township in Magway Region, researchers held a discussion with the members
  of the VDSC about its activities and the level of involvement by various types of
  villages. It was found that members from the main village in the tract are regular
  participants at VDSC meetings, but that members of other villages have limited
  opportunities to discuss their village’s needs. In particular, a common refrain was
  that the VTA often attends these meetings and as a result is able to provide his
  village with more opportunities.
  In this township, the VDSC received a budget each March. The committee
  examined proposals from the villages to ensure that projects do not cost more
  than 5,000,000 kyats. The committee then voted on projects and allocated the
  money. However, sometimes the funds were redirected.
  For instance, in one tract with four villages, members of the VDSC voted to
  renovate a middle school building in the main village for the benefit of the
  whole tract, at a cost of 3,500,000 kyats. But when the budget was approved and
  implemented, the line item was changed to use the funds for road construction, a
  project that benefited only the main village where the VTA was from. Committee
  members from the other villagers did not know how, or why, the budget line was
  changed.




39. In every village tract, one village is designated as the tract village and will generally have an administrative office. The
elected village tract administrator is often (although not always) a resident of this village. The research indicates that the
village where the village tract administrator is resident has more sway over development resources than the tract village
per se.

WITHIN VILLAGE TRACTS.        represented by a village administrator were more likely to receive government projects
                              in QSEM 5 compared to tract villages. There were no significant variations across states
                              or regions, and in no locations did tract villages receive proportionally more projects
                              than normal villages. This analysis should be viewed as preliminary.40 Given the
                              strength of the perceptions about the potential for favoritism in villages where the VTA
                              resided, however, there is value in tracking these trends.

                             A second trend is that villagers in normal villages were concerned about the lack of
                             leadership at the village level. A primary complaint was that particular leaders were not
                             sufficiently committed to the job and, as a result, villages missed out on opportunities
                             or were insufficiently represented at inter-village meetings. As previously mentioned,
                             this complaint has become increasingly directed at village administrators as their
                             authority has diminished. No alternative source of authority to adequately represent
                             the interests of villages has yet been identified.41
                             Third, the diminished role of village administrators and the lack of development
                             of alternative village-level bodies raise issues about appropriate accountability
                             mechanisms at the local level. The new regulatory framework seeks to balance
                             the increased authority of VTAs with inputs from VDSCs. However, as noted above,
                             there is little evidence of VDSCs operating as planned. Township-level development
                             committees played a role in overseeing rural development tasks at a village level
                             and provided some downwards accountability, along with township administrative
                             offices. But, as the example in Box 17 above highlights, initiatives to develop upward
                             accountability mechanisms at the village level are few and far between.




                               40. As the analysis does not compare across rounds it does not show if there have been changes in distribution since the
                               implementation of the Ward and Village Tract Administration Law. The methodology for counting government projects
                               is also qualitative by nature and therefore faces certain limitations.
                               41. It should be noted that under the new Ward and Village Tract Administration Law, VTAs are elected through a vote
                               by ten-household-leaders and that this would in theory require some form of alliance among ten household leaders
                               across villages within a tract to obtain a majority. Over time, such political incentives may lead to some form of adequate
                               representation across villages.

VILLAGE PROFILE - RAKHINE STATE
The opening of the rural economy has increased the complexity of managing
village affairs. In Rakhine State, dynamics in some villages are complicated by the
interplay between increased investment as a result of the construction of a gas
pipeline to China and mobilization around Rakhine identity.
One QSEM village in Rakhine State has a population of approximately 130
households. Two thirds of villagers own land and the remainder are casual laborers.
There is limited access by road to the village, especially in the wet season. For this
reason, the village still has a more traditional economy, with inhabitants often
bartering rice for other commodities.
In 2012, construction of the gas pipeline went through the village, affecting land
owned by 42 farmers and complicating relations with the government. Farmers
received compensation in 2012 covering use of the land and damage to crops.
In 2013, they received money for damage to crops, but last year they reported
receiving nothing despite making requests to the township three times. Electricity
lines are also being installed to follow the pipeline, though the village itself does
not have electricity and won’t be connected.

 “Twelve months ago the village leader would never have let us hold meetings in this
  village. Now we can hold meetings, but he will attend and take notes of who came
  and what we discussed.” – Youth activist (Male), Rakhine State

These types of issues provide a platform around which to mobilize people. Some
youth activists in the village have links to township civil society organizations, the
Rakhine Social Network Group and a Rakhine nationalist party. Learning from
these networks, they inform farmers of the need for land certificates to protect
land— especially as the special economic zone is established— and mobilize
people to petition the government for compensation. These issues are also
politicized, with activists highlighting how little villagers are benefiting from
infrastructure investments in the region, complicating the task of village leaders to
maintain social order.
More broadly, the village is slowly seeing benefits from increased government
assistance. The previous village leader had good networks with the township,
which helped in negotiating government assistance, including for a new school
building following Cyclone Giri. He was replaced just before QSEM 3 and it took
the new VA some time to build his networks. Recently the village has benefited
from the construction of a new pond and, after submitting a proposal three
times, received support for more schoolteachers to enable two additional years of
post-primary schooling. Villagers had previously covered these costs themselves.
Villagers still complain that the quality of education is poor, however, noting that
children who go to high school drop out soon after. The regional government has
recently promised vocational training for youth as part of the development of a
nearby special economic zone.
This village has seen few changes in terms of NGO programs. A cash-for-work
program following Cyclone Giri ended in the early rounds of QSEM. There is
ongoing livelihood assistance in the form of training and inputs for rice production.

  National reforms have changed how villages interact with actors beyond the
  village level. Across QSEM rounds, the role of government in village service delivery
  has steadily expanded, which has implications for managing the expectations of
  villagers and for the work of donors. In QSEM 1, analysis of external assistance42 was
  focused almost exclusively on the role of donor programs in villages. In early rounds,
  government services were almost solely limited to education and credit. Since QSEM 3,
  there has been an increase in these areas as well as in investment in local infrastructure
  and health services. The number of government programs across QSEM villages is now
  at similar levels to donor programs.


   ENGAGING GOVERNMENT
   QSEM research began as the Government of Myanmar started emphasizing a ‘people-
   centered development’ approach.43 As Figure 13 below shows, early rounds of QSEM
   highlighted the limited role of government in service delivery and rural development
   at the village level. Since then, the Government of Myanmar accelerated efforts “aimed
   at rapid improvement of public services and development with ‘quick wins’.” 44 QSEM
   research has tracked how the government’s approach has played out in villages across
   the country, including the response of rural communities and implications for the
   government.

                     “Households were asked to contribute more money to village administration this
                      year, as guests from government organizations are visiting more often.” –

MONTHS.                    In QSEM 1 and QSEM 2, less than one project per village was documented. By QSEM 5
                           three years later, villages were receiving approximately three different forms of govern-
                           ment service, suggesting a more-than-tripling of government activity since early 2012.
                           The focus of assistance has not changed between QSEM 4 and QSEM 5. Table 12 below
                           provides details on the distribution of projects by sector. Both education and access
                           to credit are the main areas of support. For access to credit, this predominantly means
                           MADB loans. In around half of the research areas – Magway, Mandalay and Shan –
                           several villages also received cooperative loans. Education services include school
                           infrastructure, teacher placements, school grants and stationery. Compared to QSEM 4,
                           there was some increase in health projects and a decrease in infrastructure projects.46

                           There is no noticeable pattern of government assistance favoring either accessible or
                           remote villages. The assumption that villages closer to township centers have better
                           access to government services because of the strength of networks and the lower
                           cost of delivering services is not borne out by evidence from the QSEM villages. As
                           Figure 14 below indicates, the patterns varied by state and region. Accessible villages in
                           Mandalay Region and Shan State, as well as average villages in Shan, were more likely
                           to receive government programs than remote villages. In Shan State, remote villages
                           were less likely to receive government assistance, perhaps indicating the challenge in
                           delivering programs to those villages, particularly in areas affected by conflict. However,
                           in Ayeyarwady and Magway, remote villages were considerably more likely to receive
                           government assistance.




                           45. Researchers met with village administrators and other local leaders to document government and donor assistance
                           in each village. The information was then cross-checked through the course of research in each village and tabulated
                           per region. The methodology has some weaknesses because it only assesses projects specific to those villages and
                           not services delivered above the village level. It also does not take into consideration differences in the scale or value of
                           services delivered.
                           46. The decrease in infrastructure projects may in part be related to funding cycles for government infrastructure: funds
                           were released just before research commenced in QSEM 4, but the funding cycle did not overlap as clearly with QSEM 5.

DECISION-MAKING AND INFORMATION FLOWS
Communities reported having limited ability to inform decision-making about govern-
ment assistance and, as a result, assistance was rarely prioritized based on the perceived
needs of communities. Decisions about the type and targeting of assistance followed
two patterns: First, some programs were determined at the national level and delivered
in a similar fashion either across the country or in specific geographic areas. These
included school grants assistance and a new credit program called Mya Sein Yaung,
(Emerald Green). Second, decisions about a range of other program were made
through planning processes at the township level. Box 19 below outlines the structure
of local institutions supporting development processes.



              BOX 19: TOWNSHIP DEVELOPMENT INSTITUTIONS
            The Asia Foundation’s report on Fiscal Decentralization in Myanmar: Towards a
            Roadmap for Reform describes government institutions established to manage
            development processes at the local level.
            Three key institutions exist at the township level: The Township Management
            Committee (TMC), which oversees overall township administration, is comprised of
            the Township Administrator (GAD) and heads of other government departments.
            The Township Development Affairs Committee (TDAC), which administers
            development programs and reports to the TMC, is headed by a community
            leader. All other TDAC members are representatives of government departments.
            Finally, Township Development Support Committees (TDSC) are comprised of
            eight members; two government officials and six representatives from interest
            groups including business, laborers and farmers. Although not directly managing
            resources, their role is to advise the TDAC. Representatives of these committees are
            supposed to meet monthly to report on development priorities identified by the
            government.

                               Below the township level, each village tract is supposed to establish a Village
                               Development Support Committee, comprised of between five and seven
                               respected leaders from those tracts. As is discussed below, these new institutions
                               are yet to be fully active and membership to date has generally been determined
                               by the VTA or government officials.



                             Villagers perceived the TDSC as being the most appropriate avenue for influencing
                             township level decision making processes, although with significant variations

                             or Township Development Affairs Committees except through the work of the TDSC.



                               BOX 20: A TALE OF TWO TOWNSHIP DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT COMMITTEES:
                               RAKHINE AND CHIN STATES.
                               In a township in Chin State, the TDSC tried to develop a representative structure. In
                               addition to the required members, delegates were appointed from each of nine
                               areas in the township. The members met once a month and also held meetings in
                               villages to better understand village needs and prioritize proposals.
                               However, after a new township administrator was appointed in mid 2014 only
                               one delegate was permitted to participate in the township committee. Like other
                               TDSC members, that delegate is from the town center. As a result, there are no
                               links between the township-level committee and the villages for which they are
                               approving projects.
                               In March 2013, a township in Rakhine State established a TDSC. The nine member
                               group consisted of the township deputy general administrator, an officer from the
                               township development committee and seven individuals from the villages. The
                               village members were selected by holding popular votes in each of the town’s
                               three wards. The seven committee members were selected from among the
                               top 30 vote getters in an open meeting involving the VTA and VA. Still, the views
                               of the township administrator had the most influence. The TDSC’s objectives
                               were: 1) assisting in meeting the needs of rural communities by connecting them
                               with various government departments and 2) communicating knowledge and
                               information regarding development to the rural public.
                               The committee does not have the finances or staff to go from village to village
                               but village administrators are often invited to participate in meetings that take
                               place twice a week. Issues most commonly discussed include proposals for
                               development projects and issues around land disputes. The conflict in Rakhine
                               has also been discussed. Decisions and minutes of meetings are transmitted to

  the district center. The TDSC in this township has had limited success delivering
  village-specific projects but has been more successful influencing land disputes
  and township infrastructure needs.

   “It will be much better if the government gives us lump sums. There has been
    no such thing in the past.” – TDSC member, Rakhine State

  The TDSC’s own budget is 1000 lakhs kyats from the Union Hluttaw (or parliament)
  for development, 3 percent of which is used for administrative costs. The TDSC
  can also advise other departments such as the Department of Rural Development
  and the Department of Health. However, members have noted that cooperation
  is mixed, with some Union departments seeing the TDSC as “meddling in their
  affairs”.



There was limited evidence of overall village or township-level development plans
being used to guide decision-making processes. Most villages drafted and submitted
proposals for village needs. However, systematic approaches to identify and prioritize
these needs were rare. Rather, proposals were developed by village leaders on an
ad-hoc basis, usually in response to requests or to advocate for specific needs. There
were several examples of assessments preceding government assistance but these did
not subsequently lead to the delivery of services. In three cases, researchers learned of
government surveys to identify needs on specific issues. These included the collection
of data on fishing communities in Ayeyarwady to identify vulnerability, and surveys of
villages in Chin and Mandalay to provide assistance for crop failure. Despite the surveys,
no assistance was subsequently provided in these instances.

  “The child who cries gets more milk.” –
   Casual laborer (Female), Ayeyarwady Region
  “We can’t discuss the needs of the village with every villager as they all are busy
   with the struggle to make a living. So we discuss the matters with religious
   leaders and the responsible persons from committees and submit the request to
   the respective officials.” – Village administrator (Male), Chin State

Some villages found it difficult to get information about government assistance. As
noted in the previous section, villagers across regions perceived that the ability to
access government assistance was closely linked to the strength of networks between
villages and townships. Box 21 below highlights how these networks provided
villagers with information about the types of opportunities available and, importantly,
access to and information about meetings on government programs. In a number of
villages, respondents felt that their village leaders were ineffective primarily because
they did not proactively seek assistance from the government or build external
networks. This view was expressed particularly about village administrators, whose
incentives to actively engage with township level processes had diminished greatly
since changes in village governance were implemented.

  BOX 21: PARTICIPATING IN MEETINGS PAYS DIVIDENDS IN MAGWAY REGION
  The experience of a village in Magway Region shows the importance of strong
  networks between villages and townships and of participation in township
  meetings.
  Villagers reported that they had recently been the beneficiaries of a rural
  development program funded by the Ministry for Rural Development partnering
  with a UN agency.
  The township administration developed the project, which was designed to
  provide better access to water to a number of villages. However, many VTAs
  and VAs did not attend the meeting to determine which villages would benefit.
  Researchers found that of the three villages they visited in the township, only the
  leader of one village attended the meeting and that village received the support.
  Villagers reported that the VTA (who lives in the QSEM village) was well positioned
  to access external assistance for his village: In addition to being capable in his
  duties, he had a good working network with the township and his brother in law
  was on the Township Development Support Committee. Realizing how important
  participation in township meetings was, the VTA formed a village-level working
  group of seven members (made up of 10 household leaders) who can step in if he
  cannot attend.



MANAGING EXPECTATIONS

    “It is better that schools are supported with grants by the government, but
   because of this people from the village are not willing to support the needs of
   teachers like in the past.” – School teacher (Female), Shan State

Overall, villagers reacted well to increased government service provision, but their
expectations also increased. On one level, villagers have responded positively to the
significant increases in assistance from government. This was reported in some detail in
QSEM 4 and reaffirmed by research in QSEM 5. However, the positive response should
be placed in the context of limited expectations given the low levels of assistance prior
to these changes.

  “We have heard of the minister of irrigation from the radio but we have never
   seen him in our lives.” – Small farmer (Male), Rakhine State

This has provided space for interest groups, such as political parties and activist
organizations, to mobilize communities around service delivery. To date this has
predominantly occurred in response to land confiscation and land management issues.
Previous QSEM reports provided evidence of this in relation to civil society groups that
mobilized villagers in Ayeyarwady Region over land confiscation claims. The Village
Profile at the beginning of this section provides an example of how expectations over
compensation for land acquisition and increased service delivery are being used by
activists in a village in Rakhine State to mobilize villagers, in part for political purposes.

Meanwhile, in the QSEM villages, government capacity at the local level to deliver on
new programs is limited. Over time, this risks weakening trust in the services being
delivered. Across a number of areas in the report there has been discussion of reform
agendas being felt locally, but with limited capacity of government to follow through.
Land registration, for example, has been rolled out across most QSEM areas. However,
villagers are still using traditional systems for land transfers as there has been little
clarity from townships on how the new system should operate. Similarly, there are
signs that government capacity at the township level to implement and oversee new
programs is limited. Box 22 provides two examples of these limitations in regard to the
Emerald Green project in Mandalay and school grants in Ayeyarwady.



  BOX 22: LIMITED OVERSIGHT IN IMPLEMENTATION OF THE EMERALD GREEN
  AND SCHOOL GRANTS PROJECTS.
  Under the Emerald Green project, a village in Mandalay Region was allocated 300
  lakh kyats from the Rural Development Committee. The project aimed to provide
  poorer members of the village with capital to invest in livelihoods, particularly
  raising livestock. Villages formed a seven-member village committee to administer
  the aid. The township RDC provided a four-day accountancy training course for
  committee members.

    “If [the villagers] complained that this man got a loan or that man got a loan,
     instead of us, we cannot resolve that. We know our village and its needs
     well. So we announced a meeting to select those who wanted part of the
     loans, and we divided the money between the families who wanted a loan” –
     Committee member, Mandalay Region

  Instead of splitting the 300 lakh kyats among the poorer households, the
  committee offered a loan to any households who wanted one. Because the
  Emerald Green interest rate was so low at 1 percent per month, 90 percent of
  households took a loan. Each household received between 150,000 and 160,000
  kyats. Wealthy families thought the loan size was too small.
  Oversight by the township development committee on this project was clearly
  weak, as the village committee was able to redesign the Emerald Green loan
  program to fit what they perceived as the village’s needs. Indeed, when township-
  level committee members visited the village, poorer residents showed them
  already existing cattle and pigs, which were photographed as evidence of project
  outcomes.
  Researchers noted the roll out of a government school grants project across
  almost all villages in Ayeyarwady. Researchers were informed that primary schools
  received 4 lakh kyats per school, sub-primary schools received 2 lakh kyats and
  middle schools received 10 lakh kyats.47
  A consistent story emerged across almost all villages visited in Ayeyarwady Region:
  School headmasters were required to take responsibility for the funds and were




47. The Ministry of Education and donor partners conduct their own, more extensive qualitative and quantitative
assessments of the school grants funding to inform progress of the program.

                             provided with training on the rules of use through their township education office.
                             When interviewing headmasters, researchers were not able to receive clear details
                             on how these funds had been used or whether villagers or the school committees
                             were consulted, as required under the guidelines for administering the grants.
                             Few villagers knew details apart from the fact that the school had received
                             some funding. Researchers reported that in some villages this had created
                             misunderstanding and mistrust of headmasters.

                                                        sizeable fluctuations in QSEM villages in a number of regions/states across rounds.
                                                        Whereas aid in Chin State and, in later rounds, in Magway Region, remained relatively
                                                        constant, there was a sizeable decrease in the number of projects in QSEM villages in
                                                        Mandalay Region in the most recent round. Rakhine State, meanwhile, saw a decrease
                                                        following QSEM 1 and then relatively constant levels of aid after that.
                                                        Two primary factors explain these fluctuations in regions: the shift from humanitarian
                                                        to development assistance and area-based projects with fixed timeframes. In Rakhine
                                                        and Ayeyarwady, aid levels at the commencement of QSEM research were reasonably
                                                        high as villages were still receiving assistance from humanitarian aid providers
                                                        following Cyclone Giri and Cyclone Nargis, respectively. Aid levels documented in
                                                        the third round of research showed a significant decrease as humanitarian assistance
                                                        ended. In each of these areas, this meant that the proportion of projects funded by
                                                        LIFT across the QSEM villages increased, as shown in Figure 16 below.
                                                        The area-based approach combined with fixed project timeframes also explains
                                                        variations across regions. This could be seen most clearly in the significant decreases in
                                                        aid in QSEM villages in Mandalay and Shan. In Mandalay Region, researchers documented
                                                        a reduction from 41 projects in nine villages in QSEM 4 to six projects across the same
                                                        villages in QSEM 5. Similarly, QSEM villages in Shan State experienced a 50 percent

                                                        QSEM 5, approximately 80 percent of projects in QSEM villages across Magway, Rakhine
                                                        and Shan were LIFT projects. There were also few noticeable changes in non-LIFT
                                                        funded projects in these locations except for the cessation of humanitarian projects
                                                        in Rakhine and Ayeyarwady discussed above. This indicates no significant new donor-

Chin State is the main exception, with a range of other donors active in QSEM villages. In
QSEM 5, less than 20 percent of projects in QSEM villages in Chin State were funded
by LIFT. This is the result of historically high donor engagement in Chin State, primarily
because of a combination of high poverty levels and proportionally high international
migration linking villages to international networks. It also represents more recent
investment in Chin State from new initiatives, for example, the 3MDG initiative that
provided health training to all villages in the QSEM sample in the most recent round of
research.

Access to credit and livelihood programs have remained the main types of activities
funded by donors across rounds. Table 13 shows that there has been no significant
change in the types of activities funded by donors across QSEM villages over the
last year. With the exception of access-to-credit programs where there is a significant
overlap, donors targeted different sectors to those in which government is expanding
assistance. Researchers found that approximately a third of both government and
donor programs focused on access to credit. Donors also placed significant focus on
livelihoods, while the government focused on education activities.


LESSONS FROM IMPLEMENTATION OF DONOR PROGRAMS
Researchers have generally identified a high degree of acceptance and demand for
donor programs in QSEM villages. This report has already documented a number of
case studies where donor programs have played an important role in developing
agricultural livelihoods in villages or providing villagers with alternative sources of
income. These examples have included the role of donors in supporting investment in
corn (Village Profile Shan State) and the use of microfinance to support new livelihood
activities (Box 4). Previous reports have also highlighted the importance of cash-for-
work programs in supplementing income when agricultural work is limited, as well as
the important role of donors in instigating investment in agricultural machinery and in
facilitating the move to more permanent agriculture in Chin State.
The types of issues arising from implementation of aid programs have not varied
greatly across rounds. The same types of issues have emerged in relation to
community perceptions and the delivery of aid projects across rounds. This reflects the
fact that projects in QSEM villages have been reasonably consistent, with LIFT projects
dominating and these activities lasting several years, or across several QSEM research
cycles.

The reliance on Village Development Committees (VDC) for implementing activities
has not had an optimal impact on the sustainability of projects. Most projects
established and relied on VDCs to manage implementation at the village level.
Previous reports have highlighted how multiple projects existing in the same village
often function with separate, and at times competing, VDCs. As later rounds of QSEM
research started to cover the completion of project activities in villages, the research
has indicated that VDCs face challenges in closing projects and sustaining their
benefits. Box 23 below provides an example of this in Mandalay Region.



  BOX 23: THE END OF A PROJECT IN MANDALAY REGION FUELS TENSIONS AND
  RESULTS IN ELITE CAPTURE
  In a village in Mandalay Region, village social cohesion was damaged by a dispute
  over the closure of a LIFT-funded project. While this village has always struggled
  with local political division between USDP and NLD supporters, the perception
  among villagers is that the project worsened the situation.
  The project included a community fund and the provision of agricultural
  machinery for village use, as well as the establishment of a VDC to run the
  project at a local level. The VDC leader was from a different political party than
  the village administrator, and over the life of the project tensions between them
  worsened. This was in part driven by perceived favoritism by the VDC leader when
  distributing assistance from the project-supported community funds.
  In November 2014, as the project was winding down, a meeting was held to
  determine how to maintain the materials provided by project and how the
  community fund should be administered. This meeting devolved into an
  argument that was reported to the township, where officials responded by
  sending the police. The VA denied there had been a disturbance.
  Research indicated that, since the end of the program, the VA has retained control
  of the equipment provided through the project. It is unclear whether villagers will
  have access to it once the harvest starts. There are also indications that, since the
  end of the project, there has been no disbursement of the community fund.



To date, there is limited evidence that project mechanisms have supported the
development of stronger village governance structures. As VDCs are created
specifically to administer projects, there is limited evidence that they have supported
the strengthening of village governance structures more broadly. Researchers
documented a small number of examples where donor projects supported the
development of overall development plans for villages, including land-management
plans in several villages in Rakhine State. However, as project structures were
developed predominantly to support the delivery of projects, there was limited
evidence that practices spilled over into broader village governance institutions or
strengthened organizations such as nascent village development support committees.

   Small farmer (Male), Shan State
  “The people from organizations come and stay at this house and end up helping
   just those who live nearby.” – Small farmer (Male), Ayeyarwady Region

Projects could also be strengthened by providing more systematic village-level
information on targeting approaches and accountability mechanisms. As the quotes
above highlight, in some villages people still perceived a lack of information or
transparency in the targeting of projects as an issue. This was particularly the case
when VDCs were dominated by a small number of villagers who distribute project
benefits among their networks, creating the perception that projects are exclusive.
Researchers also identified limited evidence of publicly available project information
that would assist in mitigating these kinds of issues.

CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                               77




At a time of considerable political and economic reform at the national level, the QSEM
research offers unique insights into the impact of the transition in rural Myanmar. Very
few studies have the ability to revisit on a regular basis a sample of villages across a
number of areas to document changes during a period of national-level reform. QSEM
has been doing this for three years, visiting the same 54 villages in three regions and
three states across five research rounds.
In some respects, the changes that have been documented in QSEM rounds have had
considerable impact on the livelihoods of rural villagers.
•	   QSEM has documented improvements in agricultural productivity an
 	   investments in crops in villages in some regions and states. These were the
 	   result of a combination of donor support for agricultural programs, improved
 	   infrastructure providing better access to markets and improved availability of credit
 	   enabling investment in machinery or other agricultural inputs;
•	 Villagers appear to be profiting from opportunities opening up in urban areas. 		
   QSEM has identified a steady increase in the number of migrants, predominantly 	
   young men and women, obtaining work in Yangon. The increase in migration 		
   has, overall, been positively received, enabling families to diversify sources of 		
   income, mitigate limited rural work opportunities in non-peak seasons and invest 	
   remittances in local nonfarm businesses. The increase in numbers of migrants has 	
   also resulted in more cases of people facing abuse or exploitation in the migration 	
   process;
•	 Improved access to a range of government and donor credit products appears to 	
   have reduced the vulnerability of farmers and laborers to predatory interest rates, 	
   providing some respite in household debt;
•	 There have been an almost three-fold increase in government projects or services 	
   in villages covered by QSEM, with particular focus on investments in schools, 		
   access to credit and local infrastructure - albeit starting from a very low base.
There have been other important policy changes, but the ramifications are not yet clear
as they play out locally.
•	 The decision to provide villagers with the ability to register land under new land 		
   laws was perceived as significant across QSEM locations, with high demand for 		
   registration. Since this occurred, however, there have been few noticeable changes 	
   in how villagers transact or manage land and the practical implications of the law 	
   are yet to be apparent;
•	 Significant reforms of village governance structures have occurred across the 		
   country with increased authority placed in the hands of village tract administrators 	
   reducing leadership at the village level. Although these changes are still new, initial 	
   analysis suggests they will have substantial impact on how villages engage with 	
   township authorities and may generate competition between villages.
LIVELIHOODS AND SOCIAL CHANGE IN RURAL MYANMAR 	                                              78




Finally, there are some risks that particular groups may be left out of the transition
process and that the changes will result in growing inequality among villagers.
•	 QSEM reports have consistently documented the declining position of subsistence 	
   and small-scale fishermen in Ayeyarwady, Rakhine and Magway. Across these areas, 	
   small-scale fishermen gave various reasons for their occupation no longer being 	
   viable as they were forced to look for alternative livelihood pursuits;
•	 The research identifies the vulnerability of villages in several areas, in particular 		
   Rakhine State and Magway Region, to persistent weather-related problems, in 		
   particular a lack of regular rainfall;
•	 As households place increased importance on balancing income from a variety
 	 of agricultural, nonfarm and migrant sources, this has also highlighted the 		
   vulnerability of some households who are not sufficiently able to benefit from 		
   these opportunities. In particular, households lacking both capital and productive 	
   labor are limited in their ability to diversify income sources.


RECOMMENDATIONS
There is a clear opportunity to influence a more inclusive and equitable development
process in rural Myanmar. The rapid reforms that have occurred in Myanmar have
produced some positive results. However, there is also room to ensure that the
intentions of reforms, at least as far as they relate to people living in rural Myanmar,
are realized in practice. This will be a challenge. Visible efforts to show a more
responsive government create expectations at the village level. If the efforts are not
followed through with tangible results, it will be increasingly difficult to manage these
expectations. This report puts forward a number of recommendations on how donors
can strengthen the active role they play in development in rural Myanmar.


LIVELIHOODS
The key to identifying opportunities for strengthening livelihoods in rural Myanmar
is to understand how different groups balance a range of livelihood opportunities
and which groups may miss out. As households tend to juggle several different
livelihood activities to make ends meet this provides an opportunity to identify
particular activities with greater prospects of increasing income generation and
support investments in these areas, in the form of skills training, access to capital or
the like. Dependent on the rural context, these opportunities could include improving
agricultural productivity, strengthening the rural nonfarm economy and providing
more secure and beneficial pathways to migration.
The rural context also requires an understanding that not all are able to benefit from
the transitions taking place. Donors can help to establish effective social protection
mechanisms or, based on their understanding of livelihood cycles, invest in the local
economy through cash-for-work infrastructure programs that provide the most
vulnerable with income generating opportunities at key times, such as between
harvests, when limited agricultural opportunities exist.
QSEM SERIES ROUND FIVE REPORT	                                                             79




Land management policies will continue to influence how the livelihoods of different
socio-economic groups are shaped. At this stage, there is little documented evidence
to suggest that changes in land ownership regulations have either improved access to
land for those most in need or resulted in the poor being divested of land ownership.
Given the ongoing efforts to draft a National Land Use Policy, there is a need for
continued monitoring of the impact of government land management policy on
different socio-economic groups across the country.


VILLAGE GOVERNANCE
There is a need to reexamine village governance structures based on the experience
of implementing the new Ward and Village Tract Administration Law to date. There is
increasing evidence that current structures provide insufficient arrangements for active
village participation in development processes. Authority is vested in individual village
tract administrators, who face conflicts in prioritizing between the tract as a whole and
their own villages. There are insufficient avenues for village interests to be represented
either through alternative bodies that can support the work of tract administrators, or
through more public, open participation in general.
Ultimately, there is a need to develop effective governance mechanisms that provide
villages with a voice in their development process and can improve accountability. This
could involve reinvesting authority in the village administrator, or strengthening some
other form of representative body such as village development support committees.
It should also include clear instructions in the provision of information down to the
village level and greater clarity on the roles and responsibilities of different stakeholders.
In parallel, there is a need to encourage good practices in existing village governance
mechanisms. Accountable and participatory structures that already exist should be
used in order to strengthen their legitimacy. At present, projects overly rely on project-
specific governance structures such as village development committees, which
not only have issues relating to sustainability but can also undermine formal village
governance structures. Donors should seek to use pre-existing institutions instead of
creating project-specific mechanisms. This can also be an entry point for embedding
good principles, such as gender representation or transparency and financial reporting,
in structures that already exist.


TOWNSHIP CAPACITY
Implementation of national reforms requires local government officials with sufficient
capacity and resources to be able to follow and act on policy directives. QSEM research
has identified a number of cases in which township-level government does not have
this capacity. Deficiencies have been identified in, among others, the implementation
of fisheries regulations, land transactions following the registration process, and
oversight and accountability of government service delivery.
Moving forward, it will be necessary to focus on the linkages between townships and
villages. This includes ensuring appropriate structures exist to provide information
to the village level, or that village representatives are actively able to participate in

township processes. There is also a need to support government in identifying the
most efficient levels at which to deliver different services and how to subsequently
strengthen those mechanisms. This will require building the capacity of township
officials to understand, implement and monitor reforms as they are rolled out locally.
Donors can also support the work of local institutions by harmonizing their
approaches and working with or through government, thereby reducing transaction
costs government. The prevalence of multiple donor initiatives, often with ad-hoc
management processes, provides challenges for government in coordinating
programs. To the extent possible, donors should seek to build on or strengthen
government initiatives and work through pre-existing institutions.
