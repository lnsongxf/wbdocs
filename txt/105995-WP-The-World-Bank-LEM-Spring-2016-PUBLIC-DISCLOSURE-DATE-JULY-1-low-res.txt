EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
I.	      The geo-economy presents Lebanon with            of the one-off measures that boosted revenues
challenges associated with being a nexus for              in 2014 (e.g., collection of telecom arrears). As a
regional fault lines and risks from its dependence        result, the overall fiscal deficit is estimated to have
on capital inflows. Despite markedly improved             widened by 0.7 percentage points (pp) of GDP in
security conditions since the start of 2015, anxiety      2015, while the primary surplus, which excludes
over regional turmoil and potential spillover effects     interest payments, is estimated to have shrunk by

far, the largest host of Syrian refugees (in proportion   contraction in imports, driven by lower oil prices
to the population). In addition, the economy’s            and a cheaper euro, is estimated to have induced
dependence on its diaspora to finance internal and        a 3.5 pp of GDP narrowing of the current account
external imbalances exposes Lebanon to economic           deficit. This, however, was more than offset by
and political conditions beyond its influence. Despite    lower capital inflows adversely affecting the net
these challenges and risks, the political process         foreign assets’ position of the country. As a result,
remains impaired with the vacant presidency               foreign exchange reserves at Banque du Liban (BdL)
completing its second year with uncertain prospects       declined by 5.4 percent to US$ 30.6 billion by end-
of a near-term resolution. On the other hand, a           2015. Less supportively, falling oil prices, along with
short-term solution has been found to the garbage         the depreciation of the euro, induced price deflation

streets across the country since summer 2015.             GDP growth, driving the debt-to-GDP ratio higher
                                                          by 3.1 pp in 2015 to reach 148.7 percent.
II.	     In 2015, improved security conditions
have been more than offset by a deteriorating             IV.	     The growth outlook remains subdued as
political environment, leading to a further               the Syrian conflict, the domestic political impasse,
slowdown in an already sluggish economy. Bank             and some of the negative effects of falling oil prices
staff revised downward the 2015 real GDP growth           provide significant headwind. In contrast to the
to 1.5 percent from two percent forecast in fall          former drags on growth that have been present for
2015. A resurgent tourism sector and sustained            the past couple of years, the negative impact of low
private lending continued providing a much needed         oil prices are a new development for 2016. As fiscal
push to the economy. The real estate sector, on the       buffers in the GCC countries erode and spending
other hand, acted as a drag, with registration fees       cuts ensue, remittances to Lebanon and services
and cement deliveries contracting in 2015 by 9.4          exports to the GCC (e.g., consulting services) are
percent and 8.6 percent, respectively.                    expected to decelerate. This will impart further
                                                          strain on the balance of payments that is already
III.	   The decline in oil prices has so far had          under pressure due to lower inflows. Consumption,
net positive effects on the Lebanese economy,             which is partially driven by remittances, will also be
freeing up resources to improve both internal             negatively impacted, offsetting the initial increase in
and external balances. Fiscally, lower oil prices         real purchasing power that resulted from lower oil
helped lead a decline in transfers to Electricité         prices. Overall, we project that growth will inch up

term, we expect real GDP growth to be around
2.5 percent. The return to potential output growth
critically hinges on a resolution of the conflict in Syria
as well as a marked improvement in the political
situation in Lebanon.

V.	Spatial industrial policies, most notably
the development of industrial parks and special
economic zones, offer Lebanon a viable tool to
support increased investment and competitiveness
in the industrial sector (Special Focus #1). Under
suitable conditions, industrial zones have proven
successful in various locations and industries across
the world. Benefits can include, the concentration and
specialization of infrastructure, regulatory facilitation
and specialized customs, trade and financial regimes.

VI.	 The geo-economy also presents an
opportunity in the form of tech startup ecosystems,
where communities of entrepreneurs interact,
becoming a viable source for high-skill job creation
in Lebanon (Special Focus #2). Information and
Communications Technology (ICT) has dramatically
reduced the cost of innovation and market access,
allowing small tech entrepreneurs to compete
with established businesses. Lebanon’s tech scene
is becoming increasingly attractive driven by the
example of successful startups that have tapped
regional and global markets. Additionally, innovative
initiatives by the country’s central bank in facilitating
venture capital financing have been notable.

La consommation, partiellement orientée par les

que d’une manière marginale de 1.8 pour cent par
an, soutenue par une réémergence continue du
secteur du tourisme. A moyen terme, la croissance

high levels. During the crisis period of 2011-2015,
however, TD and NRD shares of GDP fell to 5
percent and 4.3 percent, respectively. Despite this
deterioration, Lebanon’s financial sector retains key
advantages. To begin with, exceptionally low global
interest rates preclude competitive alternatives in
international markets. Furthermore, non-resident
deposits, which are largely sourced from Lebanese
expatriates, are resilient to shocks due to the
diaspora’s familiarity with the country’s political
and security volatilities. Additionally, the BdL has
demonstrated its readiness to be the ultimate
guarantor of the financial sector via its large foreign
exchange reserves, and good crisis management
overall.

expatriates from the Gulf countries. In addition to
the human factor, where many Lebanese have made
the Gulf countries their home for decades, the impact
on remittances presents macroeconomic challenges
in the short- to medium-term. In a simulation
exercise of such a shock (Box 1), GDP growth would
be expected to be 2.1 pp lower in the first year,
driven by contracting private consumption. This
would arrive at a time of already sluggish economic
activity causing a contraction in the real GDP growth.
In addition to growth effects, financing needs would
also increase, which would reflect on the debt-to-
GDP ratio.

29.	     Geo-economic risks can be hedged with
geo-economic return. Lebanon’s exposure to risks
associated with the regional turmoil is significant
and growing. A particular concern is macroeconomic
risk emanating from the country’s dependency on
inflows to finance persistent and sizable twin (fiscal
and current account) deficits. The geo-economy
offers untapped possibilities using local resources
and talents that will go some way in mitigating this
dependency. In this issue of the Lebanon Economic
Monitor, we expound on two such prospects. The
first is a project that was recently launched by
the Ministry of Industry for the development of
industrial zones across the country. The second is
the clustering potential for the ICT sector. Both are
important sources of job creation for skilled labor, an
outcome that has evaded post-war Lebanese growth.
They would also be a step toward sustainable growth
since such sectors are less prone to external shocks
compared to Lebanon’s traditional drivers—tourism
and real estate. Furthermore, human and financial
capital can be tapped locally, while the export market
is a realizable potential, enfeebling the dependence
on capital inflows and lessening balance of payments
risks. Such a vision is necessary for Lebanon to exit a
socially and economically bankrupt model, whereby
human capital is exported in return for inflows
that finance rent-seeking activities that aggravate
imbalances.

                             Box 1. A Simulation for the Economic Impact of Lower Remittances.


  This box presents an analysis on the economic implications of a large decline in remittances, given the possibility
  of mass termination of contracts for of Lebanese expatriates from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries.
  This has become a primary concern fueled not only by rumors but also small scale dismissals of Lebanese
  expatriates primarily from the UAE. To do so, the World Bank’s macro-fiscal framework is used to simulate one such
  “termination” scenario, which is then compared to the baseline scenario* that does not assume a mass dismissal.
  In those simulations, the main channels through which lower remittances will impact the Lebanese economy are
  through (i) more stressed balance of payments and (ii) a decline in private consumption as expatriates tend to
  support their families living in Lebanon.**
  To explore the relationship between remittances and consumption, we run three different Autoregressive Distributed
  Lag (ARDL) models, each with a separate dependent variable that proxies for private consumption: VAT revenues,
  cleared checks and the number of new passenger car sales. In each of these regressions, our main explanatory
  variable is the amount of remittances sourced from the quarterly bulletins of Lebanon’s central bank, the Banque
  du Liban (BdL). In addition, we control for economic activity using the World Bank Coincident Indicator Index. To
  perform our analysis, we use quarterly data between Q1-2009 and Q4-2014, where all the variables are transformed
  into log terms after being seasonally adjusted.
  In summary, our estimation results suggest that a one percent increase in the q-o-q growth of remittances, is
  associated with a statistically significant 0.08 (0.16) percent increase in the q-o-q growth of VAT revenues (number
  of new passenger car sales) with a four- (two-) quarter lag. On the other hand, when using cleared checks as a
  dependent variable, the remittances’ coefficient is found to be statistically insignificant. To quantify the impact on
  private consumption, we take the average of the two significant coefficients, such that a one percent increase in the
  growth of remittances is associated with a 0.12 percent increase in private consumption growth. Consequently,
  a large drop in remittances’ inflows in 2016, which in this simulation we assume it to be at 20 percent of GDP,
  will lower our baseline private consumption growth projection by 2.4 pp of GDP. Given that private consumption
  accounted for an estimated 85 percent of GDP in 2015, a 20 percent decline in remittances is estimated to induce a
  2.04 pp fall in the projected GDP growth, relative to the baseline.
  Under the termination scenario, GDP growth would be expected to be reduced by 2.1 pp, 0.7 pp and 0.3 pp in 2016,
  2017 and 2018, respectively, compared to the baseline (Table 1 below). In addition, and compared to the baseline
  scenario, lower remittances will reduce the growth of VAT revenues relative to GDP by 0.3 pp, 0.5 pp and 0.3 pp
  in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively, driving an equal widening of the fiscal deficit. In parallel, lower remittances
  will have an adverse impact on the current account balance, which is projected to deteriorate beyond the baseline
  projections by further one pp of GDP, 0.8 pp of GDP and 0.5 pp of GDP over the next three years. Gross reserves are
  also expected to be negatively affected over the medium term. Finally, and due to lower growth and larger financing
  needs, debt as a ratio of GDP will increase, compared to the baseline scenario, by an additional 6.7 pp, 9 pp and 7.2
  pp in 2016, 2017 and 2018, respectively.

                  Box 2. Lessons learned from international experiences with industrial parks and SEZ.

•	   Comparative advantage: Successful industrial parks often cater to specific industrial clusters. Where
     zone initiatives have been successful is where the emphasis has been on: i) industrial clusters that are in
     line with national or regional comparative advantage; and ii) where they are clearly linked into a wider
     national industrial strategy. Examples include Bangladesh and many of the EPZs in Central America, which
     built infrastructure to support a specific global positioning in the apparel sector. By contrast, less success-
     ful zone initiatives in many parts of Africa have ended up catering to a diverse set of capital intensive sec-
     tors that mainly served to facilitate imports.

•	   Strategic locations: Industrial parks and SEZs are most successful when they take advantage of strategic
     locations. This typically includes metropolitan regions and key trade-related infrastructure, but can also
     include locations with good access to immobile, strategic (typically, natural) resources. By contrast, many
     countries that have launched programs have attempted to use part of the program as a regional develop-
     ment tool, to attract investment into ‘lagging’ or peripheral regions. Many countries, including Turkey,
     Thailand, Russia, South Africa, and Bangladesh among others, have found that while industrial parks flour-
     ished in favorable locations, they languished in less favorable ones, even when additional fiscal incentives
     were on offer.

•	   Critical infrastructure: While most zones offer infrastructure that is of higher quality than is typically
     available in the country, in some cases (for example in some zones in Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal) infra-
     structure inside the zones is a mirror of the worst experiences in the country more widely, including water
     shortages, electricity failures, and health, safety, and environmental shortfalls. Thus, zone development
     must prioritize critical supporting infrastructure – both inside and outside the industrial park – along with
     or even ahead of the development of land and factory shells. This is what is referred to in China’s industrial
     parks as “five connections and a levelling” – power, water, telecommunications, roads, and ports, along
     with basic land preparation – as the fundamental infrastructural responsibility of governments in industrial
     zone development.
•	   Regulatory simplification: Successful industrial parks not only offer facilitation through ‘one-stop’ investor
     services but actually simplify the requirements and procedures involved in business start-up, construction,
     and operations. This can be done through legal mechanisms that actual change the regulatory require-
     ments of firms operating within zones, as is the case in many SEZ programs. But it can also be achieved
     through concerted efforts to improve procedures within each relevant agency. In this regard, one can look
     to reforms in Chinese industrial parks to see an example of successfully married process reengineering and
     automation of business compliance burdens, resulting in significant reductions in administrative process-
     ing times – see, for example, the ‘Digital Beijing Initiative’ of the Zhongguancun e-Park in Beijing.

•	   Role of the private sector: While many successful industrial zone programs have been led by govern-
     ment, commercial orientation and private sector participation in development and operation of successful
     zones is often critical to ensure speed of implementation, financial risk-sharing, technical expertise, and
     appropriate market signals. Fiscal, customs, and other incentives must be designed to attract the right kind
     of productivity-enhancing investments rather than short-term or rent-seeking investments.

•	   Regulatory autonomy and coordination: While a number of regulatory models exist for overseeing
     industrial parks, the most effective approach tends to be establishing a single national regulatory author-
     ity (rather than individual zone authorities) that is independent from an individual ministry. This provides
     autonomy and minimizes political interference. Examples here include the industrial zone and free zone
     regimes in Thailand, Costa Rica, Dominican Republic, Jordan, Philippines, and Korea. It is also critical, in
     cases where more than one zone program exists, to ensure a formal mechanism exists to facilitate coordi-
     nation.

•	   Local economy linkages: Particularly in SEZs and industrial zone initiatives targeting foreign investors,
     active efforts should be made to promote linkages between zone-based firms and the domestic economy,
     including suppliers and labor markets. Initiatives may include local supplier development, job training, and
     technology transfer programs. Regulatory improvements in the local economy outside the zones can also
     be critical to enable local firms to respond to the new opportunities offered by zone investments.

  Thailand’s industrial estates law guarantees provision by government and state-owned utilities of offsite infrastructure
  up to the entrance to an industrial estate, while the developer or factory owner, in the case of a private zone, must
  fund and carry out all onsite development. Thailand’s law, however, does not guarantee immediate provision of
  off-site infrastructure, and development of offsite infrastructure might not take place for several years according to
  various agencies’ and parastatals’ budgets and plans for development of roads, power lines, and water systems. The
  law does allow a private developer to accelerate the development schedule, especially for electricity and water, by
  providing immediate funding for the requested development, which is reimbursed over time once industrial estate
  tenants begin to purchase power and water and sanitation services.
  The option for private financing of offsite infrastructure in Thailand, together with the potential delays if government
  funds are required, provide a powerful incentive for developers to situate their industrial estates close to major roads,
  ports, power plants, and/or rail lines. Though free to do otherwise, developers will have to carefully weigh and incur
  the costs and delays of doing so. These costs, however, will be borne entirely by the private developer so will have
  little or no effect on approval decisions by government.

                                             Box 4. A tale of two programs in India.


  In India, the government has strongly promoted the use of SEZs. Between 2005 and 2012, fully 580 SEZs were
  approved, but only 124 became operational, and most of those were IT office parks under 20 hectares. Many were
  speculative investments spurred by the ability of SEZs to make compulsory purchases of land ‘in the public interest’.
  Relatedly, a scheme for apparel industry parks offered generous grants of up to 75% of infrastructure costs, but ran
  into problems (with only two built in total): government picked locations, and the parks risk being ‘white elephants’.
  The parks were simply not relevant enough for the private sector.
  India’s more recent Scheme for Integrated Textile Parks (SITPs) has taken a more collaborative approach. Government
  doesn’t pick the locations, but instead invites prospective firms upfront, and then underwrites firms who collectively
  pick a location and construct common infrastructure. The firms themselves have to put in equity and take out loans
  for at least half the cost, and the government funds the remaining cost with grants. The grants are performance-
  based and come in 5-6 tranches as the firms complete the park and show they’re serious. Since 2005, about 40 of
  these parks are either under construction or operational. By 2013, private investments had reached four times the
  amount of government grant disbursals, and approximately 42,000 jobs had been created, at a cost of approximately
  R150,000 per job.
  The program has also had the effect of ensuring that developments take place only in the most attractive locations
  and avoids the problems of long-delayed investment or dormancy that was common in the SEZ program. This was
  achieved by requiring that to receive government grants, the group of private entrepreneurs looking to develop the
  park are required to form a special purpose vehicle (SPV). The grant is disbursed only after the SPV, procures and
  pays for the land at the chosen location. Thus, prospective investors have to put their own money at stake to buy the
  land – this helps ensure public investment flows to locations with demonstrated private sector financing in place.

                                       Box 5. China’s industrial parks - infrastructure ++


  China has had one of the largest and most successful networks of industrial parks, with more than 900 zones employing
  40 million people*. Beyond the high profile SEZs, the success of China’s program has been the development of
  smaller-scale industrial parks, catering mainly to the SME sector. Such zones have included many highly specialized
  clusters (‘specialty cities’ focusing on specific products like footwear, toys, etc.) that link SMEs with each as well as
  upstream and downstream along the value chain.
  The recipe for these industrial parks starts with basic industrial infrastructure, but goes well beyond it. All industrial
  parks are provided with the standard ‘five connections and a levelling’, including energy, water, telecommunications,
  roads and ports, along with land preparation. They also typically include low cost factory shells, security, and often
  low cost (or free) workers accommodation adjacent to the factories. This is supported in most industrial parks with
  technical training and technology transfer facilities.
  Taken together, the offering helps overcome many of the barriers to SME investment and growth by providing a ‘plug
  and play’ environment that minimizes investment requirements and risks.

  China famously used their SEZs, particularly Shenzhen, to as experimental ‘laboratories’ for economic reforms
  that would have been politically risky to adopt on the national level. Sweeping reforms were introduced through
  Shenzhen, including the abolition of price controls, the introduction of the first labor contracts along with pensions
  and labor insurance, the privatization of SOEs, and opening up the banking system to foreign investment. Most
  recently, the government is piloting full flotation of the Yuan in the Shenzhen SEZ.
  Mauritius used their EPZ regime over several decades as a bulwark for reform, introducing labor reforms and gradually
  shifting the economy’s focus from import substitution to export promotion. Indeed, with its most recent ‘duty-free
  island’ initiative, it is clear that the reforms once started inside the EPZs have now encompassed the country.

                  Box 7. The conflicts of multiple and overlapping zone regimes - the case of Vietnam.


 Vietnam has embraced the concept of industrial zone development, creating an estimated 223 industrial and Export
 Processing Zones, 13 Coastal Economic Zones, 26 Bordergate Economic Zones, two High-Tech Zones and 600
 small-and-medium-enterprise industrial parks since 1991. Vietnam’s wide range of zone types is however governed
 by a complex regulatory structure that crosses a number of national ministries and agencies and includes significant
 roles for subnational entities.
 At the highest level, the Ministry of Planning and Investment (MPI) is responsible for Export Processing Zones,
 Industrial parks, and (Coastal) Economic Zones; the Ministry of Trade has primary jurisdiction over Bordergate
 Economic Zones; the Ministry of Science over High-Tech Zones; and the Ministry of Agriculture over High-Tech
 Agriculture Zones. In addition, the SME industrial parks / clusters are regulated at the provincial level and do not
 report in to any ministry. Export Processing Zones were defined at Law as being ‘governed under central authority,’
 yet the MPI is responsible for preparing master plans in consultation with provincial People’s Committees and are
 administered by individual EPZ Management Committees, while industrial parks are administered by Industrial Zone
 Management Boards. While a 2008 law aimed to simplify the network by creating single, provincial management
 committees for all types of SEZs, multiple exceptions were made and new complexities introduced.
 In the case of Vietnam competition across government Ministries, combined with a tendency to ‘decentralize the
 details,’ contributed to unnecessary complexity. Although this decentralization was effective in some respects
 (creating healthy competition amongst provinces), it also contributed to a proliferation of zones models. The
 regulatory differences between each are often small; the important difference being who controls them (the Prime
 Minister directly, various Ministries, provinces, etc.). This has led to a complex array of choice (and scope for
 bargaining) for investors, resulting in a politicized process, with many inefficient investments getting approval.



Avoid proliferation and ensure
coordination

75.	     Finally, as Lebanon pursues the
opportunities to develop industrial parks and
SEZs, careful coordination among ministries will
be critical to success. As noted previously, various
initiatives related to industrial parks and SEZs have
been launched by, among others the Ministry
of Industry, IDAL, the Prime Minister, and the
Central Bank, as well as by the private sector (e.g.
Association of Lebanese Industrialists). By and large
these initiatives have been uncoordinated and not
linked to any national industrial policy. This creates
a risk of proliferation, overlaps, and even conflicts
that could undermine the overall effectiveness of
the initiatives.

      Lebanon’s history of involvement with the creative industries—media, design and fashion—can have important
      linkages to the tech sector and be leveraged to widen the scope and appeal of the ecosystem.
      Berytech launched the Beirut Creative Cluster in 2012 as a support mechanism for creative industries, particularly
      media.(b) It aims to help entrepreneurs working in design, content and digital media through business development. It
      works closely with Beirut Design Week (BDW), the largest design festival in MENA, taking place in the city every year.
      The event brings together thousands of visitors “to strengthen the creative economies, develop entrepreneurship,
      and promote Lebanon’s innovative culture.”(c) BDW 2015 included a session on the maker movement and the use
      of digital fabrication for creating affordable designs. One of the speakers was Guillaume Crédoz a freelance architect
      and designer who founded FreshlyBakedToday, a 3D printing hub in a former bakery in Beirut’s Mar Mikhayel
      neighborhood featuring a workshop and gallery for digitally fabricated artifacts.(d) Crédoz launched MENA’s largest
      3D printer during BDW, designed and built in Lebanon.(e) Incidentally, Crédoz’s 3D printers were used for the first
      model of Instabeat’s swimming monitor, nominated for a design award for wearable technologies.(f)
      Beirut has often been described as the region’s most fashionable city with over 40 fashion businesses.(g) Many of the
      country’s budding fashion entrepreneurs look to Lebanon’s Elie Saab, founder of a globally recognized fashion house,
      for inspiration.(h) Technology plays a growing role in the fashion value chain, linking textile producers to designers
      and merchandizers to consumers. Collaborations between the fashion world of designers, photographers, models
      and the entrepreneurs and web designers from the tech world can spur creativity:
         “Fashion and creative industries such as the textiles and clothing, footwear, and leather sectors, operate at
         the crossroads between arts, business, and technology. They are in a strategic position to link creativity to
         innovation at a time when culture-based creativity is an essential feature of business innovation in the new
         economy.”(i)
      The link between creative industries and tech is starting to have an impact. Beirut is considered the website design
      capital of the Arab world20 and fashion startup Mistile won the Pan Arab Web Award for best e-commerce site.21
      If the ecosystem can successfully exploit the country’s creative tradition, Lebanon could carve a niche as MENA’s
      creative industry tech hub.

                                      Box 9. World Bank tech ecosystem support for Lebanon.


  The World Bank Group (WBG) has been actively supporting the tech startup ecosystem in Lebanon. It is currently
  implementing the iSME project to support equity investment for financially viable, new and existing innovative firms.*
  The key beneficiaries of the project are potential and existing entrepreneurs with new commercial ideas, many of
  whom would otherwise seek opportunity abroad, and existing SMEs that are on the verge of expansion. The project
  will finance the iSME funding program, which will provide concept grants to stimulate the generation of ideas and
  equity investment to support early stage growth. The project was ratified by Parliament in October 2014.
  The WBG also designed the Mobile Internet Ecosystem Project (MIEP), which despite its eventual cancellation,
  included in the preparation stages testing for the supported mechanism established in its design and the co-creation
  of the Mobile Innovation Hub (MiHub) with the ecosystems stakeholders, resulting in a neutral forum for the
  ecosystems to coordinate their actions and programs. The original MIEP objective was to strengthen innovation
  and entrepreneurship in the Lebanese wireless space.** Components included skills development, bolstering the
  mobile Internet industry through a Mobile Internet Hub (MiHub) and enhancing the enabling environment. The
  project was approved by the Council of Ministers but is pending Parliamentary ratification. In the meantime, the
  Ministry of Telecommunications and the Bank are developing actions to establish the MiHub and build a community
  of stakeholders.
  In addition to these activities, the International Finance Corporation (IFC) has engaged in one equity investment (US$
  2 million) in a Lebanese mobile software firm, Mobinets.***

                                     Box 10. A Central Bank Keen About Tech Startups.

  Banque du Liban (BdL) is one of the most pro tech startup central bank in the world. Its Circular 331 is a groundbreaking
  initiative for pumping funding into the tech ecosystem. BdL’s partial tech investment guarantee has reduced the
  venture capital gamble particularly critical for Lebanon that has a high country risk rating.* BdL’s support does
  not stop there. An ardent supporter of the ecosystem, BdL has been active in other aspects of the ecosystem. This
  includes organizing networking happenings such as hosting the annual Accelerate event and collaborating with the
  overseas Startup Lebanon conferences. Lebanon’s central bank has also cooperated with others on the UK Tech Hub
  and Smart ESA acceleration facilities. In addition, BdL has published several reports on the country’s tech startup
  environment. The rational for BdL’s support is that the tech sector contributes to high value added and generation of
  wealth, driving economic growth in a sustainable way.

                                      Box 11. Rapid Tech Skills Training for Employability.


  Coding boot camps can result in rapid employability when a startup ecosystem is matured enough to generate
  employment. As tech startup grow, they require talent to support technical tasks. However, the costs of skilled talent
  or of in-house training can be prohibitive for startups. These are often basic tech tasks (e.g., web development,
  programing, etc.) that can be learnt in structured programs lasting a few months. Coding boot camps provide such
  structured programs. They are typically linked with the local demand to provide practical learning and address
  employers’ needs. In a mature ecosystem, such as New York, the employment rate of coding boot camps is over 90
  percent.
  To understand the applicability of coding boot camps to employment in emerging countries, the World Bank is
  currently undertaking an activity on Rapid Skills Technology Training for Youth Employment. The activity’s goal is to
  identify the key success factors for rapid employability and to test this approach for low-income youths in Beirut as
  well as Medellin, Colombia and Nairobi, Kenya.

                        Box 12. Municipal Governments as Catalyzers of Entrepreneurship Ecosystems.


  Municipal governments have the potential to catalyze local innovation through open processes for public and social
  challenges. An example is the activity developed by the World Bank and the Government of Chile in Gran Concepcion,
  a city of about one million inhabitants located south of Santiago, the capital of the country.
  The initiative introduced open innovation processes in the municipal government of Gran Concepcion by training
  officials in these methodologies and developing an open competition with university students to address social
  challenges in the transportation sector. The challenge included questions such as “how to improve the quality of
  public transportation?” or “how to foster the use of alternative modes of transportations, other than cars (e.g.,
  bicycle, etc.)?”
  This resulted in startup projects addressing public transport challenges that were tested and adopted by the municipal
  government. More importantly, the activity served to kick-start the tech startup ecosystem in the city (which did not
  exist before) through continuing the process of open innovation for urban and local challenges. The city developed
  a local innovation hub and continues to develop competitions on public and social challenges creating additional
  batches of entrepreneurs and attracting university students into developing startups in the city.

A Sovereign Wealth Fund for Lebanon: Issues and
Preliminary Recommendations (Special Focus 1):
As Lebanon contemplates prospects of sizeable
hydrocarbon discoveries, the country is in the process
of designing an institutional framework to manage
these resources. One such issue is the establishment
of a Sovereign Wealth Fund (SWF), as required by the
2010 Hydrocarbon Law. This Special Focus provides
an overview of the various types of SWFs that have
been established across countries, draws lessons
from these experiences, highlights some pitfalls, and
presents preliminary recommendations for Lebanon
as it moves towards establishing its SWF. Key
among these recommendations is that the Lebanese
SWF’s design should include (i) integration with
the budget system, (ii) some (limited) flexibility in
operational rules, (iii) no (or limited) earmarking but
no extra-budgetary spending, (iv) coherence with
country investment strategy, and (v) transparency
and accountability.

New Coincident and Leading Indicators for the
Lebanese Economy (Special Focus 2): Weak economic
statistics in Lebanon impede economic analysis
and decision making. To remedy this, World Bank
staff developed two indicators of economic activity
for Lebanon: a coincident indicator (WB-CI) and a
leading indicator (WB-LI). These indicators, which
are based on an expanded NBER-Conference Board
methodology, reveal promising statistical properties
that should make them valuable coincident and
leading (one-year ahead) indicators for the Lebanese
economy. Based on these indicators, GDP growth for
2012 and 2013 is estimated to be, respectively, 2.2
