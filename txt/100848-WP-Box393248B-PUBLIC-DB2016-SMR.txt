THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business

permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Figure 1.5 How far has San Marino come in the areas measured by Doing Business?

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

      Economic Operator Code. While in the case of a legal person, it is

      Obtain the construction permit

      BuildCo must file a request for the construction permit at the
      Ufficio Urbanistica under the Segreteria di Stato per il Territorio,
      l’Ambiente e l’Agricoltura. The following documentation needs to
      be attached to the request:

      - Project documents
      - Map (allibramento)
      - Proof of ownership (partite)
      - Relazione sulla fattibilita’ strutturale
      - Attestato di conformità del progetto alle norme energetiche
      vigenti

      When the request is processed, the Ufficio Urbanistica will notify
      BuildCo about the total cost for obtaining the permit. Once
      notified by the Ufficio Urbanistica of the amount due, BuildCo
4     has to pay the Tassa di Concessione Edilizia. This is done at a         90 days     EUR 105,148
      bank.

      As per the Piano Regolatore Generale of 1992 the amount due
      equals 8% of the construction cost. This construction cost
      estimates are updated by Decrees of the Commission for
      Territorial Policies (Commissione per le Politiche Territoriali). The
      estimates depend on the intended use of the construction
      (destinazione d’uso). The category that applies to the Doing
      Business case-study is category D5 (Wholesale activities -
      Commercio all’ingrosso). As per the latest Decree the estimated
      construction cost is EUR 1,010.5683086 per square meter. U1 and
      U2 (oneri di urbanizzazione primaria e secondaria) are not due as
      it is assumed that this is an area of Intervento Diretto.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

Note: Doing Business continues to collect data on the number of documents needed to trade internationally. Unlike in previous
years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

                          claims proposed by the debtor at the beginning of the filing ("concordato") or
                               the company is liquidated piecemeal if the debtor’s proposal is rejected
                                                             ("fallimento").
                              In San Marino, a "fallimento" would be the most likely option, as it is the
                         procedure that applies more commonly to small and medium size companies in
                          financial distress. Very few reorganizations "concordati" are actually approved.


                             Even if it is very likely that the company will continue operating after filing for
                             insolvency ("concordato preventivo") to maximize the value of the assets, the
                                 "fallimento" always implies the sale of the business piecemeal, and the
Outcome piecemeal sale
                              concordato will almost always imply the liquidation too. Therefore, once the
                                "fallimento" is declared, the business will stop operating and will be sold
                                                                  piecemeal.

                                  Assuming a reorganization attempt ("concordato preventivo") that is then
                            rejected and liquidation ("fallimento") starts, our estimates indicate that the total
                                 time that this case would take would be 2.3 years. Within this estimate, the
                             "concordato preventivo" would take approximately 1,3 years, including the time

score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
