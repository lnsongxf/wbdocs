Connecting Voices (CV) Middle East and North Africa (MENA) is a
regional initiative and partnership that promotes governance and
improved financial management practices in the public and private
sectors. The ultimate aim is to support the demands of citizens
throughout the Arab World for jobs, better governance, a voice in
public affairs, and social and economic inclusion as reflected in the
World Bank’s MENA Regional strategy. CV MENA plans to seize on the
windows of opportunity available in the region. It will support capacity
building in the area of governance, facilitate the development of a
professional community, as well as the sharing and transfer of
knowledge both within countries and within the region as a whole. CV

In today’s world, international aid is fickle,
financial flows unstable, and many donor
countries are facing domestic economic
crises themselves, driving them to apply
resources inward. In this environment,
developing countries need inner strength.
They need inner stability. And they deserve
the right to chart their own futures. This is
within their grasp, and last week the launch
of an unassuming-but-powerful tool marked
an important step forward in this quiet
independence movement. It’s called the
TADAT, or Tax Administration Diagnostic
Assessment Tool. At first glance, this tool
may look inscrutable, technical, and
disconnected from development. But
listen. Research shows that if developing
countries could simply increase their tax
collection by 2 percent to 4 percent of GDP,
the amount they raised would eclipse the
amount of foreign aid they are receiving. This
small relative increase would represent
three times the amount of official
development assistance distributed in the        target: “Strengthen domestic resource             transparency, the percentage of taxpayers

                  Procurement Solutions for Iraqi Education

While the Iraqi education system was widely
regarded as one of the best in the Middle
East and enjoyed near-universal primary
enrollment until the 1980s, the next decade
marked a serious downturn in results.
Beginning in the 1990s, the education
system in Iraq deteriorated sharply as two
decades of conflict and economic sanctions
took their toll. The sector witnessed low
primary and secondary enrollment and
attendance, outdated curriculum content,
and deteriorating learning outcomes. Behind
this was a collapse in public investment in
education and a resulting standstill in policy
and system development in the sector.

After the 2003 regime change, the new
government had many critical service
delivery needs and was struggling to meet          realism, effective risk management, and         •   The inability of Bank staff to supervise

The measures taken included:
• Opening the market to international
  competition: Based on the assessment of
  the capacity of the local printing industry
  to deliver large quantities of textbooks
  within a very short timeframe, the
  decision was made to use both
  International Competitive Bidding (ICB)
  and National Competitive Bidding (NCB)
  procedures. The Bank used regional
  newspaper          advertisements         (in
  neighboring countries) and other methods
  to attract new suppliers to take part in the
  bidding process for textbook printing.
  Procurement was carefully packaged to
  encourage international as well as local
  bids.

     Through the Development of Internal Audit Functions in the Public Sector

Specialist.

The year 2015 was quite a turbulent and
unstable year in the Middle East and North
Africa (MENA) Region. It was also a year of
interesting milestones for the internal audit
practice. The failure to provide the expected
levels of public services combined with
insufficient progress on development
agendas in some countries have contributed
to an increase in the awareness by high
public officials and civil societies of the
necessity of finding internal assurance
systems and sound internal controls.
Governance specialists consider the
development of internal audit (following
international standards and best practices)
in MENA countries, vital for efforts to reform
public financial management (PFM). Good
internal audit practices help to ensure
economy, cost-effective internal controls,
transparency and accountability of PFM

   World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim Congratulates Tunisia
                   on the 2015 Nobel Peace Prize
 World Bank Group President Jim Yong Kim
 congratulated the Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet
 on being awarded the 2015 Nobel Prize for Peace in Stockholm, Sweden:

               "The Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet embodied the spirit of the Nobel Peace Prize
                       through their tireless efforts to promote a more inclusive society and
                  advance the full potential of all Tunisians after the Jasmine Revolution of 2011.
                        Tunisia demonstrated to the world the value of building institutions
                                   that allow the broadest participation of society,
                      showing that people can come together to resolve political challenges
                                         through compromise and consensus.
                 The National Dialogue Quartet was instrumental to this remarkable achievement.
                           The Nobel Peace Prize is a fitting recognition of the social and

other international benchmarks for
improving the outcomes for students in
learning and qualification.

across Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle
East to implement or improve a PQ.

Michael Wells
Director, IFRS Education Initiative, IASB

In May 2015 the International Accounting
Standards Board (IASB) made a limited
number of changes to the International
Financial Reporting Standard for Small and
Medium-sized Entities (IFRS for SMEs). The
amendments are effective for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2017.
However, earlier application is permitted.

This paper discusses the changes made and
draws attention to the support being
prepared for those affected by them.

The significant decline in oil prices with little
prospect of near-term reversal is prompting
many hydro-carbon rich states in the Middle
East to look for expenditure savings
wherever they can find them. In Qatar, the
Emir Tamim bin Hamad al-Thani noted in the
2016 budget discussions that citizens should
no longer be dependent upon the state “to
provide for everything” and argued that the
new budget will focus on efficiency in
government spending. In October 2015,
Kuwait’s Emir called for “speedy actions to
adopt serious and fair measures” to
complete economic reforms and reduce
public expenditures. In November, the IMF
warned that the Saudis, Omanis and
Bahrainis need to adjust their spending or
they risk running out of financial assets
within the next five years.[2] Governments
throughout the GCC and beyond are
responding to these challenges in a variety of
ways. Some are looking to delay major               efficiency units in the center of                 mechanisms, making modest changes in

We know corruption in developing countries affects poor people the most. It also impacts firms in many ways. Here are five charts showing how
corruption is affecting businesses from South Asia to Sub-Saharan Africa. These charts are based on surveys of more than 13,000 firms in 135
countries, by World Bank Enterprise Surveys. It collects data directly from firms to study an economy’s private sector.

Criteria Guidelines have been prepared by
the PIM Technical Practice to assist public
administration officials in drafting and
prioritizing their development (investment)
project requests. Transparent project
selection and evaluation selection criteria
should be agreed and established prior to
the preparation, and funding, of
development project requests.            By
articulating the project selection criteria
upfront, project funding should more tightly
align to the needs of citizens, and service
delivery should significantly improve.

Goldman Sachs described it as “the petroleum of the next century”. Water is also a global
development challenge. OECD estimates tell us that by 2050 water demand will rise by 55%
and that 240 million people will remain without access to clean water and 1.4 billion with
access to basic sanitation services. With the global community having set the Sustainable
Development Goal on Water and Sanitation (SDG 6) to achieve“ universal and equitable access
to safe and affordable drinking water for all and adequate and equitable sanitation and
hygiene for all by 2030, the challenge of managing water resources is none too soon.

financing of hydraulic infrastructure,

to services, or promoting institutional
change in the way water is delivered. But, at
all times our focus is on the relationship
between water and the welfare of nations –
what we call “water-writ-large” – and the

institutional changes in water can be the
leading edge of broader governance reforms
in terms of accountability to citizens. The
operation has embedded, in a significant
way, the empowerment of local service
providers, transparency with regard to
performance assessments and incentives,
and citizen engagement in ways that many
saw as unattainable as recently as six months
ago. What we have learned from this
operation and what we want to replicate in
other countries in MENA and globally is the
need to approach water sector reform from
a governance perspective. The unofficial
motto of the Water GP is “Don’t focus on
fixing the pipes, but rather focus on fixing the
institutions which fix the pipes”. So, instead,
we approach the overall sector and assess
how good governance is incentivized in the
overall water service delivery system in
terms of downward accountability to
customers/citizens          and         upward
accountability     to     shareholders      and
regulators. Based on this assessment, we
provide governments with global examples
of countries which have worked through the
implementation of needed policy and
institutional reforms in terms of the
technical and political economy aspects. We
are pursuing similar work with the
Governance team in Tunisia, where this is
part of a broader state-owned enterprise
(SOE) reform. We are also opening up
dialogue space for this ambitious approach
with other countries in the MENA region.

 From Across the World Bank          COVER STORY
       Modernizing Uzbekistan’s Water Sector
               with Citizen Engagement
Uzbekistan     has     made       substantial
investments in upgrading its water supply
and sanitation (WSS) services over the past
decade, amassing the largest public
borrowing portfolio for WSS projects of any
country in Central Asia. Despite such
progress, the country’s citizens continue to
face challenges in accessing clean and
reliable water services. For instance, the
households of more than half the population
(roughly 31 million people) remain
unconnected to a piped water system.

The Government of Egypt (GoE) launched
the National Rural Sanitation Program
(NRSP) in 2014 as a Presidential priority
program to address the challenge of critically
low sanitation coverage levels in particular in
the Nile Delta area with huge health impacts
on the poorest population: only 12 percent
of rural Egypt currently has access to the
sewage network. As one of the key partners
of the GoE in the rural sanitation sector, the
Bank is working to support the GoE to
achieve its development priority to increase
access to improved sanitation services - yet
now with a different approach. Given the
marked weak sector performance to date,
including       for      example        severe
implementation delays of infrastructure

Paul Prettitore
Senior Public Sector Specialist

The Arab Spring and its aftermath have
inspired much discussion of the social
contracts that have defined the relationship
between citizens and the state in the Arab
world. In the past, the typical social contract
of a state in the Middle East or North Africa
broadly afforded that citizens would be
provided jobs and public services, and
presumably political stability, in return for
limiting civil liberties that could be used to
challenge governing regimes. The political
transition in Morocco has provided space for
addressing civil liberties in the debate on
new social contracts. Moroccans, like many
in the MENA region, have long resented that
attempts to fully exercise civil liberties could
result in heavy-handed responses by security
services and courts. Activists, journalists, and

                         Morocco
        Making Government more Accountable to Citizens
Fabian Seiderer
Senior Public Sector Specialist

The World Bank recently announced a
US$200 million operation to support ongoing
reforms in Morocco to make government
more efficient and more accountable to its
citizens.     The     Transparency        and
Accountability Development Policy Loan
(DPL) is the second operation of a
comprehensive program designed to assist
the government in laying the foundations for
meeting the governance goals outlined in the
new Constitution. The new Constitution
responded to public discontent over poor
service delivery and government institutions
that were out of reach to ordinary citizens.

matters now, however, is that Moroccans see
the results of change, and that reforms lead
to greater participation of citizens in public
life.”

The program, also titled Hakama, or
‘Governance’ in Arabic, is a joint effort with
the European Union and the African
Development Bank who have both
contributed a further US$250 million in
support of the budget, procurement and
open governance reforms. In parallel with
the financial support, Hakama provides
technical assistance to the central and local
governments as well as to the Parliament for
the implementation of the governance
reforms, including training on performance
budgeting, monitoring and evaluation, fiscal
decentralization and citizen engagement.

“The translation of these new constitutional
governance rights and principles into specific
laws and policies is a key milestone of the
program” said Fabian Seiderer, World Bank
Public Sector Specialist and task team leader
of the program. “The next phase will focus on
the implementation of these policies with a
view to improving the quality of public
services to Moroccans and allowing citizens
to make effective use of these new rights.”

         Overhauling a Fragmented Identification System
Diego Angel-Urdinola
Senior Economist

For years, Morocco has relied on multiple
identity systems, each highly developed in its
own way. In the late 1970s, the government
introduced a national identity system. This
was replaced in 2008 with an electronic
identification system, Carte Nationale
d’Identité     Electronique     (CNIE)    with
approximately 20 million electronic ID cards
issued to date. Besides CNIE, Morocco’s
identification systems include the civil
registry which records births and deaths, the
National Register of Children (MASSAR), a
completely electronic system that manages
aspects of the scholastic life of children, the
RAMED database (introduced in 2011), a free
medical insurance program for the poor, and        subsidy. Through RAMED, the government            National Population Register (NPR) with a

Le Budget Participatif est défini souvent
comme « un processus de démocratie
directe à travers lequel les citoyens décident
de manière souveraine et indépendante,
avec l’accord de la commune, sur une partie
du budget et des dépenses de leur commune
». Il améliore la relation entre citoyens et
commune et contribue à construire un
rapport de confiance entre eux. Les travaux
exécutés à travers le Budget Participatif
répondent directement aux besoins
prioritaires des citoyens et améliorent
l’infrastructure et les équipements d’une
commune. En effet, les communes
tunisiennes sont habituées à décider sur le        considérée comme une préparation à

You never know what you might hear on the
Libyan debate showHiwar Mushtarak, or
‘Shared Debate.’ The show aims to foster an
open dialogue about the country’s current
challenges and its potential future by
bringing together Libyans of all stripes. There
are panel discussions featuring a diverse
range of Libyan politicians and civil society
activists, and the audience is encouraged to
engage, giving a voice to ordinary Libyan
citizens. For a recent show to commemorate
Libya’s February 17 revolution, which five
years ago led to the ousting and death of
former leader Muammar Gaddafi, a panel
debated the question: What is the way
forward?

After more than a year of civil war, almost
four years of fraught transition, and months
of intensive U.N.-led negotiations, Libyans
are poised to form a Government of National
Accord (GNA) and begin the process of
reunifying the country. However, without

situation in Libya will remain prone to reform

state institutions, disrupted oil exports,

a member experience a legal problem in the
previous five years. Legal problems will

incredibly complicated. They may affect an
individual only, but are also likely to
somehow impact the family unit. There is a
relationship between legal problems and
poverty. Legal problems, left unaddressed,

    The poor and near poor were less likely
     to have access to courts or lawyers to
     help address legal problems.

The last point above can be elaborated as
follows. Families in the lower two
expenditure quartiles, which cover roughly
the poor and near poor, were more likely to
experience legal problems related to all
types of general legal problems – family law,
civil law and criminal law. But the gap is
widest in relation to family law problems,
where they account for nearly 80% of
reported legal problems, versus 68% for civil
law and 65% for criminal law. There is             problems and poverty. We know what types        related to labor abuses, such as unpaid

Grasping the full extent of violence against
women is difficult everywhere. In the Middle
East, it can be both difficult and dangerous
for women to report abuse given social
attitudes toward the roles of women and
men within the family. In Jordan, the
violence against girls and women embodies
the problem.

The Jordanian government’s Population and
Family Health Survey captures only a portion
of the scale of violence against women.
Social norms are at play; roughly 70 percent
of Jordanian women think there are
circumstances that justify a husband beating
his wife.

registered with the United Nations, making it
the largest refugee crisis the world has

Resilience and Governance in MENA
Since the 1990s the concept of good
governance has been an explicit part of the
World Bank’s development agenda
acknowledging that inefficiencies and
weaknesses in the institutional environment
have a direct impact on the achievement
and the quality of development results. The

Resilience                The ability of households, communities and nations to absorb and recover from shocks, whilst positively adapting and transforming their
                          structures and means for living in the face of long-term stresses, change and uncertainty.
Resilience boosting       To manage the impact of shocks and future issues of risk, change and uncertainty, by strengthening the capacity to absorb shocks, or adapting
                          to reduce exposure to shocks, or transforming so that the shock no longer has an impact on the system.
Resilient system          The end result of building the resilience of a system, comprising components (or characteristics) that vary between different layers of society
                          (household, community, nations). These components result from applying resilience-building capacities that better structure risk management
                          actions to development / vulnerability reduction / poverty reduction programs and other long-term programming.
Absorptive capacity       The ability of a system to prepare for, mitigate or prevent the impacts of negative events using predetermined coping responses in order to
                          preserve and restore essential basic structures and functions.
Adaptive capacity         The ability of a system to adjust, modify or change its characteristics and actions to moderate potential, future damage and to take advantage
                          of opportunities, all in order to continue functioning without major qualitative changes in function or structural identity.
Transformative capacity   The ability to create a fundamentally new system when ecological, economic or social structures make the existing system untenable.
Risk                      The combination of the probability of an event and its negative consequences.
Shock                     A sudden event with an important and often negative impact on the vulnerability of a system and its parts. Shocks represent significant negative
                          (or positive) impacts on people’s means of living and on the functioning of a state.
Stress                    A long term trend, weakening the potential of a given system and deepening the vulnerability of its actors.
System                    A unit of society (e.g. individual, household, a group of people with common characteristics, community, nation), of ecology (e.g. a forest) or a
                          physical entity (e.g. an urban infrastructure network).
Vulnerability             An expression of susceptibility to harm, and exposure to hazard.

Introduction: In recent years, many Supreme
Audit Institutions (SAIs) around the world
have begun pioneering different citizen
engagement         models       to      increase
transparency and accountability, enhance
the effectiveness of the audit process, and
ensure value for money in the use of public
resources. Despite increasing trends toward
public participation, engaging citizens
throughout the audit process is fraught with
potential complications. Indeed, the formal

Among the most important ones, citizen
participation contributes to reducing blind
spots for auditors. Citizens can help to pin-
point problems that would otherwise be
overlooked. Most importantly, citizen
participation has been instrumental in
enhancing transparency and accountability,
as well as in improving the performance of
public sector administration. The underlying
success factors include the following: (i) a
legal foundation should be in place to ensure
continued operation and resource inflows;
(ii) top management’s support is necessary
to provide motivation to auditors; (iii)

Summary

The World Bank organized a capacity
building activity for Libyan civil servants in
Istanbul, between August 16 and 18, 2015,
funded through the State and Peace Building
Fund. This event was the third in a series of
capacity building activities for civil servants
in Libya including VCs (July 8) and the
training delivered face-to-face in Istanbul
(April 2015). Its objective was to build on the
knowledge shared during the previous
workshop (April 2015) and show how other
countries have built their state institutions
and public administrations after years of
severe civil war, while concentrating on
specific challenges. Building on the feedback
received at the end of the previous
workshop, this capacity building activity                 presentations       on    local     governance,        The summaries of the topics covered in each

participants raised the following issues: the

the importance of political balance,
prioritization, and conflict diagnosis; what is
the role of the international community in
re-building institutions? What support can
the WB provide (the disconnection between
the WB mandate focused on economic
issues and the current political needs which
are now priority in Libya)? The session was
particularly appreciated because it included
mechanisms for effective institutional
building and it stressed the importance of
collaboration between institutions and of
building trust between government and
citizens.

    The Multiple Tragedies of Syria’s Displaced Women
           Why the G20 Needs to Pay Attention
Omer Karasapan
Knowledge Coordinator

Roughly half of the world’s 60+ million
displaced people are female. This figure
includes 19 million refugees and 41 million
internally displaced people (IDPs). This the
highest number ever recorded and the
numbers continue to rise. According to the
United Nation’s High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), Antonio Gutierrez, “We
are witnessing…an unchecked slide into an
era in which the scale of global forced
displacement as well as the response
required is now clearly dwarfing anything
seen before”.
Already facing multiple inequalities, women
face significantly       greater     risks in
displacement — especially discrimination,
grinding harassment, and often sexual- and
gender-based violence. Host and transit

CV MENA: Why is it important to use pictures to document this crisis
and capture this story? How did this idea come about?
Emily Pinna: I had heard so much about the refugee crisis and it was
getting worse by the day. As many of us, I felt I had to do something
to help and decided to narrate the crisis by using my skills and training
as a visual storyteller. The format that I chose is that of a visual
chronicle consisting of a few powerful selected pictures with extended
captions. In my experience, this is a powerful format that combines
the instant power of images with concise and to-the-point narratives.
It is very useful in creating an instant connection between the
audience and an event, while being informative at the same time. In
addition, I really wanted to learn more about the refugees, who they
are, what reality they left behind, what their dreams are, and why they
decide to subject themselves and their children and elders to such
perilous journeys. It breaks my heart to see, after the most recent
terrorist attacks in Paris, that people confuse refugees with terrorists.
In many cases the refugees are the direct victims of those exact
terrorists. If only we were all more compassionate!

CV MENA: What did you learn from this particular project and
experience?
Emily Pinna: I learned many things both as a professional and a human
being. As I think back about the refugees I met, especially those
Afghans who I helped out of the boat, I am confronted with an urge
to learn more about where they are now and how fate is treating
them. I would love to visually chronicle the journey of two or three
refugee families as they cross Europe to reach their destinations and
attempt to settle. In the end, we are interested in specific human
experiences that we can relate to. Getting to know our fellow human

major milestones, emerging trends, and new beginnings. Among
other things, 2015 marked a historic drop in poverty, a major climate
change agreement, and record low child and maternal mortality rates.
Take a look at what the data show.

1. The Global Poverty Rate Fell below 10%
The share of the world’s population living in extreme poverty is
projected to hit a historic low of 9.6% of in 2015 – falling from 37.1%
in 1990. New estimates show 702 million people living below the
updated global poverty line of$1.90 per day, with the majority of
them in Sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. The milestone was hailed
as the “best news in the world today” by World Bank Group President
Jim Yong Kim, and marks real progress on the road to ending extreme
poverty by 2030.

2. The World Reached an Accord on Climate Change
Representatives of 195 nations signed on to the landmark Paris
climate agreement on Dec. 12, 2015. Each country pledged to lower
greenhouse gas emissions in what could mark a turning point in the
global effort to slow climate change. The deal recognized the role of
incentives in reducing emissions, including carbon pricing. Currently,
about 40 countries and 23 cities, states, and regions are using a
carbon price -- their outputs represent only 12% of annual
greenhouse-gas emissions. As part of the Paris deal, more than 90
developed and developing countries have included carbon-pricing
schemes among the actions they intend to take. Climate change could

4. The SDGs Set Ambitious Targets for 2030
In September, the world’s countries came together to affirm the
Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) -- a set of 17 goals for the
world. Their broad aims are to end extreme poverty, fight inequality
and injustice, and to address climate change. The goals are associated
with a number of new targets and indicators. A World Bank study
earlier this year found that many countries in the world lack the data
to reliably estimate trends in poverty, and the institution has recently
committed to filling these data gaps in the world’s poorest countries.
This year also saw the launch of the Global Partnership for Sustainable
Development Data, which aims to bring together a diverse group of
individuals and institutions to make better use of data and technology
to both monitor and achieve the SDGs.

5. Finance for Development Needs to Move from Billions to Trillions
The levels of Official Development Assistance (ODA) or “foreign aid”
to developing countries are already dwarfed by private resource flows
(such as remittances) and commercial foreign investment. The
ambitious new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) require equal
ambition in using the “billions” in ODA and in available development

of all kinds. Additional funds are expected to come from two main
sources: public domestic resources (such as tax revenues), where the
most substantial development spending happens, and commercial
finance and investment, the largest potential source of additional
funding.

energy, metals, and agricultural prices were down this year, in part
due to increasing supplies, bumper harvests, weak demand and a
stronger U.S. dollar. This end of the “commodity super-cycle” will see
exporters in the Middle East, Africa, Latin America, and Europe
adjusting to a new normal, while importers like India benefit from

9. Changing Demographics Are Shaping Our Future
While the global working age population peaked at 66% in 2012, parts
of Africa and Asia are seeing a surge in their working age populations,
and countries in these regions have an opportunity for greater
prosperity and higher living standards. According to the 2015 Global
Monitoring Report, Sub-Saharan Africa will account for more than half
of the world’s working-age population growth through 2050. The
world’s population is set to reach 9.7 billion in 2050, and almost ha lf
the population growth will occur in just nine countries.

10. Maternal and Child Mortality Rates Hit Record Lows
Between 1990 and 2015, the under-5 and maternal mortality rates fell
53% and 44% respectively. This means the number of children dying
before age 5 has fallen dramatically - from 12.7 million in 1990 to 5.9
million in 2015. Millions have survived because of the use of such
evidence-based interventions against the leading infectious diseases
as insecticide-treated mosquito nets, rehydration treatment for
diarrhea, nutritional supplements, and therapeutic foods. However,
in spite of this progress, an estimated 16,000 children under 5 still die
each day and, nearly half of these deaths are attributable to
undernutrition.

The Arab Spring Five Years Later, by Hafez Ghanem
Hafez Ghanem gives a thorough assessment of the Arab Spring, beginning with political developments since the
revolutions and changes in the legal and institutional frameworks that affect economies. Arab economies grew at
healthy rates before the revolts, but the benefits of economic growth were unfairly distributed. The politically
connected reaped great benefits, while educated youth could not find decent jobs, and the poor and middle class
struggled to make ends meet. Ghanem advises that Arab countries need to adopt new economic policies and programs
that enhance inclusiveness, expand the middle class, and foster growth in undeveloped regions. Key elements include
strengthening economic institutions, developing small businesses, reforming the education system to better prepare
Arab youth for the modern labor market, promoting gender equality with the objective of raising female labor market
participation rates, and setting up programs for rural and regional development to reduce inequality and eliminate
extreme poverty.

Arab Dawn: Arab Youth and the Demographic Dividend They Will Bring
by Bessma Momani. University of Toronto Press.
Change is on its way in the Middle East, argues Bessma Momani, and its cause is demographic. Today, 1 in 5 Arabs is
between the ages of 15 and 24. Young, optimistic, and increasingly cosmopolitan, their generation will shape the
region’s future. Drawing on interviews, surveys, and other research conducted with young people in fifteen countries
across the Arab world, Momani describes the passion for entrepreneurship, reform, and equality among Arab youth.
With insightful political analysis based on the latest statistics and first-hand accounts, Arab Dawn is an invigorating
study of the Arab world and the transformative power of youth.



Trust, Voice, and Incentives: Learning from Local Success Stories in Service Delivery in the Middle East and North
Africa by Hana Brixi, Ellen Lust, and Michael Woolcock. World Bank.
This report examines the role of incentives, trust, and engagement as critical determinants of service delivery
performance in MENA countries. Focusing on education and health, the report illustrates how the weak external and
internal accountability undermines policy implementation and service delivery performance and how such a cycle of
poor performance can be counteracted. Case studies of local success reveal the importance of both formal and informal
accountability relationships and the role of local leadership in inspiring and institutionalizing incentives toward better
service delivery performance. Enhancing services for MENA citizens requires forging a stronger social contract among
public servants, citizens, and service providers while empowering communities and local leaders to find 'best fit'
solutions. Learning from the variations within countries, especially the outstanding local successes, can serve as a solid
basis for new ideas and inspiration for improving service delivery. Such learning may help the World Bank Group and
other donors as well as national and local leaders and civil society, in developing ways to enhance the trust, voice, and
incentives for service delivery to meet citizens' needs and expectations.

A Political Economy of the Middle East by Melani Cammett, Ishac Diwan, Alan Richards, and John Waterbury. Fourth
Edition. Westview Press.
This book provides a comprehensive analysis of developments in the political economy of the region over the past
several decades, examining the interaction of economic development processes, state systems and policies, and social
actors in the Middle East. This new/fourth edition, with new authors Melani Cammett and Ishac Diwan, has been
thoroughly revised, with two new introductory chapters that provide an updated framework with which to understand
and study the many changes in demography, education, labor markets, urbanization, water and agriculture, and
international labor migration in the recent years. The new edition also includes: a new chapter that charts the political
economy of the Gulf states and, in particular, the phenomenal growth of oil economies; a new chapter on the rise of
"crony capitalism;" and increased coverage of the changes in civil society and social movements in the region, including
an exploration of the causes, dynamics, consequences, and aftermath of the Arab uprisings.

Interpretation and Application of IPSAS by Caroline Aggestam-Pontoppidan. Wiley Regulatory Reporting.

Interpretation and Application of IPSAS provides practical guidance on the implementation and application of the
International Public Sector Accounting Standards. This book brings readers up to date on the standards, and describes
their proper interpretation and real-world application. Examples and mini-case studies clarify the standards' roles
throughout, giving readers a better understanding of complex processes, especially where the IPSAS deviate from IFRS.
Readers also gain insight into smoothly navigating the transition for a public sector entity, which is moving to either
IPSAS under accrual basis of accounting or to cash accounting IPSAS, plus an overview of IPSAS adoption status and
methods around the world. Global public sector accounting is highly diversified, resulting in ongoing moves to
harmonize standards worldwide. The IPSAS are international standards that largely follow the IFRS model, but differ in
some key areas and include standards in places where IFRS has none. This book provides complete guidance to IPSAS,
with clear explanation and expert insight.
•Understand the meaning and role of each standard
•Apply the standards to real-world scenarios ,
•Manage the process of transition to IPSAS

These standards are meant to be followed by all public sector entities, including national and regional governments
and local authorities. They've been adopted by the UN, NATO, the European Commission, and others, and either have
been or soon will be adopted in Malaysia, Switzerland, Spain, and more.

  Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science
  by Dani Rodrik. W.W. Norton & Company, Inc.

  In the wake of the financial crisis and the Great Recession, economics seems anything but a science. In this sharp,
  masterfully argued book, Dani Rodrik, a leading critic from within, takes a close look at economics to examine when it
  falls short and when it works, to give a surprisingly upbeat account of the discipline. Drawing on the history of the field
  and his deep experience as a practitioner, Rodrik argues that economics can be a powerful tool that improves the
  world―but only when economists abandon universal theories and focus on getting the context right. Economics Rules
  argues that the discipline's much-derided mathematical models are its true strength. Models are the tools that make
  economics a science. Too often, however, economists mistake a model for the model that applies everywhere and at
  all times. In six chapters that trace his discipline from Adam Smith to present-day work on globalization, Rodrik shows
  how diverse situations call for different models. Each model tells a partial story about how the world works. These
  stories offer wide-ranging, and sometimes contradictory, lessons―just as children’s fables offer diverse morals.
  Whether the question concerns the rise of global inequality, the consequences of free trade, or the value of deficit
  spending, Rodrik explains how using the right models can deliver valuable new insights about social reality and public
  policy. Beyond the science, economics requires the craft to apply suitable models to the context. The 2008 collapse of
  Lehman Brothers challenged many economists' deepest assumptions about free markets. Rodrik reveals that
  economists' model toolkit is much richer than these free-market models. With pragmatic model selection, economists
  can develop successful antipoverty programs in Mexico, growth strategies in Africa, and intelligent remedies for
  domestic inequality. At once a forceful critique and defense of the discipline, Economics Rules charts a path toward a
  more humble but more effective science.

  The Economics of Inequality
  by Thomas Piketty and Arthur Goldhammer. Harvard University Press.

  Thomas Piketty―whose Capital in the Twenty-First Century pushed inequality to the forefront of public debate―wrote
  The Economics of Inequality as an introduction to the conceptual and factual background necessary for interpreting
  changes in economic inequality over time. This concise text has established itself as an indispensable guide for students
  and general readers in France, where it has been regularly updated and revised. Translated by Arthur Goldhammer,
  The Economics of Inequality now appears in English for the first time. Piketty begins by explaining how inequality
  evolves and how economists measure it. In subsequent chapters, he explores variances in income and ownership of
  capital and the variety of policies used to reduce these gaps. Along the way, with characteristic clarity and precision,
  he introduces key ideas about the relationship between labor and capital, the effects of different systems of taxation,
  the distinction between “historical” and “political” time, the impact of education and technological change, the nature
  of capital markets, the role of unions, and apparent tensions between the pursuit of efficiency and the pursuit of
  fairness. Succinct, accessible, and authoritative, this is the ideal place to start for those who want to understand the
  fundamental issues at the heart of one of the most pressing concerns in contemporary economics and politics.
