THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW
is to find out how it compares with the regulatory
environment in other economies. Doing Business provides
an aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business

from 1 to 189 by the ease of doing business ranking.           Population: 8,260,749

by sorting the aggregate distance to frontier scores,          DB2016 rank: 110

frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where    DB2015 rank: 115*
0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

The 10 topics included in the ranking in Doing Business
2016: starting a business, dealing with construction
permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting
credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading
across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. The labor market regulation indicators are not
included in this year’s aggregate ease of doing business
ranking, but the data are presented in the economy
profile.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2015 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores
for the 10 topics included in this year’s aggregate ranking. The distance to frontier score benchmarks economies with respect to
regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.
For the economies for which the data cover 2 cities, scores are a population-weighted average for the 2 cities.

Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by any economy on
each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes and
resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits,
registering property, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are
only comparable to 2014. The measure is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the
frontier). See the data notes starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

Note: DB2015 rankings shown are not last year’s published rankings but comparable rankings for DB2015 that capture the effects of such
factors as data revisions and changes to the methodology. The global best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest
time recorded among all economies in the DB2016 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory
contributions, and VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it
receives a “no practice” mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator. * Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name
indicates the number of economies that share the top ranking on the indicator. For a list of these economies, see the Doing Business
website (http://www.doingbusiness.org).

Honduras is a set of specific procedures—the
bureaucratic and legal steps that an entrepreneur
must complete to incorporate and register a new                 Legal form: Private Limited Company
firm. These are identified by Doing Business through
collaboration with relevant local professionals and             Paid-in minimum capital requirement: HNL
the study of laws, regulations and publicly available           5,000
information on business entry in that economy.                  City: Tegucigalpa
Following is a detailed summary of those procedures,
along with the associated time and cost. These                  Start-up Capital: 10 times GNI per capita
procedures are those that apply to a company
matching      the    standard     assumptions      (the
“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

      separate bound sheets before the Mayor's office by the end of each
      year (or earlier per the company's decision). In this case there are no
      associated costs.

        Request and obtain environmental approval from Office of
        Municipal Environmental Development and Management
        (GMDAM)

        BuildCo's case would be considered by the Office of Municipal
        Environmental Development and Management. Under a major
        government initiative, the National Competitiveness Program
        (Programa Nacional de Competitividad) the municipality
        (GMDAM) entered into an agreement with SERNA in 2007. Under
        the agreement, both entities have computerized all the offices
        responsible for processing the relevant documents and have also
        trained most of the staff. This has increased the number of
        licenses issued from 30 per month in 2006 to 140 in 2007.
        However, more efficient service has also boosted demand from
        the private sector. The government is considering ways to
        increase resources to meet the increased demand.

        As of September 4, 2008, the Law on Environment was approved,            21 days             HNL 6,653

        as well as other implementing regulations. Article 78 of the law
        introduced criteria for different categories of environmental
        approvals depending on project risks. Commercial warehouses
        that fit into Category 1 (Article 5) are only subject to
        environmental control rather than a full scale study at the local
        level by the Office of Municipal Environmental Development and
        Management ('UGA' or 'UMA'). It is planned that this
        requirement which is a precondition for obtaining building
        permit now will be moved as precondition for operation of the
        building, and to be complied with after the building is completed
        and all permits are obtained.

        The cost according to Article 70 of Plan de Arbitrios is 1% of the
        construction cost of the value up to HNL 200,000 + 0.50% of the
        construction cost of the value between HNL 200,001 - 1,000,000
        + 0.05% of the construction cost of the value that exceeds HNL
        1,000,000.

      The new city zoning plan that was introduced in early 2008 is
      currently being operationalized. One of the main features of the
      plan is the change of zoning from residential to commercial and
      its further digitization based on maps from Cadastre and
      Management Engineering (Engenieria Gerencial). Furthermore,
      the land use regulations were amended in April 2008,
      introducing categories based on risk factors. This led to an
      improvement in the process of obtaining the location clearance,
      including a time reduction. The application is checked in the
      back office to verify whether the new land use is compatible with
      land use regulations.

        submit design for approval

        An electrical engineer employed by CIMEQH estimates the power
        needed for the project and designs the external connection. For loads
        greater than 1,000 kVA, the engineer should go first to Empresa Nacional
        de Energia Electrica (ENEE) to request a feasibility study. In a case where
        the load is 140kVA, this procedure is not necessary.

        The design and the process of obtaining ENEE's review can only be made
        by an electrical engineer authorized by the CIMEQH. The implementation
   1    of the design can be done by an electrician. The electrical engineer must 17 calendar days             HNL 5,900
        obtain a certificate by the College for each design that he files with ENEE.
        The certificate states that the engineer is a member of the College and
        has paid his contributions.

        It is recommended that the internal wiring installation be also done by a
        CIMEQH's electrical engineer. Although the internal installation plans are
        reviewed by the Municipality and the Firefighters, in the context of the
        process to obtain a building permit, the final internal installation is not
        reviewed. One way to ensure the quality of the internal installation is to
        hire an engineer authorized by CIMEQH for the installation. In the case of
        a fire due to a malfunctioning installation, it is easier to obtain legal

      After having prepared the design, the engineer has to file the certificate
      with the Empresa Nacional de Energia Electrica (ENEE). ENEE reviews the
      certificate issued by the College to determine whether it meets ENEE's
      standards. ENEE also inspects the site. Finally, ENEE approves the design.

Note: If data on power outages is not collected or if the SAIFI index or SAIDI index are above the threshold of 100, the
economy is not eligible to obtain a score in the Reliability of Supply and Transparency of Tariff Index. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 12
(equivalent to an outage of one hour each month) or below, a score of 1 is assigned. If SAIDI and SAIFI are 4 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour each quarter) or below, 1 additional point is assigned. Finally, if SAIDI and SAIFI are 1 (equivalent to an
outage of one hour per year) or below, 1 more point is assigned. Doing Business measures the price of electricity but does
not include these data when calculating the distance to frontier score for getting electricity or the ranking on the ease of
getting electricity. The price of electricity is measured in cents per kilowatt-hour. On the basis of the assumptions about
monthly consumption, a monthly bill for a commercial warehouse in the largest business city of the economy is computed for
the month of March. As noted, the warehouse uses electricity 30 days a month, from 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m., so different tariff
schedules may apply if a time-of-use tariff is available.

years, however, these data are excluded from the calculation of the distance to frontier score and ranking. The time and cost
for documentary compliance serve as better measures of the overall cost and complexity of compliance with documentary
requirements than does the number of documents required.

Note: The recovery rate is calculated based on the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal
entities and is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors. The calculation takes into account the outcome:
whether the business emerges from the proceedings as a going concern or the assets are sold piecemeal. Then the costs of the
proceedings are deducted. Finally, the value lost as a result of the time the money remains tied up in insolvency proceedings is
taken into account. The recovery rate is the present value of the remaining proceeds, based on end-2014 lending rates.

rate has a smaller impact on the distance to frontier
score for the total tax rate—and therefore on the
distance to frontier score for paying taxes—for
economies with a below-average total tax rate than it
would have had before this approach was adopted in
Doing Business 2015 (line B is smaller than line A in
figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report). And for
economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is
very high relative to the average), an increase has a
greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores
than it would have had before (line D is bigger than line
C in figure 14.2 of the Doing Business 2016 report).

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
