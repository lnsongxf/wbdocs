 Types of Benefits of Transboundary Cooperation   Description or Examples

Economic Benefits within the                      •	 Changes in net value added the benefits of expanded activity and productivity in
Transboundary Water Basin                          economic sectors (such as aquaculture, irrigated agriculture, energy generation,
                                                   nature-based tourism, water-based transport)

                                                  •	 Reduced cost of productive activities (avoided costs of supplying water from more
                                                   expensive sources, lower cost of water for human consumption and economic uses,
                                                   lower cost of energy inputs from hydropower, savings from using river transport)

                                                  •	 Reduced risks (avoided human and economic losses from floods and droughts, avoided
                                                   food shortages, avoided energy shortages and improved energy security)

                                                  •	 Increased value of property in the basin from improvements in riparian ecosystems

                                                  •	 Reduced cost of managing water (for example, more efficient responses to pollution
                                                   accidents)

Economic Benefits beyond the                      •	 Economic impacts in the national economies due to backward and forward links of
Transboundary Water Basin                          basin-based economic activity with other economic activities in riparian countries
                                                   (for example, reductions in costs of factors of production such as water and energy)

                                                  •	 Benefits gained from cooperating in economic policy areas after trust has been built in

Social Benefits within and beyond the             •	 Impacts on unemployment, reduced poverty, improved access to services
Transboundary Basin                               •	 Improved human health (reduced incidence of water-borne diseases), and improved
