                                             OVERVIEW
1.      A fiduciary assessment for the Rwanda Public Sector Governance PforR was carried out,
taking into account recent PFM diagnostic reports and meetings and discussions with key
officials in the proposed implementing agencies and other stakeholders. The assessment followed
the Draft Guidance Notes on PforR Operations and requirements of OP/BP 9.00, Program for
Results. The assessment used the four pillars approach of the Organisation for Economic Co-
operation and Development–Development Assistance Committee (OECD-DAC) to define the
inherent risks in the procurement environment. In line with the Sector Board’s practices manual,
the potential FM risks for the various PFM elements are rated as low (L), modest (M), substantial
(S), or high (H). The assessment is also mindful of the gaps that may exist between form
(policies, laws, structures, instructions/manuals) and actual functionality or practices of the PFM
system. Mitigation measures are proposed to reinforce the government’s PFM reform efforts.
Critical measures are included in the PAP.
2.      The assessment covered the institutions directly responsible for implementing the
Program (MINECOFIN, RRA, OAG, RPPA, NISR) and one district council from each of the
four provinces and Kigali City based on the size of budget transfers and population.1 It also
included meetings and discussions with key governance and anticorruption oversight institutions,
including the Office of the Ombudsman and the National Prosecution Authority. In addition, it
solicited the views of nonstate actors, such as Transparency International Rwanda and members
of the Private Sector Federation.
3.      The Program contributes to EDPRS 2 in general and the fourth thematic area (on
accountable governance) in particular to improve service delivery and increase citizen
participation in and satisfaction with delivery of development. In order to implement EDPRS 2,
the Government developed 14 sector strategic plans.
4.      The fiduciary assessment entailed a review of the capacity of a sample of the
implementing agencies on their ability to (a) record, control, and manage all program resources
and produce timely, understandable, relevant, and reliable information for the borrower and the
Bank; (b) follow procurement rules and procedures, capacity, and performance, focusing on
procurement performance indicators and the extent to which the capacity and performance
support the program development objectives and risks associated with the Program and the
implementing agency; and (c) ensure that implementation arrangements are adequate and risks
reasonably mitigated by the existing framework, including arrangements for mitigating and
resolving governance and corruptions issues if they occur.
5.     Rwanda’s financial management systems and processes have both strengths and
challenges, as recent PFM diagnostic reports show.2 The strengths of the Program’s financial
management systems include (a) the simplified public financial guidelines for chief budget
managers, which provide clear descriptions of the various PFM processes;3(b) the orderly,

   Examples includes the 2007 and 2010 PEFA assessments, sector public expenditure review reports, public
expenditure tracking survey reports, and independent midterm and end-term evaluations of the Public Financial
Management Reform Strategy (2008–12).

participatory, and transparent planning and budget preparation process; and (c) a strong financial
management legal framework. A number of challenges still remain, however, with regard to (a)
the dearth of suitably qualified officials to handle PFM functions, especially at the district level,
where there are serious concerns about high turnover of few trained staff; (b) failure to
consolidate transactions for subsidiary entities and resulting weak annual financial statements
quality; (c) internal control weaknesses (for example, poor records management, over
expenditure on budget lines); and (d) submission of annual audit reports to Parliament 10 months
after the end of the fiscal year.
6.      Assessment of the systems and processes for dealing with fraud and corruption issues
shows that Rwanda has strong institutional, organization, and legal frameworks for controlling
fraud and corruption. Rwanda strengthened the legal frameworks in 2013 with the amendment of
the law to allow the Office of the Ombudsman to prosecute cases of corruption, it will take time
before the office take over prosecution of corruption cases from the National Public Prosecution
Authority (NPPA). The NPPA and OM have reasonable capacity in terms of staffing and other
resources to investigate fraud and corruption, though staff turnover is high and takes time to
replace them. Rwanda also passed the Whistle Blowers Protection Act, 2013 and its too early to
assess its impact on giving security and protection to whistle blowers. The Public Accounts
Committee (PAC) of Parliament has also been effective in its oversight role in public financial
management in follow up to the Auditor General’s report and regularly calling financial
managers to account. The oversight agencies (Ombudsman, NPPA, and RPPA) and
implementing agencies have a reasonably well-functioning system for receiving, recording, and
responding to complaints and grievances from the public and corporate bodies. Multiple media—
including telephone hotlines, dedicated email accounts, and complaint boxes in public offices
and places—are used to lodge complaints and these existing systems will used for the Program.
The implementing agencies are obliged to respond to such complaints and are monitored by the
OM, NPPA and RPPA depending on the complaints and grievances to be addressed. The NPPA
and OM also carries spot checks on these agencies and districts to ensure compliance.
7.      Some challenges identified include (a) inadequate arrangements to deal with fraud and
corruption at the subnational level, where the Office of the Ombudsman is not decentralized and
there is a shortage of suitably qualified PFM professionals (all districts have qualified audits); (b)
difficulty retaining qualified staff, especially investigators (as of March 2014, two of the six
investigators at the Office of the Ombudsman had left and not been replaced); (c) difficulty
obtaining evidence and lack of information to prosecute allegations of corruption and (d)
weaknesses in contract management, including suspicious delays in payment for contracts,
including suspicious delays in payments of contractors and anecdotal evidence of budget
administrators/executive secretaries in districts who try to informally influence decisions of
procurement committees with the aim of favoring friends or influential individuals.4
8.      Overall, most stakeholders agree that Rwanda has strong institutional arrangements for
controlling and prosecuting fraud and corruption, but there is agreement that there is soft
corruption in the ways things are done and difficulty getting information and evidence because of
fear. Although the Rwanda Bribery Index shows strong public trust in institutions, almost 20

percent of victims or witnesses of corruption do not report, and private businesses are even more
reluctant to report for fear of not getting government contracts.
Summary Findings
9.       The main fiduciary risks to the Program are (a) the dearth of suitably qualified and
experienced staff, especially at the district level; (b) the inability to properly budget and report at
the targeted SSP program/subprogram level within the responsible MDAs; (c) a largely
undeveloped internal audit function at both the national and subnational levels; (d)
improper/incomplete books of accounts, leading to qualified audited financial statements; (e) the
absence of a specialist on e-procurement to provide technical support and guidance during the
procurement process and the operationalization of e-procurement; (f) the absence of a civil
engineering department within NISR to provide technical support on the design and construction
of a training center; (g) inadequate arrangements to deal with fraud and corruption issues at the
district level in the context of weak internal controls; and (h) weak contract management.
10.     Human resources: There is a dearth of suitably qualified personnel to handle PFM
functions, especially at the district level, where there are serious concerns about high turnover of
few trained staff. More than half of the total number (1,065) of accountants and auditors (internal
and external) has a first degree, but there are only 16 fully qualified professional accountants in
the government (2 percent). Even in the Internal Audit Department in MINECOFIN, there were
five unfilled positions as of February 2014.
11.      Planning and budget preparation: The budget is formulated through systematic
consultations with spending ministries and the legislature, adhering to a fixed budget calendar.
MDAs plan their expenditure allocations by programs and subprograms based on their strategic
priorities and the national MTEF that is communicated to them in the budget call circular. It is
important to track budget for the reform activities from the budget for day-to-day. PFM
functions. For example, the PFM program budget under MINECOFIN depicts the subprograms
shown in the expenditure framework (table 10), which are only manually aligned with the PFM-
SSP pillars/themes. This system undermines proper conceptualization of program-based
budgeting. MINECOFIN is resorting to matching tables prepared outside the budget
classification to cross-reference the budget with the SSPs. Despite these efforts, specific reports
are not prepared showing allocation to and spending on the SSPs.
12.     Treasury management and funds flow: Predictability of available funds to undertake
planned activities to meet the program objectives is hampered by the inadequacy of cash releases
(total shortfall of 23 percent in FY2012/13). A good TSA system is well functioning, especially
for ministry and agency operations through quarterly allocations to subaccounts within the
central bank, from which all payments are made. However, time lags between revenue collection
and banking at the district and sector level need to be reduced, as noted in the Auditor General’s
report.
13.     Accounting and financial reporting: In-year and annual financial statements are timely
and of reasonably good quality. A cash flow statement is not included in the consolidated
financial statements.5 The Auditor General qualifies the district council annual financial
statements, largely because of failure to consolidate sectors and other nonbudgeting agencies

transactions and balances. District councils expense transfers to sectors and nonbudgeting
agencies at the point of transfer. Accountability occurs subsequently but outside the district
financial statements. The authorities have agreed to undertake an IPSAS gap analysis and
develop a roadmap toward compliance over time. The gap analysis will help with the format,
content, and frequency of reporting by public entities to be prescribed in the financial
regulations. The Government’s intention to embark on accrual basis accounting will need to be
carefully reconsidered as part of the IPSAS (cash basis) gap analysis.
14.     Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS): IFMIS has three
core modules in active use: general ledger, accounts payable, and revenue management. It is
operational in 131 of 156 budget agencies (84 percent) and covers 83 percent of government
payments. It has improved timeliness of reporting. IFMIS should be seen as a tool and not a
silver bullet that will address the PFM challenges, however. A multi-prong approach that ensures
sustained progress in the other reform areas will be essential. Internal audit information systems
audit capability through the use of computer-aided audit techniques (CAATs) and audit
command language will help detect the fraud inherent in an IT environment. There is a need to
develop a robust business continuity management and disaster recovery plan as part of the
information security policy for IFMIS.
15.    To ensure real-time management of information and decision making, the Government is
developing and implementing a modern IFMIS. MINECOFIN management has decided to
upgrade the existing bespoke system to meet all the Government’s financial management needs
across all qualifying entities. The review identified areas of IFMIS linkage with e-procurement,
including (a) linkage of procurement plan functions of e-procurement with budget function of
IFMIS, where the procurement plan is linked to an approved budget of IFMIS; (b) linkage of
contract award of e-procurement to government commitment to budget expenditure; (c) linkage
of inspection and delivery of supplies of e-procurement to inventory of IFMIS; (d) invoice by
supplier in e-procurement to payment of IFMIS; and (e) acknowledgement of receipt of goods by
e-procurement. With this modality, MINECOFIN is convinced that there is no duplication and
the two systems stand alone.
16.     Internal controls (including internal audit): The main internal controls are in place and
documented in the government financial management and procedural manuals.6 The main
internal control issues identified in the management letters for external audits and internal audit
reports include (a) noncompliance with procurement policy and guidelines; (b) poor
documentation and filing of accounting records; (c) irregular and unauthorized expenditure; (d)
weak controls over the management of fixed assets, cash collections, and bank transactions; and
(e) over expenditure on budget lines, despite the IFMIS in-built budget controls. Article 19 7º of
the 2013 Organic Law on State Finances and Property (commonly called the OBL) requires the
chief budget manager “to establish and maintain effective, efficient and transparent systems of
internal controls and risk management.” With the 2013 OBL and regulations in place, business
processes will need to be reengineered to strengthen existing processes, such as budget controls,
requisitioning, purchase orders, invoicing, payment authorization and approval, accounting, and


6
  The most important internal controls may be remembered by the mnemonic SOAPMAPS: segregation of duties,
organization, authorization and approval, physical, management, arithmetical and accounting, personnel, and
supervision.

reporting. The emerging business processes together with functionalities in the future IFMIS will
lead to the development of a Comprehensive Operating Procedures Manual (COPM).
17.     Internal audit: The internal audit function is in its early stages of development. Starting
from a level of 1–2 of the public sector internal audit capability model (IA-CM) in 2010, the
Office of the Government Chief Internal Auditor targets achieving level 4 by 2017. An internal
audit service has been established in all government institutions. It is estimated that there are
currently 200 internal auditors in Rwanda but only 2 qualified certified professional accountants
(CPAs) on the job. The internal audit structure is flat; it does not specify a head of unit, which
poses a challenge in terms of leadership of the internal audit function at the MDA level.
18.     Audit committee: Since 2001, 68 of the 94 MDAs have had audit committees and
submitted reports either to the district councils (83 percent by December 2013) or to heads of
entities. In July 2012, MINECOFIN published a model audit committee charter. In 2013 it published
a handbook that provides broad guidelines that audit committees in ministries, districts, agencies and
government business enterprises can use. At the central government, 14 out of 21 ministries and
agencies have established audit committees, but very few have held meetings. About 30
budgeting agencies are yet to establish the required internal audit committees.
19.     External audit: For FY2011/12, 72 percent of the MDA audit reports (97 reports) were
qualified, mainly because of avoidable and easily addressable factors. For FY2012/13, 68
percent of the MDA audit reports (94 reports) were qualified. The number of entities that
obtained reports with unqualified (clean) audit opinion increased from 37 (28 percent) in
FY2011/12fiscal 2012 to 45 (32 percent) in FY2012/13. All 30 districts received qualified audit
reports. The districts that the Bank team visited during the identification and preparation
missions (Gasabo, Bugesera, Kamonyi and Rulindo districts) all received adverse audit opinions.
20.    Public Accounts Committee (PAC): There has been notable improvement in the
implementation of audit recommendations: 60 percent of all recommendations were fully
implemented in FY2012/13, up from 49 percent in FY2011/12. The PAC conducts public
hearings on the audit reports;7 this oversight includes the audit reports for the district councils.
There is no PAC similar to the one in the Chamber of Deputies at the district level. District
council audit committees are yet to start conducting public hearings.
21.     Procurement: The Government has an acceptable public procurement legal framework
that is based on the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL)
model. The legal framework is quite robust and covers all aspects of public procurement at all
levels of government. To further improve compliance, efficiency, transparency, fair competition,
and value for money and controls in public procurement, the Government is moving toward
modernizing its procurement function by introducing e-procurement. The planned introduction
of e-procurement is reflected in the RPPA medium-term strategic plan for FY2012/13 to
FY2014. With the assistance of the Bank, Crown Agents conducted a feasibility study on e-
procurement and prepared a conceptual design that has been submitted to the Government. The
study proposed a competitive open bid to select an e-procurement solution. At the same time, the
Government asked Korea Tel-Com to submit both technical and financial proposals to
implement a solution based on the Korean e-procurement. As of September 2014, the

Government is reviewing the technical and financial proposals. Direct contracting would require
MINECOFIN to invoke Article 17 (impossibility to meet conditions for use of given method) of
the Public Procurement Law to justify the direct contracting. On construction of a statistics
training center, NISR will select a consultant to conduct the design review related to existing
office renovation and designing of a training center. As NISR does not have a civil engineering
department, it will receive technical support from the Rwanda Housing Authority, which will
provide approval as a custodian of the Government asset.
22.    Governance and anticorruption issues: The assessment also covered the capacity of the
governance systems and arrangements to handle risks of F&C, including capacity and
commitment to use the Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACGs) in PforR financing, the use
of complaints mechanisms and how such risks are managed and mitigated. From the Bank’s
assessment, Rwanda has relatively sound institutional and legal frameworks to deal with fraud
and corruption cases. There is clear division of responsibilities between the Offices of the
Ombudsman which deal with cases of corruption and the Criminal Investigation Department
(CID), which deals with cases of fraud. The NPPA prosecutes cases on F&C after investigations.
The legal provisions are strong for investigation, prosecution and prevention of fraud corruption;
corruption is comprehensively defined in the Organic Law of the Penal Code8 and complemented
by several other laws to help fight, prevent, investigate and punish fraud and corruption9.
Organic Law no61/2008 of 10/09/2008 on the Leadership Code of Conduct is also in place to
promote integrity in the public sector. Implementation and enforcement of these laws are quite
robust both in the PforR implementing agencies specifically and the public sector in general.
Severe sanctions are applied to those found guilty of fraud and corruption, including
imprisonment, dismal from office and publications of names of those convicted in the media and
website of the OM. The anti-corruption agencies have improved over the years are effective with
reasonable capacity to do their job, including covering this PforR operation. Analysis of data
provided by the office of the Ombudsman shows that 307 of 453 cases (68 percent) in 2009-2013
were investigated with only 9 sent to prosecution and 18 transmitted to other institutions,
including the police. Many of the complaints received are related to maladministration, followed
by local entities, procurement and justice sector.
23.     The Public Accounts Committee of Parliament, established in April 2011, has nine
members and has proven to be a robust oversight of financial management. It conducts public
hearings on the report of the OAG with chief budget managers, accountants and other officers
being regularly called to account. Reports submitted by the Office of the Auditor General to the
PAC are analyzed and used to access how well public funds have been spent. Where there is
evidence of abuse and misuse of funds, the PAC refers such cases to the NPPA for prosecution
and recovery of funds. These are having a positive impact in enhancing the accountability of
public institutions and officials. Assessment of the implementing agencies ((MINECOFIN and
NISR) also suggest the processes and systems for handling and reporting fraud and corruption
are in place and functioning reasonably well, though in the case of districts more need to be done

to improve oversight and internal controls due to capacity constraints. In addition, the OM
carries out surprise checks on these agencies. The agencies are obliged to report for investigation
allegations of fraud and corruption and these are reasonably enforced within the agencies
assessed.
24.     Application of World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines: The assessment also
reviewed the capacity and commitment of the Government to apply the World Bank’s
Anti-Corruption Guidelines in the PforR program in the relevant government institutions
including MINECOFIN and NISR, the oversight bodies (OM, NPPA, and RPPA). There is
commitment on the part of the Government to apply the ACGs and this will be reflected in the
legal agreement for the PforR and includes: Specifically these includes (a) commitment that
firms or individuals on the World Bank’s debarment or suspended lists shall not be allowed to
bid for contracts or benefit from a contract or proceeds of the program and the responsibility of
MINECOFIN (the lead implementing agency) to ensure that all implementing and procuring
entities have the updated list; (b) commitment that the NPPA and OM and implementing
agencies will share information on fraud and corruption in the program with the World Bank;
and (c) commitment to undertake investigations of any allegations of fraud and corruption by
OM and NPPA and that the World Bank’s Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency may directly
investigate any fraud and corruption allegations made against the entire Program or part of the
Program.
25.       In 2013 the Ombudsman was given the powers to prosecute cases of corruption in order
to speed up the process of prosecution, though there is a transition period that will enable the OM
to fully set up and staff a Prosecution Directorate. The NPPA has a team of 12 prosecutors to
handle corruption cases and each district has one prosecutor to handle corruption cases. During
this transition period the NPPA will continue to prosecute cases of corruption.
26.    The Auditor General's report provides pointers to potential cases of fraud and
corruption, in addition to the public providing information through hot lines and other
media10. One concern in sharing of information on F&C is that while OAG is required by Article
184 of the Constitution to provide copy of the Auditor General’s report to the Prosecutor-
General, the Auditor General is not required to give a copy to the Ombudsman which is
responsible for investigation of cases of corruption. This is a gap that can be bridged
administratively rather than an amendment to the law.
27.     Handling of Complaints and Grievances: There is a reasonably good citizen’s
engagement and multiple sources for lodging and recording complaints on fraud and corruption
in procurement and FM through the RPPA, Ombudsman and NPPA. The NPPA and
Ombudsman have multiple sources of receiving complaints, including hotlines, secure
complaints boxes in most public organizations and in each of the 30 districts, via email and
letters etc. The OM also has informers all over the country, including districts that provide
information on possible fraud and corruption to the HQ in Kigali. In addition, the OM carries
out surprise checks on these agencies and deploys teams agencies and districts when required.
The implementing agencies for the Program also follow the complaints mechanisms for
procurement and fraud and corruption cases. The assessment within MINECOFIN, RRA and
NISR suggests that complaints and grievance handling mechanisms are functioning reasonably

     The hotline to report suspected cases of fraud and corruption to NPPA is 3677.

well. The multiple channels of complaints (procurement via RPPA, corruption through OM and
fraud through NPPA) raise questions of coordination of the different channels to ensure all
complaints would be captured and responded to in the PforR program. The PAP will need to
strengthen mechanisms for capturing feedback and complaints from citizens and key
stakeholders such as private contractors.
28.     Concerns that emerged from the assessment of risks of F&C for the Program are capacity
gaps in staffing at the district level, concerns about internal controls, and all 30 districts having
qualified audits. There are also concerns in contract management, including suspicious delays in
payments not always due to cash flow problems but rent seeking behavior by those responsible
for processing payments. One mitigating factor is the multiple audits that districts and central
government agencies are subjected to, including by the Ombudsman, OAG, NPPA and RPPA.
29.     Some of the weaknesses identified in procurement and FM pose potential risks in fraud
and corruption in the PforR program, including use of non-open competitive methods in
awarding contracts and not publishing contract awards in media that is widely accessible to the
public. Recommended actions in the PAP will help to mitigate these risks.
30.     The Auditor General's report provides pointers to potential cases of F&C, in
addition to the public providing information through hot lines and other media11. One
concern in sharing of information on fraud and corruption is that while the Office of the Auditor
General is required to provide copy of his report to the Prosecutor-General12, he is not required
to give a copy to the Ombudsman which is responsible for investigation of cases of corruption.
This is a gap that can be bridged administratively rather than an amendment to the law.
31.    The overall risk for the Program was assessed as substantial.13 The agreed mitigation
measures will be adequate to support the operation. Key mitigation measures are suggested in
PAP Table 6-1, which the implementing agencies discussed and agreed on. Technical assistance
from the PFM Basket Fund (DFID, the European Union, KfW, and a dedicated subfund for the
OAG to protect its financial independence) and the IMF-AFRITAC-e TA in the areas of revenue
administration, PFM, and macro-fiscal analysis will help Rwanda progressively address the
challenges in order to meet the related DLIs.

I.      INTRODUCTION AND CONTEXT
A. Country context
1.      Rwanda’s development performance over the past decade has been one of the best
in the world. A highly strategic approach to development, which has galvanized domestic and
external resources around nationally defined medium- and long-term goals, has delivered strong
economic growth (7–8 percent per year), a significant decline in poverty, and a modest reduction
in inequality. Nonmaterial measures of well-being have also improved, with impressive progress
across the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs).
2.      Reductions in both poverty and inequality—from high starting levels—have been
impressive. The poverty headcount dropped, with the share of the population living below the
national poverty line falling from 59 percent in the early 2000s to 45 percent in 2011. In Kigali,
home to 10 percent of Rwanda’s population, the incidence of poverty decreased by six
percentage points, from 22.7 percent in 2001 to 16.8 percent in 2011. Starting from a much
higher base, the rest of the country experienced a 15 percentage point drop in poverty. The
poverty gap ratio, which takes into account the distance separating the poor from the poverty
line, dropped by almost 10 percentage points, from 24.4 percent in 2001 to 14.8 percent in 2011,
indicating that people living below the poverty line are now closer to it than they were in 2001,
an indicator that bodes well for future poverty reduction. Inequality, as measured by the Gini
coefficient, fell from 0.52 in 2001 to 0.49 in 2011.
3.     Rwanda performed extremely well in the past decade. It is now time to focus on the
challenging second-generation reforms that underpin the country’s goal of reaching
middle-income status by 2020. 14 These challenges include (a) transforming the economy from
one led by the public sector to one led by the private sector, (b) enhancing shared prosperity, (c)
financing the development strategy, and (d) ensuring that institutions and capacity keep pace
with growth. To a large extent, the Government’s vision describes the policies and reforms
needed to address these development challenges.
4.      The Government’s medium-term vision and targets are set out in a series of
sectoral, locality-specific, and overarching strategic development plans. The clearest
aggregation of medium-term goals is set out in the second Economic Development and Poverty
Reduction Strategy (EDPRS 2), which aims to accelerate private sector–led growth and further
reduce poverty, including extreme poverty, while reducing aid dependency, thus increasing self-
reliance. The four thematic areas of EDPRS 2 are (a) economic transformation, to achieve high
and sustained growth and restructure the economy toward services and industry; (b) rural
development, to bring the national poverty rate below 30 percent; (c) productivity and youth
employment, to ensure that growth and transformation are supported by appropriate skills; and
(d) accountable governance, to improve service delivery and increase citizen participation in and
satisfaction with the delivery of development. Eight foundational issues support these thematic

detail.

areas.15 EDPRS 1 saw substantial progress on these ongoing long-term priorities as well as on
seven cross-cutting issues.16
5.       EDPRS 2 defines the role of public financial management (PFM) as the platform for the
efficient management of nation’s resources to achieve the EDPRS 2 goals of accelerating private
sector–led growth and further reducing poverty, including extreme poverty. 17 EDPRS 2
highlights the following PFM priorities in the next five years: (a) increase resource mobilization
from domestic and alternative sources of finance, with the objective of meeting increased public
expenditure and making Rwanda progressively self-reliant; (b) scale up implementation of the
Integrated Financial Management Information System (IFMIS); (c) strengthen PFM systems at
the subnational level, including in districts and subsidiary units (sectors, schools, health
facilities), to support fiscal decentralization and service delivery; and (d) enhance training,
professionalization, and capacity building across all PFM disciplines, to sustain the reforms in
the long run.
B. Institutional Setting for Accountability for Public Funds
6.      The Constitution established three organs of the Republic of Rwanda18: (i) Legislature;
(ii) Executive; and (iii) Judiciary as separate and independent but complementary institutions of
the state. The Constitution also established a bi-cameral parliament (the Chamber of the Deputies
and the Senate) to carry out legislative function, oversight function, and representation function.
The Government structure was restructured in 2005, and sub national administrations were thus
reduced to 4 provinces, 30 districts, 416 sectors, 21,480 cells and 14,975 Imidugudu (villages).
7.      The Chamber of Deputies is responsible for receiving and debating the annual Finance
Bill before it becomes a Finance Law with the concurrence of the Senate19. The Executive is
responsible for the formulation, preparation and submission of finance bill to the Chamber of
Deputies and once passed into a Finance Law is also responsible for budget execution by abiding
by (i) the 2013 Organic Law on State finances and property20 (commonly referred to as Organic
Budget Law (OBL)) describes principles and modalities for sound management of State finances
and property and relate to public financial management of Central Government, local
administration, public institutions and parastatal organizations; and (ii) Public Procurement Law
2007 and the decree of associated Regulations. The simplified public financial guidelines for
chief budget managers21 provide clear descriptions for the various PFM processes.
8.     Article 184 of the Constitution completes the accountability cycle through the law on the
mission, organization and functioning of the Office of the Auditor General of State finances 22.
The Auditor General is required to submit annual audited financial statements to Parliament


15
   The foundational issue areas are macroeconomic stability, demographics, food security, basic education, primary
health care, rule of law, public financial management, and decentralization.
16
   The cross-cutting issue areas are capacity building, environment, gender, regional integration, HIV/AIDS and
noncommunicable diseases, disaster management, and social inclusion.
17
   The government defines the foundational issues as strategic areas that constitute the bedrock of Rwanda’s
sustainable development over the long term.

indicating the manner in which the budget was utilized including instances of unnecessary
expenses which were incurred or expenses which were contrary to the law and whether there was
misappropriation or general misuse of public funds. The Auditor General submits a copy of the
report to the President of the Republic, Cabinet, the President of the Supreme Court and the
Prosecutor General of the Republic. The Auditor General of State Finances shall ensure that the
annual audit reports are published. The Parliament as part of its oversight functions; reviews and
debates the audit report and takes appropriate decisions within a period not exceeding six
months. Sanctions for non-compliance with extant PFM legal framework include disciplinary
action23. NPPA and OM also report to Parliament and the President and submit quarterly reports
on fraud and corruption, including those convicted for fraud and corruption.
C. Program background
9.     Rwanda has made remarkable progress in rebuilding core public sector institutions
since the 1994 genocide. Its leadership has demonstrated strong commitment and resilience
despite a difficult environment. It has made significant progress in achieving peaceful political
settlement and national security, with dividends to citizens in terms of increased access to
services and poverty reduction. The Government has established its legitimacy and authority and
maintained the rule of law. Rwanda has very robust anticorruption laws and oversight institutions
for controlling corruption, and its leadership is committed to the fight against corruption. The
Government’s efforts have been so effective that Rwanda has remained a low corruption country.
10.     These achievements are extraordinary, but Rwanda still faces significant capacity
weaknesses and shortages in core skills and competencies needed to meet its ambitious
development objectives under EDPRS 2. The Government believes that it must implement
ambitious public sector reforms to deliver results. It radically restructured the administration
early on in the recovery phase in 1998–99, through a downsizing that dismissed more than 6,000
unqualified civil servants and removed more than 6,500 ghost workers from the payroll. To
eliminate the incentive to supplement income through petty corruption and moonlighting, it then
raised salaries for the much smaller number of staff by 40 percent. In 2012 the Government
supported these civil service reforms by implementing the pay and retention policy,24 following
the prime minister’s order to establish a performance appraisal and promotion process for public
servants in 2010.25 Introduction of an Integrated Personnel and Payroll System (IPPIS) in 2010
has also supported implementation of the civil service reforms.26 Beginning in 2000, in tandem
with significant fiscal, political, and administrative decentralization reforms, central government
ministries have been unbundled to create flatter and smaller structures and bring service delivery
closer to the grassroots, in order to improve performance and accountability.
11.   Public sector reforms have improved governance. Rwanda’s performance significantly
improved in all six dimensions of the Worldwide Governance Indicators (WGI) between 1996

Government effectiveness rose from the 11th percentile in 1996 to the 53rd percentile in 2012.
For some dimensions, Rwanda’s rankings are now close to the average for middle-income
countries (Error! Reference source not found.). Three dimensions—government effectiveness,
regulatory quality, and rule of law—are almost at the middle-income country averages, and the
ranking for control of corruption is much higher than the middle-income country average. In
contrast, the percentile rank on voice and accountability is lower than other country groups
(including Sub-Saharan Africa).

12.    Among the range of actions needed to improve accountability, better PFM is
particularly central. The literature confirms a positive relationship between PFM and
accountability. Effective PFM systems can help strengthen democratic influence, oversight, and
accountability in the decision-making processes related to the state budget. It can greatly enhance
transparency, by making well-structured information available on the ways in which public
resources have been used and the results that have been achieved, significantly strengthening the
accountability process in parliament and public audit institutions.28
13.     The Government regards PFM systems and processes as key to the effective and
efficient functioning of the public sector, because they underpin the performance of all sectors
and different levels of government.29 The Government has defined the main objective of PFM
reforms as “to ensure efficient, effective, and accountable use of public resources as a basis for
economic development and poverty eradication through improved service delivery”. It first
embarked on comprehensive PFM reforms in 2008, with the comprehensive Public Financial

   For example, EDPRS 2 states that “Rwanda’s public finance management system is the platform for the efficient

providing effective Accountable Governance” (Para 6.27).

     Financial Accountability (PEFA) report documents this improvement at the national level.
     Scores in all but one category improved between 2007 and 2010 (Error! Reference source not
     found.). Other assessments, such as an independent evaluation of the PFMRS, also show
     improvement. At the subnational level, the 2010 PEFA report assessed four districts. It found the
     nature and scope of external scrutiny of subnational governments to be satisfactory. Rwanda’s
     performance is as good as or better than that of neighboring countries in all categories except
     accounting, recording, and reporting (Error! Reference source not found.).

     16.    There is a need to consolidate the achievements made and to address other
     challenges. Effective PFM is very important in Rwanda, because the central government budget
     represents a large share of GDP (29 percent), a share similar to that in Kenya and Tanzania
     (Table 1). Rwanda’s tax revenue to GDP ratio (14.2 percent) is slightly lower than the average


                                                                     18
for East African countries. The combination of high expenditures and low tax revenues has made
Rwanda more aid dependent than its neighbors.

17.    In addition to addressing these challenges, PFM systems in Rwanda have to keep up
with the country’s rapid development as well as changes in technology. Nominal GDP
almost tripled between 2006 and 2013, and the national budget almost doubled between
FY2009/10 and FY2013/14. As part of decentralization, subnational governments were
completely restructured in 2005. The availability of new technology offers an opportunity to
enhance PFM systems and procedures. Advancing and implementing PFM reforms, including
capacity building and institution strengthening, is an important component of Rwanda’s
development agenda, as reflected in the importance given to this area in both the country’s
medium-term plan and the Bank’s Country Partnership Strategy (CPS).
18.     Statistics are critical for supporting Rwanda’s development agenda. They facilitate
evidence-based policy making and support more efficient and effective use of public
resources. A regular flow of good-quality, comparable data on Rwanda’s evolving social and
economic conditions is fundamental for continuously improving the understanding of the
country’s development challenges, informing the design of well-targeted interventions to address
them, measuring their impact on national poverty and social goals, and using that information to
calibrate policy design and further improve the allocation of scarce public resources. Statistics
arguably play a foundational role in PFM, particularly by informing policy analysis and strategy
formulation and supporting adjustments in planning and budgeting in light of information on the
development results achieved through public sector programs.
19.    Rwanda’s first National Strategy for Development of Statistics (NSDS 1), covering
2009–14, helped establish a foundation for the development of the statistics sector. Building on
successful implementation of the NSDS 1, the Government formulated NSDS 2, which covers
2014–19. Recognizing the important roles of statistics in the PFM cycle, NSDS 2 seeks to
improve statistical advocacy and integrate the use of statistics in decision making.
20.     This Program for Results (PforR) operation (henceforth referred to as “the
Program”) intersects with Government programs in many ways (Error! Reference source not
found.). For example, the Government program on economic planning and budgeting (P1) and
resource mobilization (P2) contribute to policy analysis, strategic formulation, and planning and
budgeting elements of the PFM cycle. The government program on electronic service delivery
and IFMIS (P5) cuts across all elements of the PFM cycle. The strategic objectives on
strengthening civil registration system, administrative records, surveys, censuses, and other
sources of data (Strategic Objective [SO] 1) and developing capacities within the National
Statistical System (NSS) (SO4) contribute to creating good-quality and timely statistics that can
inform policy and strategy formulation and evaluation. The programs to improve the quality and
dissemination of statistics and public statistical literacy (SO3) and improve statistical advocacy



                                                19
and integrate the use of statistics in decision making (SO4) are also expected to contribute to
improved policy analysis and planning/budgeting.

21.     The Government has made progress on gender issues in both PFM and statistics
reforms. It introduced gender-responsive budgeting in five ministries in 2003, and fully
operationalized it in 2008. Currently, all ministries and districts are required to submit gender
budget statements and the gender distribution of employment during budget formulation. The
National Institute of Statistics of Rwanda (NISR) started producing gender statistics in 2011; it
currently covers both national and subnational levels. The Program will support government
efforts to further enhance the mainstreaming of gender issues in both PFM and statistics
programs.
22.    Enhancing PFM will contribute to poverty reduction and shared prosperity. EDPRS
2 defines PFM as the platform for the efficient management of the nation’s resources to achieve
the EDPRS 2 goal of accelerating private sector–led growth and further reducing poverty,
including extreme poverty. This idea mirrors the Bank’s view that poverty reduction is not
merely a question of spending more but also of using resources more effectively. Key to doing so
are effective PFM systems.30 Further enhancing PFM will allow the government to better

allocate its scarce financial resources to achieve national development goals. It will also enable
the government to become more accountable to Rwanda citizens on how public expenditures are
executed in accordance with development goals.
23.    Good-quality statistics are key for making more effective use of existing resources.
NSDS 2 focuses on producing good-quality statistics relevant to poverty reduction and shared
prosperity, such as household surveys, labor statistics, and agriculture survey. The systematic
production and dissemination of economic and social statistics is fundamental for assessing the
impact of expenditures on national poverty and social goals and informing adjustments in
planning, budgeting, or both that improve the allocation of public funds.
24.     The Ministry of Finance and Economic Planning (MINECOFIN) is leading PFM
reforms. Several ministries and agencies are engaged in PFM as a foundational issue (Error!
Reference source not found.). MINECOFIN, the Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA), the
Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA), and the Office of the Auditor General (OAG)
are the implementing agencies for this Program.

25.    Progress and key issues on PFM reforms have been discussed under the PFM
Coordination Forum, which the Bank co-chairs. The Forum includes relevant ministries and
agencies as well as key development partners supporting PFM reforms, including the Bank; the
Government of Belgium; the Department for International Development (DFID); the European
Union (EU); the International Monetary Fund (IMF); and Kreditanstalt für Wiederaufbau (KfW),
the German development bank.
26.    NISR is leading the statistics agenda. It plays a coordination role in the NSS and is the
implementing agency of the Program. NSS stakeholders include other data producers (for
example, line ministries) and users. The Statistics Steering Committee is made up of government
stakeholders and development partners (the European Union, DFID, and the Bank). It functions

mechanism to discuss PFM and statistics reforms jointly, preparation of the Program has
stimulated coordination between the two areas.
National and Subnational PFM
27.     Remaining challenges and proposed solutions: Despite the progress described in the
previous section, there are remaining challenges. The PFM SSP has identified key challenges
and proposed solutions in each program, which are translated into a foundation for defining
sector priorities and outcomes until FY2017/18 (Annex Table 2.1 in the PAD). For example, in
the second program on resource mobilization, key challenges are inadequate resource
mobilization resulting in aid dependency at the national level and lack of discretionary revenues
at the subnational level31. Also, improving the coherence between the national strategies, the
MTEF and the annual budget process has been identified as an area for improvement under the
first program on economic planning and budgeting. Across the PFM sector, and more
specifically under program 7 on PFM sector and coordination, capacity and skill shortages are
identified as key bottleneck. The issue of capacity and skill shortages is more pronounced at the
subnational level, especially on core PFM areas such as accounting, auditing, budgeting, and
reporting.
Statistics
28.     The NSDS 2 for 2014-19 is in the final stages of elaboration. The two overarching
objectives of the NSDS 2 are to produce relevant, reliable and timely statistics to monitor the
progress of the EDPRS 2 and to strengthen and prepare the National Statistical System (NSS).
The NSDS 2 will support the changing requirements in terms of nature and periodicity of data as
Rwanda approaches middle-income status by 2020. The expected outcome of the NSDS 2 is a
strengthened and well-coordinated NSS that is able to constantly monitor development outcomes
and spur effective decision-making and public accountability.
29.     Progress to Date and remaining challenges: During the first NSDS (2009-2014), the
NISR made significant progress in the quality, timeliness and dissemination of data, mainly in
the social and demographic domain. NISR consistently implemented the main social surveys
and the 2012 Population and Housing Census according to a pre-published timetable. In addition,
solid progress was made on data access and dissemination through the creation of a National
Open Data Archive (NADA), where survey microdata can be readily downloaded for further
analysis, and the establishment of an Open Data Portal, which has greatly improved citizens’
access to statistical information. During the NSDS 1 period, Rwanda moved up 20 places on the
World Bank’s Statistical Capacity ranking, from 73rd (out of 149 countries with valid data) at the
end of 2008 to 53rd at the end of 201332. Focusing on Sub-Sahara Africa, Rwanda ranked sixth
in 201333, up from 10th place in 2008. There remain however important gaps to be addressed by
NSDS 2. These gaps relate in particular to the relative lack of economic statistics (data on

agriculture, businesses, and labor market activity are scarce) and the low capacity within the
National Statistical System. In addition, efforts to improve the frequency and quality of certain
types of statistics need to be accompanied by improved access to data for users of statistics. The
Bank’s Open Data Readiness Assessment34 found that there is room to improve data
dissemination, which will result in better and more use of data through an expansion of NISR’s
ongoing Open Data agenda.
30.     The Program Development Objective (PDO) of this Program is enhancing Public
Financial Management and statistics systems to improve transparency and accountability in the
use of public funds, revenue mobilization and the quality and accessibility of development data
for decision making. The Program aims to achieve the following results:
      Increased efficiency in national and subnational revenue collection;
      Improved national and subnational transparency and accountability in the use of public
       funds; and
      Improved use of development data for decision-making.
31.     Government programs to be supported by the Program are a subset of
Government’s own programs. National and subnational PFM and statistics to support effective
PFM cut across three sectors strategies. The Program will support selected programs and
strategic areas essential to achieve the program development objective of the Program through
the results areas (table 3).

II.     METHODOLOGY AND SCOPE
33.     Fiduciary management under Programs is predicated on an integrated approach of
technical, project management, financial management, procurement, related governance aspects,
and disbursements inputs provided by the respective task team members and coordinated by the
designated TTL. This assessment followed the DRAFT Guidance Notes on Program-for-Results
Operations. The assessment from a FM point of view supports the fiduciary aspects within a
government program in a manner consistent with the OP/BP 9.00, PforR. The OECD-DAC “four
pillars” approach was also used in order to define the inherent risks in the procurement
environment. Recent PEFA reports were also used to assess how the overall PFM performance
would affect the program.
34.    A donor fiduciary risk assessment of the General Budget Support (GBS 35) was carried
out by DFID Rwanda in 2011 in close cooperation with the African Development Bank, the
European Union Delegation to Rwanda, the Royal Netherlands Embassy and USAID. The
overall level of fiduciary risk was assessed as moderate. The assessment noted that “there has
been a general strengthening of PFM performance across five of the six major components of the
PFM system with some robust improvements in performance in a number of specific PFM
components. The overall trajectory of change since time of the 2008 Fiduciary Risk
Assessment (FRA) is positive. General improvements in PFM performance, coupled with
ongoing implementation of the PFM Reform Strategy, demonstrate a serious and credible
commitment to reform from the government”.
35.      This fiduciary assessment focuses on identifying the key strengths and weaknesses of the
PFM and procurement systems and measures that are in place to tackle F&C in the achieving the
program development objectives. It also helps the Bank identify fiduciary related risks that will
feed into the overall risk assessment for the program, and selected fiduciary areas that may be
considered as Disbursement Linked Indicators (DLIs). The assessment covers the following
critical elements of an open and orderly program FM system.
(i)    Planning and Budget Preparation: The program budget is realistic, prepared with due
       regard to government policy, and implemented in an orderly and predictable manner.
(ii)   Accounting and Financial Reporting: Adequate program records are maintained and
       financial reports produced and disseminated for decision-making, management, and
       program reporting.
(iii) Treasury Management and Funds Flow: Adequate and timely funds are available to
       finance program implementation.
(iv)   Internal Controls (including Internal Audit): There are satisfactory arrangements to (a)
       monitor, evaluate, and validate program results; and (b) exercise control and stewardship of
       program funds.
(v)    Program Audit: Adequate independent audit and verification arrangements are in place,
       taking.

36.     In line with the FM Sector Board’s FM Practices Manual, the potential FM risks for the
various PFM elements are rated as Low (L), Modest (M), Substantial (S) or High (H) after the
tabular analysis in Section 3. The assessment is also mindful of the gaps that may exist between
form (policies, laws, structures, instructions/manuals) and actual functionality or practices of the
PFM system. Mitigation measures are also proposed to reinforce the government’s PFM reform
efforts and the critical measures are included in the Program Action Plan (PAP).
37.     The first draft of the report was shared through the Government PFM Reform Manager to
obtain feedback for the various PFM actors. Feedback received was discussed and updates made
to report where appropriate. The report was further discussed during the appraisal mission and
agreement was reached on the proposed mitigation measures and program action plan.
III.    FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT RISK CONSIDERATIONS
38.    This section assesses the critical FM elements necessary to record, control, and manages
all program resources and produce timely, understandable, relevant, and reliable financial
information for stakeholders and for audit purposes for the Program.
A. Planning and budget preparation
Overall FM element objective: The program budget is realistic, prepared with due regard to
government policy, and implemented in an orderly and predictable manner.
39.     Consultation with spending ministries in budget formulation: The budget is
formulated through systematic consultations with spending ministries and the legislature,
adhering to a fixed budget calendar (OBL Article 26). MDAs plan their expenditure allocations
to their programs and sub-programs based on their strategic priorities and the MTEF that is
communicated to them BCC. The main issue for reform and modernization efforts of RRA36
relates to the availability of sufficient funding on a timely basis. There is no separate investment
budget and no funding commitment or predictability beyond the one year. Additional budgets
are sourced by RRA from Development Partners (DPs) and currently these funds are available
from the following: PFM Basket Fund; bilateral agreements such as Trademark East Africa and
its support to the implementation of the Customs Single Window; various funders including EC,
AfDB and World Bank for the construction of One Stop Border Posts; Netherlands’ Revenue
Administration’s support to the training of tax auditors; and AfDB for the design of a district
based revenue collection37.
40.     The capacity for budget formulation and preparation in MDAs remains weak particularly
regarding challenges in linking the budget to policy priorities and costing of programs and
strategies. It is important to identify/track budget for the reform activities from the budget for
day-to-day functions of the implementing entities. For example, the PFM program budget under

36
   The Rwanda Revenue Authority (RRA) was established in 1997 as a semi-autonomous agency (SAA), charged
with administering the collection of taxes and customs and excise duties. RRA’s annual budget is subject to scrutiny
by MINECOFIN and subject to approval by Parliament. MINECOFIN provide RRA with annual revenue collection
targets and RRA prepares its spending budget within the ceiling of 3% to 3.5% of the collection targets. Within this
resource ‘envelope’ RRA has full administrative and operational autonomy including implementing human reso urce
management policies that are delinked from the public service terms and conditions of employment. RRA is able to
pay market related salaries and when revenue collection performance exceeds target then a performance bonus is
paid to all staff.

MINECOFIN depicts the sub-programs shown in Table 5 which are only manually aligned with
the PFM-SSP pillars/themes as expected; this raises questions about the extent of proper
conceptualization of Program Based Budgeting (PBB)38. With 30% of program activities for
development externally funded39, this makes it even more difficult to ascertain how spending
contributes to project development objectives.

41.    Citizen’s Guide to the National Budget improves transparency for public finance

made public through appropriate media including publication on the entity website40 as required
under Article 40 of the OBL.
                           Table 6: Planning and budget preparation risk analysis
              Key potential risks                                    Summary Analysis
(i) Inadequate appropriation for the            The SSPs are not clearly visible as programs/sub-
      program in the annual budget              programs in the budgets of the responsible MDAs. The
                                                EDPRS 2 informs the process of prioritizing budget
                                                allocations towards specific programs and projects. Limited
                                                use of the MTEF in outer years as a basis for the annual
                                                budget preparation breeds cynicism in the MTEF process
                                                and could affect medium-term strategic planning for the
                                                Program to meet its objectives.
(ii) Delays in approving the annual             According to OBL Article 35: the Minister normally
      budget.                                   submits the Finance Bill to the Parliament not later than
                                                15th June of each year and the Chamber of Deputies
                                                adopts the Finance Law before 30th June of each year.
(iii) Budget appropriations being diverted      According to OBL Article 42, authorization to incur
      to other activities/programs during the expenditure based on approved budget and procurement
      year.                                     plan is issued on a quarterly basis and on each budget
                                                item.
(iv) Lack of transparency in the budget         The budget is formulated through systematic
      process.                                  consultations with spending ministries and the
                                                legislature, adhering to a fixed budget calendar. The
                                                Citizens Guide to the Budget and uploads of detailed
                                                budget annexes provides public information about the
                                                budget.
(v) Cursory scrutiny of budget proposals        The legislature reviews the budget proposals using
      by the legislature.                       procedures that are firmly established and respected and the
                                                review covers fiscal policies and aggregates for the coming
                                                year as well as detailed estimates of expenditure and
                                                revenue.
Conclusion: Planning and budget preparation risk is assessed as modest. The program budget being
supported by this operation is not properly aligned with the SSPs as disclosed in the budget books but
the authorities were able to extract the eligible program expenditure. The SSPs are being implemented in
an orderly and predictable manner as shown in the analysis for treasury management and funds flow.
Mitigation Measures
42.    Mapping of EDPRS 2 initiatives by Classification Of Functions Of Government
(COFOG) is commended, and the mapping would be more useful if mapping is deepened to the
MDA level to allow for better attribution of the EDPRS2 outcomes to the SSP and to
demonstrate the extent of linkage between policy, planning and budget preparation and execution
and hence contribute to the overall performance management system.

B. Treasury Management and Funds Flow
Overall FM objective: adequate and timely funds are available to finance program
implementation.
43.     A Treasury Single Account (TSA) concept is in place whereby all entities and
autonomous agencies operate sub-accounts of the main TSA. There is a zero-cash handling
policy. RRA uses commercial banks as collection agents with requirement to transfer collections
to the central bank within 3 days. Each day a notional amount equal to the commitment ceiling
would be associated with a sub account and are modified daily according to expenditure and
revenue flows. All cash balances, therefore, are calculated daily and consolidated.
44.     Large district payments are directly made by the Central Government Treasury.
Similarly, the Districts prepare and make large payments for the subsidiary organs through the
treasury to improve cash management. However subnational entities (sectors, pharmacies,
schools etc.) receive transfers as grants, which are expensed at the point of issue. Consequently
the actual expenditure which takes place is not captured by the Government’s accounting system.
45.     Predictability of availability of funds to undertake planned activities to meet the
program objectives is hampered by the variability of cash releases as shown in Table 7
(total shortfall of 23% in FY2012/13). RRA receives its cash directly from BNR (estimated at
2.6% of all revenue collected) daily before loading the net revenue collected to the Treasury
main account and as a result RRA is not part of the treasury main cash flow plan. How far
timeliness affects actual expenditure cannot be assessed at this stage due to unavailable
information on dates of actual approval of cash plans.

       Key potential risks                                 Summary Analysis
(i) Inadequate funds will be made    Predictability of availability of funds to undertake planned
    available for program            activities to meet the program objectives may be affected by the
    implementation.                  variability of cash releases as shown in Table 7 (total shortfall of

                                                31

                                        23% in FY2012/13).
(ii) Diversion of program funds         Authorization to incur expenditure is issued on a quarterly basis
     despite the availability of budget and on each budget item and this can ‘ring-fence’ program
     appropriation and budget           funds. The only acceptable mode of committing expenditure is a
     allocation.                        duly issued “purchase order” generated by the SmartFMS thus
                                        triggering a “commitments” indicating that the allocated budget
                                        has been ‘ring-fenced’ by that amount. After the delivery of the
                                        goods/services and supplier invoice, the commitments convert
                                        into actual charge to government expenditure, and therefore a
                                        liability if not yet paid.
                                        Unused budgets at the end of year lapse according to the OBL
                                        have to be re-voted.
Conclusion: Treasury management and funds flow risk is assessed as modest. The quarterly allocation
process complimented by the TSA provides predictability in the availability of funds for commitment of
program expenditures.
Mitigation Measures
46.     For the program-based budgeting concept to allow budget holders some level of
discretion over inputs and be held accountable for program results; authorization at each budget
item level is too detailed and needs to be re-considered at a higher level of program objective and
sub-chapter level of the economic code adhering to the applicable reallocation rules in Article 46
and other virement rules.
47.     Prompt banking of district revenue collection at nearest commercial bank with service
level agreement to sweep to main district treasury bank account.

C. Accounting and Financial Reporting
Overall FM objective: adequate program records are maintained and financial reports produced
and disseminated for decision-making, management, and program reporting.
48.    The budget classification (Appendix 4) system is comprehensive and consistent with
international standards. The budget is prepared in compliance with the IMF’s Government
Finance Statistics Manual (IMF-GFSM 2001). The Chart of Accounts is also comprehensive to
allow for preparation of full set of financial statements in accordance with the International
Public Sector Accounting Standards (IPSAS). Budget programs and sub-programs41 have been
mapped to the Classification of Functions of Government (COFOG) standards.
49.    A cash flow statement is not included in the consolidated financial statements made
available to the Bank team during the preparation of the Program. The financial statements
accounting policies note that the financial statements are prepared on a “modified cash basis”
whilst the budget is prepared on cash basis. An adverse opinion was given by the Auditor
General on the consolidated financial statements for FY2012 citing persistent weaknesses in
preparation of financial statements including: errors in books of accounts; unexplained balances

especially for embassies.

a. Financial Management Information Systems (FMIS)
50.    The SmartFMS currently has three core modules in active use namely: (i) General
Ledger; (ii) Accounts Payable; and (iii) Revenue management. The SmartFMS is operational in
131 out of 156 Budget Agencies (i.e. 84%) and covering 83% of government payments as shown
in Table 9.
                         Table 9: IFMIS coverage of the 2013/2014 revised budget




51.     The Government has declared that it wishes to embark on the implementation of
future IFMIS that is expected to lead to the further strengthening of its financial
management systems. Key challenges in the existing system include high turnover of users
requiring constant re-training, type of transactions and expectations have evolved and increased
requirement for more functionality and integration; and technology revolution poses stress on
user capacity and this is compounded by connectivity issues at the District level. The future
IFMIS is seen as an opportunity for modernizing and making the management of Rwanda’s PFM
more effective and efficient. The system shall be comprehensive, i.e. it shall cover all levels of
government, all institutions that are part of general government regardless of size and
complexity,42 and all sources and types of funding. The required infrastructural platform has to a
large extent already been created as part of the development and roll-out of the present
SmartFMS, which is also a centralized system accessed by thin web-based clients.
52.    The status of implementation of the 2011 Quality Assurance Group (QAG) report is as
follows: ‘Quick-wins’ and stabilization – timely reports are now produced and qualified audit
reports are reducing; pre-requisites infrastructure for connectivity improved; plan for future

  Including all universities and hospitals if it is concluded that, based on the criteria defined in GFS manual, they
should be considered to be part of the general government sector.



                                                          33
IFMIS has progressed with the completion of the Conceptual Design (CD) prepared by Ernst and
Young (E&Y). Preparation of technical and functional requirements were completed in May
2014 and a Quality Assurance Group (QAG) is being sought to evaluate the requirement to
determine the path for the future IFMIS.
53.     The reporting structure for subsidiary entities (4,869 as of December 2013) is not
clearly defined. Expenditure at subsidiary entities level is not captured and included in the
financial reports (general ledger) of the respective district. In order to address District level
accounting and reporting challenges, MINECOFIN is pursuing to strengthen the financial
management function of the subsidiary entities through a number of initiatives, among them, the
implementation of an accounting and financial reporting system. The SEAS has been
implemented as a pilot in three Districts in Kigali and one each in the other four provinces and is
being used for recording after completing all manual transactions and issuing of checks. SEAS is
an easy to use computer based accounting information system focusing on key expenditure
management functionalities to assist the subsidiary entities to: (i) processes payments; (ii)
process receipts and manage Accounts receivables for institutional clients; (iii) produce
management and statutory financial reports; (iv) deliver services to the public more efficiently,
effectively and economically through increased accountability and transparency.
54.     MINECOFIN intends to roll-out the SEAS to most of the 416 sectors by June 2017 (DLI
7). Where SEAS has been rolled-out, it has helped the sectors to meet the deadline of reporting
to the District by the 5th of each month at the budget line-item level. Rollout to the Non-Budget
Agencies (NBAs) could adopt a phased approach that focuses first on the district hospitals (41 in
number), pharmacies (30 in number) and Mutuelle De Sante-District43 (30 in number) in order to
cover the strategic NBAs. Other NBAs (health centers and primary and secondary schools) could
be provided with Excel templates with pre-defined chart of accounts so that transcripts can be
sent online from where internet services are available or other storage devices used to transmit
the transcript to sectors for loading to SEAS.
55.     Project Accounting and Reporting: The Program will be resident in the MINECOFIN
Single Project Implementation Units (SPIU). Rwanda has taken a positive step following Cabinet
resolution of 11th February 2011 regarding the formation of the SPIU44 across Line Ministries
and Public Agencies, with overall objective of creating an effective institutional framework that
will guide the process of designing and implementing projects that are earmarked to fast track
realization of development targets envisaged in the various sector strategic plans. However, there
are challenges of multiplicity of processes, procedures and information systems (Appendix 6)
resulting from the requirements of individual donors. It is therefore important for the efficiency
of the SPIU to harmonize and have a single system applicable to all projects under the SPIU
irrespective of the donor.

   Key potential risks                                      Summary Analysis
(i) Delays in                The Treasury cash book records all receipts and expenses to and from the TSA.
      recording              Information on expenditures processed centrally (at least 80% of the
      transactions in the expenditure) is input into the cash book from records of completed payment
      accounting system. orders passed on to the National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) for payment.
                             Staff in the Treasury receive daily bank statements from the BNR (each relating
                             to transactions from two days prior) and reconcile the transactions therein with
                             transactions recorded in the cashbook each day. This information is summarized
                             on a monthly basis and a monthly reconciliation statement is prepared.
(ii) Rigidity in the         The CoA is flexible enough to slice and dice program information. The national
      chart of accounts      budget is approved by Parliament by EDPRS2 priorities, programmatic
      (CoA) prevents the classification, by ministry and budget agency and by economic classification.
      addition of new        However, budget presentation does not clearly show how specific SSP pillars
      codes to keep track link to the EDPRS 2 at the implementing agency level. Furthermore, the
      of program related summary financial information in the audit report does not provide detailed
      transactions.          actual expenditure in the same format as the approved budget to allow direct
                             comparison of budget out-turns vis-à-vis original policy intent.
(iii) Inability to keep      The SmartFMS functionalities support extensive budget monitoring in

                             prepared quarterly with reasonably accurate data, broken down to at least
                             program or functional level. Currently, budget execution reports are prepared

                             of priority expenditure. Classification of data allows comparison with the
                             original budget, but expenditure at commitment stage is not captured in the
                             report.
Conclusion: the accounting and financial reporting risk is assessed as substantial especially at the
district level. The full consolidated annual financial statements are not made public. Internal audit reports
show serious concerns about poor records management and this limits the scope of ascertaining the
credibility of financial reports for decision making and accountability.

Mitigation Measures
56.     The Minister of Finance to determine the accounting standards and policies applicable to
all public entities (Article 62 of the OBL) and the Accountant General to set and promote
compliance with the accounting and financial reporting standards applicable to public entities
(OBL Article 63). Therefore, it will be useful to conduct an IPSAS gap analysis46 with the
specific objectives to: (a) provide the country’s accounting authorities and other interested
stakeholders with a common well-based knowledge as to where local practices stand in
comparison with the internationally developed standards of financial reporting; (b) assess the
prevailing variances; (c) chart paths to reduce the variances; and (d) provide a continuing basis
for measuring improvements.
57.     Update and make good use of the administrative segment of the chart of accounts to
capture the Sectors and NBAs as cost centers and create sub-funds [that will roll-up to the district
fund] that could be used to manage allocations/transfers. Upon receipt of electronic reports from
Sectors and transcripts from NBAs; the actual expenses can be charged to the full transaction
strings and the fund and sub-fund dimensions of the Fund Segment can then be used to prepare
individual or consolidated financial statements. An Application Program Interface (API) will
provide an efficient mechanism for updating district financial statements with transactions
undertaken by sectors and NBAs. Also develop standard templates for in-year budget execution
reports to capture commitments and obligations as shown in the illustrative report in annex 5;
this will help in properly accounting for pending bills.
58.    There is over-reliance on vendors for maintaining the current system and this need to be
addressed for the future IFMIS and the SEAS by particularly having in place key staff with the
suggested profile in Appendix 7 in each District but a Hub approach could also be considered to
provide the much needed support.

D. Internal Controls (including Internal Audit)
Overall FM element objective: There are satisfactory arrangements to (a) monitor, evaluate,
and validate program results; and (b) exercise control and stewardship of program funds.

a. Internal Controls
59.     There are a range of different types of internal controls. The most important may be
remembered by the mnemonic SOAPMAPS (Appendix 8) which are in place but with the new
OBL and regulations, current manuals will need to be updated. The OBL Article 19 7º requires
the Chief Budget Manager “to establish and maintain effective, efficient and transparent systems
of internal controls and risk management”. The government manual lay out the processes and
procedures to be followed by the budget agencies to ensure that there is adequate monitoring and
safeguard of assets. The main internal control weaknesses as identified in internal audit reports
include: (i) non-compliance with procurement policy and guidelines; (ii) poor documentation and
filing of accounting records; and (iii) over-expenditure on budget lines despite the IFMIS in-built

  The South Asia Region of the World Bank has developed a ‘Public Sector Accounting and Auditing: a framework
for comparison to International Standards’. The diagnostic questionnaires used to gather information on the
prevalent practices for accounting incorporate the principles contained in the public sector accounting and auditing
standards promulgated by the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC).

budget controls; (iv) irregular and unauthorized expenditures; (v) non-compliance to tax rules
and regulations among others. Strengthening of the internal audit and updating of the
government financial management manual would ensure that the internal control system is
strengthened to ensure that government overarching objectives are achieved.

b. Internal Audit (IA)
60.     Internal audit is an essential component of a well-functioning internal control
system. The capacity and independence of the internal audit function is critical in
ascertaining the efficacy of internal controls that are critical in determining the effective
and efficient use of public funds. The public sector internal audit capability model (IA-CM47)
an internationally accepted benchmark developed by the Institute of Internal auditors (IIA)
prescribes six key elements of the internal audit activity for determining the capability level.
Starting from a level of between 1-2 in 2010, the Office of Chief Internal Auditor (OCIA) targets
to achieve level 4 by 2017 and at this level, internal auditors in various government entities will
have fully complied with the internal audit regulations and implemented the International
Standards for the Professional Practice of Internal Auditing (IPPF48) and will be a driver of
change in Government. Through the PFM Basket Fund internal audit has improved to the level
of 2-3 of the IA-CM and expects to be at level 4 by 2017.
61.     An internal audit service has been established in all government institutions. It is
estimated that there are currently 200 internal auditors all over the country but only two qualified
Certified Professional Accountants (CPA) are in post. The current internal audit structure does
not specify a Head of Unit which poses a challenge in terms of leadership of the internal audit
function at the MDA level.
62.     An extensive internal audit training program has been put in place which saw 49 internal
auditors sitting ACCA examinations in 2011/12, and plans for a further 45 to sit the exams in the
following year. There have also been many courses for special audit skills (IT, PFM, risk-based
audit, procurement, payroll, etc.). TEAMMATE training has been conducted for about 50 staff
and use of the tool is being piloted.

c. Audit Committee
63.    In July 2012, MINECOFIN published a model Audit Committee Charter and
followed by a Handbook that provides broad guidelines that can be used in by Audit
Committees in MDAs and Government Businesses. Of the 94 Ministries, Districts, and
Agencies, 68 have Audit Committees since 2011 and submit reports to Council (83% by
December 2013) or entity heads. Fourteen out of 21 ministries have established Internal Audit
Committees but very few have held meetings. 30 budgeting agencies are yet to establish the
required internal audit committees. MINECOFIN vets the composition of audit committee



47
   IA-CM capability elements: (i) Services and Role of Internal Auditing; (ii) People Management; (iii) Professional
Practices; (iv) Performance Management and Accountability; (v) Organizational Relationships and Culture; (vi)
Governance Structures; and (vii) Use of Information Technology.
48
   The components of the IPPF are: the definition of Internal Auditing, the Code of Ethics, the International
Standards for the Professional Practices of Internal Auditing (Standards), Position Papers, Practice Advisories, and
Practice Guides.



                                                         37
membership49 to ensure compliance. Membership of district internal audit committees is
comprised of elected councilors (politicians). The current challenge is that they mostly lack the
required financial background to perform their duties adequately.
64.    Internal Audit reports are submitted quarterly to Audit Committees including status of
implementation of audit recommendations (external and internal) and the Internal Audit
Department in MINECOFIN consolidates and reports to the Minister of Finance on a quarterly
basis, who then reports to Cabinet starting in December 2013.
                      Table 11: Internal controls (including internal audit) risk analysis
        Key potential risks                                      Summary Analysis
(i)     Internal control system is Authorization of transactions and signing checks are clearly delineated to
        unable to prevent or        provide adequate segregation of duties. Main internal audit findings are
        detect serious              (i) non-compliance with procurement policy and guidelines; (ii) poor
        irregularities, misuse,     documentation and filing of accounting records; and (iii) over-
        and inefficient use of      expenditure on budget lines.
        program funds.
(ii)    Weak IT security and An IFMIS Disaster Recovery and Business Continuity Plan Document
        back-up arrangements.       was produced in 2013. However, evidence of testing the plan is not
                                    available.
(iii)   Internal audit is unable Internal audit staff number is inadequate at MDAs with most ministries
        to provide assurance on having only one audit staff. Also, with only 2 internal auditors per
        the robustness of and district with about 200 subsidiary entities capacity is constrained.
        compliance with internal
        controls.
(iv)    Leakages in payroll.        The OAG audit report on the integrity, accuracy and completeness of
                                    data processed through IPPIS as at July 2012 revealed the following:
                                    lack of formalized processes to register IPPIS users; weak password
                                    controls; lack of disaster recovery plans and mechanisms; lack of
                                    segregation of IPPIS duties; missing social security numbers, bank
                                    details and birth dates. Payroll controls need strengthening considering
                                    the high proportion of cost of compensation of employees for the
                                    program.
(v)     Delayed and irregular Reconciliation of cashbook records with the bank statements for the TSA
        accounts reconciliation.    is carried out on a monthly basis. Staff in the Treasury receive daily bank
                                    statements from the Bank of Rwanda (BNR) (each relating to
                                    transactions from two days prior) and reconcile the transactions therein
                                    with transactions recorded in the cashbook each day. This information is
                                    summarized on a monthly basis and a monthly reconciliation statement
                                    is prepared.
(vi)    Program lacks capacity Internal Audit Service is still in its infancy. Sustained capacity building is
        to effectively monitor, necessary to create expertise in specialist areas such as IT, value for
        evaluate, and validate money, Risk Management, System Audit, Procurement, Payroll, There are
        program results.            still serious concerns on the actual independence of Internal auditors.

     Key potential risks                                  Summary Analysis
Conclusion: the internal controls (including internal audit) risk is assessed as substantial.
Established controls are not fully complied with and the internal audit function is understaffed and also
lacks adequately qualified staff.


Mitigation Measures
65.    With the new OBL and regulations in place, business processes will need to be re-
engineered to strengthen existing processes such as budget controls, requisitioning, purchase
orders, invoicing, payment authorization/approval, accounting and reporting. The emerging
business processes together with functionalities in the future IFMIS will lead to the development of
a Comprehensive Operating Procedures Manuals (COPM50).
66.     A review of the internal audit structure should be considered to establish the right staff
number for internal auditors at each of the public sector institutions in the country. Also, an
Internal Audit Cadre with clear progression path and commensurate compensation package
will help in addressing the attraction and retention of internal auditors. Support staff towards
Certified Internal Auditors of the Institute of Internal Audit (IIA) and other specializations such
as Certified Information Systems Auditor (CISA).
67.     Consolidated risk profiling to be undertaken for GoR programs, institutions and the
various PFM processes. Internal Audit should shift from pre-payment audit to adoption of risk-
based audit using the COSO51 framework and concentrating on systemic issues covering the
Enterprise Risk Management (ERM52) objectives of ensuring (i) conformity to the
Government’s strategy; (ii) effectiveness and efficiency of operations; (iii) reliability of financial
reporting; and (iv) compliance with applicable laws and regulations. The effectiveness of
internal audit further depends on how management reacts to its reports.
68.     Need to establish a robust Business Continuity Management (BCM53) plan by
following the guidelines for the Management of IT Security published by the International
Organization for Standardization (ISO) to develop an information security policy, strategy and
procedures for business continuity and disaster recovery based on incident and impact analysis to
determine the required detective, preventive and corrective controls. This will require
classification of systems as critical, vital, sensitive and non-sensitive and undertake a business
impact analysis to assign crisis levels. Thereafter, Treasury’s recovery capability risk assessment

   Enterprise risk management is a process, effected by an entity’s board of directors, management and other
personnel, applied in strategy setting and across the enterprise, designed to identify potential events that may affect
the entity, and manage risk to be within its risk appetite, to provide reasonable assurance regarding the achievement
of entity objectives.

69.     The membership of district council internal audit committee cannot be easily controlled
since they are elected politicians. This can be addressed by co-opting competent members based
on an agreed sitting fee.

E. Program External Audit
Overall FM element objective: Adequate independent audit and verification arrangements are in place,
taking into account the country context and the nature and overall risk assessment of the program.

70.     Under the Rwanda Constitution, the Auditor General of state finances in Rwanda
has the mandate to audit all public expenditures54. Operating within the core principles of
Supreme Audit Institution (SAI) independence (Box 1), the Office of the Auditor General of
State Finances’ audit objectives of legality, regularity, economy, efficiency and effectiveness of
financial management in the public sector are achieved by the Auditor General reporting directly
to Parliament. Reports prepared by the Auditor General are submitted to the Parliament and
considered by the Committee in charge of public accounts. The Auditor General and Deputy
Auditor General are appointed by a Presidential Order and tenure of office is secured by the
Auditor General and Deputy Auditor General being appointed for a five (5)-year term renewable
only once.
                             Box 1: The core principles on SAI Independence55
i. The existence of an appropriate and effective constitutional/statutory/legal framework and the de
      facto application provisions of this framework
ii. The independence of SAI heads and members of collegial institutions, including security of tenure
      and legal immunity in the normal discharge of their duties
iii. A sufficiently broad mandate and full discretion, in the discharge of SAI functions
iv. Unrestricted access to information
v. The rights and obligation to report on their work
vi. The freedom to decide the content and timing of audit reports and to publish and disseminate them
vii. The existence of effective follow-up mechanisms on SAI recommendations
viii. Financial and managerial/administrative autonomy and the availability of appropriate human, material
      and monetary resources
The principles are supported by application provisions to illustrate the principles and are considered to be
ideal for an independent SAI

Key potential risks                                     Summary Analysis
(i) SAI is unable to     In accordance with Article 184 of the Constitution of the Republic of Rwanda of

                         with notification to both Chambers of the Parliament as opposed to
                         empowering Parliament to pass majority vote to remove the Auditor
                         General is inconsistent with the chief aim of ISSAI 10; Mexico Declaration
                         on SAI independence which calls for independent government auditing by a
                         SAI.
                         Currently OAG has only 4 professionally qualified auditors with an expectation
                         that this number will increase to about 15 by staff who are taking professional
                         examinations.
(iii) Lack of response   Article 69 of the OBL requires that “Parliament, after receiving the report of the
      to, or follow-up   Auditor General referred to in this Article, shall examine it and take appropriate
      on, audit findings decisions within a period not exceeding six (6) months”. There is notable
      and                improvement in the implementation of prior year audit recommendations where
      recommendations. 60% of all recommendations were fully implemented in 2012 and 2013
                         respectively, compared to 49% in 2011. Despite the above improvements, 68%
                         of the audit reports (94 reports) were qualified mainly due to avoidable and
                         easily addressable factors. The number of entities that obtained reports with
                         unqualified (clean) audit opinion increased from 37 reports (28%) in the previous
                         year to 45 reports (32%) in 2013.
Conclusion: the external audit risk is assessed as substantial given the still high number of qualified
audit reports.

72.     OAG will conduct the annual audit of the financial statement of the implementing
agencies including MINECOFIN, RRA, RPPA, NISR and OAG (by an independent audit firm
acceptable to the Bank), in accordance with terms of reference agreed upon by the bank
following INTOSAI international standards. The resultant audit reports and management letters
will be submitted to the World Bank within 6 months after the end of the fiscal year. Similarly
the Bank will follow up on the consolidated Auditor General’s report on the government
consolidated financial statements on an annual basis as part of the Program Implementation
Support Plan to ensure that progress on the agreed upon parameters is being achieved.
73.     Failure to act on audit queries breeds cynicism in the whole audit process. To further
strengthen accountability at the sub-national level, District level PACs should be strengthened to
help in bringing accountability much closer to the electorate.
74.     The Auditor General’s report on consolidated government financial statements is
submitted 10 months after the year-end. Efforts should be made on a gradual basis to shorten the
time to no more than 7 - 8 months after the year-end by FY 2016. This will provide ample time
to the Legislature to hold Chief Budget Managers accountable for the use of the current years’
budget before considering requests for the following year.
75.     With the introduction of PBB, OAG in consultation with other stakeholders can put in
place the policy and regulatory framework to be followed by sustained capacity building for
auditing of performance information (AOPI) using the International Standards on Assurance
Engagements (ISAEs): Assurance Engagements Other Than Audits Or Reviews Of Historical
Financial Information (3000) issued by the International Auditing and Assurance Standards
Board (IAASB). The AOPI will be beneficial by reviewing and providing an opinion or conclusion
on implementing entity’s performance against predetermined objectives (performance information)
of the SSPs supported by the operation in particular and the EDPRS in general and ultimately
reinforce the importance of PBB.
76.      Publication of district council audit reports at their notice board, on either their website or
at Rwanda Governance Board (RGB) would push the boundaries of transparency. The following
provision could be considered for inclusion in the revised regulation for the new OBL to improve
fiscal transparency as a first step to accountability.
(1) District Councils shall post on a notice board in a conspicuous place on the premises of the
    Council and on a notice board in each Sector/Ward for specified period: (a) monthly
    statements of financial accounts; (b) annual income and expenditure statements; (c)
    inventories of assets of the District Councils; (d) bye-laws and notices relating to tax rates
    and fees; (e) minutes of council meetings; and (f) development plans.
(2) Copies of the reports, notices and statements shall be made available on official websites and
    hard copies on request on payment of a fee to be fixed by the District Council.

F. PFM Human Resource and Capacity Building
77.     Through support from the Institutional Development Fund (IDF), the Institute of
Certified Public Accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR) has established its own examination that
complies with the International Education Standards (IESs) published by the International
Accounting and Education Standards Board (IAESB) of the International Federation of
Accountants (IFAC). IFAC also seeks to reinforce professional accountants’ adherence to these
values through the International Ethics Standards Board for Accountants’ Code of Ethics for
Professional Accountants (IESBA Code).

                                                  42
78.     One of the PFM sector priorities is “Human Resources and Capacity Building in PFM
Disciplines”. The Institute of Certified Accountants of Rwanda (ICPAR) has launched its own
professional courses - the Certified Public Accountants of Rwanda (CPA-R) and the Certified
Accounting Technicians of Rwanda (CAT-R); both benchmarked against the International
Education Standards (IES59). To further support ICPAR, PFM education and training could be
strengthened by appropriately updating the technical content of the curriculum in accordance
with IES2 by introducing public sector specific professional values, ethics and attitudes;
coaching and mentorship to acquire practical public sector experience; and leadership skills for
improving capabilities and competence for PFM tasks.
79.      There is dearth of suitably qualified officials to handle PFM functions especially at the
district level where there are serious concerns about high turnover of the few trained staff. It is
instructive to note that as at September 2014, only the Internal Audit Department had vacant
posts of five. More than half of the total number (1,073) of accountants and auditors (internal and
external) have a first degree but there are only 20 (i.e., 2%) fully qualified professionals.
 Table 13: Staff profile for External Auditors, Internal Auditors and Accountants as at September
                                                 2014




Mitigation Measures
80.    MINECOFIN to take a policy position to fund staff for the ICPAR examination since the
examination is IES compliant rather than paying for other international examination. Also, a
scheme of service should be developed to specify the qualification and experience requirements
for the PFM Job Family. An attraction and retention policy and strategy to enhance the
capability of the PFM Job Family or cadre is required.
81.    Officials in charge of PFM functions in the District Councils are mostly unqualified
despite handling substantial amounts of public funds. Having in place Chief Finance Officers
(CFO) and Internal Auditors who are bearers of a professional certificate in Accounting and
Auditing should at least have Accounting Technician as a minimum, depending on the budget
size, complexity of the environment and risk profile together with knowledgeable and

experienced Budget Officers and Procurement Officers will help in improving PFM performance
and support service delivery.
82.    Engage with Ministry of Public Service and Labor (MIFOTRA) to explore how
continuous training on PFM (as rare skills) can be addressed with lessons from the Strategic
Capacity Building Initiative (SCBI).

IV.    PROCUREMENT MANAGEMENT RISK CONSIDERATIONS
83.    Public procurement is listed as one of the sector priorities under Pillar 3 in the PFM
SSP with the objective of improving compliance, efficiency, transparency, fair competition,
value for money and controls in public procurement. E-procurement is a tool that can help
achieve this objective. Rwanda has an annual procurement turn-over of about US$800 million.
With typical savings of around 10% resulting from the use of e-Procurement, this would be a
huge potential for savings. Although not mentioned in the PFM strategy, the implementation of
e-procurement is one of 8 e-Gov projects planned in the National ICT Strategy to improve the
operational efficiency and service delivery of the Government. Reference to e-Procurement is
also made in the medium-term strategic plan of the RPPA for FY2012/13-2014/15. The
Government is aware of the potential benefits of e-Procurement and there is a general desire and
commitment to adopt e-Procurement sooner than later. To this end, e-Procurement qualifies as a
possible PFM component in the Program.
84.     With the assistance of the World Bank, Crown Agents conducted a feasibility study on e-
procurement and prepared a Conceptual Design that has already been submitted to the
Government. The study proposes a competitive open bid to select an e-procurement solution
(p.35). At the same time, the Government has requested the Korea Tel-Com to submit both
technical and financial proposals prior to making a decision either to go by a competitive process
or the Korean solution through direct contracting procedures. The Government is under
discussion on either to procure the Korean solution through the direct contracting procedures or
other procurement methods. In the meantime, the mission learned that Korean Telecom is in
partnership with the Government and formed a company called Africa Olleh Network Services
(AOS) to manage information technology services, install optic fiber and to upgrade Rwandan
communication information networks systems.
85.      Direct contracting will require MINECOFIN to invoke Article 17 complemented by
Article 23 (Impossibility to meet conditions for use of given method) of the Public Procurement
Law to justify the direct contracting of e-procurement. According to Article 23 of the Law,
“When prevailing circumstances make it impossible to meet the conditions for use of given
method and a procuring entity finds it necessary to use a less competitive method under this
Law in order to effect procurement, it shall seek authorization from the Rwanda Public
Procurement Authority”. The RPPA shall give the authorization after receiving a reasonable
justification from the procuring entity accompanied by a confirmation from the supervising
Minister that such procurement is in public interest.” In this specific case, justifications to use
less competitive procurement method should be supported by the Minister of MINECOFIN and
submitted to the Director General, RPPA for approval.
86.    Procurement management of e-procurement would be critical to the proposed program
achieving results to ensure transparent, effective, efficiency and monitor the public procurement
function so to achieving Government’s desire to modernize the procurement system. Further,
procurement management of the statistics training center and selection of consultants to improve

                                                44
the function of NISR also will contribute to meeting the strategic objective of this program.
Based on the foregoing, the procurement team conducted procurement capacity assessment of
the following entities: (i) Department of Corporate Services of MINECOFIN. This department
will be responsible for procurement management of e-procurement and (ii) Department of
Corporate Services of NISR that will be responsible for procurement management of the
statistics training center and selection of various consultants for statistics. The Bank carried
procurement capacity assessment and found out that both procuring entities have reasonable
capacity save for a few challenges discussed herein. In FY2012/13, the Department of Corporate
Services of MINECOFIN processed a total 75 contracts while that of NISR processed a total of
65 in all procurement categories of works, goods and consulting services. Procurement of Goods
contract takes major share in terms of number of contracts while in terms of single contract value
procurement of works takes the lion’s share.

                                                                  million)

87.     Maximum value of IT procurement, so far, handled by the procurement office of
MINECOFIN is Rwf 244 million (equivalent to $360,000). The cost estimate of e-procurement
solution is about US$4 million. This is 10 times of the single contract the procurement unit of
MINECOFIN has ever handled. Given that procurement of e-procurement solution would be
complex and of large value, the procurement unit of MINECOFIN would need a technical
support of the e-procurement expert.
88.    NISR will select a consultant to conduct the design review related to existing office
renovation and designing of a training center. Since NISR establishment does not have a civil
engineering department, they will receive technical support from Rwanda Housing Authority,
which will provide approval as a custodian of the Government Asset.
89.     Challenges and risks would include: (a) rejection of the direct contracting justifications
by the Director General of RPPA to procure the Korean solution if found insufficient and revert
to competitive method; (b) a perceived conflict of interest in terms of invoking Article 17 of the
Public Procurement given that the Director General of RPPA is the interested party of e-
procurement and may be unable to review justifications forwarded by MINECOFIN objectively
with independent mind; (c) absence of a specialist of e-procurement to provide technical support
and guide during procurement process and operationalization of e-procurement; and (d) absence
of a civil engineering department within NISR to provide technical support related to design and
construction of a training center.
90.    These risks may be mitigated by following measures: (a) in the case of direct contracting,
decision may be done by the Board of Directors instead of the Director General of RPPA; (b)
The Government will recruit a consultant to assist implementation of e-procurement; and (c)
NISR will receive technical support from Rwanda Housing Authority, which will provide
approval as a custodian of the Government Asset.


                                               45
A. Pillar I: Legislative and Regulatory Framework
91.     The Government has acceptable public procurement legal framework that is based on the
UNCITRAL model, and it is quite robust and covers all aspects of public procurement at all
levels of Government. The RPPA is a Public body that was established on February 20, 2008 by
the Law No. 63/2007 of December 30, 2007. It was created to replace the National Tender Board
during a reform process in Public financial management launched by the Government, in which
Public procurement reform was one of the most important components. The Government revised
the Law in 2012 to incorporate comments, which were issued during Phase II of the Use of
Country System (UCS) exercise conducted by the Bank. The revised Law was gazzetted in April
2013 to become a Law.
92.   The Bank reviewed the Procurement Law and found it acceptable save for the Rwanda
Law requirement of payment after goods have been received even under CIP (Article 86).
B. Pillar II: Institutional Framework and Management Capacity
93.     Under the Law, RPPA is responsible for procurement oversight function of the public
procurement both at the central and local government. It is therefore responsible for setting
procurement standards, guidelines and procedures to ensure transparent, effective, efficiency and
monitor the public procurement function. The Law also provides for establishment of the
Independent Review Panels, both at the central and district level. Further, the Law also
establishes the institutional arrangement at a procuring entity level, including; (i) Procurement
Unit (PU); (ii) Tender Committee (TC); and (iii) Accounting Officer (Chief Budget Manager).
The PU is responsible for carrying out the procurement process from the planning process to the
completion of the contract execution. The TC is responsible for conducting bids opening,
evaluation and recommendation for award of contracts. Accounting Officer approves reports of
the TC and signs the contract on behalf of the procuring entity.
94.    The Public Procurement Law requires procuring entities to prepare annual procurement
plans and submit to the MINECOFIN together with their work plans as part of the budgeting
process. Equally, the Public Procurement Law requires that all budget entities publish an annual
procurement plan. RPPA monitors this process and majority of plans are now prepared and
published on the DgMarket website60 in addition to RPPA’s web site. Normally procurement
plans are approved in June, and both MINECOFIN and NISR revise their procurement plans
once at mid-fiscal year in line with budget revision by the government. It is a requirement that
submission of the procurement plan must accompany the budget request.
95.     The Procurement tools prepared by RPPA has detailed parameters to be included in the
Procurement Planning Template and accordingly consists: - Description of contract, Procurement
Method, Source of Funds, Lead Time for No Objection to DBD (from RPPA where required),
Publication Lead Time, No Objection Lead Time to Contract Award and Contract Management
(delivery Period).
96.    Both MINECOFIN and NISR have Internal Tender Committee (TC) comprising of 7
members. The TC is vested with responsibility of bid opening, evaluation and recommends
contract awards to be approved by the Chief Budget Officer. The TC normally serves as standing

                                               46
committee for duration of two years. The quorum for the TC to make a decision is two third and
it meets regularly when there is need.
C. Pillar III: Procurement Operations and Market Practices
97.    Open competition is a default approach in line with the procurement law and the
ministerial orders. National Competitive Bidding (NCB), International Competitive Bidding
(ICB), Shopping, Direct Contracting (DC) and Restricted Tendering (RT) are the common
methods practiced based on the thresholds. The predominant procurement methods used by the
assessed agencies are NCB and Shopping. A clear and applicable guideline for procurement
method selection and process is elaborated in User Guide. Besides, Standard bidding documents;
Standard template for bid opening report; and Standard template for bid evaluation are provided
by the RPPA. The SBDs used for open domestic bidding are comprehensive in nature and
contain all the relevant information which should enable bidders to prepare responsive bids. The
evaluation criteria are generally non-discriminatory and encourage competition.
98.     According to the manuals the average business standard time to prepare a bidding
document for Goods is 5 days and to finalize evaluation 21 days. The assessment revealed that in
practice the average time to prepare bidding document is between 5-7 days and for evaluation is
between 1-4 days for relatively small contracts. Bid evaluation must not take more than 21 days.
At the MINECOFIN, contract awards are approved and signed by the Director General of
Department of Corporate Service (on behalf of the Permanent Secretary) while at the NISR it is
the Budget Corporate Manager, who is the Deputy Director General.
99.      Registration of suppliers’ list is a requirement and is done at Rwanda Development
Board, with a link to RRA and Rwanda Social Security Board (RSSB). But the registration is not
restrictive and can simply be undertaken on line. It is a practice that RPPA provides price
references on regular basis for use by procuring entities has contributed a lot to ensuring fairness
of the prices.
100. Standard Bidding Documents, Standard Request for Proposal, and standard templates
issued by RPPA are consistently used by implementing agencies. The standard bidding
documents are modelled from the World Bank Standard Bidding Document. The standard
bidding documents are accompanied by user guides to assist the entities in completing them.
101. Procurement arrangements provide for wide advertising of bidding opportunities, through
local print and online media, such as, DgMarket, PPS, Client connection, UNDB online, etc., and
the implementing agencies have practiced accordingly.
D. Pillar IV: Integrity and Transparency of the Public Procurement System.
102. Rwanda has a two tier for the administrative review process. A complainant is required to
lodge a complaint with the Chief Budget Officer at the procuring entity as the first level. In this
case, they are the Director of Corporate Services Department of MINECOFIN and the Deputy
Director General of NISR. The second level is the Independent Panel Review. The Law also
gives RPPA mandate to debar firms. Since its establishment in 2008, RPPA has so far debarred
29 firms and are publicized on the RPPA website.
103. The Rwanda Procurement Law has established an Independent Review Panel at the
National level and Independent Review panels at the District level for the purpose of conducting
independent reviews of complaints and rebuttal of the public procurement process. It has seven



                                                47
(7) members composed of Government, civil society and private sector representation. The
proportion from the Government is less than 50%. The tenure is 3 years renewed once.
104. The Law provides 7 days grace period of Provisional Notification to allow bidders to
lodge complaints. Bid result is notified to all bidders including non-qualifying bidders. Likewise,
response to the complaints should be given within seven days from the date of filing of the
complaint. Procedure for contractual disputes resolution is in place, by the procurement law.
Disputes are resolved by agreement of the parties involved. Where no agreement is reached,
arbitration is encouraged and used. Judicial reviews come as a last resort when arbitration has
failed.
105. At both agencies, there is a system of accountability with defined responsibilities and
delegation of authority for contract procurement processing, evaluation, approval and signing of
contracts. RPPA normally conducts procurement audit on sample basis. The Authority has a total
of 54. With the existing manpower, the Authority is in short of carrying out audit every year for
all procuring entities. Based on the audit statistics, the prone risk area, which has been identified
by RPPA is forgery of the bid documents such as bid securities.
106. RPPA plays a key role in procurement oversight, being part of the control systems for
public procurement. RPPA conducts annual audits of 30-50% of the procuring entities. These are
comprehensive audits that cover the whole procurement cycle, i.e. procurement planning,
procurement process and contract management.           Other oversight entities involved in
procurement audits include: (i) OAG was established in 1998 to carry out external audits; (ii) the
Chief Internal Auditor was appointed in 2006; (iii) MINALOC; and (iv) Ombudsman Office.
RPPA uses the report of the Auditor General to help them to focus its training for a particular
implementing agency in those areas of weakness. RPPA communicates corruption cases to the
Ombudsman Office and Fraud cases to the Public Prosecutor/CID for further investigation and
prosecution. Procurement audits are the primary responsibility of RPPA while the OAG will in
most cases conduct procurement audits as a means to ascertain whether internal controls are
working. Harmonization and coordination on this front is required to avoid double effort of these
oversight institutions.
107. This assessment revealed both strengths and weakness in the procurement environment,
which have been summarized as follows:
108. Findings on the strengths of the procurement systems and practices: (i)
MINECOFIN and NISR procurements are generally sound and consistent with the budget, and
completion reports are prepared; (ii) Both implementing agencies have an established
institutional setup for implementation of procurement activities; (iii) There are adequate
suppliers of goods, works and services at national and district level; (iv) Reasonable oversight
and accountability exists. Procurements and/or contracts are monitored regularly, by RPPA on
sample basis. All procuring entities are required to provide a monthly report to RPPA on the
implementation of the procurement plan. RPPA has the overall responsibility to train all new
comer’s procurement officers as well as new internal tender committees in national procurement
procedures as outlined in the Procurement Law. In addition to that, RPPA provide training to all
procurement officers to refresh their knowledge on regular basis. Besides, the OAG undertakes
compliance auditing, in addition to the established financial auditing. OM is also conduct
procurement audits as part of its investigation upon receipt of such information. Also, both
procuring entities have internal auditors who review financial and procurement operations on
regular basis sometimes; (v) The public procurement Directives provides that implementing


                                                 48
agencies are required to comply with the well-defined complaints handling mechanism and is
implemented through National Independent Review Panel mechanism; (vi) Good number of
works and goods contracts are awarded based on the lowest evaluated responsive bidder; (vii)
Good number of contracts are awarded based on criteria provided in bidding documents; (viii)
Good number of consultancy services contracts are awarded through Quality and Cost Based
Selection (QCBS) procedures.
109. Findings on the weaknesses for implementation of procurement: (i) There are
irregularities in implementing the procurement legal framework and systems, (prolonged period
for bids preparation than that prescribed in the legal documents)61; (ii) High turnover of
procurement officers; (iii) Rwanda Public Procurement Authority (RPPA) Procurement
procedures require agencies to publish contract awards on media accessible to the public, in
principle on similar media used for bid advertisement. The assessment revealed that this is not
implemented by both agencies; (iv) Capacity of RPPA to carry out comprehensive procurement
audits on annual basis as part of its regulatory mandate is low. At the national level, most
agencies are audited only once in two years; (v) Lack of coordination of procurement auditing by
RPPA and OAG; (vi) Sometimes selection of consultants is conducted based on “Open
Competitive” like procurement of goods and works, in contrary to the procurement law.
110. The overall procurement risk in implementing the Program is moderate, and all identified
risks can be mitigated for the successful implementation of the Program.

V.      GOVERNANCE AND ANTI-CORRUPTION (GAC)
        CONSIDERATIONS
111. The assessment also covered the capacity of the governance systems and
arrangements to handle risks of fraud and corruption, including commitment to use the
Bank’s Anti-Corruption Guidelines (ACGs) in PforR financing, the use of complaints
handling mechanisms and how such risks are managed and mitigated. The assessment also
covered views from non-state actors (including members of TI Rwanda, the PSF). Discussions
with non-state actors focused on how well they perceive the government fiduciary and
complaints/grievance handling systems to be working and risks for fraud and corruption. The
section provides more details on assessment of the legal and institutional arrangements for
investigating and prosecuting F&C cases, the assessment of ability to apply the ACGs and
assessment of the complaints/grievance handling mechanisms for the Program.
Assessment of Legal and Institutional Arrangements for fighting Fraud and Corruption
112. This assessment shows that Rwanda has relatively strong institutional and legal
frameworks to deal with F&C cases and also prevention and public education. There are
relatively strong institutions of accountability, integrity and oversight, including the Public
Accounts Committee (PAC) of Parliament, the OM and OAG. The assessment also shows that
the legal and institutional arrangements have improved over the years with clear political will at
the highest level and achieving very good results. There is division of responsibilities between
the OM which deal with cases of corruption and the NPPA/CID, which deals with cases of fraud,

Procurement Law, Regulations and Procedures.”



                                                     49
while the NPPA prosecutes cases on fraud and corruption after investigations. The NPPA has
10 prosecutors who worked on fraud and corruption and each one prosecutor for each of the 30
districts. The prevention directorate of the OM assists both public and private organizations and
non-profit organizations in reviewing their business processes to identify and address gaps that
might create opportunities for corruption. It also has the mandate to review the systems and
procedures and make recommendations on corruption prevention measures. There seems to be
good working relationships and understanding among the agencies with a common purpose of
minimizing opportunities for fraud and corruption and dealing decisively with it when it occurs
through investigation and prosecution.
113. The legal provisions for investigation, prosecution and prevention of fraud
corruption and enforcement are quite strong. Corruption is comprehensively defined in the
Organic Law of the Penal Code62 and there are several other laws to help fight, prevent,
investigate and punish fraud and corruption63. The Law establishing the Office of the
Ombudsman was amended in 2013 (Law No. 76/2013) to enable the OM to prosecute cases of
corruption in order to speed up the process of prosecution. At the time of the assessment, the OM
was in the process of setting up a prosecution unit and thus the NPPA will still be responsible for
prosecution of both fraud and corruption cases until the OM is ready to take on this
responsibility. Also a Whistle Blowers’ Protection Act was passed in 2013 to give reasonable
assurance and incentives to report cases of fraud and corruption. One key innovation for
deterrence is a naming and shaming policy for persons convicted of corruption whose names and
offences are published in newspapers and at the website64 of the OM. On public procurement,
the Procurement Law is complemented by two ministerial orders, (a) ministerial order no.
002/10/10/TC of 25/06/2010 which governs public procurement and tender and tender document
issues and (b) Ministerial order no. 001/11/10/TC24/01/2011 which establishes professional
codes of code of ethics governing state employees involved in procurement, including annual
declaration of their assets. Together, these three documents aim to limit the opportunities for
fraud and corruption in public procurement. Overall, the legal and institutional frameworks give
reasonable assurance of the capacity to deal with cases on fraud and corruption in the Program.
However, staffing capacity in investigation in OM is a concern. There were two vacancies yet to
be filled at the time of the assessment due to delays from the Ministry of Public Service and
Labour. It will be important for the OM to complete the process of setting up the prosecution unit
and appropriately staffing the unit as well training new and young prosecutors of the NPPA.
114. The independence of the OM is key for effectiveness. The OM has operational
independence. The Chief Ombudsman is appointed for a five year term, renewable once, and
two deputies are appointed for four year term each, renewable once. The OM reports to
Parliament and the Office of the President and has independence in its operations. The Steering
Committee of the OM includes representatives of the private sector and civil society who provide

guidance and advice to the OM on issues and areas to focus on and helps to institutionalize third
party voice and participation in the fight against corruption.
115. The Auditor General's report provides pointers to potential cases of fraud and
corruption, in addition to the public providing information through hot lines and other
media. The OAG produces an annual report on the use of public funds in Governmental organs
and institutions. The annual report is sent to Parliament (Public Accounts Committee) and a copy
is provided to the Prosecutor-General as provided for by Article 184 of the Rwandan
Constitution as revised to date. The NPPA then appoints a team to analyze the report and
investigate persons suspected of complicity in mismanagement of public funds in general, where
necessary. However, the law does not require a copy of the report to be provided to the OM
which is responsible for investigation of cases of corruption. With the amendment of the law to
enable the OM to prosecute cases of corruption, it would be important to officially require a copy
of the report of the Auditor General to be sent to the OM and this can be included in the PAPs.
116. The Parliamentary Public Accounts Committee provides effective oversight and
check on public finances. Even though it is relatively new (established in April 2011), it has
proven to be capable and effective in providing oversight of financial management. Its nine
members have regularly called Chief Budget managers and other public officers to account in
public hearings on their scrutiny and analysis of the report of the OAG. The PAC refers cases of
misuse of funds to the prosecutor general for prosecution and requires report on how their
finding and recommendations have been followed. They also monitor the implementation of the
report of the AOG and agencies who do not achieve more than 60 percent implementation are
sanctioned. These measures have positive impact in enhancing the accountability of public
institutions and officials, including MINECONFIN, RRA and NISR. This has contributed to the
relatively low levels of corruption. The systems in place both at the national and in the PforR
implementing agencies provide reasonable assurance that the resources from the program will be
used for the intended purposes with economy and efficiency.
Assessment of Complaints and Grievance Handling Systems for Fraud and Corruption
117. There are multiple channels of making and recording complaints and grievances on
F&C, including on procurement: There is a reasonably good citizen’s engagement and
sensitization on issues of fraud and corruption and channels to report or complain. Both the OM
and NPPA have regular press conferences aimed at sensitizing the public at large on fraud and
corruption in order to prevent the public from engaging in this and related crimes since persons
found guilty are harshly punished.
118. Complaints and grievances related to fraud are reported or redirected to NPPA and the
Police, while corruption cases are reported to the OM. On fraud, Chief Prosecutors at all
Prosecution Levels are duty bound to receive complaints from the public every day on
allegations of fraud. This enables issues to be handled in a timely manner and prevents
complainants from seeking to use corrupt means to solve their concerns. The Chief Prosecutors
write monthly reports to the Prosecutor-General informing him of all complaints received and
how they were resolved. Prosecutors also have timelines within which they must have taken a
decision on each case, failure of which reasonable cause must be given.




                                               51
119. Complaints on fraud come from multiple sources, including the public, private bidders,
newspaper reports and the organized private sector and civil society. In terms of systems for
making complaints on fraud related to FM or procurement both national level and in the districts,
the NPPA has the following systems including (a) dedicated free hotline65 that enables anyone
with information on corruption or has a complaint can easily communicate to NPPA; (b) secured
complaints boxes in public offices and at the districts maintained by the OM; (c) dedicated email
accounts (d) newspaper reports/allegations (d) letters – official or anonymous and (e) third party
sources such complaints made through TI Rwanda or the PSF, where members of the public feel
more confident and protected to report in some cases.
120.    In the case of corruption, there also similar multiple sources of receiving complaints and
grievances, including hotlines, secure complaints boxes in most public organizations and an in
each of the 30 districts, via email and letters and through third parties such as TI Rwanda and the
PSF offices. The assessment suggests that these complaint mechanisms work reasonably well.
The TI Rwanda, for example, has offices in five districts and has a toll free number (2641) for
receiving complaints on corruption and fraud which it consolidates at its head office, review and
pass on to the appropriate authorities (OM, NPPA or CID) for investigations. TI Rwanda also
has a web based tool for the public to report corruption cases. It has signed an MOU with the
OM to share such information for further investigation. These existing systems will be used for
handling complaints and grievances under the Program.
121. These are already requirements in the procurement law, anti-corruption provisions and
service chatters in public institutions which are reasonably enforced. These mechanisms and
tools include the use of complaints boxes, emails and letters. However, for the Program, in order
to strengthen transparency during implementation there will need to improve records keeping
and maintaining a database of complaints received in each implementing agency (MINECOFIN,
RRA, NISR). As already required by Rwanda’s law, the implementing agencies will report any
fraud and corruption allegations to NPPA and OM, respectively. In agreement with the
Government, these agencies will report such allegations to the World Bank and share such
information with the World Bank in real time according to the ACGs.
122. In the specific case of districts, the Program will use existing channels for complaints and
grievances (see Figure 7). For corruption, there are secured complaints boxes in all districts
manned the OM and checked quarterly. Complaints and grievances can also be made through
phone, emails and letters directly to the Office of the Ombudsman. The OM also has informants
all over the country, including districts who provide information on possible fraud and corruption
to the HQ in Kigali. In the case of procurement, complaints normally go to the Chief Budget
Manager in the first instance, but could also be made directly to the OM or NPPA when fraud
and corruption are suspected. In addition, the OM carries out surprise checks on these agencies.
However, more needs to be done to improve internal controls due to capacity constraints in the
districts and this is part of the PAP for PFM in this operation and will be expected to have
positive impact on mitigating the risk of fraud and corruption.

to the District Review Committee (in the case of districts) and finally to the national appeal
committee Complaints related to suspected cases of fraud and corruption in procurement are
referred to the OM and NPPA by the NPPA for investigation and possible prosecution.
Complaints from citizens on suspected cases of fraud and corruption are also lodged with the
RPA or directly to the OM or NPPA. Figure 7 below summarizes the system for receiving and
handling complaints and grievances related to fraud and corruption.
124. Table 15 below summarizes number of complaints received on corruption by the OM
since 2009/10. It shows that 307 of 453 cases (68 percent) were investigated with only 9 sent to
prosecution and 18 transmitted to other institutions, including the police. Many of the complaints
received are related to maladministration, followed by local entities, procurement and justice
sector. A major challenge noted is the lack of evidence or information to prosecute allegations of
corruption. Almost all cases prosecuted have been petty corruption rather than grand corruption.

A. Program specific assessments of risks of Fraud and corruption
125. Application of World Bank Anti-Corruption Guidelines: The assessment also
examined the capacity and commitment of the Government institutions to implement the Bank’s
ACGs which provide measures that will mitigate the risks of fraud and corruption in the
Program. The application of the ACGs to the Program is summarized below.
(i)    Sharing of debarment list of firms and individuals: MINECOFIN-SPIU will share with
       the procuring entities the list of firms or individuals on the World Bank’s debarment or
       suspended list and ensure that these are not allowed to bid for contracts or benefit from a
       contract under the operation during the period of debarment or suspension. Though
       Rwanda procurement law does not automatically debar firms on the World Bank list from
       participating in public procurement, the application of the ACGs agreed to by the
       Government will require the use of the World Bank list of debarred and suspended firms
       and individuals. The Office of the Auditor General and RPPA will check compliance and
       report to the World Bank every six months as part of the reporting requirement of the
       PforR operation.
(ii)   Sharing of information with the World Bank on fraud and corruption allegations: All
       program managers are required by law to forward any allegations of fraud and corruption
       to the OM and NPPA respectively. The OM and NPPA will share such information with
       the World Bank in real time on all allegations of fraud and corruption received from the
       public and the complaints system. This is necessary to demonstrate commitment to
       transparency and openness in the program to the ACGs and take immediate remedial action
       in the program.
(iii) Investigation of fraud and corruption allegations: The OM and NPPA have the legal
      mandate to investigate any allegations of fraud and corruption and prosecute such cases. As
      a result, all allegations of fraud and corruption will be investigated by the OM and the
      NPPA and those found to be credible will be prosecuted by NPPA and OM. The World
      Bank’s Institutional Integrity Vice Presidency (INT) may also investigate any fraud and
      corruption allegations made against the entire program or part of the program. Thus there
      are two possible tracks to investigation, depending on the circumstances: (i) The OM and
      NPPA may undertake their own independent investigations of fraud and corruption
      allegations that may arise from complaints or sharing of information under the above
      paragraph; (ii) INT may undertake its own corruption fraud investigations related to the
      PforR operation. In such cases the Program and OM and NPPA will collaborate with INT
      to acquire all records and documentation that INT may reasonably request from the
      operation regarding the use of the Program.

measures:

Enhancing      national Direct payment of taxes to the transit bank accounts of the RRA and districts

                        which investigates allegations and suspicions of fraud, working closely with
                        the police and prosecution. The policy to broaden the tax base and improve
                        includes the roll out of VAT. One key challenge in the roll out of EBM to
                        enhance VAT implementation and compliance is the low level of take up on
                        EBM machines by businesses. All businesses were expected to have EBM
                        installed by December 2013. Out of the target of 8000 EBM machines only
                        3000 have been installed and not all 3000 machines are used. The F&C risks
                        are in the non-usage of the machines and under declaration of revenues from
                        VAT. Other F&C risks in revenue include weak tax administration at district
                        level also poses F&C risks but this will be mitigated by the RRA taking on
                        revenue collection responsibilities on behalf of districts.
E- Procurement          The main risks assessed is the potential for conflict of interests as the RPPA is
                        an interested party and at the same time will be required to provide an opinion
                        when the Government decides on using direct contracting/single sourcing
                        with a Korean provider. The potential for non-transparency of the process will
                        be a concern in that case. It is worth noting however that the Government is
                        yet to make a decision.
                        The Auditor General’s report has also raised the concern for the excessive use
                        of single sourcing in public procurement; this has potential F&C risks.
Auditing and internal With capacity gaps in staffing at the district level, concerns about internal
controls                controls, and all districts having qualified audits, the risks of fraud and
                        corruption in the program remain a concern mainly at the district level.
Statistics              No significant F&C risks were identified at this stage, but the NISR has to
                        manage procurement of works and services under the program by beefing up
                        the staffing of procurement. The NISR has unqualified audits and seems to
                        have the capacity to implement the Program in a transparent and accountable
                        manner with the oversight of its board.


In conclusion, F&C risks for implementing the Program is moderate in the program areas
selected. Rwanda has the institutional and organizational capacity to handle issues of fraud and
corruption in the program but will have to take action to address the risks areas identified,
including adequate staffing in investigations and PFM at district level. Otherwise, the ex-post
detection and ex-ante prevention of corruption are quite sound and give reasonable assurance
that issues of fraud and corruption will be handled and the existing systems will respond
adequately.

VI.    PROGRAM ACTION PLAN
127. To address the key challenges and constraints revealed by this assessment, the time-bound
Program Action Plan was formulated (see Annex I on Program Action Plan in the PAD). The
fiduciary team will engage closely with the authorities as part of the overall Implementation
Support Plan.

1. Interpretation of risk ratings
 Risk level      Detail
 Low             Represents a situation where the structure of the PFM system broadly reflects good
                 international practice and there is routine compliance with the majority of controls
                 within the system. Any remaining weaknesses are being addressed.
 Modest          Represents a situation where the structure of the PFM system broadly reflects good
                 international practice, although there may be some gaps or inefficiencies. There is
                 basic compliance with controls within the system but regular exceptions occur. There
                 is a credible commitment to addressing key weaknesses.
 Substantial     Represents a situation where the structure of the PFM system falls short of good
                 international practice in a number of areas and/or there are numerous and/or material
                 weaknesses in compliance with many of the controls within the system. Reform
                 plans may need to be strengthened and prioritized.
 High            Represents a situation where the structure of the PFM system shows a significant
                 divergence from good international practice and/or there is widespread lack of
                 compliance with many of the controls within the system. Commitment to a credible
                 reform program is required.

7. Different types on Internal Controls
There are a range of different types of internal controls. The most important may be remembered by
the mnemonic SOAPMAPS.
   Segregation of duties: the functions of authorizing transactions; recording the transactions; and
    custody of the associated assets should be undertaken by separate staff
   Organization: there should be a clear organization chart and all staff should have up to date job
    descriptions that clearly indicate their responsibilities
   Authorization and approval: all transactions and decisions should be formally authorized by
    nominated staff
   Physical: there should be suitable controls over access to offices, assets, controlled stationery
    and computer systems



                                                 62
   Management: production of suitable financial and operational management information; use of
    exception reports; critical review and enquiry by management
   Arithmetical and accounting: checking / re-performing tasks carried out by others; costing
    (adding up) orders, invoices, payroll etc; reconciliation between the bank and accounting
    records; control accounts
   Personnel: appointment of staff should be adequately controlled; all staff should be suitably
    trained for their post and appraised regularly
   Supervision: all staff and activities should be adequately supervised by someone who
    understands the process and will detect deviations from accepted practice.
