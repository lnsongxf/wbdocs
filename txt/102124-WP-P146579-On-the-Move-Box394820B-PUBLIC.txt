     SIGNIFICANCE OF GOVERNANCE

     The success of any country’s transport system          Governance is therefore increasingly recognized
     does not (and should not) depend primarily on          as critical to the success of transportation
     sector governance, but instead on the competence       authorities. In 2005, a team of experts from the
     and hard work of managers and employees in             University of Toronto reviewed the factors that
     the transport industry who deliver transport           contribute to best practice in urban transport
     infrastructure and services. Nevertheless, sector      and concluded that the most critical requirement
     governance can have a significant influence            is effective governance—even more important
     on how well any country’s transport industry           than finance, infrastructure, and urban land-use
     responds to market demands and national policy         planning.
     goals. Sector governance creates the enabling
     environment for the transport industry: the            In    its   report    on    Transportation    for
     effectiveness of the government bodies with            Development, the World Bank asserts
     which it deals; the market freedoms that it is         “transport performance is not just a matter
     permitted; the regulatory constraints under which      of physical investment. Transport that
     it operates; the confidence with which it can plan     contributes positively to development and
12   long-term business initiatives and investments.        that is safe, clean, and affordable also depends
on sector governance.”5 In the 2000 European
Commission communication on transport,
governance is considered a prerequisite to
sustainable development of the sector.

Irrespective of specific policies, the World Bank
has identified a number of indicators that have
been generally found to be consistent with good
practice in discharging the governance function.6
These are shown in Table 2.1. In theory, principles
of good governance apply universally. In practice,
countries think and act differently. While the
principles of effectiveness and integrity are
equally valid everywhere, accountability practices
often tend to differ. Countries often differ with
respect to the balance between using the public
sector versus the private sector to achieve their
goals. Another area in which differences arise
is in the involvement of communities and end
users in decision-making. Variations in practice
can be explained by the different histories,
culture, and circumstances of each country. These
variations are also affected by different systems
and traditions for decision-making over policy,
planning, and budgeting. These are intimately
tied to the nature of government, the character of
leaders and the political elite, and the main source
of government revenues (taxes, natural resources,
etc.).7 That being said, there is an opportunity to
learn from what occurs internationally. The phrase
“one size doesn’t fit all” should not be interpreted
as encouragement to claim national uniqueness
as justification for ignoring practices that have
proven effective.

     STRUCTURE OF PAPER

     The remainder of the paper describes how
     transport sub-sectors are organized in the five
     case study countries dealing respectively with:
     the peak governance entity, typically a Ministry of
     Transport or equivalent (Section 3) and the central
     functions of regulatory administration; ports
     (Section 4); railways (Section 5); roads (Section 6);
     and public transport (Section 7). It gives particular
     attention to structural, institutional, and financing
     dimensions. The main lessons learned from this
     collective experience are summarized in Section 8.

     Level
Each of the case study countries has a different       material, and World Bank country sources. In
ministry structure at the apex of governance of        some cases the ministries are responsible for

     COMMON THEMES

     There are many differences in the specific             Most countries have a unit or department in the
     ministry entities that form the peak government        ministry that is responsible for freight logistics.
     entities in transport in the five countries, but       In most cases, this is responsible, with other
     also some common patterns as indicated in              stakeholders, for producing a national logistics

     transport containing both multi-modal initiatives      establishing the high-level regulatory policies
     as well as mode-specific components.                   that shape the regulatory function.

     In some cases particular executive functions with
     regard to infrastructure provision, regulation or
     operations are carried out by agencies reporting
     to the ministry, especially in Finland (where there
     is a single comprehensive transport agency) and
     South Africa (which has a series of specialist
     transport agencies).

     In three countries the ministry’s responsibilities
     are organized administratively by mode and in
     two by function, though the distinction is perhaps
     not as great as it seems as those organized by
     mode have functional departments within them,
     and those by function have some mode-specific
     units in their internal organizations.

26   Logistics Performance Index and Its Indicators
Tanger-Med and Busan serve larger vessels than
the other three ports. The lower performance of
Helsinki reflects lower overall cargo volumes and
relatively more land, crane, and berth availability
than is actually required for the current volumes.
Durban also performs lower than world averages
for TEUs per gantry crane and TEUs per hectare,
suggesting slower moves per crane hour or an
excessive number of cranes as well as either
excessive land or lower density storage. Lower
density storage means the cycle time for
movement to storage is also likely to be higher as
the yard equipment has to move farther from the
cranes at the berth.

A more detailed analysis with a larger sample of
ports would be required to draw firm conclusions
about the relationship of port performance to each
country’s port institutional framework. However,
given the countries under study here, generally
those ports that have private sector participation,
competition (e.g. Valparaiso, Tanger-Med, and
Busan), and greater commercial autonomy at arms
length from political influences seem to perform
better than those ports that do not reflect these
characteristics. As earlier noted, a corporatized
state-owned monopoly operator serves South
Africa’s ports, while Finland’s gateway port of
Helsinki is subject to municipal governance. As
shown in Table 4.3, these two ports perform well
below world averages as indicated by the average
scores of the three indicators compared to the
world indicators.

       ORGANIZATION AND MANAGEMENT OF RAILWAY SYSTEMS

     The five case studies provide a wide range of
     management models. Only one and a half (Morocco
     and northern Chile) are still vertically integrated
     in the sense that both infrastructure and train
     operations are undertaken by a single organization.
     However, even in Chile, there is provision in the
     current draft law for third parties to operate on
     payment of access charges. Of the others, two
     (southern Chile and South Africa) still combine
     infrastructure with some train operations—freight
     in the case of South Africa and passenger in
     the case of southern Chile—while third parties
     undertake other train operations. South Korea
     is integrated in the sense that infrastructure
     maintenance and operations are undertaken
     by the same organization responsible for train
     operations, but in this case the infrastructure is
     owned and ultimately managed by a third party,
     which contracts its maintenance and operations
     back to the railway.

     Finally, Finland conforms to the EU model with
     separation of above-rail (passenger and freight)
     activities and infrastructure management. Sweden
     takes this one further and has separated the
     freight and passenger operators in independent
     companies. Germany has many third-party
     passenger and freight operators on its network
     but the dominant operators in both sectors are
     German railways’ (DB) subsidiary companies, and
     these are in a common group structure with DB

Road traffic accidents are a major cause of death,
especially among young adults. In industrialized
countries, only about 15-20 percent of fatalities
involve pedestrians, non-motorized vehicles,
and motorcycles. In developing and transition
countries, the figure is closer to 50 percent and
is as high as 70 percent in Asia. In developing
and transition countries, road accident rates per
10,000 vehicles tend to be 10 to 20 times higher
than in industrialized countries and cost between
1.0-1.5 percent of GNP. A major challenge for all
road agencies in industrialized and developing
countries alike is to build safer and forgiving roads
that contain the scourge of road accident fatalities
and injuries. Fortunately more attention is being
paid to road accidents. Efforts are underway
to mobilize private finance for road safety
interventions and to set up accident reporting
systems to enable road safety interventions to be
planned and implemented more effectively.

     PERFORMANCE OF PUBLIC TRANSPORT

     The metropolitan populations of the principal           percent of work-related trips as compared to only
     cities in case study countries vary substantially,      14 percent in Johannesburg.
     ranging from slightly over 1 million (Helsinki) to
     over 20 million (Seoul). The scale and composition
     of the public transport systems serving these
     cities vary correspondingly. For example, the
     mass transit system30 of metropolitan Seoul is
     393 km in length as compared to only 21 km in
     Helsinki.

     Tables 7.6 and 7.7 show features of public
     transport systems in ascending order of city
     size. Care should be taken in comparing cities as
     statistical methods may differ. The performance
     of these systems varies both in qualitative and
     quantitative terms. For example, the Seoul public

     encompassing passenger and freight operations,            stakeholders, for producing a national logistics

     In the transport sector as a whole the lessons
     of international experience in reorganizing sector
     governance are confirmed as they have been long
     understood, to paraphrase Amos (2006)33:

     •	 Restructuring a complex industry or
        organization is a long-term process. It often
        requires legislative, as well as institutional and
        management changes, and a period of cultural
        adjustment within organizations before
        benefits emerge. Unrealistic timetables that
        do not allow for the time needed for political
        process, for the consensus building needed
        for radical change, and the need to overcome
        organizational inertia are likely to be frustrated.

     •	 Structural change is only a means to an
        end. That end is to improve performance.
        Governments can create the policy platform
        and framework for this improved entity
        performance but only managements and
        their employees can deliver the goods. Close
        attention therefore needs to be given to
        investing in the actual process of business
        change management, attraction of the best
        skills and experience, worker consultation
        and participation, creation of the appropriate
        culture, incentive structures, and so on.

     •	 Even within a particular sector of transport,
        such as a highways agency, or rail or port
        company, one structural model does not fit
        all. The international experience needs to be
        mined, but then shaped to local markets and
        circumstances.

     •	 Public enterprise reform is not a “fire and
        forget” process. Good public custodianship
        requires explicit supervisory and monitoring
        mechanisms. When government enterprises are
        not working well it is often the processes of
        public governance that need scrutiny as much
        as the enterprises themselves.

     •	 Transport markets and technologies are
        continually changing. New transport demands
        and opportunities will emerge with economic
        development and technological progress. The
        objective of transport policy should not be to
        achieve a given end state, but to create an
        industry adaptable and responsive to change.
