Foreword

Feeding the world requires a strong agricultural industry. Cultivating and processing agricultural
commodities—including crops, livestock, timber and more—is critical to society. From farming yields and
quality standards to equipment and processing facilities, agribusiness is a growth opportunity around the
globe, and the private equity industry is playing an important role in building this sector.

Agribusiness touches on many issues. It is vital for food security, job creation and economic growth,
especially in rural communities. It provides fiber, building materials and bioenergy to help meet the world’s
rising energy needs. Large-scale commercial farming and processing—the types of operations that attract
commercial and often international investment—will play an even more important role as the world’s
population continues to grow and more people enter the middle class and move to cities. With a focus on
sustainability, these operations can generate great value to both investors and society, responsibly producing
an array of goods demanded by consumers around the world.

Large-scale agribusiness, though, can also be uniquely exposed to environmental and social challenges,
which must be properly addressed to run a successful business. Due to the size of its footprint, agribusiness
can spark controversy over land acquisition (including conflict over customary land rights), local jobs,
occupational health and safety, and human displacement. Agribusiness may also cause disruption to natural
habitats and the valuable services provided by dynamic and healthy ecosystems. Unintended outcomes that
should concern any investor include social conflicts and work stoppages, degradation of underlying natural
assets, and challenges from key stakeholders. In short, investors may face significant risks when putting
capital to work in this industry.

Good business managers are thoughtfully addressing these issues. Because of their natural resource use,
agribusinesses can benefit from sustainability initiatives that focus on operational efficiencies. These efforts
can lower costs, improve relations with local communities, and protect an ongoing license to operate. At
KKR, we believe that businesses and private equity investors that adopt a sound policy and management
approach to environmental and social matters are better positioned to anticipate and avoid adverse risks and
impacts, and can achieve greater financial and social returns. To help guide the industry on these risks and
opportunities, credible standards have recently been developed, including standards by the authors of this
report, such as the International Finance Corporation’s Performance Standards and Voluntary Agro-
Commodity Standards.

This report has been written for emerging market private equity fund managers. It highlights trends in private
equity investment in emerging markets agribusiness and promotes adopting environmental and social
management systems to generate sustainable financial returns. While the report points out the environmental
and social risks in primary production, it considers how such risks may reverberate through the value chain.
These risks and opportunities are not exclusive to a particular commodity but relevant to all agro-
commodities, including livestock, aquaculture and timber, the last of which is the focus of a case study in this
report.

General Partners (GPs) should find this paper to be particularly relevant, especially those seeking or receiving
investment from Development Finance Institutions. The material should also be helpful to Limited Partners
(LPs), debt investors, commercial banks and others investing in emerging markets agribusiness.

The future of this industry is crucial and our role as responsible investors is increasingly essential. I believe
that this report will help interested parties understand the current landscape and will inform their actions
moving forward. It should be our goal as investors to find opportunities to solve societal challenges, and
create shared and sustainable value in the process.

I.	      Sustainable Agribusiness: A Unique Value Proposition

Global trends such as burgeoning demographics, expansion of the consumer class, urbanization, and
increasing energy and raw material needs have fueled unprecedented demand for agricultural products. The
pull toward greater production is felt keenly in emerging market economies due to their fast-growing
populations, increasing caloric intake, and shifting consumer preferences. As these trends continue and the
global population soars to nearly 10 billion people by 2050, overall food production must increase by 70%,
and production in developing countries will need to nearly double.1

Agribusiness is more than farming; it includes the manufacture and distribution of farm equipment and
supplies, and the processing, storage and distribution of farm commodities. Together, the expectations
placed on modern agribusiness provide a special opportunity for private equity (PE). PE firms can bring stable
and patient growth capital to agribusinesses that may struggle to access finance given the uneven nature of
their cash flows and the general unavailability of bank lending in many markets. PE firms can leverage
industry expertise to help agribusinesses attain scale, strengthen banking relationships, and improve capital
buffers, making more sustainable enterprises. For Limited Partners (LPs) that back PE funds, agribusiness
can offer long-term financial and diversification value.

In addition to its commercial investment aspects, agribusiness plays a critical role in society. In emerging
markets particularly, it drives employment, economic growth and food security. As Stuart Bradley, Senior
Partner with the Sub-Saharan Africa-focused PE firm Phatisa notes, “Growth in agriculture is significantly
more effective at reducing poverty than growth in other sectors.” The majority of the world’s poor are farmers,
and they often live and work adjacent to major population centers with accelerating demand for agro-
commodities. Yet these farmers frequently lack the capital, knowledge, technical inputs and infrastructure to
profit from market trends. Consequently, agribusiness PE holds enormous potential to drive improvements in
human development while representing an attractive commercial opportunity.

Despite both the promise and the imperative of expanding global food production, the growth of agriculture’s
footprint poses significant risks. Agricultural irrigation already accounts for 70% of global water withdrawals.2
Agriculture and forestry together are responsible for much of global deforestation and account for one-third
of global greenhouse gas emissions—more than any other sector.3 In light of its resource requirements and
the constraints on land and water consumption, the race to expand agribusiness can lead to serious local
conflicts and the degradation of resources upon which communities depend. Food security, equity and
access to food for local communities constitute additional risks, especially when agricultural production is
oriented to export markets. Labor practices and working conditions in the sector are frequently criticized, with
increasing scrutiny on the fairness of agricultural value chains and the provision of decent wages and
livelihoods for farm workers. Climate change introduces additional complexity in terms of agribusinesses’
contribution to climate change as well as its exposure and ability to respond to the impacts of severe and
unpredictable weather patterns.

By managing these risks and understanding the value of sustainable agribusiness, investors can realize
significant opportunities across the industry. Sustainable agribusiness may generate value through
efficiencies, cost reductions, market access, a broader customer base and strong relations with local
communities and regulators. A combination of existing environmental and social (E&S) standards—for
example, those of the International Finance Corporation (IFC)—and credible sustainability certification
systems4 help define well-managed agribusiness and the economic benefits to be gained. In the case of
palm oil, for example, the benefits of certification under the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil were found
to include operational improvements, a decrease in social conflicts, reduced labor turnover and enhanced
access to capital.5

While the tangible benefits of sustainable agribusiness will likely interest any investor, the value of positive
social impact should resonate especially with the growing community of institutional, public and private
investors seeking a measurable development impact. This class of “impact investors” has directed US$46
billion of capital to investments across a variety of sectors that are meant to produce financial as well as
positive social returns.6 Additionally, over 1,300 financial institutions have become signatories to the
Principles for Responsible Investment (PRI), of which over 500 are indirectly or directly invested in PE,
including 150 specialized General Partners (GPs). These firms are obliged by PRI to report on how they
integrate environmental, social and governance (ESG) matters into their investment processes. Evidence of
PRI’s effect on the market is found in requests for proposals by LPs, which increasingly ask for information
and supportive evidence of ESG integration, indicating that ESG familiarity is becoming a competitive point in
the asset management industry.

For PE investors to add and preserve value and ultimately realize competitive returns, strong E&S
management is a logical win-win. By addressing sustainability issues in a thoughtful and deliberate
manner, investors can avoid an array of potential business obstacles while building shared value among
critical stakeholders that can influence the financial success of the agribusiness company.

Indeed, in a major field-based study on agricultural investment in emerging markets7—a study with
particular focus on approaches to environmental, social and economic responsibility—a recurring theme
was the value created through active management of E&S concerns. The study surveyed stakeholders
across a range of agricultural investments and found a willingness to embrace agribusiness investments
against a backdrop of fears about the use of natural resources (figure 1).

The actual results of these investments mirrored the hopes and concerns of local communities. Key
benefits included direct and indirect employment; support to outgrowers (local contracted farmers) to
optimize agricultural yield; improved food safety and security; and increased local investments, including
in infrastructure.

Key negative outcomes involved disputes over access to land, especially between investors and those
with informal land use rights, and the consultation process over land acquisition. Additional negative
outcomes included poorly handled resettlement, lack of consultation with and inclusion of local
communities, lack of public disclosure on farmland leasing contracts, including terms and conditions, and
on the environmental and social impacts of the proposed operations. Finally, lack of community grievance
and redress mechanisms and inadequate assessment of environmental impacts, including cumulative
impacts, added to the list of detrimental outcomes.

The intersecting risks and opportunities in agribusiness investing are not unique to one place, business
or commodity. They are relevant in all geographies. They pertain to primary producers and to input
providers, traders and processors, as well as consumer goods companies that deal directly with
inquisitive and demanding consumers. Furthermore, the value of strong E&S management is not limited
to row crops but applies to livestock, aquaculture and forestry sectors. In view of this complex landscape,
this report intends to help PE investors better understand and implement effective E&S management,
beginning with a description of PE trends in emerging markets agribusiness followed by a framework to
address E&S risks and opportunities.

Emerging Market Fundraising and Investment Trends

Geographically, Latin America-focused vehicles raised the most capital between 2008 and 2014—
approximately US$1.9 billion in total—though there has been a discernible shift toward Emerging Asia
and Sub-Saharan Africa-focused funds since 2010, which have accumulated US$2.1 billion and
US$1.3 billion, respectively, over the last seven years (figure 4). With respect to single-country funds,
Brazil-dedicated vehicles have attracted the largest amount of capital by far—nearly US$1.5 billion
compared to US$356 million for China, the second-largest destination.

Mirroring the trend in the emerging markets PE industry as a whole, a pronounced concentration of
capital occurs in the largest fund managers. Since 2008, the ten largest funds account for US$3.8
billion (or 56%) of the total capital raised for agribusiness-dedicated vehicles, with the top 15
closing on nearly 71%. The largest emerging market agribusiness funds raised are targeting
investments in Emerging Asia, Latin America and Sub-Saharan Africa (figure 5).

PE firms invested an average of approximately US$1 billion in agribusiness companies each year from
2008 through 2013. However, the amount of capital invested exploded to nearly US$2.6 billion in 2014,
largely prompted by three deals in Emerging Asia, which accounted for nearly two-thirds of the total.8
Annual agribusiness deal flow over the same period averaged 40 transactions across all emerging
markets, with a general trend toward greater capital deployed over time (figure 6).

the Middle East and North Africa (13), and Central and Eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of
Independent States (16) constituted the remaining 27% of investments. Four middle-income
countries—China, India, Brazil and South Africa—accounted for 55% of deals.

Of the 193 deals for which EMPEA has transaction values, the vast majority have been investments of
less than US$50 million, and this has been consistent until 2014 (figure 7). While it is too soon to
definitively conclude that this launches a new trend of larger deals, a number of multi-billion dollar
generalist funds have been raised for Emerging Asia over the last three years, which could soon drive
deal flow above the US$100 million level.

                              Emerging Asia represents a multitude of countries, yet the vast majority—fully 87%—of deal activity has
                              taken place in China and India (figure 9). This outcome may be due to the relatively advanced stage of
                              development of the PE industries within these countries rather than the state of agribusiness
                              opportunities. Although activity is heavily concentrated in these two countries, PE firms have deployed
                              capital in 16 sub-sectors—the broadest array of agribusiness deals in any emerging market region.

                              Within Emerging Asia, dairy operations have been a popular target for investment, as have assorted
                              protein producers and processors. Crop production, by contrast, has not received as much investment,
                              which—at least in China—may be due in part to evolving government restrictions on foreign investment
                              in agribusiness companies, and—in India—the societal importance of small-holder farmers.

                              Elsewhere in Emerging Asia, the structure of the agricultural industry may be inhibiting capital flows to
                              primary production. As Bill Randall, Managing Partner of Pacific Agri Capital, explains, “In Southeast
                              Asia, outside of Indonesia and Malaysia, agricultural activity is predominantly small-holder driven; this
                              gives the farmer a great degree of importance and an entrenched position in land rights, and so it is
                              practically impossible to achieve scale.” As a result of these hurdles, PE investors appear to be targeting
                              companies at the input, processing, distribution, and retail stages of the value chain.

Spotlight on Sub-Saharan Africa – Diverse by Country and Sector

Unlike Emerging Asia’s concentration of activity in two countries, Sub-Saharan Africa exhibits rich
diversification, with 21 countries receiving investment—from the relatively developed market of South
Africa to more frontier economies such as Burkina Faso and the Democratic Republic of the Congo
(figure 10). Befitting the diversity of investment destinations, the region also exhibits a breadth of activity
by sub-sector.

With its abundance of land, Sub-Saharan Africa has become a popular destination for global investors,
most famously—though by no means exclusively—sovereign wealth funds from the Middle East seeking
the continent’s natural resources to enhance their own countries’ food security; examples include Saudi
Arabian land acquisitions in Sudan and Qatari deals in Kenya.12 In the process, sovereign wealth funds,
along with Chinese state-backed investors and corporate investors from developed markets,13 have
begun building infrastructure that the region’s agricultural industry can leverage for export markets. This
is an important development, as according to Phatisa’s Stuart Bradley, “compared to other emerging
markets, greenfield agricultural investments in Sub-Saharan Africa can be more challenging due to the
lack of infrastructure and weak logistics.”

Though international capital is addressing the lack of infrastructure, some of these non-PE investments
have faced global criticism, with some decrying the deals as “land grabs” that involve a lack of
transparency and a violation of traditional land rights. Indeed, the challenges of large-scale land
acquisition, whether in Sub-Saharan Africa or other emerging markets, illustrate the need for emerging
market agribusiness investors to integrate robust environmental and social risk assessment and
management into their investment strategies.

Given the array of challenges, most PE managers avoid primary production and focus on other stages of
the value chain. Carl Neethling, Chief Investment Officer of Acorn Private Equity, points out, “This is a
sector that requires specialization to add value; we try to focus on the value-add side of the sector and
stay away from primary production. One reason for our focus is that the closer an investor gets to
primary agriculture, the harder it can be to obtain financial information that one can rely upon; moreover,
it is often the case that the farmers we want to back are already successful and do not necessarily need
an additional equity investment.” While Sub-Saharan Africa possesses enormous opportunities in primary
production, the pressure on PE investors to exit investments within a fund life-cycle and the nascence of
both Sub-Saharan African agribusiness firms and the region’s capital markets may inhibit investment in
primary production for the near future.

“One of the big trends in the region has been consolidation. The sector needs a few highly sophisticated
farmers to achieve scale and thus become more attractive to private equity. At the same time, a lot of
international and U.S. investors with large checkbooks are coming to buy huge chunks of land and
business in an attempt to replicate the U.S., institutionalized agriculture model in Africa. Africa is not the
United States—that model just doesn’t work.”
- Carl Neethling, Chief Investment Officer, Acorn Private Equity

“As the investment strategies of European development finance institutions (DFIs) have evolved—along
with their heightened interest in Africa and growing concerns over food security—a gap in the market
has emerged for development equity specialists like Phatisa. The larger private equity managers have
traditionally focused on generalist funds and are less interested in specialist food and agriculture. As a
result, development equity managers have created a niche for themselves by combining commercial
capital with U.S./European development finance institutions (DFIs) and the African development banks,
all of which are focused on industry growth, job creation, entrepreneurship, and improving environmental
and social governance.”
- Stuart Bradley, Senior Partner, Phatisa

“When it comes to forestry, there is a mismatch between what institutional investors are looking for—
which is to own timber—and the optimum way of working in Africa. For example, in North America in the
1980s, pulp and paper companies sold off their forests to pension funds and focused their efforts on
increasing their return on capital for manufacturing assets. As it turns out, the owners of timberland
made more money than the manufacturers over the last three decades, so there is a tendency against
owning the manufacturing component of the value chain. But given the structure of the timberland
markets in Africa it is difficult to generate favorable returns unless you control your value chain; in fact, if
you don’t, your operations can be at risk of being held up through the lack of available or continuous
supply and consistent pricing. So I believe the historically successful model in the North American market
is not as directly applicable when applied to Sub-Saharan Africa and other emerging markets.”

As in Sub-Saharan Africa, Latin American agribusiness investments exhibit diversity by country but
are slightly more concentrated with respect to sector (figure 11).

Of the three regions discussed, Latin America exhibits the greatest concentration of investments in
forestry deals, which could be due to the climatic and soil conditions in South American countries. Based
upon his experience with tree crops in Southeast Asia and South America, Pacific Agri Capital’s Randall
observes, “The tropical belt yields on both a per-hectare and food-caloric basis that can be produced in
Latin America are far greater than anywhere else in the world.” These growing conditions have created
deal flow both in primary production of tree crops and in lumber processing companies.

Similar to other emerging market regions, a key constraint on agribusiness companies in Latin America
is ensuring that their operations are fully capitalized. One distinctive feature of the region’s agribusiness
environment, however, is that unlike India, parts of Southeast Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa, investors in
many Latin America countries can obtain freehold titled land. This makes it easier to pursue primary
production opportunities and can facilitate an agribusiness firm’s ability to achieve scale and vertical
integration.

Environmental and Social Management Systems

For PE funds, no standard blueprint exists for an E&S management system (ESMS), but common
elements of an effective system are widely recognized. Importantly, an ESMS should be built on existing
investment management processes to ease implementation and minimize costs. Key elements of an
ESMS include the following:

•	 E&S policy that defines the performance-based standards and practices that will be applied to 		
	 the fund’s investments;
•	 Procedures for E&S assessment and management that ensure risks are adequately addressed, 	
	 mitigation measures implemented, and opportunities identified and realized;

•	 Monitoring and reporting processes to ensure adequate reporting of E&S performance to 		
	 management and investors and adoption of good practices and continuous performance 		
	 improvements; and

•	 Capacity to manage E&S issues and realize opportunities across all assets and areas of 		
	 operation, including direct suppliers, contractors and outgrowers.

Environmental and Social Policy

An E&S policy should apply to and guide all of the business activities of a fund and its investees. It is
typically a concise statement of the fund’s commitment to integrating E&S considerations across the
investment process, and it is the foundation of a fund’s ESMS. The policy should be approved and
supported by the GP at the highest level of decision making and should define investment standards and
criteria as well as accountabilities for E&S issues. The policy should also list any excluded investment
activities, which may be required by LPs or the fund. A sample exclusion list is provided in Annex 2.




16
The policy should also:

•	 Emphasize that E&S opportunities/value drivers are an important aspect of the fund’s expectations;

•	 Require that E&S considerations are incorporated into the activities of portfolio companies, for 		
	 example, through legal and investment commitments to comply with E&S regulations, international 	
	 performance standards and/or credible certification programs;

•	 Commit to ongoing monitoring and to improving overall E&S performance of the fund’s portfolio 		
	 companies; and
				
•	 Commit to strengthen staff capacity to identify and manage E&S risks over the life of the fund.

The policy should be communicated to all staff, investees and external stakeholders. Its 			
implementation may be considered by some LPs to be part of a fund manager’s fiduciary obligation.


Assessing, Managing and Capitalizing on Environmental & Social Issues

With an E&S policy established, a PE fund should outline the procedures for assessing and mitigating
E&S issues in each of its investments, including capitalizing on the E&S opportunities outlined in table 1.
Ideally, the procedures should build on the fund’s existing investment processes and incorporate E&S
considerations along the way. Where a multi-sector or generalist fund already has an ESMS, the
integration of additional agribusiness-focused components, such as sector-specific due diligence
questions or impact metrics, can simply be added.

The first step in the E&S due diligence process is typically the screening of proposed investments to (a)
determine if the range and significance of E&S issues are consistent with the fund’s E&S policy, and (b)
provisionally categorize the transaction based on potential E&S risks (table 2).

For risk categorization, attention should be given to:

•	 Scale and location of operations, and broader environmental or social trends such as climate 		
	 change or national labor market issues (including minimum wages) that could magnify E&S risks 	
	 and opportunities;

•	 Greenfield versus existing operations, recognizing that greenfield assets may generate more risks21;

•	 Cumulative or induced impacts related to the investment, for example, increased water demand 		
	 within a catchment from similar agribusiness activities; and

•	 Value chain risks or issues, for example, downstream sensitivities to upstream labor practices, safe 	
	 working conditions and biodiversity impacts.

E&S risk categorization may be aided by referencing past categorizations of similar companies and
applicable regulatory codes where they exist. For example, the IFC has a public database of its projects
with a reference on specific issues and due diligence focus for agribusiness investments based on
transaction-specific circumstances.22

Assuming no red flags are raised in relation to the fund’s policy requirements, including any review by the
fund’s investment committee, full E&S due diligence follows. For E&S risks and opportunities, due
diligence is a critical step in charting the path of a successful investment. This report provides
suggestions for conducting due diligence, but experience shows that overly prescriptive and formulaic
approaches, for example, through strict reliance on checklists, are generally not sufficient. Practical,
deal-specific analysis is always required.

Depending on the characteristics of the operation and the experience and capacity of the fund manager,
the fund may undertake E&S due diligence itself, though the use of external experts is recommended for
any complex project. A sample set of questions and issues that may be integrated into a due diligence
exercise are provided in Annex 3.

•	 Project or construction planning and concept documents;
•	 Pollution control plans and capital expenditure commitments;
•	 Stakeholder/community engagement plans;
•	 Contracts/agreements with buyers and investors and any E&S requirements therein; and
•	 Commitments and staffing to manage E&S risks and deliver on E&S opportunities.

In addition to the compliance and planning-related matters of an agribusiness investment—whether a
farm, processing plant or other business investment—the scope of due diligence may need to extend
beyond the property line. Such circumstances might include: 1) facilities associated with a primary
production operation, such as seed operations, plant-stock nurseries or slaughterhouses owned or
operated by the company or where such facilities have been developed by third parties solely to service the
needs of the farming operation; 2) supply chains where labor or biodiversity risks are present; even where
these risks cannot be directly addressed by the target company, for example, because of lack of
commercial influence, the company should be aware of the issues and working to mitigate the risk over
time; and 3) cumulative impacts, for example, to water supplies within a single catchment from multiple
large-scale agricultural operations.

In cases of high- and medium-risk investments, fund managers should commission E&S due diligence,
specifically Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs), if not already required by national
regulations. Such assessments are typically followed by the development of an Environmental and Social
Management Plan (ESMP). In cases of large-scale primary production, Resettlement Action Plans (in the
case of physical displacement) and/or Sustainable Livelihoods Plans (in the case of economic
displacement) may also be warranted. A description of ESIAs and ESMPs is provided in Annex 4. Good
practice includes the use of external experts in the case of high risk transactions. For investments involving
significant risks, consultation and engagement with local communities and other stakeholders, such as civil
society organizations, should be established. A variety of international good practice materials and
guidance on E&S due diligence may apply at this stage. A partial list is provided in Annex 5.

Following due diligence, the fund manager should engage the target company to discuss the findings and
gauge the commitment and capacity of the company to address deficiencies and act upon opportunities.
These requirements can then be mapped out either in an Environmental and Social Action Plan (ESAP) or
through other approaches (e.g., 100-day plan). Good practice includes the use of agreed-upon ESAPs in
formal legal documentation. At a minimum the fund manager should obtain confirmation from the investee
company that it plans to address any adverse E&S impacts within a reasonable time. Good practice also
includes the use of appropriate remedies in the Investment or Share Purchase Agreement, side letters or
other legal documents in the event that the portfolio company fails to implement the actions within the
agreed-upon timeframe. These measures ensure that the fund’s requirements are understood, interests
and expectations are aligned, and investee capacity and commitments are demonstrated with supporting
evidence.

Monitoring and Reporting

Beyond typical financial and operational monitoring employed by fund managers, active oversight of E&S
matters is strongly recommended, especially because E&S risks and opportunities may shift significantly
over the life of an investment. Monitoring and reporting should: (1) allow fund management to
understand whether investees are effectively addressing E&S issues; (2) check the overall effectiveness
of the company’s ESMS; and (3) inform LPs and others interested in the E&S impact. Additional
suggestions for monitoring and reporting procedures are provided in Annex 6.

Monitoring and reporting should cover both the risks and opportunities of the investment. On the risk
side of primary production and downstream businesses, particular attention should be paid to labor and
employment practices as well as to changes in natural resource use, such as demand for water or the
availability and use of land in the catchment, since cumulative impacts on natural resources may affect
operations and create reputational risks to the company. If an ESAP or similar requirements were
prescribed during due diligence, the monitoring and reporting process gauges progress.

On the opportunity side, monitoring and reporting tracks E&S performance through impact metrics, also
referred to as development outcomes indicators by some DFIs. Appropriate metrics will vary depending on
commodity, type of investment, location in the value chain and other factors, but some suggestions are
provided in table 3. An emerging good practice in the industry is reporting and disclosure of the E&S
performance of a fund and its investments to external stakeholders, and impact metrics are a key aspect,
especially for GPs seeking to capitalize on impact investing trends.

Capacity to Manage Environmental & Social Issues

Given the unique and often complex nature of E&S issues in the agribusiness sector, a fund may need to
consider specific capacity-building measures to meet its policy commitments. These costs will need to
be calculated and included in the fund’s operational budget. Most fund managers recognize the value of
in-house capacity supplemented by outsourced technical E&S skills as needed. Some funds—generally
those that target higher-risk primary production investments—have developed in-house teams with
significant technical E&S capabilities. Extending E&S capacity building to portfolio companies may bring
additional value and be part of a GP’s efforts to transfer expertise and foster operational improvements.

An important aspect of capacity building is to create broad E&S awareness and understanding within the
fund’s investment staff and committee members, as well as portfolio companies. Raising awareness and
training should cover key E&S issues that are significant to the sector, including:
•	 Defining the scope of E&S due diligence, including supply chain aspects;
•	 The need for an effective consultation process, including a stakeholder engagement plan (especially 	
	 where land acquisition is part of the investment) and a community grievance mechanism;
•	 An assessment of labor and working condition practices and issues, including in supply chains;
•	 Opportunities for value creation through better resource efficiency, improved labor practices and 	
	 working conditions, etc; and
•	 Biodiversity and ecosystem service impacts.

As the fund matures, the training curriculum can integrate real-world experiences and situations
encountered by portfolio companies, lessons learned, trends in the sector and new approaches.

Lastly, a GP should consider appointing an individual within the fund who has specific responsibilities to
oversee (but not necessarily deliver) E&S compliance, since this improves consistency and efficiency of
E&S management as well as quality control efforts applied to third parties. Also, funds should consider
establishing Investment Committee accountability—either an individual Committee member or collective
accountability—for decisions that have E&S implications.

Leveraging Development Finance Institutions and Outside Experts

For funds with DFI investors, opportunities may exist to leverage capacity-building programs and
technical assistance; for example, CDC, IFC and other DFIs provide regular courses and mentoring on
E&S issues, and CDC has an online toolkit for PE funds. A range of commercial courses are also
available on labor, health and safety, and supply chain management in agribusiness. Online programs are
available, such as those offered by the United Nations Environment Program Finance Initiative, IFC
(“FIRST for Sustainability” ) and FMO. Lastly, the PRI Secretariat has working groups that provide
insights into the agribusiness sector from the perspective of responsible investment.

When using external experts to augment internal capacity, the expert’s track record should receive
heightened attention since E&S issues in agribusiness are often complex and require specific skills. This
is especially important when the completion of an ESIA, ESMP and/or Resettlement Action Plan is
contracted to a third party services provider. The provider must be qualified to perform the work, meeting
any national legal and regulatory requirements for business registration and professional certifications,
the fund’s own performance-based policy commitments, and requirements of international markets and
investors/lenders. Professional service providers should have depth of experience, reputation, familiarity
with E&S risks in the context of financial transactions, and the ability to meet international standards for
ESIAs and ESMPs. A fund manager should also consider the consultant’s familiarity with the operation
of PE funds and experience providing high-quality E&S due diligence materials to guide and inform an
investment committee.

Industry technical specialists—for example, those focused on food safety, labor and supply chains,
energy, hydrology or technology-related due diligence—may offer better skills and insights than
generalist E&S consultancies.



                                                                                                          21
The use of third-party expertise is highly recommended in the following situations:
•	   Where people’s livelihoods will be affected through the acquisition of land (i.e., through involuntary 	
	    resettlement or economic displacement) even if they have no formal title or ownership rights to that 	
	    land. These requirements apply in situations where the land is farmed or used intermittently (i.e., 	
	    pastoralists, nomadic use).
	
•	   Where acquiring and/or developing land in areas with a water deficit, where the company’s 		
	    operations will require significant water supply, or where there is a high level of cumulative demand 	
	    on water resources within the catchment.
•	   Where conversion of natural habitats or proximity to protected areas, critical or high conservation 	
	    value habitats is evident, and where development may affect the area’s ecosystem services.
	
•	   Where there are many agricultural workers (including migrant or temporary labor) or in commodities/	
	    geographies with a documented record of poor labor practices, including harmful child or forced 	
	    labor in production or supply chains.
•	 Where there are opportunities for resource efficiencies (energy and water use in particular) that 		
	 could generate savings (i.e., especially for activities that have high energy or water demands in 		
	 production or processing).
•	 Where production from third-party suppliers purchased by off-takers requires traceability and 		
	 certification of management practices against voluntary agro-commodities standards.
•	 Where those affected by land acquisition or use may be formally recognized indigenous peoples or 	
	 other vulnerable groups.



Additional Considerations

Certification

Credible certification systems may factor significantly in ESMS design and performance-based
requirements. Certification may improve operational performance and profitability and align interests
across the value chain. In sectors such as forestry and palm oil, the Forestry Stewardship Council (FSC)
and Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil (RSPO) certifications, respectively, are increasingly important to
accessing a broader range of markets and finance, and they may factor favorably in PE exits such as
initial public offerings and acquisitions. Many certifications and standards, for example, Bonsucro (sugar)
and Better Cotton Initiative, are supported by global corporate buyers such as Coca-Cola and IKEA with
special procurement commitments.

Certifications also factor prominently in commitments to sustainable agribusiness by large global banks.
For example, in 2014 a group of banks adopted a “Soft Commodities Compact”,24 in effect pledging to
help their clients in the consumer goods sector reduce deforestation. The pledge hinges on certification
systems for key commodities, such as palm oil, soy, beef and timber.

In some cases where credible mainstream certifications have not yet matured, positive E&S outcomes
may be achieved through continuous improvement schemes, such as country-level Beef Sustainability
Roundtables or the Global Forest & Trade Network for forestry. Buyer commitments and/or verification
processes have arisen around some of these schemes.

Independent verification of compliance with credible standards is increasingly recognized as a proxy for
good E&S performance and may cover legal compliance, community engagement, sustainable sourcing
and so on. The use of certification systems may offset a GP’s E&S monitoring and management costs
while representing evidence of good industry practice to buyers, lenders and others. Databases such as
the International Trade Centre’s Standards Map outline and compare the growing body of certification
standards in the market; additionally, the ISEAL Alliance is an umbrella organization that accredits
agribusiness standards based on their operational performance.25




22
Insurance

Insurance instruments may complement E&S and other risk management frameworks used by PE
investors to de-risk individual transactions and portfolio level aggregation. Insurance can address some
of the factors that inhibit PE flows into agricultural production, such as weather and disease risks, land
title and ownership complications, and post-harvest loss in warehousing and storage.

Basic financial products are readily available in emerging markets for viable financial stop-loss mechanisms
and smooth earnings volatility from operational issues, while enforcing greater discipline in risk screening
and allocation in investees. Insurance can respond to a range of PE investor concerns, with relevant
products including political risk guarantees on portfolios (e.g., expropriation of assets or restriction on
currency transfers); natural disaster cover at the portfolio company level (e.g., flood or fire loss to
plantations, or business interruption at processing sites); operational liability at the fund manager and
portfolio company level; and environmental or tax representations and warranty issues in investment exits.

For large-scale operations, sound E&S systems are essential for cost effective insurance programs. PE
portfolios allow insurers to pool and diversify their agri-insurance business. Furthermore, with alignment
of commercial objectives, insurers and fund managers may develop financial instruments to address risks
inherent in agribusiness investment.




                                                                                                             23
IV.      Conclusion and Recommendations

In the years ahead, private equity may be expected to play an ever greater role in financing the imminent
global expansion of agribusiness. Preliminary findings from EMPEA’s 2015 Global Limited Partners
Survey suggest that LPs want to build their exposure to agribusiness strategies in emerging markets over
the next two years. Though PE fundraising shifted in recent years from Latin America to Emerging Asia,
EMPEA’s survey shows that all emerging market regions are in focus for LPs, with a majority seeking
greater exposure in nearly every market. Africa and the Middle East may be poised for the most growth.
Furthermore, the amount of capital invested in recent years has climbed, including large deals that may
signify a trend toward bigger investments.

With its long-term focus on building value, PE firms can bring stable capital and industry expertise to solve
agribusiness challenges, such as uneven cash flow and the need for scale. For the sake of food security,
ecological conservation and other critical societal goals, the growth of agribusiness needs a sustainable
path. PE fund managers can help chart that path while enhancing and protecting the economic interests
of their funds and investors.

To help PE fund managers optimize their approach to E&S risks and opportunities, the following
recommendations are provided:

• E&S matters are increasingly important across all sectors, but they are now core interests for
  agribusiness investing and value creation, particularly in emerging markets. Agribusiness hinges on
  natural assets and ongoing positive relations with laborers, community members and other
  stakeholders, who may rely on the same natural assets that underpin the profitability of the company.
  Proactive E&S management can spell the difference between success and failure and should be
  implemented throughout the investment process.

• A well-designed and executed ESMS typically includes an E&S policy, assessment and management
  procedures, monitoring and reporting procedures, and development of internal capacity. Portfolio
  companies need to stay closely engaged throughout the investment process on the E&S objectives
  and plans.

•	    Fund managers should gain confirmation from portfolio companies that they plan to address adverse 	
	     E&S impacts within reasonable timeframes. Good practice includes the use of appropriate remedies in 	
	     the Investment or Share Purchase Agreement, side letters, or other legal documents in the event that 	
	     the portfolio company does not follow through. Good practice also includes reporting and disclosure of 	
	     the E&S performance of portfolio companies and the fund to external stakeholders.

•	 Since every business is unique and circumstances on the ground vary, formulaic approaches and 		
	 checklists for E&S due diligence are generally not sufficient. Guidelines on E&S due diligence may 	
	 help to understand risks and opportunities but can only complement deal-specific analysis.

•	    When considering the level of E&S impacts, particular attention should be given to: the scale and 		
	     location of operations; greenfield versus existing operations; direct, cumulative or induced impacts 	
	     related to the investment; and risks that may reverberate through the value chain, such as poor labor 	
	     practices or biodiversity impacts.

•	    In cases where the E&S risk is substantial, fund managers should engage with communities early and 	
	     commission E&S due diligence to take advantage of the expertise provided by qualified third-party 	
	     experts. This is especially true in cases involving land acquisition that might cause involuntary 		
	     resettlement or economic displacement. Other high-risk circumstances include developing land in 		
	     areas with a water deficit or where there is a high level of cumulative demand on water resources 		
	     within the catchment, and conversion of natural habitats in proximity to protected conservation areas 	
	     and/or encroachment on indigenous lands. Stakeholder Engagement Plans are critically important, 	
	     and grievance mechanisms are a vital tool for fund managers and portfolio companies to resolve 		
	     concerns from local communities.

•	 Active monitoring and oversight of E&S matters through performance indicators, including impact 		
	 metrics, is highly recommended, especially because E&S risks and opportunities can shift significantly 	
	 over the life of a PE investment.

•	 Limited Partners can help protect the value of their investments by inquiring about the ESMS in use by 	
	 GPs and prompting and examining E&S performance reporting.

Case Study: Identifying Opportunities to Create Value through an Environmental and Social
Management System: Vital Capital and Aldeia Nova

Vital Capital manages a US$350 million private equity fund making large-scale, “no-trade-off” impact
investments, with the twin goals of improving quality of life and delivering risk-adjusted, market-rate
financial returns.

In addition to using existing sustainability and health and safety guidance, such as that provided by IFC,
Vital Capital has developed its own approach to implementing measurable social impact across its
portfolio, including in agribusiness. Value creation is intrinsic to this approach: investment opportunities
are screened and underwritten to maximize positive social returns, not only to mitigate negative
externalities. This enables Vital Capital to develop and implement solutions that create tangible impact
results for the communities in which it invests.

Vital Capital has developed a proprietary, four-dimensional assessment tool called the
Vital Impact Diamond, which evaluates prospective investments across four value creation themes:

Vital Capital’s Environmental and Social Management System in Action: Aldeia Nova, Angola

Over seven million Angolans, or 40% of the population, are undernourished. One reason is that many
agricultural products—eggs in particular—come from a limited supply of local producers, supplemented
by low-quality imports.

Aldeia Nova, one of Vital Capital’s portfolio companies, fuses agricultural production with a wide range of
support services for smallholder farmers. This includes productivity and process improvement services,
access to modern production methods, materials and equipment, social development services, and the
operation of a large-scale agro-industrial center.

The Aldeia Nova agro-industrial center assists over 700 smallholder farming families by providing support
for increased productivity. This includes, but is not limited to, animal feed, mechanical equipment,
processing, packaging, marketing, productivity services, training and infrastructure. The center also
provides 100% off-take for the resulting production, which is sold downstream, as a branded “Aldeia
Nova - Made in Angola” product. Farmers are offered credit and are under contract with the company,
thereby enjoying lower risk and more stable incomes.

The company employs over 350 local employees, who represent more than 96% of its total staff. It
gives over 5,000 annual hours of training to employees, and training to local farmers, establishing strong
local know-how, professional capabilities, and commercial and financial literacy, while building a
foundation for long-term success and stability. Aldeia Nova scores highly on the four dimensions of the
Vital Impact Diamond and received a top-tier rating on its business model from GIIRS.

Case Study: Kilombero Valley Teak Company: An Environmental and Social Management
System in Action in Sub-Saharan Africa

Nestled among 14 villages and between the lush environs of Udzungwa National Park and the Selous
Game Reserve (Africa’s largest) in central Tanzania lies Kilombero Valley Teak Company (KVTC), a teak
plantation and wood processing company. Established in 1992 by CDC Group plc, the United Kingdom’s
development finance institution, KVTC began with the planting of 100 hectares of teak trees. Today,
under the majority ownership of Global Environment Fund (GEF)—a global alternative asset manager
focused on energy, environment and natural resources26 —KVTC oversees 8,162 hectares of teak
plantations amidst 28,000 hectares of forested land.27

Managed by a strong team of Tanzanians and expatriates, KVTC also operates a sawmill and wood
processing plant that produces a variety of timber and value-added products—including panels, floorings
and decking products—for local and export markets.


Identifying Environmental and Social Issues During Due Diligence

GEF relies upon a robust ESMS to detect social and environmental risks in its prospective portfolio
companies, and install the management tools to mitigate these risks. During its due diligence process for
KVTC, GEF recognized increasing pressure on the plantation assets from a combination of land use and
population issues, and identified several priority areas where KVTC’s management systems needed
strengthening. Following its investment, GEF introduced tools to implement the recommended changes.
A further priority was the health and safety of KVTC’s industrial and forestry workers, whose
performance did not meet international good practices. GEF proposed that KVTC adopt the
Occupational Health & Safety Advisory Services (OHSAS) 18001 health and safety system; the
resulting improvements in health and safety performance have been demonstrated through annual
independent audits.

For all of its forestry investments, the primary international guidelines that GEF relies on to manage
environmental and social risks is the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC) standards. For historical reasons,
KVTC is ineligible for this certification. However, as part of its shareholder agreement, GEF asked
KVTC’s management team to follow the standards anyway, and demonstrate compliance annually
through an independent third-party audit. The FSC audits provide a detailed framework for managing the
company’s environmental and social impacts, and gives comfort to GEF and its LPs that the company is
meeting international ESG standards.

A unique feature of agribusiness investments—particularly those engaged in primary production—is that
companies often operate on land that may provide sustenance to wildlife and local communities, which
can create conflicts and operational challenges. As Peter Tynan, Managing Director for Sustainability at
GEF, affirms, “In agriculture and forestry, a framework for addressing E&S issues is absolutely critical to
the core operations and value creation within your investment; you can’t even work in this business
without one.”

Through its due diligence process, GEF recognized that KVTC’s commitment to conservation must be
maintained. Moreover, relations with surrounding communities were not as strong as they could be,
potentially threatening the company’s “license to operate” and even exposing the company to increased
operational risks by disaffected local communities. Therefore conservation and enhanced stakeholder
engagement became two additional areas of focus for GEF’s E&S activities.

Conservation and Protection of Wildlife

Deforestation is a challenge across Sub-Saharan Africa as up to 90% of the wood harvested on the
continent is used as fuel for basic energy needs. KVTC dedicates 30% of its landholding for commercial
teak plantations, which in turn funds the conservation of the remaining 70% of the land. The company’s
efforts have paid off: since 1991 there has been less than 3% diminution of forest cover within the
landholding boundaries. Contrast this with land immediately adjacent to KVTC’s boundaries, where
satellite analysis reveals land clearing for agriculture and grazing has depleted forest cover by more than
30%. The company is now partnering with international development organizations to educate and
involve local communities in the management and conservation of KVTC’s miombo forests.

KVTC also works with communities to protect wildlife. Due to land degradation and the encroachment of
farmers and herders on animal habitats, KVTC’s land offers one of the few remaining passageways for
wildlife—including buffalo, elephant, lion and zebra—moving between the Selous Game Reserve and the
Udzungwa Mountains. KVTC’s activities help create a protected ecosystem in which wildlife can thrive.
The company trained and works with local Village Game Scouts to monitor and record encroachment of
the plantation’s boundaries to conserve woodlands and reduce poaching.

Stakeholder Engagement

To enhance community relations, GEF engaged a consultant to conduct innovative surveys of
surrounding villagers. As GEF’s Tynan notes, “We took the ‘Net Promoter Score’ methodology from the
business world and applied it to the social world, seeking to understand villagers’ perceptions—and the
drivers of their perceptions—toward KVTC.”

This exercise led GEF to reconfigure KVTC’s approach to stakeholder engagement to improve the
company’s “license to operate.” KVTC has strengthened its communication with surrounding
communities, and with workers and contractors. The company better understands and addresses areas
of concern for stakeholders, and educates stakeholders about the company’s activities and role in the
community. For example, KVTC now sponsors a weekly local radio program about environmental and
forestry topics— a more effective communication channel than the village council meetings that were
solely relied on before—and holds regular meetings with workers, contractors and village members.

In addition, KVTC focuses community development efforts where there is a clear strategic link with the
activities of the company. For example, the firm started an Outgrower Support Program, whereby local
farmers can convert portions of their existing farmland to teak forestry. KVTC provides inputs, technical
support and purchase guarantees for these local farmers, contributing to their livelihoods. At the same
time, KVTC has partnered with the U.S. Agency for International Development on a project to improve
farmers’ agricultural productivity. The results have been impressive: participants have increased rice
yields by 2 to 4 times, offsetting the yield loss from allocating land to teak production.

Annex 4: Overview of Environmental and Social Impact Assessments
and Management/Action Plans


Environmental & Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs)

The main purpose of an ESIA is to identify the range, magnitude and likelihood of adverse E&S impacts from
a company’s operations. It is typically focused on risk but may readily include opportunities in its scope. An
ESIA is advisable (and may be contractually or legally required by LPs) for target investments categorized as
high risk. ESIA’s may be advisable for medium risk projects as well. ESIA’s are often associated with new
construction, or “greenfield” projects, but they may apply to any and all stages of a business operation,
including planning and design, construction, decommissioning, closure and post-closure.

ESIAs for some types of operations may be required by a government regulator, in which case ESIA’s
should conform to the requirements of the host country’s laws and regulations, including relevant
disclosure of information and public consultation requirements. It should also comply with the
performance-based requirements that a fund employs, e.g., IFC Performance Standards, as well as
relevant certification systems.

ESIAs generally cover the following seven elements:
1.	 Description of the operations, whether existing or proposed, including physical characteristics, 		
	   land-use requirements, production processes, etc.; also, any related facilities that may be required, 	
	   e.g., dedicated access roads or water supply.
2.	 Baseline description of the natural environment and communities likely to be significantly affected.
3.	 Identification, prediction, and analysis of the likely significant impacts on the environment and 		
	   communities resulting from the operations or project.
4.	 In cases that involve new greenfield projects, an outline of the main alternatives and an indication of 	
	   the reasons for its choice, taking into account the E&S effects.
5.	 Description of measures envisaged to avoid, mitigate and manage significant impacts.
6.	 Description of the assessment process itself and any significant uncertainties about the company’s 	
	   operations and their E&S effects, including the extent and quality of available data, key data gaps, 	
	   uncertainties associated with predictions, and technical deficiencies in the operations.
7.	 A non-technical summary of the above information that is concise and comprehensible to the public.

The geographic/physical scope of an ESIA should cover the area likely to be affected by activities and
facilities that are directly owned or operated by the company (or its contractors) and are a component of the
business operations as well as facilities that are not part of the business operations but would not have been
constructed or expanded if the operations did not exist and without which the operations would not be
viable. It should also cover unplanned but predictable developments caused by the operations that may
occur later or at a different location as well as cumulative impacts from other existing or planned operations.
In the case of agribusiness, for example, a large-scale primary production operation will likely spur
infrastructure investments, which in turn may attract more primary production and processing facilities.

The ESIA process should initiate consultation with stakeholders, especially communities that are directly
affected by the operations/project. Effective consultation is two-way and should begin early in the
process of identifying environmental and social risks and impacts and continue on an ongoing basis
under an ESMP as risks and impacts arise.

ESIAs employ a mitigation hierarchy with respect to adverse E&S impacts. An ESIA identifies and
describes a set of measures to be taken to avoid, minimize or compensate/offset for risks and adverse
E&S impacts, in order of priority and with timelines. The mitigation hierarchy will favor the avoidance of
impacts over minimization, and, where residual impacts remain, compensation/offset, where technically
and financially feasible.

For operations with potential significant adverse social impacts, e.g., involuntary resettlement, an ESIA
will identify individuals and groups that may be directly and differentially or disproportionately affected by
the operations because of their disadvantaged or vulnerable status. Where individuals or groups are
identified as disadvantaged or vulnerable, the ESIA will propose measures so that adverse impacts do
not fall disproportionately on them and they are not disadvantaged in sharing the development benefits
and opportunities. This may be a critical factor in agribusiness operations in emerging markets.

Annex 4: Overview of Environmental and Social Impact Assessments
and Management/Action Plans (Continued)


Environmental & Social Management Plans (ESMPs)

An ESMP typically follows an ESIA where both are required by national regulations or contractual
agreements, for example, with lenders or off-takers. The purpose of an ESMP is to ensure and guide
follow-through on measures to avoid and minimize adverse E&S impacts. In cases where an ESIA has
been completed, the ESMP should reflect the ESIA’s findings and recommendations. In addition to
describing the measures to avoid, mitigate and manage the impacts, the ESMP may include
performance indicators, targets and/or criteria that can be tracked over defined time periods, with
estimates of the resources and responsibilities for implementation, including staff training. Recognizing
the dynamic nature of business operations and projects, the ESMP should be responsive to changes in
circumstances, unforeseen events and the results of monitoring and reporting.

The terms “ESMP” and “ESAP” (environmental and social action plan) are sometimes used
interchangeably and may cause confusion. They are similar in that both serve to lay out specific, time-
bound actions to address E&S impacts that were previously identified in an assessment or audit. The
difference is that the term ESMP is typically associated with regulatory/legal requirements, whereas
ESAP is a term typically used by DFIs when working with a GP or portfolio company on meeting the
DFI’s E&S performance standards. The two are not mutually exclusive. A portfolio company may have
completed an ESMP as required by law, and a DFI may subsequently require an ESAP to close any gaps
with its standards.

Funds should review the implementation of ESMPs at least once annually. Monitoring may be done on a
more frequent basis depending on risks, impacts and compliance requirements. The results of
monitoring should be properly recorded by the fund. If monitoring reveals deficiencies in the
implementation of an ESMP, the fund should identify time-bound corrective measures and communicate
these to the portfolio company.

During the course of monitoring, an adjustment to the risk categorization may be appropriate based on
changes in operations or circumstances.

Consultation, Participation and Disclosure of Information

Consultation with stakeholders, including local communities and any vulnerable groups that may be
affected, should start during ESIA preparation and stakeholder analysis. In the case of high impact
clients, the affected communities should be given the opportunity to participate in key stages of design
and implementation. Therefore, stakeholders should be consulted to obtain their input to the preparation
of the draft Terms of Reference of the ESIA, the draft ESIA report and summary, and the draft ESMP.

An ESMP should include a credible grievance and redress mechanism to address concerns regarding
the E&S performance of the company. The grievance mechanism needs to be sufficiently independent,
empowered and accessible to the stakeholders at all times during the business operations/project cycle,
and all responses to grievances should be recorded and included in E&S reporting to the fund.

In the interests of transparency and disclosure, key documents such as ESIAs should be made public at
relevant stages of their development. Disclosure should start early in the impact assessment process and
conform to national or local regulations and international standards.The portfolio company should provide
periodic reports to affected communities that describe progress with implementation of the ESMP on
issues that involve ongoing risk to or impacts on affected communities and on issues that the
consultation process or grievance mechanism have identified as a concern to those communities.

Annex 6: Monitoring and Reporting of Environmental and Social Information: Suggested Procedures

Post-investment monitoring should ensure that conditions of investment approval are met and continue
to be achieved over the term of the investment. Over and above monitoring, another objective is to
engage portfolio companies, advise on (and learn about) E&S good practices, and strengthen awareness
of the fund’s E&S requirements.

Monitoring is also a useful opportunity to check on development outcomes indicators, or impact investing
metrics, so the fund can assess the positive environmental and social impacts of the investment activity.

Monitoring of a given portfolio company will vary depending on the E&S issues identified during the due
diligence phase, risk categorization, any measures recorded in an ESMP, and changes in circumstances
that may result in increased risk/impact over the course of the investment. Monitoring may include a
combination of conducting a site assessment and periodic E&S compliance reports by the company.
Qualified third-party consultants may be used to perform monitoring.

ESIAs and ESMPs are key references. Copies of all ESIA and ESMP documents should be retained by
the fund, in part because LPs may require access to them.


Sample list of items for post-investment periodic monitoring

1.	   Risk categorization at the time that investment occurred and has the risk categorization
	     ever been modified?
2.	   Since the last time the portfolio company was monitored, have any significant changes occurred in 	
	     staffing and responsibilities on environmental and social matters?
3.	   Since the last time the portfolio company was monitored, have any of the following occurred in 	
	     relation to environmental and social matters:
	     a.	 Regulatory non-compliance
	     b.	 Fines or subpoenas
	     c.	    Loss of a permit
	     d.	 Pollution events, spills, accidents, and/or emergencies
	     e.	 Grievances against the company
	     f.	    Changes in operational or regulatory circumstances
4.	   During the period, did the company commission or complete an ESIA, ESMP, Resettlement Action 	
	     plan, climate change vulnerability assessment, and/or any related study?
5.	   Based on any existing ESIA, ESMP and/or related study/plan, describe all significant actions and 	
	     progress achieved during the period:
6.	   Were any significant challenges or difficulties experienced during the period? Any serious incident reporting?
7.	   Are any corrective actions required?
8.	   Have any public consultations and/or disclosure actions occurred during this period?
9.	   Is an adjustment to the risk categorization required?
10.	 Were any changes made by management to relevant policies or procedures?
11.	 Has the portfolio company produced any environmental or social performance reports?
12.	 What types of technical assistance from the fund would be most useful to support environmental 	
	    and social performance by the portfolio company?
Where conformance with the requirements of the fund, regulators and/or certification programs cannot
be demonstrated, a Corrective Action Plan may be necessary. A target completion date for each
specified action in the plan should be agreed upon.

Annex 6: Monitoring and Reporting of Environmental and Social Information: Suggested Procedures
(Continued)


Reporting to Investors in the Fund and Public Engagement

Subject to confidentiality limitations, GPs should disclose documents on environmental and social
matters unless there are compelling reasons not to do so. Any ESIAs, ESMPs and Resettlement Action
Plans developed in the course of the fund’s activities should be disclosed to the public.
With respect to E&S performance, the fund may want to prepare an Annual Report for investors and the
public that covers some of the following items:
1.	   Investment activity, including E&S due diligence completed, new investments, risk categorizations, 	
	     and closed investments.
2.	   Development outcome indicator data, or impact investing metrics.
3.	   Results of any public consultation processes completed by a portfolio company in connection with 	
	     its operations.
4.	   Mitigation of significant impacts identified for high and medium risk investments.
5.	   Monitoring results for portfolio companies and any remedial action plans required.
6.	   Any changes in risk categorizations.
7.	   Any grievances and/or legal actions against portfolio companies and related to environmental and 	
	     social issues, including responses/actions by the fund; and
8.	   Any changes in the ESMS, unexpected results (positive or negative), performance of the ESMS 	
	     itself, lessons learned, and/or general management views on environmental and social performance.
