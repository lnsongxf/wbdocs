Introduction
Sub-Saharan Africa (henceforth referred to as “Africa” for simplicity) has been on a two-
decades-long growth spurt and, despite the recent slowdown, the continent remains the third
fastest-growing region in the world, with GDP growth averaging 4.6 percent in 2014. Africa’s
commodities-driven growth has interestingly been underpinned by improved macroeconomic and
ﬁscal stability, with inﬂation stabilized below 10 percent in most countries, lower debt, and sig-
niﬁcantly lower ﬁscal and external balances. Africa’s brightest prospects have led to a renewed
interest from investors, most of whom have been awakened to the continent’s huge infrastructure
deﬁcit. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) have also joined the bandwagon.
   SWFs are government-owned investment funds set up for a variety of macroeconomic pur-
poses. Generally speaking, there are three types of SWFs: stabilization funds, savings funds,
and pension or reserve investment funds. These funds invest in natural resources as well as
in infrastructure projects. While much has been said about SWFs as political investments or
as stabilization mechanisms to manage growing natural resource rents, their role as a source
of long-term ﬁnance for development, especially in Africa, has not been fully explored. In-
deed, if SWFs could invest only 1 percent of their assets in Africa, this would amount to about
$420 billion over the period 2010-2020, which would broadly correspond to the missing half
of required investments in infrastructure needed to meet the Millennium Development Goals
(MDGs) (Zoellick, 2010). SWFs’ contribution to long-term ﬁnance is critical, as traditional
foreign direct investments (FDI) cannot play this role.
   In this paper, we theoretically and empirically analyze SWF investments in Africa. Since
SWF activities remain minimal in Africa, the question is what would it take for SWFs to
contribute more to long-term ﬁnancing of development in Africa? In terms of the literature,
Triki and Faye (2011) count at least 15 SWFs, and analyze how African economies can beneﬁt
from SWFs and use them as a channel to tap into international ﬁnancial markets. They use data
taken from diﬀerent sources (Sovereign brands survey, JPMorgan) to discuss the landscape of
African SWFs, as well as SWF interventions on the continent, and ﬁnd that African Funds are
small, suﬀer from poor governance structures, and mainly focus on stabilizing local economies.
However, this paper does not analyze the determinants of SWF investments, nor the empirical
relationship between SWF investments, economic growth and ﬁnancial development. Turkisch
(2011) analyzes the opportunities and barriers for SWF investments in Africa, and suggests that
the introduction of SWFs in African economies facilitates up to 50 percent of the investment
needed for infrastructure. However, this paper also identiﬁes the main barriers for SWFs in
Africa, which include macroeconomic risks and high volatility of returns, the lack of technological
knowledge, and the size and liquidity of African economies. Moreover, the latter study did not
use a theoretical model or empirical estimates to obtain these ﬁndings. This lack of studies
motivated us to explore the landscape and determinants of SWF investments in Africa. In
doing this, we use an enriched simple mean-variance portfolio model to derive testable results.
First, we theoretically show that the determinants of SWF investments in Africa are rate of
return, risk, and networks. More precisely, we ﬁnd that the rate of return has a positive and
signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments, while risk exerts a negative eﬀect.

                                                2
        Second, we ﬁnd empirically using a database of 26 SWF investments in Africa over the period
1985-2013 that: i) about half of SWF investments in Africa are commodity-fueled funds, which
raises some concerns given the end of the commodity super-cycle; ii) Real Estate and Hotels
are the most popular sector for SWFs in Africa, totaling 42 percent of investment, while only
10 percent of their investments are in infrastructure1 ; iii) SWFs that invest in Africa mainly
originate from Asia, and Africa is the region that received the smallest share of SWF investments.
        Third, in terms of econometric speciﬁcation, we regress the logarithm of the investment share
on return rate, risk and networking parameters using cross-country data over the period 1985-
2013. Our empirical results show that rate of return has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF
investments, while volatility exerts a negative but not signiﬁcant eﬀect. Most importanly, we also
ﬁnd that SWFs with a political bias are more likely to invest in Africa. Our results remain robust
to the introduction of the following control variables: the Linaburg-Maduell transparency index,
school, inﬂation, macroeconomic variables (government consumption and budget balance), trade,
religion, corruption, property rights, and the use of legal origin as controls.
        The rest of the paper is organized as follows. Section 1 investigates some facts of SWF
investments in Africa. Section 2 presents the econometric investigation of the determinants of
SWF investments. Finally, section 3 provides policy implications and concludes.


1        Stylized facts
1.1       What do we know about SWFs in Africa?
Using data from the Sovereign Wealth Institute (SWI) transaction database, we document in-
formation on SWFs in Africa according to several variables. Table 1 shows African SWFs, their
capitalization, type, and origin.
        In terms of numbers, the world market share of sovereign wealth funds reached a record
amount of $6,831 trillion in September 2014 (see Sovereign Wealth Fund Institute), with $4,098.6
trillion being oil and gas related, and $2,732.4 trillion for other industries and commodities.
The mean of African SWFs in terms of capitalization is $16.2 billion, with a minimum of $0.003
billion, and a maximum of $6.9 billion. The percentage of African SWFs in total capitalization
represents 0.24 percent, and 0.4 percent if we take only the capitalization of SWFs related
to oil and gas. This suggests that African SWFs are less capitalized than other emerging
SWF countries. For example, SWFs from Asia are 40 percent capitalized, while 35 percent is
capitalized in the Middle East. In column (3), we indicate the type of SWFs. The majority of
African SWFs are stabilization and development funds. In terms of origin, column (4) shows that
African SWFs are mostly related to oil windfalls. Following the literature, we also investigate
the transparency of African SWFs, using the Linaburg-Maduell transparency index. This index,
developed by Carl Linaburg and Michael Maduell, is based on 10 principles that depict SWF
transparency to the public. The minimum rating takes a value of 1, while the maximum takes
a value of 10. Overall, we ﬁnd that African SWFs are not transparent. According to SWI,
    1
   This is in sharp contrast with Asia where the signiﬁcant majority of SWF investments are in infrastructure.
Other sectors of interest in Africa include extractive industries (16 percent) and manufacturing (16 percent).

and the available data, only Nigeria’s SWF is quite transparent with a value of 9, followed by
Botswana’s SWF with a value of 6. According to the available information taken from SWI,
African SWFs are all managed by local managers.
   In Table 2, we present African SWFs capitalization over the period 2007-2013, using the
information given by the SWI in terms of the international capitalization of SWFs around the
world. Given that the share of African SWFs is equal to 0.24 percent, this allows us to estimate
the capitalization of African SWFs over the period 2007-2013. The mean capitalization of
African SWFs over the period 2007-2013 is $11.21 billion, while the minimum is $8 billion, and
the maximum reaches $15 billion.

1.2     Data: SWF investments in Africa
In this section, we present SWF investments in Africa. We ﬁrst look at the sources of funding
for SWFs that invest in the continent. Second, we take into account the geographical origin
of the SWFs, and ﬁnally, we classify SWF investments in Africa by sector. We collected data
from diﬀerent sources. We use data taken from Bortolotti et al. (2009, 2015), who investigate
the relationship between SWFs and their investment patterns and performance levels. Their
database includes the total number and value of investments, the number and value of domestic
investments, the number and value of listed equity investments, the number and value of unlisted
equity investments, and the number and value of real estate investments of SWFs over the period
January 1986 to September 2008, for 35 funds. We also used data taken from Chhaochharia and
Laeven (2009), who analyze the investments of SWFs by taking into account common cultural
traits. They collected information on a total of 29,295 equity holdings by SWFs over the period
1998-2007, comprising 10,282 equity holdings across 51 countries at year-end 2007. We use a
database taken from the Sovereign Wealth Center and the SWI, and another database taken
from Triki and Faye (2011). Finally, in order to have more information about SWF investments
in Africa, we went to diﬀerent SWF websites, and recorded their acquisitions in Africa. We
then used diﬀerent online sources to ﬁnd the amounts invested in these companies by SWFs,
particularly in ﬁnancial and economic newspapers. Indeed, this strategy allowed us to track the
country destinations of ﬁve SWF investments over the period 2000-2013, and then calculate the
share of investments in terms of GDP received by African countries.2
      To investigate SWF investments and economic growth, we use per-worker GDP data for 30
African countries over the period 2000-2013 taken from the WDI.3 We also use private credit
as a measure of the level of ﬁnancial development, as well as stock market capitalization as an
alternative measure to analyze the relationship between SWF investments and growth through
ﬁnancial development. The datasets of these variables are also taken from WDI.

SWFs that invest in Africa mainly obtain their funding from extractive industries.
47 percent of SWFs that invest in Africa obtain their ﬁnding from extractive industries, therefore
53 percent are from other sources (non-commodity).

SWFs that invest in Africa mainly originate from Asia. The investments of SWFs in
Africa are dominated by Asian funds, with 49 percent of the total, followed by African funds
with 38 percent (this includes Lybia and Algeria). However, the domination by Asian SWFs is
due to China, which represents 48 percent. The share of investments of SWFs from the Middle
East and the Americas in Africa is 6 percent, while only 1 percent of SWF investments are from
Europe.
  2
     Istithmar Investment Fund invested in Kenya, Djibouti, Rwanda, South Africa, and Tanzania. The Mubadala
Fund invested in Guinea, and Nigeria. The Brazilian SWF invested in Mozambique, Democratic Republic of Congo
and Angola. The Chinese SWF invested in Nigeria, Sudan, Guinea, South Africa, and Ethiopia. The Singaporean
SWF (Temasek) invested in Nigeria, Tanzania, and South Africa.

Africa is the region that received the smallest share of SWF investments. In Figure
1, we show the percentage of the world SWF investments by target region. Using a 2009 database
taken from Monitor-FEEM SWF, we show that SWFs have primarily invested in Asia, with 29
percent of total investment, followed by Europe with 27 percent, and the Middle East with 18
percent. America received 17 percent of total investment in 2009, while other regions attracted
only 10 percent. This suggests that African countries attracted less SWF investment than any
other region. In fact, Africa’s share is certainly marginal.

The real estate and hotel sector is by far the largest share of SWF investments in
Africa by sector. Following Triki and Faye (2011), we are able to track the sectors in which
SWFs invest. For 50 SWF investments in Africa, we observe that 42 percent are located in real
estate and hotels, followed by extractive industries and industrial, with 16 percent, infrastructure
with a value of 10 percent, and ﬁnally the ﬁnancial and banking sectors with 8 percent. Figure 2
presents the investments of SWFs in Africa by sector, while Figure 3 presents the percentage of
SWF investments by sector around the world. Using Monitor-FEEM SWF data over the period
2000-2008, this shows that world investments by SWFs are located in real estate, with a value
of 16 percent, the ﬁnancial sector represents 18 percent of investments, while the industrial and
energy sectors represent 17 and 9 percent, respectively. This suggests that SWF investments in
Africa by sector are diﬀerent from other regions in the world.

1.3    Are SWF investment strategies typically diﬀerent in Africa?
This section compares the strategies of African SWFs to SWFs from Asia and the Middle East
in terms of domestic and foreign investments. Given the lack of data to track all African SWFs
we use a case-study analysis of three SWFs from three diﬀerent regions: investment strategies of
the Nigerian SWF (Nigerian Sovereign Wealth Fund Authority), the Malaysian SWF (Khazanah
Nasional) and the United Arab Emirates SWF (Mubadala Development Company). We were
able to track 9 investments realized by the Nigerian SWF over the period 2005-2014, using
data taken from the Sovereign Wealth Center. We found that between 2005 and 2014, six of
these investments were located in Africa with an amount of $129 million, and three were in the
United States, with an amount of $200 million. This suggests that the Nigerian SWF invests
more in the United States with 61 percent of its investment than in Africa with only 39 percent
for regional investments.4 Using the data taken from Bortolotti et al. (2009) over the period
1986-2008, we found that the Malaysian SWF have invested an amount of $10 billion in 108
projects. However, 90 projects were located domestically, with an amount of $8 billion, and the
rest were in foreign countries. This suggests that the Malaysian SWF investments are located
domestically with 80 percent. It also implies that in terms of investment strategy, the Nigerian
SWF and the Malaysian SWF are very diﬀerent. Finally, using the same database we found that
Mubadala Development Company invested an amount of $30 billion over the period 1986-2008
  4
    The Nigerian SWF invested $75 million in 2005 in Goldman Sachs, $75 million in 2007 in Credit Suisse, and
$75 million in 2007 in VBS Global Asset Management.



                                                          7
in 62 projects. Only 30 percent of these investments were located domestically, with an amount
of $9 billion, which corresponds to 20 projects. These ﬁndings conﬁrm the fact that African
SWFs are more likely to invest abroad than domestically or regionally.

1.4   Do SWFs improve long-term ﬁnancing and do their investments lead to
      growth in Africa?
We investigate the relationship between SWF investments and economic growth and long-term
ﬁnancing. We ﬁnd that the average GDP growth rate is positively correlated to SWF invest-
ments. This suggests that countries receiving SWF investments grow faster, and that these
investments positively aﬀect economic growth.

   However, we ﬁnd that there is a weak negative correlation between SWFs and the level of
ﬁnancial development measured by private credit, while there is a positive correlation between
private credit and the interaction term between SWF investments in Africa and private credit.
This result is not surprising according to the results of Turkisch (2011), who showed that the
size and liquidity of African ﬁnancial markets are barriers for SWF investments, and also that
the small size of most African stock markets renders big investments diﬃcult. This suggests that
SWFs invest in Africa where the level of ﬁnancial development is important. In addition, we
veriﬁed the relationship between economic growth and SWF investments and the level of ﬁnancial
development by calculating the interaction between SWF investments and private credit. Our
result shows that there is a positive correlation between economic growth and the interaction
term. This implies that SWF investments aﬀect the average growth rate in countries with a
high level of ﬁnancial development. To the best of our knowledge, these ﬁndings are the ﬁrst in

                                                                         8
the existing literature to empirically establish a positive relationship between SWF investments,
ﬁnancial development, and economic growth in Africa.
   The correlations among the variables are shown in Table 3. The average GDP growth
rate is positively and signiﬁcantly correlated with SWF investments at the 1 percent level.
This result implies that SWF investments may increase economic growth for African countries.
The correlation between growth rate and the interaction term between SWF investments and
private credit is also positive and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level, while SWF investments
is negatively but insigniﬁcantly correlated with private credit. The correlation between the
level of ﬁnancial development measured by private credit and the interaction term is positive
and statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent level. This suggests that SWFs
invest in countries with a good ﬁnancial system, and the combination of these investments and
the ﬁnancial development increases economic growth.

The Theoretical Model
In order to study the relationship between SWFs and long-term investments in Africa, we built
a portfolio choice theoretical model. We assume that the manager of each SWF invests in
portfolios that consist of three types of assets: two risky assets, and one risk-free asset. The
ﬁrst risky asset represents investments in Africa by SWFs, while the second risky asset captures
investments outside Africa. Let R                                              ˜ p ) and V(R
                                  ˜p be the random return on this portfolio, E(R           ˜p ) be
the mean and the variance of the return on portfolio, respectively. Let θ1 , θ2 , and θ3 also be the
percentages of a portfolio invested in Africa, outside Africa, and in risk-free assets, respectively.
R1 and R2 , the random returns of the two risky assets, respectively. Let also R1 and R2 be the
expected returns of the two risky assets, and Rf the return of the risk-free asset. Finally, let σ1
and σ2 be the standard deviations of the two risky assets, respectively. We assume that there are
no investment costs, and that the covariance between the two risky assets is equal to zero. Each
SWF manager augments the return of the risky asset by a preference to the region represented
by X1 , with 0 ≤ φ ≤ 1, being the weight given to this preference. This allows us to analyze the
foreign investment bias of SWF investments in Africa. It also captures historical and cultural
variables, speciﬁcally religion, language or legal origin, for example. This modeling feature is
motivated by the ﬁndings of Huberman (2001) and Grinblatt and Keloharju (2001), who found
that investors prefer to invest in familiar investment opportunities as opposed to unfamiliar
investments, as well as Guiso et et al. (2009), who found that historical and cultural variables,
particularly religion, aﬀect trust in people from other countries, and that these diﬀerences in
trust aﬀect people’s ﬁnancial decisions. We assume that the SWF manager maximizes expected
negative exponential utility and that the manager has a constant attitude towards risk:


                            ˜
         ˜p , X1 ) = −e−(φRp +(1−φ)θ1 X1 )
      U (R                                                                                                                (1)

    where R ˜p = θ1 R1 + θ2 R2 + (1 − θ1 − θ2 )Rf . This utility function is increasing and concave
   ˜p , and X1 . The Jensen inequality allows us to determine the expected negative exponential
in R
utility given by:


                               ˜ p +(1−φ)θ1 X1 ]
           ˜p , X1 )) = −E e−[φR                         ˜
      E(U (R                                     = −e−E[φRp +(1−φ)θ1 X1 ]                                                 (2)

   with E(R  ˜ p ) = Rp = θ1 (R1 − Rf ) + θ2 (R2 − Rf ) + Rf and E(X1 ) = X 1 and V(X1 ) = σ 2 . If
                                                                                            X
                                                                 ˜
there is no correlation between the random return of portfolio, Rp , and the networking parameter
X1 , then the log-normalization directly implies that:

   E(U (R
                                                                        1      2 θ 2 σ 2 +φ2 θ 2 σ 2 +(1−φ)2 θ 2 σ 2
                                                                                  1 1         2 2             1 X      ]} (3)


   The objective of the manager is to maximize a modiﬁed expected negative exponential utility
rate given by (3). The maximization problem becomes:

                                                                      φ θ1 σ 1 + φ 2 θ2                2 2

        The ﬁrst-order conditions directly imply that:

and risk of network, σX , but positively on excess return in Africa (R1 − Rf ) and the networking
parameter, X 1 .

Proof. These properties follow directly from diﬀerentiating equation (5).

        The result is quite intuitive. First, the increase in risk in Africa reduces the amount invested
by SWFs. The excess return that indicates the return rate on an investment relative to the
return rate on the risk-free investment increases SWF investments in Africa. It also shows that
an increase in the networking parameter positively aﬀects SWF investments in Africa.


2         Empirical investigation
In terms of econometric speciﬁcations, we estimate the following equation:5


                                                      2
          log(1 + θ1ij ) = α1 + α2 (R1ij − Rf ) + α3 σ1ij + α4 Xj + α5 Yi +         ij                           (6)

                                                             ∗ is the share of investments of
where i and j denote SWF and African country, respectively. θi,j
SWF i in African country j , (R1ij − Rf ) is the excess return deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the expected returns of African country j and the risk-free asset. σ1ij is the risk of investment
in African country j . Xj and Yi are country j and SWF i characteristics, respectively.                   ij   is the
error term. α1 is the intercept and, α2 , α3 ,α4 and α5 are constant coeﬃcients. If the rate of
return on investment in Africa has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments, then
α2 should be positive and statistically signiﬁcant diﬀerent from zero. The risk of investment in
Africa is expected to exert a negative and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments, thus α3 should
be negative. The coeﬃcients of the networking variables, α4 and α5 , are also expected to have
    5
        See the Appendix for the derivation of equation (6) from the ﬁrst equation of the system given by (5).

a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments. The introduction of country and SWF
characteristics captured by Xj and Yi allows us to examine if there exists cultural bias for SWF
investments in Africa, and if the drivers of these investments are ﬁnancial rather than political.
Indeed, Chhaoccharia and Laeven (2009) found that cultural bias is more pronounced for SWFs
and they tend to invest in countries with similar cultural traits. Most importantly, they showed
that religious closeness is positively and signiﬁcantly related to SWF investments. Knill et et al.
(2012) ﬁnd that political relations are important in why SWFs invest. However, for Avendano
and Santiso (2009), SWF investments do not exhibit political bias, and their investments are
not diﬀerent from Mutual Fund investments. Our dependent variable is the logarithm of one
plus the share of each investment in terms of total capitalization for 26 SWFs in Africa over the
period 1985-2013.
      In order to estimate the empirical model, we use the following proxies. We ﬁrst calculate the
excess return using the average GDP growth rate over the period 1985-2013 taken from the new
Penn-World Table 8.0 of Feenstra et al. (2013). The United States is used as a proxy in terms
of investment in a risk-free asset, Rf . The expression Rj , which denotes the expected return in
African country j , is measured as the average per-worker GDP growth rate.6 To measure the risk
of investments in Africa, we use the standard deviation of the average per-worker GDP growth
rate over the period 1985-2013. Our networking variables Xj and Yi are proxied by religion and
political fund, respectively. Speciﬁcally, Bortolotti et al. (2015) use the question 11 of Truman
(2008): “Are decisions on speciﬁc investments made by the Managers?” to construct the index
of political fund. They classify all funds with managerial independence score of less than 1 as
“political funds” and all others as “non political funds.” They then deﬁne a dummy variable
that takes the value of 1 for “political fund” and 0 if not.7 The religion variable includes the
share of Christians and Muslims in a given country using the new database of the PewResearch
Center.8
      In terms of control variables, we use the following variables: Private credit and bank costs
to take into account the level of ﬁnancial development and bank eﬃciency, respectively. Private
credit is calculated as the credit provided by the banking sector, including all credit to various
sectors on a gross basis, with the exception of credit to the central government, which is net and
bank costs are measured by overhead costs to total assets (%), deﬁned as operating expenses of a
bank as a share of the value of all assets held, and cost to income ratio (%), deﬁned as operating
expenses of a bank as a share of the sum of net-interest revenue and other operating income.9 We
also control our results using school, inﬂation, macroeconomic policies such as budget balance
and trade taken from the World Bank WDI.         10    School is measured by the total enrollment in
secondary education, regardless of age, expressed as a percentage of the population of oﬃcial
secondary education age. Inﬂation, consumer price index, measured by the consumer price
index, reﬂects the annual percentage change in the cost to the average consumer of acquiring a

    We also use the average per-capita GDP growth rate to test the robustness of our results.

basket of goods and services that may be ﬁxed or changed at speciﬁed intervals, such as yearly
(the Laspeyres formula is generally used); budget balance as % of GDP is cash surplus or deﬁcit
revenue (including grants) minus expenses and the net acquisition of non-ﬁnancial assets. In the
1986 GFS manual, non-ﬁnancial assets were included under revenue and expenditure in gross
terms and trade calculated as the sum of exports (% of GDP) and imports (% of GDP).
   In terms of institutional variables we use corruption taken from Laporta et al. (2008) and the
International Country Risk Guide (ICRG). Higher values in corruption reﬂect more developed
institutions.11 To take into account the level of innovation of a given country we introduce the
proximity to the world technology frontier, deﬁned as the ratio of the GDP per-worker of the
country in 1985 to the GDP of the US at the same period.
   Finally, we add several SWF characteristics as controls. The following variables are used:
Transparency, capitalization taken from the SWI.12 To investigate the foreign investment bias
for SWFs that invest in Africa, we deﬁne a dummy variable that takes a value 1 if the country
origin of SWF is a member of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) and 0 if not.
More particularly, this dummy variable allows us to analyze if SWFs from muslim countries
invest more or less in Africa.13
   Table 4 shows the summary statistics of our variables. The average of the logarithm of
the investment share in Africa by SWFs is 0.83, with a standard deviation equal to 1.11. The
maximum is 3.93, and the minimum is 0. In terms of transparency, the average is 7.25, with a
maximum of 10, and a minimum of 1. The average of SWF capitalization in $ billion is 103.95.
However, we observe a high dispersion between SWFs in terms of capitalization, conﬁrmed by
the value of the standard deviation, which is equal to 184.04. The average of the rate of return
is -0.81, while the average of the risk is 0.22. The average of the dummy variable political fund
is 0.61. The maximum of political SWF is 1, while the minimum is 0. In terms of institutional
variables, we ﬁnd that the averages of the level of the corruption is -0.49. The maximum level
corruption is 0.5, while the minimum is equal to -1.12. The maximum of the variable property
rights takes a value equal to 3, while the minimum is 2. The averages of private credit is 30.03
percent of GDP. The minimum of the level of ﬁnancial development measured by private credit
is 4.40 percent of GDP, while the maximum is 108.63 percent. In terms of correlation we ﬁnd
that the logarithm of the share of SWF investments in Africa is negatively correlated with the
Linaburg-Maduell transparency index. This suggests that transparent SWFs are less likely to
invest in Africa. However, we ﬁnd a positive correlation between political fund and political
index with the logarithm of the investment share, suggesting that political SWFs are more
likely to invest in Africa.

2.1    Results
This section presents the results of our speciﬁcations. The dependent variable is the logarithm
plus one of the share of investments in Africa of SWF i. In each speciﬁcation, we introduce the
intercept, and we deal the heteroskedasticity problems in regressions by using White’s consistent
standard errors for statistical inference. The speciﬁcations are estimated using ordinary least
squares (OLS).
   In column (1) of Table 5 we regress the logarithm of one plus investment share of SWFs
in Africa on rate of return and risk in Africa, as well as our networking variables captured
by political and religion motives of the fund. This allows us to test if SWF investments are
politically biased or not. The introduction of religion takes into account the cultural bias of
SWF investments in Africa. Our main results show that return on investment has a positive
and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investment, suggesting that the rate of return enhances the in-
vestment of SWFs in Africa. The coeﬃcient associated with risk enters negatively but is not
signiﬁcant. This result suggests that risk decreases the investment of SWFs in Africa, but does
not aﬀect SWF investments. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcient of political fund
enters positively and statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent level. This
result suggests that SWFs with political views are more likely to invest in Africa. Our results
are in line with Knill et al. (2012), but contradict those of Avendano and Santiso (2009), who
showed that SWF investments are not politically biased. For the second type of networking
variable, namely religion, we ﬁnd that the coeﬃcients associated with the share of christians
and muslims enter (weakly) positively and negatively signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at the 10
percent level, respectively. This implies that SWFs from christian countries tend to invest more
in Africa, a ﬁnding in line with Chhaoccharia and Laeven (2009). Our results suggest that long-
term SWF investments in Africa depend more on rate of return. They also imply that political

SWFs tend to invest more in Africa. Using the Linaburg-Maduell transparency index for SWF
transparency as control in column (2), we ﬁnd our coeﬃcient of interest, α2 , remains positive
and signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level, while risk enters negatively and statistically signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent level. In terms of networking variables, we ﬁnd that the
dummy variable political fund remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level, while
the share of christians has a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on the investment share of SWFs in
Africa at the 5 percent level. In column (3), we add the capitalization of SWFs in $ billion
as a control. Our coeﬃcient of interest, α2 , remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 5 percent
level, while α3 remains negative but insigniﬁcant. This suggests that return rate increases SWF
investments, while risk does not aﬀect these investments. The coeﬃcients associated with the
dummy variable political fund, the share of christians and muslims, enter positively and statisti-
cally signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at the 1 percent and 10 percent levels, respectively. These
ﬁndings conﬁrm our theoretical model and empirical strategy, and show that there are political
and cultural biases for SWF investments in Africa. In column (4), we ﬁnd an interesting result
after controlling for the dummy variable called Islamic fund. The rate of return has a positive
and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments, while risk exerts a negative and insigniﬁcant eﬀect.
We also ﬁnd that SWF investments are politically biased since the coeﬃcient of political fund
remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. Also, the coeﬃcient associated with the
share of christians enters positively and signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at the 10 percent level.
But the dummy variable Islamic fund enters negatively and insigniﬁcantly.
   To take into account the level of ﬁnancial development and bank eﬃciency of countries in
Africa, we add private credit, overhead costs and cost to income ratio as controls in columns
(5)-(8). The coeﬃcients associated with the return rate and political fund remain positive and
signiﬁcant, while risk remains negative but is not signiﬁcant. The share of christians remains
positive and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level, while the share of muslims remains negative.
This suggests that SWFs from christian countries tend to invest more in Africa but not for
those from muslim countries. The introduction of bank eﬃciency measures conﬁrms our results
listed above. They suggest that the return rate enhances SWF investments, and political SWFs
invest more in Africa. Surprisingly, the coeﬃcient associated with bank cost to income ratio
enters positively and statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at the 5 percent level. This
suggests that SWFs tend to invest more in countries with less eﬃcient banking systems, a ﬁnding
in contraction with Turkisch (2011).
   It could be that our results are driven by human capital. To control for this fact, we add
school enrollment in column (1) as a control of Table 6. The coeﬃcient associated with the
return rate remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 5 percent level, while risk remains negative
and insigniﬁcant. Also, political fund remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. As
expected, human capital enhances SWF investments in Africa as the coeﬃcient of school has a
positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on the share of investments at the 10 percent level. This suggests
that SWFs tend to invest in African countries with good education system. We continue to
check the robustness of our ﬁndings by adding inﬂation, macroeconomic policies such as budget
balance, openness measured by trade, innovation captured by the proximity to the technology

frontier, and transparency measured by corruption as controls. In column (2), we regress the
logarithm of investment share of SWFs on rate of return, risk in Africa, political fund, the share
of christians and muslims, and inﬂation. Our results show that return on investment has a
positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investment, suggesting that the rate of return enhances
the investment of SWFs. The coeﬃcient associated with risk enters negatively but is not sig-
niﬁcant. This result suggests that risk decreases the investment of SWFs in Africa. Political
fund remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. The share of christians enters posi-
tively and statistically signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from zero at 10, while the share of muslims remains
negative and signiﬁcant at the 10 percent level. These ﬁndings show that the excess return
that indicates the rate of return on an investment relative to the rate of return on the risk-free
investment increases SWF investments and that there exists political and cultural biases for
these investments in Africa. Budget balance is introduced in column (3), and all coeﬃcients of
interest enter signiﬁcant with the expected signs. Most importantly, the rate of return has a
positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments at the 10 percent level. To take into account
the degree of openness we control for trade in column (4). Our main results remain unchanged.
It could be that SWFs invest in countries close to the technology frontier in terms of innovation.
In addition, we add into our speciﬁcations the proximity of the country to the technology fron-
tier (where the leader is the United States). The coeﬃcient associated with the rate of return
remains positive and signiﬁcant. More speciﬁcally, the magnitude of the coeﬃcient associated
with the rate of return increases and remains positive and signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level.
Also, the networking parameter captured by political motive of the fund remains positive and
signiﬁcant at the 1 percent level. This suggests that SWFs with a political bias are more likely
to invest in Africa. We also ﬁnd that the coeﬃcient associated with the share of christians has
a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments. Interestingly, the coeﬃcient associated
with the proximity to the technology frontier also enters positively and statistically signiﬁcantly
diﬀerent from zero at the 5 percent level. This shows that the share of SWF investments in
Africa increases with the level of technological innovation. In terms of institutional variables,
we use the level of corruption. The results are shown in columns (6) and (7). The signs and
signiﬁcance of our coeﬃcients of interest remain unchanged. Our main results remain robust to
the introduction of inﬂation, macroeconomic variables, trade, corruption and the proximity to
the technology frontier as controls, and conﬁrm at the same time the results listed above, and
our theoretical implications.


3    Conclusion and policy implications
Using available data on SWF in Africa, we observe that 47 percent of SWFs that invest in Africa
are from minerals (extractive commodity), while 53 percent are from non-commodity sources.
In addition, we ﬁnd that African funds invest less domestically, in contrast to Asian funds.
    In addition, we show using an enriched mean-variance portfolio model that the determinants
of SWF investments in Africa are excess return, risk and networks. We test our theoretical

The dependent variable is the logarithm of the share of investments in Africa by an SWF. Column (1) controls for human
capital measured by school enrollment. Column (2) regresses the logarithm of the investment share in Africa of an SWF
on rate of return, risk, political fund, religion and controls for inﬂation. Columns (3) controls for macroeconomic policies
captured by budget balance. Column (4) takes into account the degree of openness measured by trade. Columns (5)
introduces the proximity for a given country to the world technology frontier. Column (6) uses corruption as a control
variable.

vestment share of SWFs on rate of return, risk, and networking indicators using cross-country
data over the period 1985-2013 for 26 SWFs. Empirical results show that rate of return has
a positive and signiﬁcant eﬀect on SWF investments, while risk exerts a negative and but not
signiﬁcant eﬀect. Most importantly, we ﬁnd that political SWFs are more likely to invest in
Africa. These results are robust to the introduction of the following control variables: the
Linaburg-Maduell transparency index, the political structure of the SWF, religion, corruption,
private credit, bank eﬃciency, and the proximity to the technology frontier.
   To increase the quantity of SWF investments in Africa, policy makers should set up good
governance and transparency policies by promoting a low level of corruption and high levels of
property rights. African countries should reform their ﬁnancial sectors by rendering their stock
markets more attractive. Finally, strong governance and a higher level of coordination among
public entities positively aﬀect the eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness of public investment programs.

   Let us assume that i is the individual index of a SWF and j is the country we will then have:


                                                  2                 2

   where i and j denote SWF and African country, respectively. θ1ij is the share of investments
of SWF i in African country j , (R1ij − Rf ) is the excess return deﬁned as the diﬀerence between
the expected returns of African country j and the risk-free asset. σ1ij is the risk of investment in
African country j of SWF i. Xj is country j characteristics.              ij   is the error term. Since we use
                                                                                        2 = 0,
religion as networking variable captured by Xj and that this variable is constant then σXj
it follows directly that:


                                                  2
      log(1 + θ1ij ) = α1 + α2 (R1ij − Rf ) + α3 σ1ij + α4 Xj + α5 Yi +           ij                     (11)

   We add Yi in order to take into account the characteristics of SWF i such as capitalization,
transparency and political index.
