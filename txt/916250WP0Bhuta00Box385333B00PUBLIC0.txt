COUNTRY SNAPSHOT
Recent Economic and Sector Developments
The economy is estimated to have grown at six percent in 2013-14, still constrained by various
administrative restrictions in place on credit, foreign exchange and imports limiting the expansion of
aggregate demand and lower than expected hydropower generation. For the first half of 2014, hydropower
(annualized) generation has declined by two percent due to lesser rainfall compared to 2013 (hydropower
projects are run-off-the river, so electricity generation depends on the amount of rainfall). Meanwhile,
tourism recorded a marked expansion following the introduction of new measures aimed at boosting tourism
during the low season months of June to August. 1 Tourist arrivals more than doubled in June-July and grew by
12 percent year-on-year as of July 2014.
In 2012, corrective administrative measures to stop the rupee shortage led to a sudden halt in construction
and service growth in 2012 that, combined with a poor record in agriculture, contracted growth to 4.6
percent – the lowest level since 2008. Construction in hydropower has been sustained, with four projects
being built at an average annual investment cost of 28 percent of GDP. Domestic sales of cement, a good proxy
for construction-sector activities, slowed markedly in the first half of 2014, despite the Nu10.9 billion (about
$180 million) Dungsam Cement mega-project starting production.
In spite of the uncertainty and volatility in the external sector, economic growth is projected to be 6.8
percent in FY 2014-15. This growth will be driven by expansion in construction (including hydropower) and
a rebound of aggregate demand, boosted by the increase in public wages and allowances concomitant with
the lift of bans over housing/construction loans.
In 2014-15, the electricity sector is projected to contribute to growth with the commissioning of the
Dagachhu hydroelectric project by the end of September 2014. Hydropower construction will continue. Four
new projects have been agreed with the Government of India, under a Joint Venture mode, in April 2014 (see
Table 1). In June 2014, the 600MW Joint-Venture Kholongchu Hydro-electric project was inaugurated by
Indian Prime Minister Modi during his visit to Bhutan.

1 Under the Bhutan-Thailand friendship initiative, Thai residents were offered a special package during the
low season, including a 50 percent discount in airfare and hotel, and did not have to pay the mandatory
minimum daily tariff of $200 a day for the lean season. Instead, they would be only levied the daily royalty of
USD 65.

Aggregate demand will regain momentum in the next 12 months . Consumption will rebound following
the lift of administrative measures to curb imports and the raise in civil service salaries in July 2014, while
investment will be sustained with continued inflows into the hydropower sector . Private consumption
contributes around two-thirds of total consumption, while private investment, boosted by hydropower, is
more than 75 percent of GDP. In addition, a liquidity injection in the financial institutions and establishment
of cottage, small and medium industries as a part of the economic stimulus package is expected to
reinvigorate growth especially in the manufacturing and service sectors (see previous issues of the World
Bank Bhutan economic update).
The service industry is expected to pick up again during the second half of 2014, driven by the good
performance of tourism and relaxation of credit restrictions in the financial sector. The World Bank
estimates that hotel, restaurants and trade/retail will grow at 15 percent in 2014
The outlook is positive but macroeconomic pressures on domestic demand will have to be managed.
We project growth to reach 7.3 percent in 2015/16 supported by a combination of favorable factors (on-
going construction of four hydropower projects, the commissioning of the Dagachhu project by mid-2014,
Dungsam Cement coming on line, the possible lift of the bans on imports and housing credit, disbursement
from India to finance the 11th Five-Year Plan for 2013-2018 leading to higher public capital spending, the
economic stimulus plan, increased public wages expected in the FY14/15 budget, expansion of tourism with
innovative measures).2 This boost in economic activity could risk a resumption of overheating and macro
imbalances. It will be important to tighten monetary and fiscal policies in light of (i) disbursements under the
economic stimulus, (ii) increase in the public service wage bill, and (iii) relaxation of restrictions over foreign
exchange, vehicle imports, and housing loans.

2In February, the Prime Minister announced the “Bhutan-Thailand friendship offer” aimed at attracting residents from Thailand during
the leaner months of June, July and August, as an effort towards lean season promotion as well as the new flight from Mumbai to start in
the fall of 2014. As a part of the offer, Thai nationals and others with proof of residency in Thailand will not pay the mandatory minimum
daily tariff of $200 per day for the lean season. Instead, they would be levied the daily royalty of $65, while tour operators would have to
compete and come up with attractive packages. In addition, the national airline will offer 50 percent discounts on airfare, while hotels
will give up to 50 percent discounts on rates.

Inflation
Consumer price inflation in Bhutan has slowed down to 8.1 in June 2014 year-on-year from 11.3
percent at the end of 2013. This decline was mainly driven by India’s easing of inflation. 3 India’s consumer
price inflation averaged a rapid 7.9 percent in July (year-on-year). However, the relative weakness of the
rupee and supply-side shortages will continue to generate inflationary pressures in India.

Bhutan’s inflation is expected to rebound to 10 percent in 2014/15 fueled by domestic factors . These
factors include the civil servant wage increase, the introduction of a five percent fuel tax and the schedule
increase in electricity tariffs by up to 15 percent. The share of housings, water, electricity and gas/fuels in the
consumer price index is 21.7 percent. The tariffs’ impact on poverty should be modest, given the progressive
nature of tariffs.

Fiscal accounts
An upward revision of public compensations will push up current spending in FY14/15. Civil service
wages and allowances have been increased by 19 to 23 percent. That increase corresponds to a 0.7
percentage point increase of GDP (Table 2) which has been partly offset by reduction in other current
expenditures. It is also worth stressing that public wages had not been revised since November 2010. The
increase corresponds to a catching up of purchasing power of civil servants . In fact, taking into account the
increase in prices since then (+35 percent), it turns out that the purchasing power of the median civil servant
has actually declined by more than eight percent. Nevertheless, it will be important to tighten fiscal/monetary
policies, to incentivize savings over immediate consumption.

The government relies heavily on foreign grants to finance capital expenditure . That said, only
confirmed donor-funding is actually factored in the budget at the start of the Fiscal Year. It usually leads, as it
does this fiscal year, to an under-estimated capital spending budget, which will be revised as more donor
resources come in. The drop of the capital budget from 17.5 to 11.7 percent of GDP does not reflect the actual
projections of capital spending, but provide merely a very conservative estimate of secured donor resources
for the year.
Grants financed about 27 percent of total spending, or nine percent of GDP, in FY13/14, 70 percent of it from
the government of India. Given the persistent shortage of rupees, the government has tightened expenditures
to bring them in line with available resources. Another reason for the spending dip is the slow start of the
budget year because of the elections in the summer, change of leadership, and delays in foreign grant
disbursements. Grants are expected to more than halve, from 15 percent in FY12/13 to about 6.6 percent of
GDP, due to slow initiation of the 11th Five-Year Plan (FYP-11).
Domestic revenues coverage of current spending has been shrinking consistently over the last four
fiscal years. The coverage is expected to be 112 percent of FY14/15 current spending, compared to 122
percent three years before. By constitution, domestic revenues should cover at minimum current spending
and FYP-11’s targets coverage of 85 percent of total expenditures by 2018. Domestic revenues as a share of
GDP have been declining over the last three years, from 22 percent to an estimate of 18.9 percent in FY14/15.
This calls for an effort to broaden the tax base, improve tax administration and rationalization, in particular
reducing tax holidays and exemptions to the extent they do not have the intended impact.
To replace the bans on vehicle imports lifted on July 19, new taxation measures on vehicles were
introduced. That includes a fuel tax of 5 percent, a tax on vehicle imports (other than from India) from 100 to
180 percent and a sale tax on Indian vehicle of 55 percent.
These tax measures are however weakened by the persistence of a civil service quota for vehicle
import. The quota allows civil servant (at or above grade P3A, or 7189 civil servants, 28 percent of total civil

service) to import every 7 years a vehicle duty free up to Nu800,000 (or $13,333). Efforts to replace the quota
by a financial allowance proved unsuccessful during the last Parliament session.
The deficit in FY14/15 is expected to ease to 2.7 percent of GDP, as more revenues will kick in with
commissioning of the Dungsam cement project, the Dagacchu hydro electricity scheme, and the Chhukha
power plant’s electricity export tariffs revision.

The Ministry of Finance was the last ministry to sign a performance agreement with the prime minister
on September 3. Key targets include (i) maintaining the fiscal deficit below three percent, maintaining the
non-hydro debt at 35 percent of GDP, and raising revenue above 20 percent of GDP.

Public debt
Bhutan’s public and publicly guaranteed external debt stood at 93.2 percent of GDP by end-FY13/14.
The rise in the external public debt is primarily due to disbursement of on-going hydro projects (59.1 percent
of GDP). Hydropower projects are financed primarily by India with a mix of loans (70 percent) and grants (30
percent). External debt is largely denominated in Indian rupees (and related to hydropower sector debt),
which accounts for 64.4 percent of total external debt, with convertible currency debt accounting for only
35.6 percent of GDP. Domestic debt is due entirely to a loan to purchase aircraft for national carrier Druk Air
in FY9/10.
Bhutan’s rapid hydropower development is projected to lead to a substantial buildup of external debt
in the medium-term, with debt ratios breaching most of the country-specific indicative thresholds. Bhutan’s
debt situation is expected to improve over the long run, reflecting significantly higher electricity exports
when hydropower projects come on stream.

Bhutan’s risk of external debt distress continues to be moderate .4 This is based on the commercial
viability of the hydropower projects, the risk-sharing agreement with India for hydropower loans, Bhutan’s
strong track record of project implementation, rapid growth in energy demand from India, committed donor
support, and Bhutan’s high level of international reserves. Bhutan’s concentrated export base, rupee-
reserves mismatch with external debt and the trade structure of the country leave it vulnerable to exports
and any shortfalls in aid inflows. Additional risks stem from bulky hydro-related debt service payments
requiring provisioning of rupee reserves.5
These projects also bring strong economic dividends in the long term , boosting average real GDP growth
and exports. Moreover, despite the large increase in the stock of debt, the addition of the new hydropower
projects does not create substantial vulnerabilities in debt servicing over the long term. Bhutan’s strong track
record of project implementation, the commercial viability of the new hydropower projects and the close
economic and political ties that Bhutan has with India are all factors that mitigate the commercial risks of
these projects. India has been both the main provider of financing for hydropower projects and the main
consumer of the projects’ output.

Balance of payment
Export revenues from sales of electricity are expected to decline slightly in step with less than
expected rainfalls until June 2014. Since no new hydropower projects have become operational since
2006, the fluctuation in export revenues reflects the vagaries of hydrological flows. The monsoon rains in the
first half of 2014 have been below those of last year, which is why data show a decline of 1 percent in export
revenues (year-on-year) from sales of electricity as of end June 2014. The potential for future increases
remain strong. Exports of minerals and mineral-based products account for more than half of total exports,
with hydropower exports comprising a further 45 percent, and manufactured products a tiny five percent.
India receives almost 90 percent of Bhutanese electricity production. Continued shortages of power in India
will ensure strong demand for electricity from Bhutan

The tourism sector has turned into an important contributor of export revenues in recent years .
Tourism revenues are 20 percent of non-hydro exports. Tourist arrivals and revenues (from convertible
currency-paying tourists) expanded at an average of 15 percent per year in the five years to 2013. As of July
2014, 25,854 convertible currency tourists came to Bhutan, a jump of 12 percent year-on-year, earning the
country $67.5 million in convertible currency, a seven percent increase year-on-year compared to 2013. New
measures introduced towards Thai tourist have contributed. A similar number of tourists came overland,
mainly from India with light travel requirements but the statistics are not up-to-date for this segment.
Bhutan runs a large and growing current account deficit (estimated at about 25 percent in June 2014) .
It is essentially financed by donor resources, of which India contributes the most through loans and grants to
finance hydropower development. Even when excluding self-financed hydropower construction imports of
goods and services (around a third of total good and services), the current account deficit would stand at 15
percent of GDP, illustrating a significant national dissaving, and the need for the country to borrow to finance
consumption. Foreign direct investment finances a low eight percent of the capital account (about $20m). The
recent amendment of the FDI policy should contribute to attract more foreign investment into the country. In
particular, foreign investors are now allowed to repatriate their profits in the currency of their choice.
Gross international reserves had built up to 17 months of goods and service imports . International
reserves amounted to $997.9 million by end-June 2014, 83 percent of which was in convertible currency,
with the rest in Indian rupees.6 There is, however, a continuing mismatch in the composition of Bhutan’s
reserves and the structure of its international transactions, as the country primarily needs Indian rupees for
trade settlement and debt service. To start addressing this issue, the RMA has implemented since August new
reserve policy measures allowing the conversion of convertible currency reserves into Indian Rupees above a
threshold of $700 million.

Monetary and financial sectors
The tight liquidity experienced by the banking system in 2012 has eased . Excess liquidity characterized
the financial system from 2008-mid 2011 due to large build-up of hydropower inflows and grants (and only
partial sterilization of these funds by the RMA). The tight liquidity conditions emerged in June 2011 as a
result of persistent growth in Indian rupee imports with an equivalent drain on local currency liquidity, a
reduction in the overall level of individual deposits, over-dependence on the more volatile and seasonal
corporate deposits as a source of funding; and bank-financing of the large, long-term public- and private-
sector investment projects (e.g., Dungsam cement project). Since March 2012, in order to address the tight
liquidity conditions, the RMA cut the cash reserve ratio (CRR) twice to five percent from 17 percent. As result,
the banking sector’s liquidity improved between Q2 2012 and Q2 2014.


Interest rates have shown little movement previously, despite the absence of explicit controls . Real
interest rates have been negative, introducing a strong bias towards investment in real estate. While the
reason for interest rate stickiness is unclear, higher and more flexible interest rates may better reflect market
conditions and be more aligned with those in India.




6The Constitution requires that foreign exchange reserves should be maintained at 12 months of essential
imports.

Box 1: Royal Monetary Authority notice: introduction of housing & vehicle loans.

This is to inform the general public that the RMA will lift the ban imposed on Housing and Vehicle loans with effect
from 1st September 2014. The policy ban of March 2012, although unconventional in nature, was inevitable and
had to be implemented by the RMA given the severe macroeconomic imbalances the country faced during the time.
This policy normalization has been a yearlong process of extensive planning, preparation and consultation by the
RMA, which was approved by the RMA Board during its 98th Board meeting.
Further, along with the Housing and Vehicle loans guidelines, Consumer loans guidelines have also been issued as a
pre-emptive measure by the RMA to mitigate systemic risk that could arise from potential build-up of risks
particularly in these sectors.
However, with the reintroduction of these Guidelines, we would strongly advise all FIs (Lenders) to lend
responsively and all Borrowers to borrow responsibly.

Monetary conditions need to remain sufficiently tight to ward off overheating and manage pressures
on rupee reserves. Excess liquidity should be closely monitored and promptly adjusted to prevent credit
growth from rebounding strongly. In future, along with the development of a domestic capital market,
increased issuance of treasury bills could be used to mop up excess liquidity. Rupee inflows related to
hydropower projects and grants should be sterilized in order to curtail excess liquidity in the banking system
and dampen credit growth, without the need for administrative or macro-prudential measures.

Since early 2013 to June 2014, private credit growth has slowed markedly to an average of 6-7
percent annually, as a result of the strict tightening of credit and foreign exchange availability
following the shortage of Rupees. Since then, although it remains yet to be seen in the data, credit growth is
expected to rebound with the lifting of credit restrictions and their replacement of market-friendly measures.
Strengthening supervision will be critical in the short-to-medium term financial sector because
vulnerabilities have likely accumulated. While banks appear to be well capitalized, with the risk-weighted
capital adequacy ratio rising to 19 percent, non-performing loans rose to 11.5 percent as of March 2014 (from
10.1 percent a year before) following the sudden halt of rapid credit growth. The financial sector remains
adequately capitalized, with a capital adequacy ratio of 18.20 percent in March 2014, above the institutional
requirement. Yet vulnerabilities arise from asset-liability mismatches, with a significant proportion of the
deposit base being (short-term, seasonal and volatile) corporate deposits, whereas bank credit is
concentrated in loans with longer time horizons to finance investment and projects (as in construction,
particularly funding of large infrastructure projects). The concentration of lending in personal and real estate
loans raises particular concerns; more than a quarter of the financial sector’s portfolio consists of building

and construction loans, followed by personal loans that constitute around 16 percent of overall credit
outstanding.
Efforts to deepen the financial sector in a sustainable manner are underway . A comprehensive Financial
Sector Development Strategy is being prepared with a careful sequencing of reforms within a medium-term
plan. It will emphasize the importance of balancing further deepening with maintaining financial stability,
promoting alternatives to bank financing for the private sector, and improving information and market
infrastructure by steps that included broadening coverage of the credit bureau.

Poverty and Statistical Capacity Building
Bhutan is a star performer in poverty reduction, with only 12 percent of the population below the
national poverty line in 2012, compared to 23 percent in 2007. Bhutan ranks third among least poor
countries in South Asia behind Maldives and Sri Lanka, with only 1.7 percent of the population below the
$1.25 international poverty line in 2012, compared to four percent in 2010. This remarkable progress is
founded on robustly high per-capita annual GDP growth of five percent. Bhutan outpaces countries in its
cohort in poverty reduction in the world.

Broader measures of welfare such as multidimensional indicators of poverty counted a quarter of the
population to be deprived in 2010 in four of the thirteen indicators. Bhutan’s innovative Gross National
Happiness Index measured in 2010 that nearly half the population is not-yet-happy for policy purposes using
an even broader set of 33 indicators.
                                        Fig 5: Poverty rates (2007-2012)




The remaining concerns are regional disparities in poverty reduction and persistence of poverty in
some dzongkhags (districts) and urban areas. A new poverty assessment sheds light on ways to address
these concerns and potentially there is need for an urgent census of below poverty line households. The new
government manifesto for its first 100 days mentions the conduct of a Below Poverty Line (BPL) census to
identify households that are poor and help with formal social transfers to the poor households.

Bhutan aims for equal access to public services. Nearly all (98 percent) of the population has access to
improved water sources, and there is little disparity in this respect between poor and the non-poor
households. At least 80 percent of households have access to improved sanitation, with a disparity of around
15 percent between poor and non-poor households in both urban and rural areas. Nearly all (97 percent) of
households in urban areas, even the poor, have electricity for lighting. In rural areas, however, only 69
percent of poor households have electricity for lighting. Only 21 percent of poor households have television,
compared to 59 percent in non-poor households.

Bhutan’s statistical system is considered fragile with limited human resources, absence of legal
framework, data weaknesses and poor data coordination. However, notable progress has been made in
remedying data weaknesses in select areas such as price data collection and dissemination using a map
portal. Updating the 2008 National Statistical Development Strategy and resources to implement such a
strategy are relevant areas of engagement with ROGB.

Private Sector
Bhutan's economy remains dominated by state-owned enterprises (SOEs), with private sector
contributing a mere 8 percent of total national revenue. Advantages include a stable and low-corruption
environment, reasonably good human development including wide-spread knowledge of English, access to
low cost and reliable electricity, preferential access to the large Indian market and easy access to skilled and
unskilled labor from India. Against these advantages, private sector development is limited by the absence of
scale economies, unequal access to finance, mismatched skills of the labor force, and the lack of adequate
infrastructure.

To spur PSD, a number of policies and laws have been formulated. These include the Economic
Development Policy (EDP) and the amended FDI policy and rules and regulations. Forthcoming policies
include the industrial infrastructure development policy (governing economic zones), the licensing protocol,
the mineral development policy, the renewable energy policy, the micro, small and medium enterprises
(MSME) policy, the consumer protection bill and the enterprise registration act. With the support of the
World Bank, Bhutan launched its first IT Park in 2012 as a Public Private Partnership (PPP)

Despite reforms, Bhutan’s ranking in ease of doing business in 2013 remains in the last tier , having
decreased to 148 (out of 185 economies) from 142 in 2012, suggesting that more needs to be done. The
private sector remains small and, while 15-to-24 year olds represent a fifth of the Bhutanese population,
unemployment among the youth remains high. To foster Private Public Partnerships (PPPs) a PPP policy has
been drafted and submitted for Cabinet for approval.

The Business Opportunity and Information Centre (BOIC) was established on December 19, 2013 as a
time bound autonomous agency for implementation of the Revolving Fund created as part of the Economic
Stimulus Program in order to foster growth of cottage and small manufacturing industries that contribute to
employment creation, export enhancement/import substitution. The Centre was officially launched on
August 27, 2014. Under the Nu. 5 billion worth of Economic Stimulus Plan (ESP), Nu. 1 billion is earmarked
for the Special Support Scheme (SSS) activities, another Nu 1.5 billion will be pumped into the revolving fund
I for cottage and small manufacturing industries. The revolving fund II, for non-formal rural activities, has a
budget of Nu 0.40bn and the remaining Nu 2.1 billion has been allocated towards the Financial Institutes
(FIs).

Health
Bhutan has sustained its investments in health over the last two decades and made remarkable
progress. In 2010-11, public health expenditure stood at 4 percent of GDP and 9 percent of government
spending, considerably higher than other South Asian countries. The expansion of the network of health
facilities now ensures that 90 percent of the population live within three hours walk to a health facility; there
are 25 traditional medicine units at Basic Health Units (BHUs), and there are more than two functioning
ambulances at each district hospital.

Access to health services is satisfactory, with their utilization and quality requiring improvement. The
Constitution (2008) provides that the state will provide basic public health services free of cost to all citizens.
As of now, all health services (barring a handful of dental, cosmetic and other services) continue to be
provided by the government for free. Nevertheless, some outreach centers (ORCs) are very remote and
require health workers, the unsung heroes of the country’s public health system, to endure long walking
hours (or even days) prior to reaching the remote facilities.




The most significant health problem is the high rates of malnutrition. Though there has been
improvement in recent years, it is nevertheless still estimated that some 35 percent of Bhutanese preschool
children are stunted. The Royal Government of Bhutan finalized the draft of the National Food and Nutrition
Security policy during 2012. Although the burden of non-communicable diseases (NCDs) is growing, the
health services continue to spend most of their resources at district level on the traditional infectious
diseases such as common cold, diarrhea, skin diseases and conjunctivitis. In addition, alcoholism remains a
significant health challenge.

Education
Bhutan’s education expenditures are equally strong. Public education expenditure stood at 7.3 percent of
GDP and 16.7 percent of total government spending (MOF, 2012). These figures are among the highest in the
South Asia region. The Constitution (2008) provides for the State to ensure free education up to Grade 10 for
all children of school-going age, and to make technical and professional education generally available, and
higher education equally accessible to all on the basis of merit. At the same time, this progress has led to a
refocus by development partners on other priorities, which may make it difficult to sustain high education
spending.

                                       Table 6: Poverty and Social indicators




Bhutan is on track to achieve the MDGs in education by the end of the 10 th Five-Year Plan (2008-
2013). Bhutan has established and built up an organized public education system since the 1960s. This
diversified sector now includes over 650 schools and institutes, more than 180,000 students and nearly 9,000
teachers. Notably, gender parity has been achieved up to Grade 10. Females constitute nearly 50 percent of
enrollment in higher secondary education and nearly 40 percent at tertiary level. The gross enrollment ratio
was 71 percent at secondary level and 30 percent at tertiary level in 2011 (WDI 2011).

A key issue is that despite high enrollment and levels of public financing, learning levels remain low.
Poverty remains key among constraints on enrollment and attendance, as corroborated by data from the
Poverty Analyses, demonstrating that geogs - a collection of villages that forms a local administrative unit --
where fewer children attend school tend to be those with comparatively higher poverty rates. This is mainly
due to the high out-of-pocket expenditure for households.

Sector wide, the majority of education service delivery is through the public sector. The exception is
higher secondary education (HSS, Grades 11-12) where 50 percent of the students are in private institutions .
The FYP-11 expansion plan to boost student numbers will require more intensive collaboration with the
private sector and attention to school mapping to attenuate the existing inequitable pattern of participation
in secondary education.

There is a growing role of private institutions and financing in the tertiary sub-sector. FYP-11
expansion plans for tertiary education are ambitious but essential for Bhutan to build up a human resource
base to support a knowledge-based economy. Student intake is to increase to 15,000 (from just over 5,000
currently). To keep this from overburdening public expenditures, a greater role for the private sector is seen,
but this raises new issues of quality and relevance. Since it will take the Education City some years to become
operational, the Royal University of Bhutan (RUB) is the main reference point for the quality assurance and
accreditation framework.

RGoB’s recent decisions at the tertiary level are to adopt a sin gle quality assurance model for both
public and private tertiary institutions. This would involve endorsement of “accreditation” as the mode of
quality assurance (as distinct from solely “audit” or “assessment”); and structure the QAA implementation
procedures in three tiers, whereby “accreditation” is the third tier, preceded by registration and licensing of
institutions (tier one) and self-appraisal and peer review (tier two).

Social Protection
There is no formal system of social protection in Bhutan. The lack of safety nets particularly for those
outside of public sector jobs leaves the majority of the population vulnerable to shocks and risk. Employment
opportunities for youth are limited, particularly at higher level managerial jobs (skills and job mismatch in
market). The change in social structures and rapid urbanization is likely to leave many elderly rural poor
without informal or social safety nets.


The coverage of Bhutan’s pension system is limited to civil servants and joint -sector companies. These
groups encompass little under 7 percent of the population in 2012. In addition, the armed forces are covered
under a separate scheme. The participation in National Pensions and Provident Fund (NPPF) extends across
some part of the formal sector workforce beyond higher income groups and a similar proportion of the
elderly are receiving some benefits from the system. This influences the decisions of the young people of
Bhutan entering the labor market with a majority of youth focused on entering the limited opportunities in
the public sector.

Employability of Bhutanese youth is a key priority. Employment opportunities for youth are limited. This
includes particularly access to higher level managerial jobs due to a skills and job mismatch in the market.
Similar imbalances and mismatches exist due to individuals’ preference for jobs in urban areas, jobs that are
white-collar and jobs in the public sector. However, the number of these types of jobs is limited. In addition
to these relatively well-documented issues, there are indications that a number of other, less obvious but
nevertheless pressing challenges exist. In particular, informality and underemployment appear to be
widespread, especially in rural areas. Besides, chronic or long-term unemployment might be a problem at
least for certain parts of the Bhutanese labor force. The government target is to bring down the youth
unemployment rate from 7.3 percent in 2012 to 5.0 percent or less by the end of the next plan period (2013-
2018). Within this context, the Ministry of Labor and Human Resources (MOLHR) has decided to develop a
social protection strategy to provide more equity of social protection to those who work across different
sectors, and provide support to senior citizens outside of the formal sector.

There are some existing specialized grant programs such as scholarships, and welfare schemes
distributed by His Majesty the King, or a few NGOS, but few are integrated into social assistance, social
insurance or labor market program schemes. There is also little coordination across them. There is low
coverage of target groups as most of the poorest 20 percent have no social protection coverage. Other
support to the elderly only exists through family and social networks.

The World Bank is supporting the development of Social Protection and Labor Strategy, which includes
assistance to expand and improve the Bhutan Labor Force Survey as well as a pilot Computer Assisted
Personal Interviewing (CAPI).

Agriculture
Bhutan is predominantly an “agriculture-based society”. The agriculture sector is dominated by
smallholder subsistence farmers who occupy the majority of the arable land and produce most of the crop
and livestock products. As per the Labor Force Survey Report of the MoLHR, 2011, the agriculture sector
provides livelihood to 68.4 percent of the total population contributing to 14.3 percent of the total GDP.


While the contribution of the agriculture sector to GDP has been declining, it continues to be an
important sector. It is particularly important as a source of employment and reducing poverty. However, the
sector’s growth remained insufficient to adequately address poverty, and attain food security. Immigration
from rural to urban areas, particularly by youth and men looking for a more modern life style, has resulted in
the feminization of the agriculture sector particularly in the lagging areas.

A range of policies are needed to improve rural life and maintain rural population. Physical access to
rural areas and between rural areas and markets needs to be improved, while dispersed and small scale

production hinder adoption of good agriculture practices. Greater access to credit and technology is needed,
and sustainable approaches to pest and wild life encroachment are needed. Other issues include loss of
agriculture land for other development, lack of infrastructure such as irrigation, farm roads and post-harvest
storage, labor shortage, and the scarcity of existing market traders and wholesalers.

The agriculture sector contributes to implementation of FYP-11. To achieve eradication of national
poverty to less than 15 percent and rural poverty below 20 percent, the sector needs to grow at an annual
rate of 4 percent. FYP-11 is expected to adopt a multi-dimensional approach to develop the lagging regions.
To achieve this, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has a mandate to improve food security and
nutrition, improve rural livelihoods to overcome poverty, and sustainable management and utilization of
natural resources.

FYP-11 has 16 programs with total budget outlay of Nu. 13.65 billion (more than $200 million).
However, in FY 2013-14, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forest has an approved budget allocation of Nu. 2.96
billion (almost $50 million).

Environment and Cultural Heritage
Environmental conservation is a cornerstone of Bhutan’s unique development approach . Bhutan
remains endowed with dense and virtually untouched forests, abundant water resources and diverse wild
species. The country’s vast endowment reflects its commitment to maximizing Gross National Happiness.
Nevertheless, it confronts chronic pressures primarily related to land degradation and biodiversity loss due
to development and population growth. Land degradation can stem from inappropriate agriculture
production and mining practices, overgrazing, and excessive forest harvesting, as well as solid waste disposal
in and around population centers. Threats to biodiversity include illicit forest harvesting, human-wildlife
conflict, poaching, and habitat fragmentation arising from land development projects.
A particularly important element is the need for integrated water management. Despite the positive
outlook for water availability, incipient challenges relate to the sustainability of urban water supply systems
and functionality of existing rural water supply schemes. Ongoing soil erosion and deforestation threaten
watershed conditions and their functional integrity. Concerns on water quality stem from the rise in
domestic and industrial waste generation along with improper disposal as well as run-offs from agricultural
fields and urban centers.

The government has taken several important steps to preserve the environment. Bhutan’s environment
policies include: (i) mandating a minimum forest cover of 60 percent of the country’s total land area in the
Constitution; and (ii) increasing the proportion of land under protected area status to around 50 percent at
present from 26 percent in 2000. The Bhutan Trust Fund for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) is
working towards the adoption of more modern governance and business practices. With grants made
possible by BTFEC, conservation projects began to be implemented in the high altitude northern areas which
form part of the fragile eastern Himalayan ecosystem. The wildlife crime unit within the Department of
Forest and Park Services is in the process of upgrading the Bhutan Forest Enforcement Database into an
online reporting system on wildlife offenses by field offices and expanding programs for raising public
awareness and sensitivity to forest and wildlife crime. Environmental sustainability is at the core of Bhutan’s
Five-Year Plans, including the 11th Plan currently under implementation.

Bhutan has also taken steps to preserve its cultural heritage. Protection of its culture is one of the four
pillars of Bhutan’s unique GNH vision. It is also a key economic driver through the tourism i ndustry; as such
conservation of heritage monuments need to be prioritized in synergy with the development of urban
infrastructure and services.

The World Bank will assist the Royal Government of Bhutan to implement the Heritage Sites Bill with
a focus on improving the living conditions and economic opportunities of the poorest communities in the
country, which tend to live in traditional houses and villages across the country.

Disaster Risk Management
Bhutan is highly prone to disasters and climate related risks. Its rugged topography, geographic and
climatic features make it prone to flooding, landslides, glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), drought and
earthquakes. Over the past 40 years, several earthquakes above a magnitude of 6 on the Richter scale have
occurred. According to the World Bank report on Natural Disaster Hotspots (2005), 31.3 percent of Bhutan is
in risk areas, and 60.8 percent of population is at high mortality risk from multiple hazards.

The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events appears to be increasing. The country has
become increasingly vulnerable to glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs), other flooding, drought, forest fires
and loss of vegetation/biodiversity. Heavy seasonal monsoon rains and glacial melt contribute to flooding and
landslides. Of the 2,674 glacial lakes that exist in Bhutan, 25 have been identified as potentially dangerous.
This poses not only a threat to the development of hydropower in the country but also a threat to food
security.

The government adopted the Disaster Management Act in 2013 to strengthen the disaster
management system. The Act decentralizes disaster management activities, empowers the nodal
institutions with the legal status to implement disaster reduction strategies and emphasizes a consultative
process at the village level. The Department of Disaster Management (DDM) under the Ministry of Home &
Cultural Affairs - the national coordinating agency - is formulating a comprehensive National Disaster Risk
Management Strategy for Bhutan. It is expected to result in the formation of a National Disaster Management
Authority (NDMA) under the leadership of the Prime Minister. Key challenges include (i) strengthening
preparedness and early warning systems: (ii) mainstreaming disaster risk management, including in
construction and (iii) strengthening disaster response capacity.

An important aspect of disaster risk mitigation, climate adaptation and early warning systems is
improved capacity for hydro meteorological monitoring and forecasting. Importance of hydromet
services is well recognized in FYP-11. In Bhutan, the main agency responsible for these services and for
weather, hydrological and flood forecasting is the Department of Hydromet Services (DHMS) under the
Ministry of Economic Affairs. DHMS was established in 2011. It is a relatively new agency in significant need
of capacity strengthening. At present, there is no legal or regulatory framework for delivering hydromet
services or a national framework for climate services. Most of the existing observation network is manual
with limited capacity for real time monitoring. Capacity for snow, permafrost and glacier monitoring within
DHMS is only now beginning. Bhutan at present features only 24-hour weather forecasts, therefore, there is a
need to improve the lead time to better prepare communities. Also, the current practice issues flood forecasts
only when the water level is high. While DHMS’s activities are being supported by several development
partners such as the U.N. Development Program and Japan International Cooperation Agency, there is
substantial room for strengthening DHMS to support its transformation into a modern service delivery
agency that can support disaster risk mitigation, and also provide climate services in various sectors such as
agriculture, water resources and hydropower.

Urban Development
Bhutan is undergoing a rapid transition from a rural economy to an urban society. The average annual
urban population growth rate has been around 4 percent since 2007. The Bhutan National Urban Strategy
(NUS, 2008) projects that by 2020, the country will be most likely 60 percent urbanized. As Bhutan evolves
into a more urbanized society, RGOB recognized the country’s unique challenges in urban development – (i)
the rapid rates of urbanization, and (ii) the limited availability of serviced land.

The urbanization rate across the country is skewed toward the Western region. Thimphu and
Phuentsholing are the two most favored destinations for migrants. These cities, especially Thimphu, are
experiencing urban sprawl and densification with consequent rise in demand for municipal services. Through
the enactment of the Local Government Act (2009) and the approval of the Municipal Finance Policy (2012),
the RGOB has established four autonomous cities (Thimphu, Phuentsholing, Gelephu and Samdrup-Jokhar).
Under the proposed National Urban System, these urban centers would play an important role as future
engines of growth.

Bhutan is relatively well-positioned to meet the challenge of rapid urbanization, given its low
population. Nevertheless, urban institutional and governance systems need to be strengthened. Spatial
planning is also needed, as lack of affordable and housing for lower-income groups is becoming a critical
issue. In this context, the Bank is supporting the RGoB through the Second Bhutan Urban Development
Project and its Additional Financing, which provides resources for sites and services development in northern
Thimphu and for municipal finance and management systems development in the four cities as well as for
related capacity building. Another important issue related to the rapid urbanization is to provide jobs for an
increasingly urban youth population.

Energy
Hydropower development has underpinned the rapid growth of Bhutan’s economy. The total installed
capacity of existing hydropower plants is 1,488 megawatts (MW). Of total annual power generated, 80
percent is exported to India after meeting domestic consumption. Power exports account for the largest
source of national revenue in the form of taxes and dividends, generating more than 40 percent of
government revenue. Power exports also contribute to 25 percent of gross domestic product (GDP), and
hydropower infrastructure development contributes another 25 percent of GDP through the construction
sector.

However, power generation can get disrupted during winter months. During wet seasons, existing
hydropower plants can generate sufficient electricity to meet domestic demands and power exports. Since all
the existing plants are run-of-the-river, the total generation capacity drastically drops to around 288 MW
during winter dry seasons (December–March). This low capacity does not meet the system peak demand
during winter. To deal with the seasonal power shortage, industrial loads have been curtailed during the
winter months. Winter power shortages will likely remain until 2016 when the Punatsangchhu-I hydropower
plant (1,200 MW) is expected to come online.

In 2008, Bhutan agreed to develop and export 10,000 MW of new capacity with India by 2020. Under
the bilateral framework, one project at Punatsangchhu (stage 1, 1,200 MW) has started construction and
contracts for two projects at Punatsangchhu (stage 2, 1,020 MW) and Mangdechhu (720 MW) have been
awarded. Seven other large hydropower projects are at various development stages with the Indian
government and its own enterprises.

In addition, small and medium sized hydropower operations are being developed as public–private
partnerships (PPPs). In 2008, the Asian Development Bank (ADB) agreed to finance the Dagachhu
hydropower project (126 MW) as the first PPP infrastructure in Bhutan. The project’s join t venture was
established between DGPC and India’s Tata Power Company. The Department of Hydropower and Power
Systems also intends to promote independent power producers (IPPs) as the next step after formulating rules
and guidelines required for IPPs.

The hydropower development will require extensive investments in power transmission. While these
transmission lines are expected to be developed and aligned with hydropower development, a holistic
development approach will be crucial for the network expansion to maximize the investment benefits and
minimize any adverse safeguard impacts on transmission corridors.

Bhutan has set an ambitious goal of providing electricity for all by 2015. Mountainous terrain and the
resultant difficulties of grid extension have kept some of the rural population without access to clean energy.
Traditional fuels, such as kerosene and fuel wood, cause indoor pollution and health burdens. To reduce
poverty and stimulate inclusive economic development, the government has embarked on a large-scale rural
electrification campaign. As of December 2012, 84 percent of households had access to electricity, supported
by the ADB and JICA. In addition to grid extension to rural areas, households in remote villages may have
access to electricity through standalone solar home systems.

Bhutan has also begun to develop renewable energy to diversify the energy supply base through wind,
solar, biomass, and small and micro hydropower. Wind power projects have the potential to generate clean
energy to supplement hydropower in winter dry seasons. Bhutan also has biogas development potential as an
alternative energy source to replace fuel wood for cooking in rural areas. Rural households depend heavily on

fuel wood, which emits indoor air pollutants and poses a health hazard. To promote renewable energy, a
national policy must be established and financial and fiscal incentives provided to help overcome the entry
and financial barriers for development.

Transportation
Transportation is the biggest infrastructure problem encountered by firms in Bhutan according to
Bhutan’s 2010 Investment Climate Assessment. In rural areas transport connectivity is also a key
determinant of affordable access to basic social and economic services. The Bhutan Living Standards Survey
(2012) reports that transportation services alone account for approximately 23 percent of the cost incurred
where households sought health care to address sickness or injury. In the broader economic context, roughly
40 percent of all firms and 70 percent of large firms surveyed had experienced losses due to ground
transportation difficulties.

Bhutan has achieved significant milestones in the transport sector. Investments under the 10th Five-Year
Plan (FYP-10) have helped increase connectivity towards the official goal of having 85 percent of the
population within half a day's walk from the nearest road. Parliament has also passed the Road Act in 2012
which empowers the Department of Roads to coordinate various institutions working in the roads sector.
These accomplishments show a strong Government commitment to developing Bhutan’s transport sector and
the institutions that will sustain it into the future. Recent achievements, supported by World Bank projects,
include: (i) 67 km of new roads, (ii) 24 km of improved roads; and (iii) seven newly constructed motorable
bridges. Project beneficiaries have experienced a 62 percent reduction in travel time to reach socio economic
facilities (schools, clinics, etc.).

Looking forward, Bhutan Transport 2040 envisages meeting increased demand for rural transport
with a dzongkhag road network that is 3.5 times its current length with connections to every geog. Achieving
such targets will require approximately 2,500km new roads. Bhutan Transport 2040 also targets major
investments such as (i) widening of the existing East –West Highway (and other key routes) to two lanes; (ii)
improving access routes between industrial centers and major border crossings; and (iii) improving various
existing alignments along the national highways network to improve safety and travel times.

Improving urban transport services is also a priority. The number of Bhutanese living in urban areas
nearly tripled between 1990 and 2010. Increasing rates of motor vehicle ownership and use have
accompanied this trend, bringing unprecedented impacts on the urban environment (many negative,
including emissions, congestion, noise, etc.). Bhutan’s urban transport systems are still developing to meet
increasing demand for urban mobility. Nevertheless, less than one third of urban households in Bhutan report
using public transport in a given month.

The Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) is pursuing a green transport and electric vehicles initiative
to promote improved urban mobility and reduced reliance on fossil fuels. The World Bank has been
requested to provide technical advice and analytical work to inform decisions taken to develop this
initiative. There are four components to this work as follows:

(i)     Technical advice on electronic vehicles initiative options, infrastructure, planning, as well as fiscal
        and trade impacts;
(ii)    Technical advice on enhancing the Thimphu city public transportation system;
(iii)   Knowledge sharing and partnerships to bring international experiences of electric vehicle and public
        transport programs to Bhutan; and
(iv)    A household survey on travel behavior, needs, and vehicle preferences in Thimphu.


Under the activity to improve the resilience and affordability of roads and bridges, a grant from the
Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and Recovery (GFDRR) has been applied to support Bhutan’s
Department of Roads with:




                                                      19

(i)     Developing and asset management system to track the condition and vulnerability of roads and
        bridges. This information would provide the basis for directing investments to strengthen resilience
        and optimize the lifecycle cost of road and bridge infrastructure; and

(ii)    Improving DOR’s capabilities on specific technical design topics through a knowledge exchange with
        Japan.


South-South Knowledge Exchange on urban public transport. This activity has also been seeking a grant
from the South-South Knowledge Exchange Trust Fund to bring knowledge of urban public transport
initiatives from Colombia, Ecuador, and China to Bhutan and Nepal. There are two key aims that this activity
would seek to achieve: (i) informing government stakeholders within non-technical institutions about what is
possible through improving urban public transport services and the institutions that provide them; and (ii)
increasing the operational knowledge and capacity of City Bus Company staff. The international knowledge
exchange would be particularly useful in this regard, given Latin America’s relatively extensive experience of
transformational bus initiatives.

Governance, Public Financial Management and Procurement
Bhutan outperforms its neighbors on Transparency International’s Corruption Perception Index. In
2012, Bhutan moved further up the index, from 38th to 33rd, in recognition of additional steps it has taken to
strengthen its anti-corruption legal framework, including passage of the 2011 Anti-Corruption Act, the
establishment of an Anti-Corruption Commission (ACC), and further strengthening of rules governing asset
declaration by public servants in 2012. In 2013, Bhutan has moved further up to be ranked 31. A key element
for improving governance has been an ambitious government-to-citizen program to provide services
electronically through community centers, which is particularly important in light of geographical barriers.
Similarly, with support from the IFC, the government has developed a government-to-business e-portal to
provide a comprehensive inventory of licenses and other information on business processes.

Public financial management (PFM) reforms are part of national priorities . Bhutan over the years has
been making progress in the area of accounting, budget execution oversight, control and reporting.
Parliamentarians increasingly pay attention to the budget approval process and also in reviewing the audit
observations through public accounts committee. The government continues to take steps to strengthen PFM
in the country. The public at large has also become more demanding in terms of transparent and efficient
government. Nevertheless, further improvement is needed on oversight of public sector entities,
predictability in funds available for expenditures, the quality and timeliness of budget reports and financial
statements, implementing the standards on auditing and accounting, PFM information systems, availability of
professionally qualified staff and effectiveness of internal audits. The Bank has provided an IDF Grant to help
the government in strengthening PFM in the public and private sectors in Bhutan by strengthening internal
audit in the public sector, assisting in the implementation of Bhutanese Accounting standards (BAS),
strengthening public accounting functions of RGoB, and supporting the RGoB in establishment of Bhutanese
Institute of Chartered Accountants.

Significant progress has been achieved on public procurement reforms. Among the outcomes are: (i) the
introduction of the procurement rules and regulations and standard Bidding Documents for Goods, Works
and Services in April 2009; (ii) the establishment of the Public Procurement Policy Division in August 2008;
(iii) the career path and recruitment tools put in place for a procurement profession; (iv) the generally well-
functioning procurement market; (v) a strong framework for control and audit, spearheaded by the Royal
Audit Authority and the Anti-Corruption Commission; (vi) set up of the Government Procurement and
Property Management Division to conduct centralized procurement of common items; and (vii) an
independent review body to handle procurement grievances has been constituted. Because of this progress,
the World Bank is moving towards use of country systems for all procurements up to the International
Competitive Bidding Thresholds in Bhutan from end FY 2014-15.The Alternative Dispute Resolution Act of
Bhutan, 2013 has come into being and formal arbitration expertise needs to be built in the country. In its
endeavor to professionalize the procurement function, Bhutan has enrolled more than 300 government staff
in the World Bank’s Certificate Program in Public Procurement.

The World Bank Program in Bhutan

The World Bank provides around $15-20 million of new IDA resources per year. There are four ongoing
specific investment operations for a net commitment of $82 million of IDA resources. These include three
country specific IDA operations – Decentralized Rural Development, Urban Development II, Remote Rural
Communities Development – and one regional IDA project – Regional Cooperation on Wildlife Protection – as
well as one GEF grant operation – Sustainable Financing for Biodiversity Conservation. In addition, the Bank
manages several small grants for Bhutan on Disaster Management, Corporate Governance, Public Financial
Management, Urban Budget Processes, and improving the resilience to Seismic Risk.

The World Bank has also extended three development policy operations over the last six years. The
most recent, Development Policy Credit-2 (DPC-2), was approved by the World Bank’s Board of Executive
Directors in November 2012 for a total of $36 million. This operation has focused on (i) Promoting
government efficiency and effectiveness through sound fiscal and public financial management and
procurement, and strong public administration; (ii) Fostering private-sector development by improving the
policy environment and facilitating productive employment opportunities; and (iii) Expanding access to
infrastructure in a sustainable manner.

The World Bank also provides support on knowledge. Recent analytic work includes an HD Public
Expenditure Review, a review of higher education, and an Investment Climate Assessment which served to
underpin the most recent budget support operation (DPC-2) to improve the policy framework governing
private sector development. A poverty assessment, Financial Sector Assessment and a green growth study are
underway.

The overarching goal of the new CPS (FY15-19) is to support Bhutan’s aspirations to achieve
sustainable and inclusive growth. The proposed CPS will be aligned with the government’s 11th Five-Year
Plan and will organize its activities under three results areas: (i) improving fiscal and spending efficiency, (ii)
increasing private sector growth and competitiveness, and (iii) supporting green development.

However, it is anticipated that many of the themes of the current CPS will continue to resonate. The bulk of
IDA financing is expected to continue in the form of development policy lending, supplemented by a limited
number of specific investments in key areas, particularly infrastructure, and a robust analytic program.

International Finance Corporation (IFC)
The IFC has a total committed investment portfolio in Bhutan of about $31 million. The portfolio
consists predominantly of IFC’s equity participation in Bhutan National Bank. The advisory portfolio includes
advice in structuring Public Private Partnerships (PPPs), improving Bhutan’s investment climate and
enhancing access to financial services.

The IFC successfully completed a PPP transaction advisory for the multi-level car park project with the
Thimphu Municipality. The project involves the development of two Multi-Level Car Parks (MLCPs) in order
to address the parking requirements in the core city area.

IFC is providing assistance to the development of the power sector in the country by particularly assisting the
Ministry of Economic Affairs and Druk Holding and Investments consider setting up a Power Trading
Company in India.

IFC continues to explore areas of assistance in hydropower, tourism, manufacturing, agribusiness, health and
education sectors among others. IFC’s advisory support on investment climate reforms, PPP development and
the financial sector is expected to continue.

Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency (MIGA)
Bhutan has taken the first step to becoming a member of MIGA by signing the MIGA Convention in
January 2013, which will be ratified by parliament in September 2013. In light of the newness of
membership there has been no guarantee to date.

 *As of Sept 2014

 Project Background:
 The Decentralized Rural Development Project (DRDP) was approved on March 1, 2005 for a credit of $7 million. Effective March 21, 2011
 under the Global Food Crisis Response Program (GFRP) Multi-Donor Trust Fund, a grant for $5 million was allocated to Bhutan as
 additional financing for the DRDP. The additional DRDP grant funds were to help finance the costs associated with scaled-up activities and
 to address the impact of the continuing high prices associated with essential food commodities. Due to significant exchange rate
 savings/gains the project was restructured and the closing date extended to December 31, 2014.



Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project development objective is to improve market access and increase agricultural output for rural communities in selected areas of
Bhutan. The project supports improvements/rehabilitation of rural infrastructure (rural roads and irrigation) and promotes extension
activities particularly for rice, maize and potato crops to address disease outbreaks and low productivity.
The DRDP Additional Financing supports three components. The first component focuses on the rehabilitation and construction of irrigation
canals and on the improvement of selected roads that support rice, potato and maize production areas. The second component helps farmers
improve production of rice and maize through demonstration, knowledge sharing, improved technologies and capacity building. Finally, the
third component focuses on institutional strengthening activities such as capacity-building at the local-level administration, for planning
aspects, and for the physical reporting of project implementation performance, to ensure the appropriate transfer of funds to the local level.
In addition, capacity building activities for pest surveillance, financial management, environmental and social screening will be supported.



 Results:

           The project is on course to achieving its targets in improving rural infrastructure (irrigation canals and farm roads) and food crop
            production (rice, maize and potato). To date the project has benefitted over 8,272 households (target 6,700 households) from
            improved infrastructure and over 8,703 households (target 8,500 households) through improved extension services.

           It has improved 43.95 km of farm roads, exceeding the end of project target of 15 km. Similarly, 256 km of irrigation canals have
            been rehabilitated, exceeding the target of 200 km.

           In the last cropping season Jan-Feb 2013, 111 tons of basic seeds of potatoes were produced. With the increase in number of
            contract farmers for seed production and also with the increase in National Seed Center (NSC) area for cultivation, the total basic
            seed production is expected to exceed the 700 metric ton target by the project closing date. . The adaptation rate for improved rice
            varieties is 45 percent against a project target of 25 percent. On the other hand, 27 metric tons of Green Leaf Spot (GLS) disease
            tolerant maize seeds were produced by community based seed production (CBSP) groups, resulting in 60 percent of GLS affected
            maize seeds being replaced. The target replacement rate for the project is 80 percent.

Project Background:
The Kingdom of Bhutan has experienced rapid social and economic development over the past two decades, and this socio-economic transition is
fueling rapid urbanization. Meeting the challenges of urban development, management and finance is now a key developmental agenda of the
Royal Government of Bhutan (RGOB) and its international development partners. The World Bank started its support with the Bhutan Urban
Development Project (1999-2006), which helped develop urban infrastructure systems in ten secondary towns. The RGOB showed strong interest
and appreciation of the Bank’s policy advice through the project and technical assistance to prepare the National Urbanizatio n Strategy (2008)
and the Thimphu City Development Strategy. On the RGOB side, the Local Government Act of 2009 and Municipal Finance Policy (2012) provide
the framework for the roles and responsibilities of urban local governments. In that context, the ongoing BUDP2 focuses on supporting
urban/municipal development in Thimphu (the capital and Bhutan’s largest city) and Phuentsholing (second largest city and a commercial hub)
as well as technical assistance for the urban local governments and the Ministry of Works and Human Settlement.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project development objectives are to (i) support Bhutan’s municipal reform program by strengthening municipal finance an d management
services in Thimphu and Phuentsholing; and (ii) improve infrastructure services in northern Thimphu where no formal services are currently
available.

The BUDP2 consist of three components: (i) municipal Finance and Management; (ii) Thimphu Northern Area Development; and (iii) Capacity
Building. Component 1 ($1.5 million) aims at strengthening the institutional systems of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes, or city
corporations. The support for the city-specific reforms is being done broadly through (i) strengthening the local revenue administration systems
and processes; and (ii) strengthening the expenditure management systems and financial managementsystems and processes of the two city
corporations. This component also supports Royal Government policy reforms aimed at setting up a policy framework for municipal financing.
Component 2 ($9.3 million) supports the development of basic infrastructure systems in two ‘local area plans’ in northern Thimphu, including
roads, stormwater drainage, water supply, sewerage and street lighting, as well as support for increase in low-income housing units in these
areas. Under component 3 ($1.2 million), resources are being provided for training programs, equipment, technical assistance, and studies based
on the needs of Thimphu and Phuentsholing Thromdes. It aims at significant upgrading of each city corporation’s capacities in various aspects of
their internal work processes and service delivery to citizens through training of operational staff and provision of relevant equipment.


Results: [Target Values at end of Project]
 Increase in local revenue collection: 50 percent by Thimphu and 40 percent by Phuentsoling.
 New building permits issued for serviced plots: 175 (in two Thimphu Local Area Plans being developed)
 Number of households with new piped water and sewerage connections: 600 (in two Thimphu Local Area Plans).
 Number of municipal staff trained: 250 (with 150 in Thimphu and 100 in Phuentsholing)

Project Background:
As development proceeds (eight percent average growth in the past three decades), Bhutan is facing pressures on its natural resources
stemming from population growth, agricultural modernization, hydropower and mineral development, industrialization, urbanization and
infrastructure development. In keeping with Bhutan’s enduring national commitment to protecting the environment, conservation is one of the
five main development objectives included in Bhutan’s 20-year perspective of development goals, Bhutan 2020: A Vision for Peace, Prosperity and
Happiness. However, conservation efforts have been challenged by an inadequate system of prioritizing the wide range of environmental needs,
weak institutions and capacity as well as limited financing. In recognition of the constraints, the government established the Bhutan Trust Fund
for Environmental Conservation (BTFEC) in 1992. A GEF grant of $10 million implemented during 1992-97 helped to create a permanent, well-
capitalized institution. In comparison to BTFEC’s notable growth in capital from bilateral donor contributions and careful m anagement of
investments, its grant-making performance has been modest and below its potential. With the socio-economic development needs of a
modernizing and growing population, especially with the advent of constitutional democracy in 2008, BTFEC’s challenge has become more
formidable. It needs to gain greater prominence, authority and credibility as an effective and reliable institution for sustained funding of
conservation activities and for setting annual conservation priorities.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project development objective is to improve the operational effectiveness and institutional sustainability of the Bhutan Trust Fund for
Environmental Conservation (BTFEC). The project components are: (i) enhancing the operations effectiveness and sustainability of the BTFEC;
(ii) improving conservation management of the high altitude northern areas landscape in Bhutan; and (iii) capacity building for mainstreaming
of conservation and sustainable forest and natural resource management approaches in national policies, strategies and plans. Progress is being
made towards the modernization of BTFEC through the finalization of draft bylaws for the Board’s approval, proposed addition of three non-
governmental members to the Board and ongoing revision of BTFEC’s operatio ns manual. Five grants for conservation activities in the high
altitude northern areas (HANAS) amounting to $1.5 million were approved by BTFEC’s Board in early 2014 and they are under imp lementation.



Results:
Despite having become effective only in November 2013, the project is making progress on key results indicators. This includes: (i) investments
towards enhanced protection in two protected areas that cover 1.1 million ha; (ii) increased disbursements of total financial resources for
activities approved by BTFEC; (iii) progress on the establishment of a M&E system that effectively monitors grant implementation.

 Project Background:
 The Remote Rural Communities Development Project (RRCDP) project area covers 26 geogs, or village administrative units, and six
 dzongkhags or districts, in southwestern and south central Bhutan. The RRCDP is designed to improve living conditions and incomes in the
 country's poorer and more remote rural areas. The populations in these areas currently rely on subsistence agriculture, and lack roads,
 irrigation, technologies, and community and social infrastructure that would allow them to improve their incomes and social integration.


 Project Development Objective and brief component description:
 The main objective of the project is to increase agriculture productivity in remote rural areas by improving access to markets, irrigation,
 agricultural technologies, and community infrastructure. Improvement in market access would be achieved by investments in farm roads
 and marketing infrastructure. Agricultural productivity and rural incomes would increase through promotion of improved irrigation and
 agronomic practices, and rehabilitation of productive assets for key commodities. Community-led investments will improve the access of
 the poorest people to the critical and missing infrastructure in the selected area. The RRCDP consists of three components:
  Rural Infrastructure: Connects the communities to larger roads and regional markets and to improve production potential through
 improved availability of irrigation.
  Community, Marketing and Productive Infrastructure: Covers investments in marketing and post-harvest infrastructure, critical community-
 level infrastructure, and investments identified by producers to increase agricultural productivity.
  Project Management and Institutional Strengthening: Supports project management, including the monitoring and evaluation functions. It
 covers: (a) technical and financial management, (b) procurement, and (c) supervision of compliance with environmental and social
 safeguards.


 Results:
 Rehabilitation of six kilometers of irrigation schemes has been completed, providing irrigation to six hectares of land.
 Seven cardamom propagation houses and one citrus propagation house were constructed.
 A design survey and cost estimates for four farm roads have started, and 15 community infrastructure subprojects have been identified for
support.

Project Background: Bhutan is highly prone to a range of hydro-meteorological hazards including glacier lake outburst floods (GLOFs), flash
floods, riverine floods, landslides, Landslide Dam Outburst Floods (LODF), cloud bursts, windstorms and river erosion. Flooding is a recurrent
phenomenon especially during the monsoon season. The country is also exposed to tropical cyclones such as the 2009 cyclone Aila that resulted in
damages to the economy of close to $17 million. Bhutan issues only 24 hour weather forecasts and does not have the capacity for issuing flood
forecasts. Also, there is significant need to develop climate services in important sectors such as agriculture and hydropower. The Royal
Government of Bhutan (RGoB) is in the process of modernizing its hydromet observation network, improving weather and flood forecasting
capacity, and strengthening community-based early warning systems. As part of its broader agenda to strengthen resilience to disasters and
climate change, the RGoB has requested technical assistance from the World Bank. In October 2013, a non-lending technical assistance (NLTAA)
was initiated to undertake a baseline assessment of the country’s existing observation network and forecasting, and to provide recommendations
for improving weather and climate services.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The main objective is to provide recommendations to the RGoB, in particular the Department of Hydromet Services (DHMS) under the Ministry of
Economic Affairs (MoEA), to modernize its hydro-meteorological observation network, improve weather and flood forecasting, and strengthen
early warning systems. This is being done in two components:
           Development of a roadmap for modernizing the country’s hydromet network and forecas ting capacity
          Development of recommendations for strengthening end-to-end early warning systems in two river basins Development of
           recommendations for improving delivery of meteorological and climate services in the agricultural sector.


Results:
 A draft roadmap has been prepared. Some of the main findings include the need for better glacier and snow monitoring, a strengthened data
infrastructure, and a legal framework for DHMS operations, as well as enhanced training and capacity in a number of technical areas.

Project Background:
Bhutan faces a set of challenges typical of countries seeking to make a rapid transition from a mostly rural, agrarian society to one characterized
by increasing levels of education, a large number of young people looking for more opportunities and, with increased globalization, shifting
expectations and aspirations on the part of its population. Strengthening of the banking sector is a key pre-requisite for fostering private sector-
led growth and poverty alleviation. The IFC’s landmark $28.5 million investment for a 20 percent stake in Bhutan National Bank (BNB) was its
first equity investment in the country. It also was the largest foreign investment in Bhutan to date.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
The project brings together IFC’s two pillars of investment and advisory services . IFC’s funding will help expand the bank’s outreach into the
underserved population of Bhutan. By capitalizing on BNB’s strong platform to reach underserved small and medium enterprises, the expected
improved access to finance will help address a key impediment to private sector competitiveness.



Expected Results:
The project will initiate and generate increased access to finance in Bhutan, a frontier market, with a sizeable underserved and rural population.
It also will provide BNB with access to international best practices in the areas of information technology, risk management, social and
environmental management and corporate governance.

 Project Background:
 The Amankora project involved the construction of five luxury guest-house type resorts at different locations in Bhutan. The project operates
 under the Amanresorts brand of hotels recognized in the tourism industry for its ability to create high-end resorts in unique/frontier
 destinations. The project is funded with a long-term loan of $10 million and an equity of $8 million.



 Project Development Objective and brief component description.

 The project contributes to the development of the tourism sector in Bhutan attracting private investment into Bhutan, such as higher end
 hotels. It also brings direct and indirect job creation, and supports the government's 'high value - low impact' approach to expanding the
 tourism sector by attracting high spending, environmentally conscious and culturally interested visitors. In addition, it transfers international
 best practices in hotel management, including service and quality standards, occupational health and safety, and environmental management to
 the emerging Bhutanese tourism industry. At the same time, the project generates revenue in U.S. dollars to reduce the risk of the India rupee
 dominating Bhutan's foreign exchange reserves, and it encourages utilization of a significant proportion of goods and services required by the
 resort guests from local sources, which will help develop the local supply base and encourage the growth of small and medium enterprises.




Results:
The construction of the five lodges has created more than 200 jobs and stimulated an arts community, as local craftspeople, artisans and
performers benefit from tourist spending.

 *As of June 30, 2014

 Project Background:
 According to Doing Business 2010, Bhutan’s ranking in ease of doing business and starting a business worsened from the previous year. The
 government then undertook reforms intended to improve efficiency of its services. The Economic Development Policy of 2010 set the goal of
 reducing the burden of compliance through elimination of overlapping approvals and streamlining requirements for business start-up and
 operations by 2011.

 As requsted by the government, IFC conducted an inventory of business licenses and identified 119 licenses issued by 29 agencies. The
 inventory also identified business entry constraints such as inefficient and cumbersome procedures related to ex-ante licenses, systemic
 shortcomings including gaps in the regulatory basis, duplication of information required by different issuing agencies, and poor access to
 information which affects both domestic and foreign investors.

 To improve business licensing in Bhutan, IFC designed this project to focus on the in-depth analysis of key technical licenses, bringing
 knowledge of good international practice and corresponding regulatory changes. In addition, the project covers system-wide reforms to
 introduce good practice in business licensing and to develop an electronic licensing e-portal containing information related to business
 licenses.


Project Development Objective and brief component description:
This project will help the Royal Government of Bhutan (RGoB) improve regulatory requirements underlying selected business licenses and
promote streamlining, and achieve at least 25 percent time savings to the private sector with a targeted 10 percent reduction in compliance
costs for entry licenses made more accessible through improved provision of information.
Components are:
Licensing Policy: Supports the government in adopting a licensing policy to apply international good practices in business licensing.
Information Access: Supports the government in improving information online (www.g2b.gov.bt) and at the issuing agencies’ offices.
Prirority License Reform:Identifies three priority licneses -- foreign direct investment (FDI) approval, project approval and environmental
clearance -- for in-depth reform.

The project has aimed to contribute to the following impacts by April, 2015 (i.e. three years after project completion)
•        USD 1 million compliance cost savings;
•        USD 10 million FDI facilitation.


 Results: G2B Licensing e-Portal developed and launched.

     FDI approval process and policy streamlined, making it significantly faster. For the priority sectors, the time reduction is from 213 days
      down to 10.5 days, with compliance cost savings of $1.07 million.
     Domestic project approval for medium and large businesses has been streamlined, making it faster and easier.
