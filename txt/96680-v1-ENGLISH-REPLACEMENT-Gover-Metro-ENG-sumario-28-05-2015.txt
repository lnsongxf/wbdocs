    Metropolitan Governance in Brazil



    Foreword

    In less than fifty years, Brazil evolved from a predominantly rural society and economy to a highly
    urbanized country in which 85 percent of its people now live in urban areas and more than 90 per-
    cent of the country’s GDP is generated in the cities. This rapid urbanization process was characte-
    rized by a lack of planning and an enduring framework of inequality, resulting in high degrees of
    concentrated poverty in the urban areas.

    Much of this urbanization has taken place in metropolitan regions (MRs). MRs have grown more
    rapidly than the rest of the country, both in population and in GDP terms. In 2010, per capita GDP
    was higher in MRs than in the rest of the country and metropolitan economies accounted for 70%
    of GDP. At the same time, half of the Brazilian poor and 90 percent of the people living in subnor-
    mal conditions were found in metropolitan regions.

    MRs present diverse realities. To begin, there are differences between core and peripheral areas in
    each region, with peripheral areas characterized by lower access to basic infrastructure and ser-
    vices, mobility, jobs, affordable land, and housing. There are also important differences between
    MRs, e.g in terms of scale and wealth. Over 19.7 million people lived in the São Paulo MR (one in
    ten Brazilians) while only 2.1 million people lived in the Belém MR. The São Paulo MR produces
    almost 1/5 of Brazil’s GDP and, in 2012, generated 1/4 of Brazil’s tax collection; in contrast, the
    Recife MR makes up 64% of Pernambuco’s GDP but represents only 1.6% of the Brazilian economy.
    Finally, there are large differences in the racial composition of the MRs with residents of the North
    and Northeastern cities of predominantly self-identifying as pardos (mixed origin) while residents
    of the South and Southeastern cities have larger populations that call themselves brancos (white).

    After years of discussion, the recent approval of a new framework for metropolitan governance in
    Brazil – the Statute of the Metropolis – creates the opportunity for debate and evolution regarding
    several key issues. These include: a) placing metropolitan matters at the forefront of the develo-
    pment arena in Brazil; b) reviewing what has been learned about inter-municipal governance and
    service delivery; c) estimating resource mobilization needs for metropolitan development; d) coor-
    dinating metropolitan land use with transport and housing; e) including metropolitan concerns in
    any revision of fiscal federalism; and f) promoting environmental sustainability, social inclusion
    and resilience to disasters and climate change plans at the metropolitan scale.

    The World Bank can be a partner in addressing these issues. In responding to Client demand, the
    Bank has been providing a range of support to Brazilian states and cities and especially their lo-
    w-income populations in the areas of infrastructure, social services, slum upgrading, institutional
    development, river basin management, local economic development, environmental protection,
    water and sanitation, and transportation. In the future, we hope that this support can increasingly
    be delivered at the metropolitan level and through metropolitan structures.

    This work is part of the Bank’s knowledge generation and dissemination agendas. It is aimed at
    enriching and building a discussion space among our nework of Clients and Partners.

     tructure or close to the core city. Lack of ade-
     quate land use planning and absence of pro-ac-
     tive slum prevention characterizes most of the
     MRs, especially in the periphery. Housing units
     have grown in areas with relatively poor infras-
     tructure, and slums have grown in the outskirts
     of metropolitan areas, aggravating mobility
     issues in already congested urban areas. This
     indicates the low elasticity of land supply for
     housing and shelter and shows the dynamics of
     the informal markets to answer a very clear de-
     mand for affordable land and shelter that is not
     adequately being addressed.

     Case Studies: São Paulo, Recife
     and Belo Horizonte

     Three selected case studies - São Paulo, Recife
     and Belo Horizonte - offer an in-depth, qua-
     litative look at metropolitan governance in
     Brazil and reflect the absence of a unique one-
     size-fits-all model of metropolitan governan-
     ce. The experiences show distinct approaches
     to metropolitan governance currently in place
     in these three MRs, which have taken an active
     role in shaping their institutional and policy
     structure. They exemplify the dynamism of
     metropolitan governance, whether led by the
     state or by municipalities, and offer an oppor-
     tunity to extract lessons that could be of use in
     other MRs. São Paulo presents a compelling
     case due to the sheer scale of its challenges,
     the number of metropolitan initiatives that
     have taken place, as well as its experimenta-
     tion with inter-municipal consortia and other
     forms of metropolitan governance. Recife’s
     historic legacy of metropolitan planning sheds
     light on innovative participatory planning ini-
     tiatives. Belo Horizonte is an interesting case
     study for demonstrating how civil society can
     contribute to metropolitan institutions.
