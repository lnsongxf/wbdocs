About Doing Business
The Doing Business project provides objective measures of business regulations and their enforcement across 190 economies and
selected cities at the subnational and regional level.

The Doing Business project, launched in 2002, looks at domestic small and medium-size companies and measures the regulations
applying to them through their life cycle.

Doing Business captures several important dimensions of the regulatory environment as it applies to local rms. It provides
quantitative indicators on regulation for starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering
property, getting credit, protecting minority investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts and resolving
insolvency. Doing Business also measures features of labor market regulation. Although Doing Business does not present rankings
of economies on the labor market regulation indicators or include the topic in the aggregate distance to frontier score or ranking on
the ease of doing business, it does present the data for these indicators.

By gathering and analyzing comprehensive quantitative data to compare business regulation environments across economies and
over time, Doing Business encourages economies to compete towards more e cient regulation; o ers measurable benchmarks for
reform; and serves as a resource for academics, journalists, private sector researchers and others interested in the business
climate of each economy.

In addition, Doing Business o ers detailed subnational reports, which exhaustively cover business regulation and reform in di erent
cities and regions within a nation. These reports provide data on the ease of doing business, rank each location, and recommend
reforms to improve performance in each of the indicator areas. Selected cities can compare their business regulations with other
cities in the economy or region and with the 190 economies that Doing Business has ranked.

The   rst Doing Business report, published in 2003, covered 5 indicator sets and 133 economies. This year’s report covers 11
indicator sets and 190 economies. Most indicator sets refer to a case scenario in the largest business city of each economy, except
for 11 economies that have a population of more than 100 million as of 2013 (Bangladesh, Brazil, China, India, Indonesia, Japan,
Mexico, Nigeria, Pakistan, the Russian Federation and the United States) where Doing Business, also collected data for the second
largest business city. The data for these 11 economies are a population-weighted average for the 2 largest business cities. The
project has bene ted from feedback from governments, academics, practitioners and reviewers. The initial goal remains: to provide
an objective basis for understanding and improving the regulatory environment for business around the world.                                     Page 2

The distance to frontier (DTF) measure shows the distance of each economy to the “frontier,” which represents the best
performance observed on each of the indicators across all economies in the Doing Business sample since 2005. An economy’s
distance to frontier is re ected on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the lowest performance and 100 represents the
frontier. The ease of doing business ranking ranges from 1 to 190. The ranking of 190 economies is determined by sorting the
aggregate distance to frontier scores, rounded to two decimals.

    Starting a Business
This topic measures the paid-in minimum capital requirement, number of procedures, time and cost for a small- to medium-sized
limited liability company to start up and formally operate in economy’s largest business city.

To make the data comparable across 190 economies, Doing Business uses a standardized business that is 100% domestically
owned, has start-up capital equivalent to 10 times income per capita, engages in general industrial or commercial activities and
employs between 10 and 50 people one month after the commencement of operations, all of whom are domestic nationals. Starting
a Business considers two types of local limited liability companies that are identical in all aspects, except that one company is owned
by 5 married women and the other by 5 married men. The distance to frontier score for each indicator is the average of the scores
obtained for each of the component indicators.


The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

      number, district number, and number of the court that issued the deed. It
      takes about a week to obtain a valid copy of the title deed.



      When the deed is lost, the owner must advertise the case through news
      paper or radio and then request from the court to issue a duplicate deed.
      Within 7 -- 10 days the court will issue a scanned copy of the deed without
      charges.

      Agency : Kabul Municipality

      It is possible to request and receive an inspection from the Municipality's
      Survey and Master Plan Department for the Sketch of the land plot (Koroki)
      at the same time as placing a request for a copy of the land deed.

      Agency : Kabul Municipality

      BuildCo must go to the municipality to check the Kabul Master Plan and to
      obtain a zoning approval. The master plan is 15 -- 20 years old and has not
      been recently updated. If everything is in order and BuildCo pays a bribe, it
      may receive the zoning approval in a couple of days. However, without
      paying a bribe, approval takes about a week.

  5   Obtain building permit from Kabul Municipality                                      300 days              USD 6,000
      Agency : Kabul Municipality

      BuildCo submits a copy of the title deed, the zoning approval, the building
      design(s), and proof of the employees' quali cations. If the property is inside
      the Kabul Master Plan, the designs are sent to the Engineering Department
      and a committee will approve them. BuildCo then pays the building permit
      fee. The municipality sends approval copies to various municipal
      departments (e.g. the police). The building permit fee is not standardized -
      the fees can vary from applicant to applicant.


      By paying bribes, BuildCo can obtain a building permit within a month of
      submitting an application. Without bribes, the application process takes
      more than one year.

      Agency : Kabul Municipality

      At the beginning of the construction work, an o cial from the Municipality
      District O ce and the Construction Control Department with the help of the
      district police will come to the construction site to verify the construction
      permit.


      If the builder has a permit, the company can continue their work; otherwise
      the project will be stopped and a bribe to both parties would allow the work
      to continue. Doing Business does not include these types of uno cial
      payments.

      Agency : Police

      On average, either the Kabul Municipality or its police department will visit
      the construction site every month (about six inspections for a 30-week
      project). Inspectors often demand bribes of AFN 5,000.00 to AFN 10,000.00
      for each visit. The Doing Business project, however, does not account for any
      of these informal payments.

      Agency : Central Authority for Water and Sewerage

      Water supplies in Afghanistan are obtained from ground water sources and
      manmade wells. So BuildCo must dig its own well.


      Normally builders drill up to 50 meters deep but it depends on the needs
      and willingness of the owner.

      The cost can range from USD 10 to USD 1,000 per meter depending on the
      quality of the soil (if there are lots of rocks, etc.).

      committee establishes the value of the land after an inspection of the
      property. The value is entered on the Circular Form and 1% on that is
      charged, to be paid at the bank. The Procedure also includes checking for

    Paying Taxes
This topic records the taxes and mandatory contributions that a medium-size company must pay or withhold in a given year, as well
as measures the administrative burden in paying taxes and contributions. The most recent round of data collection for the project
was completed on June 30, 2017 covering for the Paying Taxes indicator calendar year 2016 (January 1, 2016 – December 31, 2016).

Last year (Doing Business 2017) the scope of data collection was expanded to better understand the overall tax environment in an
economy. The questionnaire was expanded to include new questions on post- ling processes: VAT refund and tax audit. The data
shows where post ling processes and practices work e ciently and what drives the di erences in the overall tax compliance cost
across economies.

The new section covers both the legal framework and the administrative burden on businesses to comply with post ling processes.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of paying taxes is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores on the ease of
paying taxes. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for each of the four component indicators –
number of tax payments. time, total tax rate and post ling index – with a threshold and a nonlinear transformation applied to one of
the component indicators, the total tax rate. The nonlinear distance to frontier for the total tax rate is equal to the distance to
frontier for the total tax rate to the power of 0.8. The threshold is de ned as the total tax rate at the 15th percentile of the overall
distribution for all years included in the analysis up to and including Doing Business 2015, which is 26.1%. All economies with a total
tax rate below this threshold receive the same score as the economy at the threshold.

    Trading across Borders
Doing Business records the time and cost associated with the logistical process of exporting and importing goods. Doing Business
measures the time and cost (excluding tari s) associated with three sets of procedures—documentary compliance, border
compliance and domestic transport—within the overall process of exporting or importing a shipment of goods. The most recent
round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Given the importance of trade digitalization, in Doing Business 2018, the Trading across Borders questionnaire included research
questions on the availability and status of implementation of Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) and Single Window (SW) systems.
With this information, Doing Business built a comprehensive dataset on the adoption and level of sophistication of electronic
platforms in 190 economies. These data are not used to compute the distance to frontier score or ranking of the ease of doing
business. The new dataset on EDI and SW systems is available here.

Note: The ranking of economies on the ease of trading across borders is determined by sorting their distance to frontier scores for
trading across borders. These scores are the simple average of the distance to frontier scores for the time and cost for
documentary compliance and border compliance to export and import (domestic transport is not used for calculating the ranking).

    Enforcing Contracts
The enforcing contracts indicator measures the time and cost for resolving a commercial dispute through a local rst-instance
court, and the quality of judicial processes index, evaluating whether each economy has adopted a series of good practices that
promote quality and e ciency in the court system. The most recent round of data collection was completed in June 2017. See the
methodology for more information.

Cost required to enforce a contract through the               - The dispute concerns a lawful transaction between two businesses (Seller
courts (% of claim)                                           and Buyer), both located in the economy’s largest business city. For 11

                                                              - The buyer orders custom-made goods, then fails to pay.
  Court fees
                                                              - The value of the dispute is 200% of the income per capita or the

Quality of judicial processes index (0-18)                    - The seller sues the buyer before the court with jurisdiction over
                                                              commercial cases worth 200% of income per capita or $5,000.

                                                              - The seller requests a pretrial attachment to secure the claim.
  Case management (0-6)                                       - The dispute on the quality of the goods requires an expert opinion.
  Court automation (0-4)                                      - The judge decides in favor of the seller; there is no appeal.
  Alternative dispute resolution (0-3)                        - The seller enforces the judgment through a public sale of the buyer’s

    Resolving Insolvency
Doing Business studies the time, cost and outcome of insolvency proceedings involving domestic legal entities. These variables are
used to calculate the recovery rate, which is recorded as cents on the dollar recovered by secured creditors through reorganization,
liquidation or debt enforcement (foreclosure or receivership) proceedings. To determine the present value of the amount recovered
by creditors, Doing Business uses the lending rates from the International Monetary Fund, supplemented with data from central
banks and the Economist Intelligence Unit.

The most recent round of data collection for the project was completed in June 2017. See the methodology for more information.

Proceeding        foreclosure       Depending on the security, Mirage’s case may fall within the ambit of a Commercial
                                    Mortgage. In order for a mortgage to be considered commercial it must be made for
                                    commercial purposes (Article 697 of the Commercial Code). Article 706 provides the
                                    procedure to be adopted by Bizbank for the sale of the mortgaged hotel property in the
                                    event of default on loan payments by Mirage. To affect the sale of mortgaged property, the
                                    creditor shall request the relevant Commercial Court for permission to sell the mortgaged
                                    property. On receipt of such request the Court shall notify the debtor. Any objection from
                                    the debtor is required to be submitted within three days. Failing the receipt of objection
                                    from the debtor within three days, the Commercial Court may make a decision concerning
                                    the sale of the mortgaged property. The specific time and date of sale should be mentioned
                                    by the Court in its decision. Furthermore, the decision should unambiguously state that the
                                    decision of the Court shall be considered to be final if the creditor fails to object to such
                                    decision within three days. In case objections are received from the creditor, the Court has
                                    within 8 days of the date of receipt of objections to hear such objections prior to ruling on
                                    the matter.

Outcome           piecemeal sale    After the Court's decision, BizBank would gain possession of Mirage's assets secured by the
                                    mortgage and sell them. After the sale, the business will lose its assets and will not be able to
                                    continue operating.

Time (in years)   2.0               It takes 2 years from Mirage's default until BizBank is repaid some of the money owed to it. It
                                    usually takes about 3 months for Mirage to initiate foreclosure through the Court and
                                    informs all the parties about the foreclosure through a publication in a newspaper. The
                                    delay in the completion of foreclosure proceeding is caused by the inefficiency of court
                                    which takes about a year to make a decision on the case.

Cost (% of        25.0              The costs associated with the case would amount to approximately 25% of the value of the
estate)                             debtor's estate. Cost incurred during the entire insolvency process mainly include court or
                                    government agency fees (10%), attorney fees (12%), costs of notification and publication
                                    (1%), fees of accountants, assessors, inspectors and other professionals (1%), and fees of
                                    auctioneers (1%).
