THE BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT
For policy makers trying to improve their economy’s
regulatory environment for business, a good place to start     ECONOMY OVERVIEW

environment in other economies. Doing Business provides

The aggregate ranking on the ease of doing business
benchmarks each economy’s performance on the
indicators against that of all other economies in the Doing
Business sample (figure 1.1). While this ranking tells much
about the business environment in an economy, it does
not tell the whole story. The ranking on the ease of doing
business, and the underlying indicators, do not measure all
aspects of the business environment that matter to firms
and investors or that affect the competitiveness of the
economy. Still, a high ranking does mean that the
government has created a regulatory environment
conducive to operating a business.

Note: The rankings are benchmarked to June 2014 and based on the average of each economy’s distance to frontier (DTF) scores

regulatory practice, showing the absolute distance to the best performance in each Doing Business indicator. An economy’s
distance to frontier score is indicated on a scale from 0 to 100, where 0 represents the worst performance and 100 the frontier.

factors as data corrections and changes to the methodology. Trading across borders deflated and non-deflated values are identical in
DB2015 because it is defined as the base year for the deflator. The best performer on time for paying taxes is defined as the lowest time
recorded among all economies in the DB2015 sample that levy the 3 major taxes: profit tax, labor taxes and mandatory contributions, and
VAT or sales tax. If an economy has no laws or regulations covering a specific area—for example, insolvency—it receives a “no practice”
mark. Similarly, an economy receives a “no practice” or “not possible” mark if regulation exists but is never used in practice or if a
competing regulation prohibits such practice. Either way, a “no practice” mark puts the economy at the bottom of the ranking on the
relevant indicator.
* Two or more economies share the top ranking on this indicator. A number shown in place of an economy’s name indicates the number

“standardized company”) used by Doing Business in
collecting the data (see the section in this chapter on
what the indicators measure).

      called DUE (Documento Unico Electronico). The PAE will then send the

      deed, he sends an electronic communication to the tax administration
      agency asking for the provisional Tax Number (CIF) for the new
      company. The notary also sends the public deed for registration with
      the commercial registry. Once the company is registered with the
      commercial registry, the registry communicates the registration of the
      deed to the tax administration and asks for the definitive tax number
      for the company again by electronic means through CIRCE. Finally,                       see procedure

        For any kind of electrical project an administrative authorization has to
        be obtained from the DIRECCIÓN GENERAL DE INDUSTRIA, ENERGÍA Y
        MINAS. The engineer in charge of preparing the electrical plans submits
        a project plan to the Dirección General for approval. The Dirección
        General will review the documents to establish if the project complies
        with the relevant standards. The project is not inspected for the purpose
        of the approval (Iberdrola will later on do an inspection to ensure that
        the project has been realized according to the plans approved by the
        Dirección General).



   1    For an installation project in low or medium voltage different types of    30 calendar days           EUR 1,100
        approvals exist. An installation project that involves a medium voltage
        connection has to be registered directly with the Dirección General and
        the cost for the procedure is approximately EUR 1,100. For an installation
        involving a low voltage connection, customers usually contract a private
        firm that deals with the administrative procedure for them. This private
        firm will also inspect the installation before submitting the project for
        approval. This leads to a higher cost of approximately EUR 1,600.

      General.

      Iberdrola will prepare an estimate and inform the customer with a letter

      Customers have two choices: The external connection works can be done
      by Iberdrola or the customer can hire a private licensed electrical
      constructor.

      Two cases are considered equally likely for a customer with a load of
      140kVA: Iberdrola's distribution network allows for connections of up to
      160kVA at the low-voltage level. If the area where the new connection is 55 calendar days       EUR 46,000

      done has enough spare capacity the connection can be done to the low
      voltage lines. In some cases two connections are done for one customer
      to avoid that a new transformer station has to be installed. If no spare
      capacity exists, Iberdrola will connect the new customer to the medium
      voltage grid which will increase the connection costs for the customer. A
      transformer station will have to be installed in these cases and the
      station remains in the possession of the customer given that he pays for
      it in its entirety. Iberdrola considers the transformer part of the internal
      wiring installations of the client.

       Notary requests property information from the Property Registry

       According to the law (Art. 175 of the Decree dated on June 2, 1944), the
       notary is obliged to duly inform the parties, be aware of the ownership
       and encumbrances on the property, and consult the Property Registry
       books before executing the deed. Since the early 2000, the consultations
       can be done on-line at www.registradores.org and the printout from the
       internet is valid.

       This document is an “Informative Land Registry Extract” containing the
       same information as an Ownership and encumbrances Certificate, and
       bearing the same responsibility of the Registrar in case of mistake as a
       formal certificate would provide. This is an information product
       specifically foreseen by the Mortgage Law to answer the Notary's
       requests of Information related to registrable acts and contracts. The
       Notary submits an electronic request and receives the information also           1 day
   1   by electronic means. From that moment and for the next ten days, the         (simultaneous        EUR 9
       Registrar must inform the Notary about any Document submitted to the with procedure 2)
       Land Registry related to the same property, within the maximum term of
       24 hours since such document was submitted to the Land Registry
       Office. This procedure is aimed at preventing any surprises or
       unexpected situations while the contract is being formalised. This
       scheme is supplemented with the electronic submission to the Registry
       of a Notarial Attestation covering the essential features of the contract in
       relation to which the Information was requested, sent by the Notary by
       electronic means at the time of the document’s signature, in order to
       secure the priority of that document right after being signed.
       Since June 2011, the information from the Land Registry is also available
       in English. Translations come at an additional fee of EUR 20 and take up
       to 4 days.

      First transfers of property or transfers made between entrepreneurs are
      subject to VAT (down to 4% from the previous 8% rate, according to
      Royal Decree-Law 9/2011 of August 19, 2011) and Stamp Duty (0.5-1.0%
      of the property value, depending on the autonomous region -- it is 1.5%
      in Madrid). Second and subsequent property transfers are not subject to
      VAT, but to the Transfer Tax ("Impuesto sobre Transmisiones
      Patrimoniales y Actos Jurídicos Documentados", ITP). The rate of the
      transfer tax is 6% to 10% depending on the autonomous region of Spain
      (in Madrid, it is 6% of the property value). For the Doing Business case
      study, as it is assumed that the buyer is a company and the property is in
      Madrid and has been transferred at least once in the past, the applicable
      tax should be the Transfer Tax (ITP). The ITP is paid at the relevant tax
      office within 30 working days after the date of granting of the notarial
      deed of transfer (a copy of the transfer deed is to be attached to the
      transfer tax liquidation form). In many cities without a specific tax office, Less than a day

      it has to be noted that under certain circumstances (e.g., that the
      acquisition of the property is within the scope of the usual activities of
      the acquiring company), the acquiring company can choose to make the
      transaction subject to transfer tax or VAT. In the case the company chose
      to have VAT apply, it would be charged an 8% VAT rate on the sale price,
      plus a stamp duty of 1.5% . The VAT paid would become a credit that
      the company would deduct fromsubsequent transactions, such as those
      related to the normal business of the company. Note: VAT rates were
      increased by Law 26/2009 of 23rd December, on Estate General Budgets
      for 2010. By this law, as from the 1st of July 2010, the general rate
      increased from 16% to 18%.

                    Spain amended its regulations governing insolvency
DB2011              proceedings with the aim of reducing the cost and time. The
                    new regulations also introduced out-of-court workouts.
                    Spain strengthened its insolvency process by making workouts
                    easier, offering more protections for refinancing agreements,
                    allowing conversion from reorganization into liquidation at
DB2013              any time, allowing reliefs of the stay under certain
                    circumstances and permitting the judge to determine whether
                    an asset of the insolvent company is necessary for its
                    continued operation.
                    Spain made resolving insolvency easier by introducing new
                    rules for out-of-court restructuring, introducing provisions
