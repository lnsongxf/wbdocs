This Rapid Flood Damage and Needs Assessment (RFDNA)
report was prepared by the Government of Vietnam (GoV) with
technical contributions from the World Bank task team and
support from the Global Facility for Disaster Reduction and
Recovery (GFDRR). This report has benefitted from the guidance,
coordination, and logistical and technical input provided by
officials in Binh Dinh, Ha Tinh, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, and
Quang Ngai provinces and other stakeholders and many central
government ministries, including the Ministry of Planning
and Investment (MPI), the National Disaster Management
Office (NDMO) under the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
Development (MARD) and the Ministry of Natural Resources and
Environment (MoNRE), the Office of Government (OOG), the
State Bank of Vietnam (SBV), the Ministry of Transport (MoT),
and the Ministry of Finance (MoF).

The assessment team visited Binh Dinh and Phu Yen provinces on
February 12 –15, 2017, to gain a firsthand understanding of the
scale of the damage and to develop a recovery and reconstruction
plan. The team would like to acknowledge the generous support
offered by the provinces and line ministries in assisting the team
in the field, as well as in Hanoi during the assessment.

FOREWORD

Between mid-October and the end of December 2016, a combination of tropical
depressions and the North-Eastern Monsoon produced very heavy rainfall and five
consecutive periods of flooding, which significantly affected the people and economies
of eighteen provinces in central Vietnam (North Central, South Central Coast, and the
Central Highland regions). The preparedness and timely action to the warning of the
floods from the central government, affected provinces, and communes resulted in
minimum casualties.

This report – Rapid Flood Damage and Needs Assessment, Vietnam 2016 – lays
the groundwork for the effective recovery from flood impacts in the five priority
provinces of Ha Tinh, Quang Ngai, Binh Dinh, Phu Yen and Ninh Thuan. Both the central
government and provinces of Vietnam recognize the necessity to continuously improve
on disaster risk reduction and management capabilities and aim to rebuild a more
resilient future for its citizens.

Presently, we need to immediately start restoring access to services and infrastructure
as quickly as possible, incorporating “build back better” components into the
reconstruction efforts. This report provides a detailed breakdown of the key affected
sectors, the extent of damages sustained, the reconstruction/recovery needs, and the
recovery strategy. We are committed to integrating disaster risk management within
every development initiative to minimize future risks in the country.

        EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE EVENT
From the middle of October until the end of December of 2016, very heavy rainfall caused by a combination of
tropical depressions and the North-Eastern monsoon produced five consecutive periods of flooding in eighteen
provinces in central Vietnam (North Central, South Central Coast, and the Central Highland regions), significantly
affecting their people and economies.

The total rainfall on average over a two-month period reached up to 2,000 millimeters, with peaks in Quang Nam
(2,611 millimeters), Quang Ngai (2,729 millimeters), and Binh Dinh (2,417 millimeters). The 2016 floods were rare
events; while rainfall-induced flooding occurs annually in these regions, they are seldom so frequent and so late in
the year. During the two months, new floods would occur in the low-lying areas of the South Central Coast regions
while the regions were still feeling effects from the previous ones, thus exacerbating their impacts. As irrigation
and hydropower reservoirs in all affected regions reached their maximum capacities, a series of controlled water
discharges further intensified the effects.



                        FIVE CONSECUTIVE PERIODS OF FLOODING:
                        October-December 2016
                        RAINFALL ON AVERAGE OVER A TWO-MONTH PERIOD:
                        Up to 2,000 millimeters

    Damage and Losses
    OVERVIEW
    The six provinces most affected by the floods were Binh Dinh, Quang Ngai Nghe An, Phu Yen, Quang Binh, and
    Ha Tinh. The following are all eighteen provinces affected and the dates they were affected:

        ■	 Nghe An,Thu Thien Hue, and provinces in between, October 13–18
        ■	 Ha Tinh, Phu Yen, and provinces in between and the Central Highland provinces, October 30–November 7
        ■	 Thua Thien Hue, Binh Dinh, and provinces in between, November 29–December 4
        ■	 South Central and Central Highland provinces (Thua Thien Hue, Ninh Thuan, and provinces in
           between), December 5–9
        ■	 Central and Central Highland provinces (Quang Nam, Quang Ngai, Bình Dịnh, Phu Yen, and Gia Lai),
           December 12–18

    Approximately 10 to 30 percent of the people in each province were affected, with over one million temporarily
    displaced and in need of recovery assistance. On October 15, 2016, the Government of Vietnam (GoV) declared a
    state of emergency, and in December 2016, the government’s Central Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and
    Control (CCNDPC) and the United Nations reported the total damage and loss from all five floods in the eighteen
    provinces:

        ■■ Human impact: 134 dead or missing and 151 injured
        ■■ Housing: 233,271 houses flooded (with water rising above one meter in 163,682) and 4,093 damaged or
           collapsed
        ■■ Crops: 53,247 hectares of rice damaged and 23,294 hectares of perennial crops and 44,437 hectares of
           vegetables submerged
        ■■ Livestock: 18,371 cattle and 1,218,449 poultry killed
        ■■ Infrastructure: 1,782 kilometers of roads damaged or eroded and 585 bridges or culverts and 60
           kilometers of dikes damaged
        ■■ Estimated economic loss (in Vietnamese dong): VND 10,520 billion (approximately US$460 million)

PER PROVINCE
Of the four provinces that came under review for this report, the rapid assessment showed the most severely
affected was Binh Dinh, followed by Quang Ngai, Phu Yen, and Ninh Thuan. Table A1.1 summarizes the estimated
damage and losses1 to each province, in Vietnamese dong (VND) and U.S. dollars. The sectors covered under this
rapid assessment are Housing, Agriculture, Livestock, Fishery, Irrigation & Flood Control and Road Transportation
Sectors.

Subsequently, GoV requested that Ha Tinh province be covered under this project assessment. Because the time to
collect information on damage and reconstruction needs for Ha Tinh was extremely short, the report for Ha Tinh
province is mainly on the flood protection and irrigation sector, with disaster effects summarized in table A1.2.

    Vietnam’s transportation infrastructure was extensively damaged by the flooding and landslides. As reported, the
    five floods during October–December 2016 caused heavy damage to the transportation infrastructure, mostly roads
    and bridges, in the eighteen provinces. After overtopping and/or breaching the riverbanks and dikes, flood flows
    from various rivers inundated the surrounding areas, including the roads, and in many places washed away portions
    of road, eroded the road pavement and embankments, and destroyed or damaged many bridges. In hilly terrains,
    the heavy rainfall caused landslides that blocked and damaged the roads. Heavy surface water flow down the steep
    slopes caused erosion of road foundations, leading to failure of the pavement. Flooding and landslides had a major
    impact on road connectivity.




8   |     VIETNAM 2016: RAPID FLOOD DAMAGE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT
In the four provinces considered to have suffered most from the flooding—Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, and
Quang Ngai—the transportation sector alone accounted for about 54 percent of the total damage, which was mainly
concentrated in Binh Dinh province; damage to transportation there represented nearly 55 percent of the damage
in that sector in the four provinces. The flooding and landslides cut off access to essential services, with destroyed
bridges blocking access even to foot traffic—the most basic mode of transportation. Road infrastructure remains
vulnerable to further damage and failure until permanent repair works (including the strengthening and raising
of riverbanks and dikes) can be completed. The disaster worsened already poor accessibility in the rural areas.
The lack of access on the road network restricts the delivery of emergency supplies and will continue to hamper
recovery efforts for the most severely affected communities. The rapid assessment estimates total damage in the
transportation sector in the selected four provinces at US$70 million, for which the recovery and reconstruction
needs approximate US$143 million, including the cost of a more resilient standard structure.

The irrigation infrastructure sector (including flood prevention and control) in the affected provinces also
experienced great damage. The damages caused to flood embankments and dikes, riverbank erosion protection
works, irrigation infrastructure (e.g. canals and canal structures, temporary raised dams, barrage, and access
to roads to irrigation headwork, and drainage culverts and sluices), and water supply schemes, with most of
the damages occurring to dikes, riverbanks, and irrigation canals wide-spread largely in rural areas where are
most vulnerable to natural disasters.. Rural areas suffered major impacts, with damage occurring to dikes and
embankments, riverbank protection works, irrigation canals, diversion dams, roads, bridges, culverts, and so on. All
damaged schemes and infrastructure identified here are public investments.

The reported damage in this sector in Binh Dinh province exceeded that of the other provinces included in the rapid
assessment, as the assessment team observed during the field mission. For the four sectors, the estimated direct
damage for Binh Dinh was twice as high as for the other three provinces (see table A1.1).

At the time of the assessment, provincial governments had, with the assistance of the central government, undertaken
temporary restoration measures, such as the initial and/or partial closing of breaches, the strengthening of critical
bunds and revetments, and so on. Many of these works require immediate attention, with permanent measures taken
to lessen the chances of further losses and/or damage in the near future. This is particularly urgent with the approach of
the annual monsoon season, when Vietnam is exposed to cyclonic storms and heavy rain. Given the frequency of severe
events in Vietnam, completing the repair and strengthening of damaged infrastructure immediately is vital.

The total cost of damage to infrastructure, including dikes and embankments, irrigation canals, and other
infrastructure in the five provinces under review in this report is estimated at US$113 million. The aggregate cost of
reconstruction with improved design standards for flood control and irrigation infrastructure in the five provinces
that are the focus of the reconstruction project is estimated at US$200 million, with approximately half that total
required by Binh Dinh province.

     Government’s Response
     In the face of the 2016 floods in Vietnam, the country’s central government acted promptly, according to prearranged
     response plans. Warnings and operational directives disseminated via the media (TV and radio) guided the
     preparedness and response efforts.

     At the provincial level, the Provincial Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (PCNDPC) instructed
     the districts, communes and line provincial departments to implement the pre-agreed response plan. The PCNDPC
     was on standby every day around the clock, collecting and disseminating information on the flood situations. For
     the response, the provincial authorities deployed human resources, devices, materials, equipment, water and food,
     preventive medicines, and other necessities.

     Other actions taken by the provincial-, district- and commune-level committees included operating the reservoirs
     according to the pre-agreed procedures, with the result that no major incidents took place; guiding traffic to avoid
     areas with collapsed bridges, landslides, and flooded roads, which ensured safety; and promptly evacuating people
     living in the severely affected areas to safe places. As of the end of December 2016, all evacuated people had returned
     to their houses or were living with relatives. The media provided constant updates on the situation and disseminated
     instructions from the Committees for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control for the residents affected by the event.

     Each year, the provincial authorities set aside contingency budgets, comprising 3 to 5 percent of their annual
     budgets, to be used to support relief and emergency operations immediately following a natural disaster. These funds
     allowed the quick mobilization of relief items, such as food and water, seeds for replanting, livestock, and search and
     rescue equipment, and they paid for temporary measures, such as sandbags for breached riverbanks and temporary
     shelters, to be put into place.

     Following natural disasters, the provincial authorities in Vietnam also provide extraordinary financial support to
     social protection beneficiaries—that is, to people affected by the events. In Binh Dinh, for example, the 2016 events
     prompted the provincial authorities to provide compensation in the following amounts:

          ■■ VND 4.5 million per person for loss of life
          ■■ VND 1.5 million per seriously injured person
          ■■ VND 50 million per destroyed house that could be rebuilt on the same plot
          ■■ VND 100 million per house that was washed away and needed to be relocated due to the vulnerability of the
             original plot to future events, with one alternate land plot granted without a land use fee

     The provincial militaries supported the affected households by helping clean up inundated houses and erecting
     temporary shelters for those who could not go back to their homes. Temporary dikes were also erected, allowing the
     winter–spring crops to be planted. Contaminated wells were treated, and schools were cleaned up so children could
     resume their educations. Electricity was restored to most of the affected areas.

           1. INTRODUCTION

1.1 Vietnam: Brief Overview of Vulnerabilities to 		
Natural Disasters
Of the countries in the East Asia and Pacific region, Vietnam is among those at highest risk from natural disasters, with
floods, droughts, severe storms, landslides, and forest fires having substantial economic and human impacts annually.
Over the past two decades, natural disasters in Vietnam have caused more than 13,000 deaths and property damage in
excess of US$6.4 billion, valued at an annual average of about 1 percent of gross domestic product (GDP).2

While an upward trend in economic impact is probably in part the result of increased exposure associated
with economic growth, climate change will also likely exacerbate the impacts from these hazards, as hydro-
meteorological events increase in frequency and intensity. Of a total population of 90 million,3 an estimated 70
percent live in low-lying areas close to Vietnam’s coastline, which extends for approximately 3,200 kilometers and is
vulnerable to hydro-meteorological disasters, such as floods and storm surges and windstorms generated by tropical
cyclones.4 Vietnam is likely to incur, on average, US$1.4 billion (VND 30.2 trillion) per year in direct damage due to
floods, typhoons, and earthquakes. In the next 50 years, it has a 40 percent chance of experiencing economic loss
exceeding VND 141.2 trillion (US$6.7 billion) and a 20 percent chance of experiencing loss exceeding VND 171.2
trillion (US$8.1 billion).5 The poor and extreme poor, including ethnic minorities, are particularly vulnerable to
economic shocks, including from disasters, weather extremes, and climate variability.

     Vietnam has a tropical climate. The rainy season normally lasts from May to September in the northern regions and
     from September to early December in the central and southern regions, during which time heavy rain increases the
     risk of floods. In the past ten years, severe floods have affected the country almost annually, particularly in the central
     regions. In September 2009, Tropical Cyclone Ketsana and the depression associated with it brought heavy rain to
     Cambodia, Lao, and Vietnam, affecting millions. Even though the cyclone did not make landfall, the associated rainfall
     greatly affected the Central Region of Vietnam. Floods resulted in 163 fatalities and an estimated US$800 million in
     damage to the infrastructure, production, and social sectors, with an impact on GDP amounting to 2.9 percent. Since
     then, severe floods have affected the region almost annually, with major impacts observed in 2012 and 2013.

     While the Central Region is heavily exposed to storms and floods, some areas are also vulnerable to droughts.
     Approximately 2 million people living in the Central Region were severely affected by the prolonged drought of 2015–
     2016 as a result of impact from the global El Nino. The 2015–2016 drought was among the most intense and long-lasting
     in the past 90 years. It severely affected rural livelihoods, damaging 60–90 percent of planted crops,6 affecting assets, and
     disrupting basic services.

     During the last three months of 2016, heavy rain caused five consecutive flooding events, affecting eighteen provinces
     in the Central Region. The intensity and, particularly, the frequency of floods in this time frame (see table 1.1 for the list
     of events) far exceeded what is expected under normal circumstances. The heavy rain and floods continued beyond the
     end of the rainy season, and irrigation and hydropower dams in affected areas reached maximum capacity, resulting in
     controlled water discharges that further intensified the flood impact downstream of the reservoirs.


     INSTITUTIONAL ARRANGEMENTS FOR DISASTER RISK MANAGEMENT
     IN VIETNAM
     Approved in 2007, Vietnam’s National Strategy for Natural Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation Towards
     2020 focuses mainly on reducing risk from water-related disasters. The strategy stipulates that national and local
     socioeconomic and sectoral development master plans must integrate natural disaster risk reduction measures,
     and it recommends the development of a catastrophe risk financing strategy.

     The Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control, enacted in 2014, defines the institutional arrangements for
     the disaster-related agencies, including their responsibilities and coordination mechanisms, from the central
     to the local levels. This legislation covers nineteen disaster types. Along with the National Strategy for Natural
     Disaster Prevention, Response and Mitigation, Vietnam has also set up a National Action Plan for Climate
     Change, as well as a national program to support community-based disaster risk management. Responsibility for
     disaster risk management lies with the Department of Disaster Prevention and Control (DDPC) and the Disaster
     Management Centre (DMC) under the Directorate of Water Resources of the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural
     Development (MARD). The Directorate of Water Resources also plays as a Standing Office of the Central Committee
     for Natural Disaster Prevention and Control (CCNDPC). As an ex-ante risk reduction measure, the government
     has been strategically relocating households living in vulnerable areas and had, as of 2014, relocated 71,413
     households from areas prone to flash floods and landslides.

     Following natural disasters, Vietnam has, for thirty years, been measuring damage and losses using a formal
     methodology called the Damage Assessment and Needs Assessment (DANA).7 This methodology was updated with
     technical assistance from the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in 2010. The communes provide
     damage reports that are then aggregated by the provinces according to a predefined list of damage categories.
     The Provincial People’s Committee (PPC) submits to MARD the compiled report, complete with the damage data
     collected and requests for assistance based on the needs assessment.

         Figure 1.2 shows the reported damage by province in US dollars by flood event period. During the two months of the
         disaster, new floods would occur in the low-lying areas of the South Central Coast region while the regions were still
         feeling effects from the previous ones, thus exacerbating their impacts.

         As of early February 2017, 134 people had died and approximately one million had been affected by the floods.9
         Preliminary reports from all eighteen provinces, collated by the United Nations based on GoV data in December
         2016, estimated a total of approximately US$460 million in direct damage and losses. Around 4,000 houses were
         destroyed, and the torrential rain and resulting floods washed away or eroded the foundations of roads and bridges,
         causing disruption to people’s lives. Irrigation structures and flood control facilities were severely damaged. Erosion
         of the riverbanks and damage to the embankments allowed flood water to gush over cultivated land and layers of silt
         to accumulate, affecting the production of cash and subsistence crops. More than one hundred thousand hectares
         of farmlands were reported as inundated and destroyed, and livestock and poultry were killed. It is understood that
         none of the public administrative buildings was affected by the floods. The GoV/UN joint report from December 2016
         summarized the total effects of the disaster on the eighteen provinces as follows:

           ■■ Human impact: 134 dead or missing and 151 injured
           ■■ Housing: 233,271 houses flooded (with water rising above one meter in 163,682) and 4,093 damaged or
              collapsed
           ■■ Crops: 53,247 hectares of rice damaged and 23,294 hectares of perennial crops and 44,437 hectares of
              vegetables submerged
           ■■ Livestock: 18,371 cattle and 1,218,449 poultry killed
           ■■ Infrastructure: 1,782 kilometers of roads damaged or eroded and 585 bridges or culverts and 60 kilometers of
              dikes damaged
           ■■ Estimated economic loss (in Vietnamese dong): VND 10,520 billion (approximately US$460 million)

GOVERNMENT RESPONSE
The central government acted promptly in the wake of the floods, according to the pre-arranged response plans
defined in the 2014 Law on Natural Disaster Prevention and Control. Warnings and operational directives
disseminated via the media (TV and radio) guided the preparedness and response efforts.

At the provincial level, the Provincial Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention of the Provincial People’s
Committee (PPC) instructed the local governments, departments, and sectors to implement the pre-agreed response
plan. The Steering Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention was on standby every day around the clock, collecting
and disseminating information on the flood situations. For the response, the provincial governments deployed
human resources, devices, materials, equipment, water and food, preventive medicines, and other necessities.

Other actions taken by the provincial district- and commune-level committees included operating the reservoirs
according to the pre-agreed procedures, with the result that no major incidents took place; guiding traffic to avoid
areas with collapsed bridges, landslides, and flooded roads, which ensured safety; and promptly evacuating people
living in the severely affected areas to safe places. As of the end of December 2016, all evacuated people had returned
to their houses or were living with relatives. The media provided constant updates on the situation and disseminated
instructions from the Committee for Natural Disaster Prevention for the residents affected by the event.

Each year, the provincial governments set aside contingency budgets, comprising 5 to 10 percent of their annual
budgets, to be used to support relief operations immediately following a natural disaster. These funds allowed the
quick mobilization of relief items, such as food and water, seeds for replanting, livestock, and search and rescue
equipment, and they paid for temporary measures, such as sandbags for breached riverbanks and temporary
shelters, to be put into place.

Following natural disasters, the provincial governments in Vietnam also provide extraordinary financial support to
social protection beneficiaries—that is, to people affected by the events. In Binh Dinh, for example, the 2016 events
prompted the provincial government to provide compensation in the following amounts:10

   ■■ VND 4.5 million per person for loss of life
   ■■ VND 1.5 million per seriously injured person
   ■■ VND 50 million per destroyed house that could be rebuilt on the same plot
   ■■ VND 100 million per house that was washed away and needed to be relocated due to the vulnerability of the
      original plot to future events, with one alternate land plot granted without a land use fee

The provincial w supported the affected households by helping clean up inundated houses and erecting temporary
shelters for those who could not go back to their homes. Temporary dikes were also erected, allowing the winter–
spring crops to be planted. Contaminated wells were treated, and schools were cleaned up so children could resume
their educations. Electricity was restored to most of the affected areas.

                  2. RAPID DAMAGE AND NEEDS
                  ASSESSMENT METHODOLOGY

     2.1 Assessment Methodology and Scope	
     Because the time available was limited and the recovery and reconstruction needs urgent, the rapid assessment focused
     solely on estimating the direct physical damage to the following sectors: housing, transportation, flood protection and
     irrigation infrastructure, and agriculture, livestock, and fishery. For the agriculture, livestock, and fishery sector, losses11
     were assessed as well as physical damage. Although not part of the analysis presented in this report, a short section on
     livelihoods is also included, providing an overview of employment and related concerns in the affected areas.

     The analysis is based on information collected using the Damage Assessment and Needs Assessment (DANA)
     methodology adopted by the Government of Vietnam in 2010.12 GoV mandates that the provincial authorities
     consolidate information reported by district and commune levels, and requires the data to be presented according to
     a predefined set of damage categories, in a specified reporting format.

     In terms of geographical scope, the assessments initially focused on all eighteen provinces that were affected by
     at least one of the five flood events between October and December 2016. Subsequently, following the preliminary
     assessments carried out by the provinces, the central government (MPI) prioritized four provinces in the South
     Central Coast region: Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, Phu Yen, Quang Ngai, and Ninh Thuan, which are among the most
     severely affected provinces and had relatively limited access to Government or donor funding compared to other
     flood-affected provinces. Subsequently, GoV requested the inclusion of a fifth province, Ha Tinh, selected from one
     of the most affected provinces by the 2016 floods. As the time to collect information on damage and reconstruction
     needs for Ha Tinh was extremely short, the assessment for that province is mainly on the flood protection and


     11	   “Damage” is defined as total or partial destruction of physical assets. “Losses” are defined as reduction or variation in economic flows due to the
           event—for example, reduction or variation in production; service delivery; access to goods and services; revenues, salaries, personal income, and
           employment; imports and exports; financial flows; taxes and other revenues and expenditures; transfers; and/or compensation payments.

irrigation sector. These were deemed most in need of reconstruction and recovery support based on a government-
led review of the estimated overall damage and affected population, combined with an analysis of ongoing Overseas
Development Assistance (ODA) investments in the eighteen provinces.



2.2 Limitations of the Assessment	
The main aim of the rapid damage assessment was to quantify the direct physical damage (losses were assessed
only for the agricultural sector) from the 2016 floods and to provide a first-order assessment of the immediate and
long-term recovery and reconstruction needs. The analysis presented in this report is based on the damage, loss, and
reconstruction needs data provided by provincial governments, using the DANA methodology, in discussion with the

     World Bank task team. The damage and reconstruction data are those available at the time of writing.

     In mid-February 2016, the rapid assessment team made a two-day field visit to the most affected areas in Binh Dinh
     and Phu Yen provinces to gain a firsthand understanding of the impacts of the floods. The analysis in this report reflects
     observations the team made in the field during these visits.

     Chapter 3 presents the results of the rapid damage and needs assessment for the provinces and the key sectors under
     review in this report. The assessments use the reported damage and reconstruction needs costs obtained from the
     government. For the infrastructure-related sectors, damage reported in this section pertains to assets managed by
     provincial governments. Thus, damage to national assets (such as national highways) is not included. Disaggregation
     of the damage and reconstruction needs into private and public assets was not attempted, as information was
     insufficient. It can be said, however, that most of the infrastructure assets reported on in this section fall under
     public assets.

3.1 Housing	
HOUSING SECTOR CONTEXT
The housing stock in the four provinces under review is, on average, of relatively good quality. Nationally,
approximately 49 percent of the housing stock was built after 2000. In the urban areas, around 44 percent was
built during this period and in the rural areas 51 percent. Data suggest most people in Vietnam live in dwellings
owned by their families, with the proportion of owned housing at 93 percent of all households with dwellings.

In terms of size, the data indicate that, of all households with dwellings, the housing area of more than half (54.3
percent) is 60 square meters or more. In urban areas, this share is 60.9 percent, 9.5 percentage points higher than in
rural areas. In 2009, 96.1 percent of households overall used electricity from the national network for lighting, an 18
percent increase from 1999. Based on the analysis developed by the Population and Housing Census and presented in
table 3.1, the houses in Vietnam are categorized into four types: permanent, semi-permanent, temporary, and simple.

For the rapid assessment, only the first three categories were used. Permanent houses were defined as dwellings for
which the three main structural elements—supporting columns, roof, and walls—all fell into the “sturdy” category.
Semi-permanent houses were defined as having two out of the three in the sturdy category, while temporary
structures had only one of the three categorized as sturdy.

     It should be noted that, of the affected dwellings, as many as 70 percent in Phu Yen, 69 percent in Bin Dinh, 54
     percent in Quang Nai, and 18 percent in Ninh Thin were totally destroyed. Such destruction may be attributed to the
     strength of the floodwaters.

     As shown in table 3.3 in the next section, the overall estimated cost of damage, which included both the household
     structures and a minimum basket of household goods affected by the floods, amounted to VND 231,655 million, or
     US$10 million.




20   |    VIETNAM 2016: RAPID FLOOD DAMAGE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT
RECONSTRUCTION NEEDS
The government has aimed to increase Vietnam’s housing area per capita from 16.7 square meters in 2015 to 25
square meters by 2020 through a residential housing development strategy.12 The Vietnam Population and Housing
Census reports that in the ten years since 1999 the proportion of households living in dwellings with housing area
above 60 square meters has more than doubled, from 24.2 percent to 54.3 percent. This is viewed as a success in
terms of the government’s effort to increase the average housing area per capita.

Nevertheless, the proportion of households living in cramped living quarters (below 15 square meters) has
not declined substantially. Overall, the decline has been only 0.3 percentage points and in urban areas only 0.8
percentage points. The census report notes that such low decline indicates growing disparities between the rich and
the poor in terms of housing in both urban and rural areas.13

The government is expected to seek to ensure that inequalities based on housing will not be exacerbated as a
result of the 2016 flooding and to direct its reconstruction efforts accordingly. The estimated reconstruction costs,
including building back better components for those houses that were completely destroyed and strengthening
components with mitigation for those with partial damage, are presented in table 3.3. Reconstruction is estimated
with the assumption that the government will support reconstruction of permanent houses with a standard size of
no less than 60 square meters. As land is owned by the government, land acquisition costs and costs for relocation
will be kept to a minimum by relocating households within communities where services are already established.

     3.2 Transportation Infrastructure
     (Roads and Bridges)
     TRANSPORTATION SECTOR CONTEXT
     Vietnam’s local road and bridge network comprises about 253,000 kilometers, or about 85 percent, of the total
     295,000-kilometer network. It serves around 80 percent of the entire population and 90 percent of the nation’s poor,
     who mainly live in rural areas. Research conducted in Vietnam and neighboring countries since 2000 has shown
     investments in local roads and bridges have significantly alleviated poverty and increased social participation,
     school attendance, and health services. Many communes lack roads in good condition, however, and users still face
     high mobility costs, while for many, bridge connectivity to the cities is limited or nonexistent. Time lost from limited
     mobility and travel erodes prosperity, while high mobility costs cut the disposable income of poor women and men,
     who often live in locations without reliable, safe, and affordable transportation.

     Vietnam has a long coastline and hilly and mountainous terrains, the steepest of which are concentrated in the
     Northern Mountain and Central Region provinces. The many inland water bodies make the country prone to various
     climate and disaster risks, while the combination of steep terrains, variable geology, and increased deforestation
     and climate impact can lead to a high incidence of flooding. The construction in hilly and mountainous terrain of
     modern highway networks, which are increasingly expected to conform to vehicle-friendly geometrical designs,
     involves earthworks that have adversely affected already vulnerable terrain. Combined with significant changes in
     land use, the variable geotechnical environment, and the impact of climate, this has exposed the provinces in these
     regions to significant landslide activity. Every year during the rainy season, soil or rock failures affect these highways,
     sometimes with soil-rock mass up to thousands of cubic meters. Such landslide risks and other climate and disaster
     risks, including flooding, apply not only to roads but to all modes of transportation.

     Recent frequent incidents of flooding highlight the prevalence of these risks and the vulnerability of the
     transportation network in these provinces. Such risks should be mitigated and managed through a combination
     of solid, evidence-based planning, design, and engineering solutions, information technology for early detection,
     forecast, and response, and adequate allocation of financial resources. Efforts in those areas could yield significant
     economic benefits by maximizing the integrity of the network and minimizing the negative economic and social
     impacts, as well as the human losses, from disastrous events.


     DAMAGE TO TRANSPORTATION
     The five floods between October and December 2016 heavily damaged the transportation infrastructure in seventeen
     of the eighteen provinces affected. No damage was reported in Da Nang province or for the inland waterway, marine,
     or airway infrastructures. For railways, five eroded or congested points were reported in Quang Binh province. All
     damage reported for this sector in the provinces under review here, therefore, relates to the road infrastructure.

     The water flow that overtopped and breached the riverbanks and dikes flooded the roadways and breached or
     washed away parts of the roads, in many cases eroding the pavements and embankments. In hilly terrains, the heavy
     rainfall caused landslides that damaged and blocked the roads. Heavy surface water running down the steep slopes
     eroded the road foundations, causing the pavements to fail.

     Road networks were also disrupted by stagnant floodwaters, with these conditions lasting for up to a month in
     some places. The PPC and the respective sector management agencies, including the provincial departments of
     transportation, district divisions, and communes, took immediate actions to restore the road connectivity. Despite
     their efforts, the roads remained impassable in some places at the time of assessment.

     Table 3.4 shows the estimated damage to the transportation infrastructure caused by the floods of 2016 in the
     four provinces under review, based on data provided by the provincial governments. The assessment includes the
     damage and reconstruction needs only for the transportation infrastructure managed by the provinces and excludes
     all nationally maintained transportation infrastructure. Estimates of the costs of damage, repair, and reconstruction
     to higher standards were also based on the data provided by the provinces.



22   |   VIETNAM 2016: RAPID FLOOD DAMAGE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT
The road infrastructure affected by the five floods should be restored to a standard that makes it resilient, thus
enhancing its capacity to withstand future natural disaster events. The estimates in table 3.4 are preliminary. For
more accurate estimates, site-specific investigation and engineering designs are needed.

RECONSTRUCTION NEEDS
Reconstruction needs include the reconstruction of roads, pavement structures, culverts, and bridges. Construction
of additional cross-drainage structures, including bridges, will also be necessary, replacing causeways, road
embankments, and slopes with cohesive materials for higher stability. Slope protection works, the stabilization and
improved drainage of hill slopes, and other protection works to strengthen and increase the capacity of the drainage
arrangements will be required as well. Table 3.5 shows the breakdown of the needs estimated for the transportation
sector.

     3.3 Flood Control and Irrigation Infrastructure
     FLOOD CONTROL AND IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE SECTOR CONTEXT
     Its irrigation, flood control, and drainage infrastructure plays a pivotal role in Vietnam’s economic and social
     development. The country has developed irrigation infrastructure to serve 4.5 million hectares, which represents 60
     percent of the country’s arable land area and provides employment to 60 percent of the population.

     Crop production in the central regions is predominantly dependent on irrigation, carried out through systems with
     different forms and capacities. The common irrigation systems include diverting water from local rivers—often by
     diverting their flow with low-height weirs, by releasing water from reservoirs in the upstream mountainous areas,
     and, to a lesser extent, by withdrawing groundwater in coastal areas. Overall, irrigation systems in these regions
     are well developed, but with rather conventional technical specifications, which makes them vulnerable to natural
     disasters like floods. This vulnerability is coupled with deferred maintenance.

     As the Central Region is prone to natural disasters, mainly tropical cyclones and storms, most of the infrastructure
     needs to be able to cope with annual floods and waterlogging. These extreme events often cause landslides and
     erosion of riverbanks, threatening the lives of local people. Systems for protecting people, their livelihood activities,
     and infrastructure are thus essential and worthy investments.


     DAMAGE TO FLOOD PROTECTION AND IRRIGATION INFRASTRUCTURE AND
     RECONSTRUCTION NEEDS
     All damage schemes and infrastructure identified in the assessment of the irrigation and flood control sector are
     public investments. The 2016 disaster caused damage to flood embankments and dikes, riverbank erosion protection
     works, irrigation canals and canal structures, temporary and raised dams and drainage culverts and sluices, and
     water supply schemes. Most of the damage, however, was to dikes, riverbanks, and irrigation canals. Major impacts
     were seen in rural areas and to rural infrastructure, including dikes and embankments, riverbank protection works,
     irrigation canals, diversion dams, roads, bridges, culverts, and so on.

     The reported damage in this sector in Binh Dinh province exceeded that of the other provinces included in the rapid
     assessment, as the assessment team observed during the field mission.

     At the time of the assessment, provincial governments had, with the assistance of the central government,
     undertaken temporary restoration measures, such as the initial and/or partial closing of breaches, the strengthening
     of critical bunds and revetments, and so on. Many of these works require immediate attention, with permanent
     measures taken to lessen the chances of further losses and/or damage in the near future. This is particularly urgent
     with the approach of the annual monsoon season, when Vietnam is exposed to cyclonic storms and heavy rain.
     Given the frequency of severe events in Vietnam during this time, completing the repair and strengthening of
     damaged infrastructure immediately is vital.

     The total estimated cost of damage to this sector, including dikes and embankments, irrigation canals, and other
     infrastructure in the four provinces under review is VND 595.7 billion (US$26 million). The aggregate cost of
     reconstruction with improved design standards for flood control and irrigation infrastructure is estimated at VND
     3,295 billion (US$145.83 million), shown in table 3.6, with the costs broken down by province in table 3.7.

     3.4 Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries
     AGRICULTURE CONTEXT
     The four prioritized provinces belong to the South-Central Coast (SCC) agroecological zone of Vietnam, a region
     strongly dependent on agriculture. Around 50 to 70 percent of the population derives most of its income from
     agriculture. Rice is the main crop in the cropping system, especially in the flood plains. In the uplands, the deep
     sandy soils are widely used to produce fruit and nut trees (mangoes, cashew nuts) and annual crops (cassava,
     peanuts). Rice remains the favored staple food, while cashews and peanuts are largely grown as cash crops. Other
     grain legumes (soybeans, mungbeans, black beans) are widely grown in Binh Dinh, Ninh Thuan, and Phu Yen. Other
     crops with large cultivated areas in the four provinces are mango, sesame in Binh Dinh and Phu Yen, and garlic in
     Ninh Thuan.


     DAMAGE TO AGRICULTURE
     Based on the reports submitted by the provincial governments, the total area affected by the floods in the four
     provinces is estimated at 81,312 hectares (see table 3.8), of which over 65,000 hectares are considered fully lost.
     This damage is estimated to have caused economic losses of VND 4,760.2 billion (US$210.6 million), with Binh Dinh
     suffering the largest loss of VND 2,209.3 billion (US$97.8 million).

     With regard specifically to crop production (table 3.9), the floods reduced the 2016 output for the four provinces by
     around 368,643.1 tonnes, which translates into an estimated economic loss of VND 3,076.7 billion (US$136.1 million).
     The losses were high due to timing, as the floods arrived at the end of the winter season and the beginning of the
     winter–spring season, when the fields were growing paddy and peanuts.14

     Of the four provinces, Binh Dinh was the most affected, with a reduction of 153,121.2 tonnes in crop production,
     followed by Phu Yen (103,654.3 tonnes). The largest economic loss was in Binh Dinh, at VND 1,559.3 billion (US$69
     million), followed by Ninh Thuan (VND 798 billion, US$35.3 million), and Quang Ngai (VND 505.6 billion, US$22.4
     million).




     14	 The main peanut crop is the winter–spring crop (from December to March), when the yield is highest.

AGRICULTURE RECONSTRUCTION AND RECOVERY NEEDS
Based on their reports, the total of damage and losses in the four provinces is estimated at VND 4,916.4 billion
(US$217.5 million), of which VND 4,760.2 billion is losses (table 3.10). Binh Dinh was the hardest hit, with damage
and losses combined estimated at more than VND 2,346.4 billion (US$103.8 million). The estimated funding
needs for reconstruction and recovery are, respectively, VND 226.4 billion (US$10 million) and VND 2,142.1
billion (US$94.8 million). Reconstruction is expected to rehabilitate the damaged agriculture infrastructure,
while recovery covers the distribution of seeds and other planting materials, fertilizers, and pesticides for off-
season replanting in the affected areas. These interventions are expected to build on efforts delivered in response
to requests from the provincial governments in the aftermath of the disaster, mainly to carry out the 2016–17
winter–spring cropping. This included the provision of planting material and crop seeds, particularly for rice
(1,400 tonnes), corn (57 tonnes), vegetables and beans (41 tonnes), cassava (8,000 tonnes) and sugar cane saplings
(10,000 tonnes). In total, financial support amounted to VND 74.5 billion (over US$3.3 million).

     LIVESTOCK CONTEXT
     Livestock production is very important to the farming systems of the SCC region. As demand for meat is increasing
     in Vietnam, the raising of livestock is seen as an opportunity to help alleviate poverty. Available data suggest that
     over 20 percent of Vietnam’s cattle are found in the SCC region, principally in Binh Dinh, Phu Yen, and Quang Ngai.
     For the poor households, animal husbandry diversifies income sources, generates available capital for investments,
     improves cash flow, and makes effective use of crop byproducts. Available estimates suggest income from beef cattle
     husbandry accounts for 22 to 26 percent of total family income for these households. Provincial governments have
     prioritized the raising of beef cattle, and the cattle population has increased in recent years at an annual rate of 5 to
     11 percent, depending on the province.


     DAMAGE TO LIVESTOCK
     As shown in table 3.11, early estimates suggest over 333,000 animals died as a result of the floods, of which 12,832
     were large animals (cows, buffalo), 38,174 small animals (goats, sheep), and 282,001 poultry (chickens, ducks). The
     total figure corresponds to about 1.8 percent of the existing stock before the floods. Binh Dinh was the province
     most affected, with a total of 232,800 dead animals, including 10,980 large animals, 25,620 small animals, and 196,200
     poultry. Some 114,684 animals raised for meat were killed.

     LIVESTOCK RECONSTRUCTION AND RECOVERY NEEDS
     Livestock damage and losses in the four provinces total, respectively, VND 323.3 billion (US$14.3 million) and VND
     81.1 billion (US$3.6 million) (table 3.12). In the aggregate, the overall economic impact is estimated at VND 404.3
     billion (US$17.9 million). The losses on meat production are estimated at VND 74,673.5 billion (US$3.3 million). With
     damage and losses totaling VND 275.1 billion (US$12.2 million), Binh Dinh suffered the greatest overall impact in
     the livestock subsector. The funding needs for reconstruction and recovery are estimated, respectively, at VND 468.7
     billion (US$20.7 million) and VND 36.5 billion (US$1.6 million). Reconstruction aims to restock animal herds and
     rehabilitate and rebuild infrastructure. The recovery activities the provincial governments have requested from the
     central government include the delivery of vaccines and medicines to prevent disease in cattle and poultry and of
     animal breeds to restore production, at a cost amounting to over VND 7,680 billion (around US$340 million).

FISHERY CONTEXT
Fishery resources in the SCC region of Vietnam reported by the General Statistics Office comprise aquaculture
facilities and catches, both at sea and inland. Fishery and aquaculture production for 2015 in the four provinces
under review was an estimated 523,914 tonnes, of which 35,275 tonnes comprised aquaculture production (68
percent shrimp and 18 percent fish) and 488,639 tonnes catches.

DAMAGE TO FISHERY
Damage reports from the provincial governments indicate the largest impact of the floods was on the aquaculture
ponds. Available estimates indicate full or partial damage to 968 hectares of aquaculture facilities, 458 hectares of
fishery ponds, 47 boats, and 745 aquaculture cages for lobster production in the four provinces. The most severe
damage was in Phu Yen, with 397 hectares of aquaculture facilities and 425 hectares of fishery ponds affected.

     In terms of output, 3,374 tonnes of aquaculture production were estimated lost. This represents a loss of around
     9.2 percent relative to the estimated production for 2016.15 Again, Phu Yen had the largest losses in aquaculture
     production of the four provinces (1,529 tonnes)—over 16 percent of the 2016 production estimates—followed by
     Ninh Thuan (924.8 tonnes), around 9 percent. In terms of value, the total losses of aquaculture production have been
     estimated at VND 642 billion (US$28.4 million), over 11 percent of the estimated production value for 2016. In Phu
     Yen, almost one-third of the production value in aquaculture for 2016 was lost.

     FISHERY RECONSTRUCTION AND RECOVERY NEEDS
     The damage to boats, nets, and ponds in the four provinces have been estimated at VND 58.2 billion (US$2.57 million)
     and the losses due to disrupted production at VND 655.2 billion (US$29 million). The overall impact totals VND 713.4
     billion (US$31.6 million). The funding needs for reconstruction and recovery have been estimated, respectively, at
     VND 84.4 billion (US$3.7 million) and VND 294.9 billion (US$13 million). Reconstruction is expected to rehabilitate
     aquaculture facilities and ponds and other facilities, as well as restore fishing gear, equipment, and boats. Recovery
     aims to provide seeds, fingerlings, and medicines for the aquaculture ponds and fisheries. Requests for support from
     the provincial governments target mostly fishermen with damaged equipment and boats, amounting to VND 4,884
     billion (US$216.1 million), chemicals to treat fishery ponds, and extension of loan due dates for fishermen.

3.5 Population and Livelihoods	
The floods of October to December 2016 in the four provinces under review disrupted normal livelihoods for at least
three months for significant proportions of the population, most of whom were engaged in agricultural activities.

For the flood-affected region three (the South Central Coast region), the 2009 Population and Housing Census
reported the labor force numbering 10,548,048, of whom 5,147,169 were female. Female labor in Vietnam was almost
on balance with male labor, accounting for 48.8 percent of the employed population. Unemployment in 2016 was low,
at 3.7 percent of the labor force, as presented in table 3.17. In 2014, Vietnam also had a low Gini Coefficient of 37.6,
suggesting a fairly equal society.

     As the remit for this assessment has not included the collection of loss estimates, it is not possible to estimate
     income loss and impact on livelihoods for the region or period under review. The floods of late 2016 would, however,
     have taken a toll on the ability of persons working in agriculture, forestry, and fishery to earn their livings, as rivers
     broke their embankments and rushed into agricultural fields, leaving sand deposits on soil and destroying produce.
     Furthermore, most workers in the agricultural area fall into the category of self-employed/household enterprise,
     which accounts for some 78.5 percent of the labor force. This suggests that, unless they are able to engage in
     economic activity, they will not earn an income, unlike salaried workers who may continue to earn despite losing
     time at work.

        4. RECOVERY AND
        RECONSTRUCTION

This chapter summarizes the recommendations regarding the short-, medium-, and long-term recovery and
reconstruction needs for each sector reviewed in the previous sections.



4.1 Recovery and Reconstruction Needs
Housing
The recovery needs for the housing sector are:

  ■■ Ensure inequalities based on housing will not be exacerbated as a result of reconstruction following the
     2016 flooding, and that efforts are directed accordingly. At the same time, continue the so far successful
     implementation of the plan to increase per capita average dwelling size.
  ■■ Ensure households moved to safer locations will have access to basic services and will not be disadvantaged
     as a result of the relocation.

Transportation Infrastructure (Roads and Bridges)
The following recommendations pertain to transportation infrastructure needs in the four provinces, where
restoring connectivity is essential for people to resume their day-to-day activities:

  ■■ Restore rural accessibility by repairing impassable roads and bridges.
  ■■ Construct additional cross-drainage structures, including bridges replacing causeways.



                                             VIETNAM 2016: RAPID FLOOD DAMAGE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT                 | 33
         ■■ Upgrade key routes to withstand potential hazards.
         ■■ Use more stable material at road embankments and at side-slopes, together with slope protection as
            required.
         ■■ Stabilize hill slopes, including improved drainage and protective works as required.
         ■■ Improve and strengthen surface drainage arrangements alongside the roads.
         ■■ Engage local communities in the reconstruction of the transportation infrastructure, encouraging female
            workers to participate and using local material where possible. .
         ■■ Develop and implement resilient design and construction standards, maintenance routines, and budgets.

     Flood Control and Irrigation Infrastructure
     Restoring the infrastructure for flood control and irrigation is a high priority to ensure communities are protected
     against future floods. The following recommendations reflect the recovery and reconstruction needs:

         ■■ For the rehabilitation of the flood control and irrigation structures, it is important to choose appropriate
            material and implement design standards fully, including standards for maintenance during the lifespan of
            the infrastructure.
         ■■ The design of rural infrastructure should be based on detailed analysis of the local conditions. The lack of
            detailed design in the past may have contributed to the failure of some of the structures.
         ■■ Consider improving design principles with greater concern for flexibility and drainage. Detailed hydrological
            studies will be important to avoid the overtopping of the embankments in the event of floods of similar
            magnitude.
         ■■ The operation manuals for the reservoirs (large and small) are in urgent need of review, as these could
            bear on the safety of the infrastructure that will be reconstructed downstream in the long term. Improved
            reservoir operations can reduce the flood peaks in the rivers and, consequently, lower the chances of the
            overtopping of dikes and unintended flooding.

     Agriculture, Livestock, and Fisheries
     Restoring agriculture, livestock, and fisheries is key to the swift recovery of the communities, especially in the
     rural areas, from the effects of the floods. The following recommendations pertain to the agriculture, livestock,
     and fishery sector:

     Crops
         ■■ Distribute seeds and other inputs for off-season replanting in affected areas.
         ■■ Rebuild affected farmers’ stocks of saved seeds and planting material.

     Livestock
         ■■ Restock animal herds and build capacity, including for animal management and health care and pasture
            management.
         ■■ Provide animal feed, vaccinations, and veterinary services.

     Fishery
         ■■ Rehabilitate aquaculture facilities and ponds.
         ■■ Restore fishing gear, equipment, and boats.
         ■■ Provide seeds, fingerlings, and medicines for aquaculture facilities and inland fisheries.

4.2 Recovery and Reconstruction Principles
This section recommends recovery and reconstruction principles that can guide and form the basis for recovery
planning, describing them according to the immediate-, medium- and long-term time frames to which they apply.
As the time frame for the rapid assessment did not allow guiding principles to be developed specifically for this
flood event, these are derived from international experience in recovery and reconstruction.


IMMEDIATE-TERM RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION
In the immediate phase, build back better and smarter by integrating disaster risk reduction measures
into recovery and reconstruction. It is important to restore access to services and infrastructure as quickly as
possible, incorporating “build back better” components into the reconstruction efforts. Restoration of key services
and infrastructure will enable the affected population to resume normal life, which in turn will allow recovery to take
place efficiently. The infrastructure should be reconstructed in a way that increases the overall resilience of the local
community it serves.

For the 2016 floods in Vietnam, the immediate response and recovery plans devised by the central and provincial
governments before the events worked well, and emergency measures are already in place, with temporary
shelters erected and temporary roads and bridges provided in many locations. Households severely affected by
the floods have received financial support.


MEDIUM- TO LONG-TERM RECOVERY AND RECONSTRUCTION
Produce better data collection, sharing, and damage estimates. The damage estimation methodology DANA17
is well established, and the affected communes and provinces have used it to estimate the impacts from the floods
in financial terms. Room remains for improvement, however, with regard to data collection, sharing, and damage
estimates. One possible avenue to explore is the construction of a database that is prepopulated with the most
current damage and reconstruction unit costs for the categories of items to be included in the assessment based on
the DANA methodology. Location information on destroyed and partially damaged infrastructure, complete with
photographs, can be linked to the cost data so the estimation of damage and reconstruction needs can be carried out
more quickly, with less effort, and consistently across the country.

Continue raising communities’ awareness of potential risks. Raising awareness of disaster risk management
at the local level is key for increasing the resilience of communities. As residents become aware of the potential
risks from natural disasters in their localities, they will be better prepared, and unnecessary suffering and loss may
be averted. Vietnam is already conducting community drills regularly, resulting in high awareness of local risks.
Providing information on the risks from natural disasters during peacetime, educating children about them, and
communicating them through various media can all help raise awareness. The Community-Based Disaster Risk
Management (CBDRM) project currently undertaken by DMC will help promote community-level risk awareness.

Streamline the budget allocation process for emergency reconstruction projects, both at the central and
provincial levels, to minimize delays and uncertainties in mobilizing funds for medium-term reconstruction
projects. Although the contingency budget allocated in the annual budget is available for immediate relief and
recovery purposes, the mechanism for allocating funds for medium- to long-term reconstruction needs is currently
unclear. Considering the frequent occurrence of hydro-meteorological hazard events in Vietnam that require
reconstruction efforts on an almost annual basis, having a clear emergency budget allocation mechanism for this
purpose would be beneficial. As part of this mechanism, risk financing options could also be considered.

In the medium term, incorporate better components into the design of the infrastructure to be
reconstructed. Repairs should not just restore infrastructure to the same standards and specifications as
before the event. Rather, planners should consider all options, including innovative approaches, such as the use
of green infrastructure, so they may come up with the optimal design specifications and solutions. Doing so will
ensure resilience in the future, especially in the face of the projected increase in frequency and intensity of hydro-
meteorological hazards under climate change scenarios. For the design of resilient infrastructure, an integrated

17	 Damage Assessment and Needs Assessment methodology; see chapter 1..



                                                       VIETNAM 2016: RAPID FLOOD DAMAGE AND NEEDS ASSESSMENT                | 35
     flood management approach should be applied, taking into account the hydrological, meteorological, and other
     conditions of entire river basins and surrounding environments.

     Carry out comprehensive hydrological analysis before any reconstruction. The design of the existing rural
     infrastructure, including bridges, flood embankments, and diversion structures or weirs, was not based on a
     comprehensive hydrological analysis, which has led to the structures having inadequate capacity. A full hydrological
     analysis before designing the specifications of infrastructure to be constructed is recommended so the repairs will
     be adequate for the locations.

     Allocate budget for maintenance of the infrastructure. Once constructed, infrastructure should be maintained
     to ensure it functions to its design standards and lasts its designed lifespan. Not allowing for maintenance work may
     result in costly replacement, or even unexpected damage and disruption to people’s lives. It is recommended to allow
     adequate budget for the monitoring and maintenance of key infrastructure (dikes, roads, bridges, and canals) that
     was reconstructed following the 2016 floods, as well as for the existing infrastructure.

     Incorporate disaster risk reduction and climate change adaptation concepts into land use planning. Informed
     land use planning can reduce unnecessary risk from natural disasters, as well as from climate change. Vulnerable
     locations can be identified using scientific analysis and modeling, as well as by taking advantage of local knowledge.
     Policies and strategies that limit the uses of land in these locations can be developed and implemented to reduce
     the risk to human lives and assets. Where these plans affect people already living on the land, care must be taken to
     avoid adversely affecting them. GoV has been actively promoting the planned relocation of residents from vulnerable
     land since 2007.

        5. ENHANCING DISASTER
        RISK MANAGEMENT

The reconstruction phase provides an excellent opportunity to increase resilience against future disaster
events by building back better or by strengthening the institutional capacities of the government agencies
to respond to disasters. Review of existing disaster risk management mechanisms, both ex ante and ex post,
can identify gaps and areas for improvement. This section recommends areas to highlight throughout the
reconstruction phase for improved disaster risk management.

Make risk information available and build capacity to generate and incorporate it for planning purposes.
Disaster risk management (DRM) and reduction (DRR) are most effective when mainstreamed into physical, fiscal,
and policy decision making at both the national and subnational levels. DRR also requires long-term vision, as risks
from disasters and climate change persist over long periods of time. That vision should be informed by scientific
analysis and by evidence and knowledge of the potential hazards, the exposed assets and their vulnerability, and the
risks associated with the hazards and exposure.

Furthermore, information on the potential hazards and exposed assets and the assets’ vulnerability to the hazards
and risks should be available for use by decision makers, and the risk quantified at the appropriate scale to respond
to the issue at hand. Strengthening the country’s capacity to produce risk information is paramount, as is having
the means to store and disseminate it and the knowledge to make decisions based on it. The ongoing World Bank–
funded VN-Haz project, which covers ten provinces in the Central Region, aims to produce an information system
in which the quantified risk information derived from hydrological models is made available for use in planning and
other development-related projects. Adoption of such a system should be considered.

Develop DRM financing instruments to ensure liquidity in the face of natural disasters. As Vietnam is
particularly prone to severe hydro-meteorological hazards almost annually, emergency contingency budget is set
aside that allows the central and local governments to mobilize resources quickly for immediate relief and recovery.

     Developing a financial instrument that will allow the smooth and efficient transition from immediate recovery
     into medium-term reconstruction efforts ( for example, the rebuilding of infrastructure) may further improve the
     government’s ability to cope with disasters and increase the resilience of the country by reducing disruption to
     services for the affected population.

     Strengthen disaster risk governance. Many international donors are currently working with GoV on disaster
     risk reduction issues. It is noted that donor coordination could be improved so the investments made in the
     various areas do not become piecemeal and so they adhere to a clear set of principles guided by GoV, reducing
     redundancies and overlaps in and fragmentation of DRM systems. According to the DRM Law which was adopted
     in 2014, a dedicated DRM agency should be established and functional at both national and provincial levels as
     soon as possible. This agency can take a lead role in coordinating the various efforts supported by the international
     communities to establish a coherent strategy that allows these efforts to scale up across the country in an efficient
     way and to streamline these activities so they all feed into the common goal of increasing the resilience of Vietnam to
     natural disasters, like the 2016 floods.
