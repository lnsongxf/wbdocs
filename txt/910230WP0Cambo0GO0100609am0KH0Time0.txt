           There is plenty of room to further develop the tourism sector to increase its contribution to growth, shared
prosperity and poverty reduction, and the public sector is well placed to undertake or help facilitate this development. As the
experience of Costa Rica shows, the diversification of tourist sites to tap the huge potential of coastal areas as well as the
potential for eco-tourism in rural areas will help expand the tourism sector and share its benefits across the country,
generating jobs for local communities and contributing to reduce poverty and vulnerability. Implementing successfully the key
activities and targets set in Cambodia’s 2012-2020 Tourism Development Strategic Plan (TDSP) will provide a sound basis,
though more can be done to ensure greatest impact. While the TDSP’s focus on connecting and facilitating air travel will help
increase tourist arrival numbers, a larger impact can be obtained by simultaneously developing physical infrastructure,
particularly publicly financed paved and rural roads, as half of total arrivals is via land. Facilitating the development of
privately financed hospitality and logistics support services will also be key to support tourism diversification and expansion.
It is thus important to clearly define the roles of the public sector, local authorities, private sector and local communities, and
to establish a well-functioning coordination arrangement to prioritize, implement, and monitor key activities and targets. For
instance, efforts have been made to rehabilitate and expand a number of highways linking Cambodia to Thailand and
Vietnam, but without sufficient coordination and prioritized resource allocation, maintaining the rehabilitated and expanded
highways including its tourist information, rest stops, and toilet facilities in decent shape will likely remain a challenge.
Similarly, central and provincial authorities have been making good efforts to strengthen safety, security, and the environment
to attract tourists, but without the active participation of the local community those efforts may not be as effective.
Coordination also at the regional level will help increase the attractiveness of joint tour packages. For instance, combining
eco-tourism, cultural and beach packages with neighboring countries will attract tourists visiting the region to also come to
Cambodia. As shown in Figure B1.2, the dependency of Cambodia‘s relatively new tourism sector on Thailand’s more
developed tourism sector points out to the importance of close cooperation between ministries, agencies and private sector of
the two countries.

                      Cambodia Joins the Olympians of Growth

Cambodia has grown at a yearly average growth rate of 7.7 percent for two decades now making it the sixth fastest
growing country in the world over that time period. Cambodia’s performance is impressive as very few countries in the
world have experienced consistently high growth rates over several decades. The more typical pattern is for countries to
experience phases of growth, stagnation, or decline of varying length. 1 In fact, as noted by the Growth Commission (2008),
since 1950 only 13 economies in the world have grown at an average rate of above 7 percent a year for 25 years or longer. At
such a pace of growth, the economy almost doubles in size every decade. 2

Cambodia’s high growth is all the more impressive because of its resilience. In addition to growing at a fast average
rate, it has maintained a fairly constant growth over the period. This sets Cambodia apart from countries such as Equatorial
Guinea, Liberia, Angola and Cape Verde that are among the top 5 fastest growing countries over the past 20 years but have
not experienced such constant growth, and instead puts it in the same group as China, which is among the top 5 fastest and
has also experienced constant growth.

This box measures the growth resilience of fast growing countries and categorizes those most resilient as the
“Olympians of growth”. Countries with resilient growth are considered to be those with medium-run growth rates that rank
among the highest in the world every year for a two decade period. Those with a consistent ranking among the top 40 (the
top quartile of the sample) are named the Olympians of growth. The medium-run GDP yearly growth rate (also known as
growth trend) is estimated by calculating yearly growth rates on five-year moving average GDP data.3 Moving averages are
used to smooth out short-term GDP fluctuations and show medium-run trends. GDP is measured in constant 2005 US$ for
160 countries from 1993 to 2013. The attractiveness of this proposed definition of dynamism is that it looks at a country’s
growth relative to that of other countries and thus controls for periods of global crisis when countries typically experience
lower growth. To use a metaphor, a fast and resilient runner is one who outruns other runners come rain or shine. Resilient
fast growth over a period is more desirable from a development perspective than high growth over a period achieved with
intermittent growth. The two main reason for this are firstly, that resilient growth provides more time for institutions to adapt
to change, for resources to be better deployed, and for technological change to be better mastered (Growth Commission
2008), and secondly that intermittent growth is likely to be less poverty reducing as the poor are more vulnerable to growth
shocks than the non-poor population because they have less shock cushion (savings and assets).

Thanks to its high resilient growth over the last two decades Cambodia is part of the select group of “Olympian s of
growth.” Cambodia is among the group of eight countries and is accompanied in the region by China, Lao PDR and
Vietnam (Figure B2.1).

Cambodia’s growth has been driven by four engines. These four engines of growth are: garment exports, tourism, crops
and construction/real estate. Growth was spurred by both factor accumulation and productivity gains, which were favored
by an expansion of international trade and sustained investment. Growth decomposition shows that factor accumulation
contributed, on average, about 4 percentage points to potential GDP growth, with roughly equal contributions from capital
(2 percentage points) and labor accumulation (2 percentage points) over the 1987 –2011 period. Growth in productivity
contributed about 3 percentage points to potential GDP growth on average, and has been a relatively stable source of
growth for Cambodia.4

Cambodia’s dynamism has slowed since the global financial crisis, raising questions over the continuity of its high
growth path. Cambodia's medium-term growth, which ranked consistently among the top 10 fastest countries before the
2008/9 global crisis, has fallen down into the top 20 after the crisis, with a slower pace of growth than the above 8 percent
growth experienced before (Table B2.1). This is in contrast to the case of its neighbor, Lao PDR, which has seen its
medium-term growth and rankings further improve to the top 10 on the back of increased investment, unlike Cambodia,
which has experienced a slowdown in investment growth (Figure B2.2).

 Cambodia aims to shift its economy towards an 8-percent-GDP growth track over the next decade.
 Some refer to such a pace as a “growth miracle” but, as the Growth Commission (2008) notes, fast sustained
 growth should not be considered a miracle; it is attainable by countries that possess favorable factors, and deploy
 the right set of policies to seize opportunities and overcome challenges. Increasing factor accumulation
 (particularly capital and skilled labor) and factor productivity is key for greater growth. Implementing Cambodia’s
 development reform agenda with renewed vigor, particularly on the business climate, would help the capital-to-
 GDP ratio to increase by the 5 percentage points needed to achieve a GDP growth rate of 8 percent (see
 business climate recommendations in the Selected Issue 2 Creating Opportunities for Firms: Findings from the
 Investment Climate).

                                                      2013 showed that Cambodia’s debt distress rating

24.     The reduced fiscal deficit resulting
from better revenue collection helps improve
Cambodia’s fiscal position and promote
sustainable fiscal performance while also
improving public sector service delivery. The
overall fiscal deficit (including grants) has
improved, reaching 2.7 percent of GDP in 2013
and is projected to further reduce to 2.5 percent
of GDP in 2014 (Figure 21). The deficit
continues to be over financed by external funds
(Figure 22). Government savings (deposits)
therefore rose to US$931 million by mid-2014,
compared with US$700 million at the end of
2013.

indicates that the business environment
continues to hamper the competitiveness of
firms in Cambodia. The key constraints for firms
continue to be electricity cost and access,
informal payments and uncompetitive practices.
The survey also shows that Special Economic

improved business environment, are not yet
delivering the benefits expected by foreign
investors.

and efficiency in spending will allow
increased social spending and public
investment. Continued broadening of the tax
base and strengthening tax administration will
boost revenue collection, which in turn will allow
for more public investments in key social and
economic sectors such as education, skills
development, and infrastructure.

inter-ministerial coordination, leadership, and
most importantly, the monitoring of specific

increasing public investment in farm advisory
services, technology development (especially seeds),
rural transport, and irrigation infrastructure. In
addition increasing the competitiveness of the milled-
rice supply chain would enable Cambodia to
significantly increase its presence in the global rice
market. Better access for rice producers and
processers to finance, lower electricity costs, and
reduced costs of doing business would help increase
the competitiveness of the milling industry.
Improving logistics would also critically contribute to
meeting the export target. Two important actions to
reduce Cambodia’s high logistics costs are the
transport of milled rice in bulk cargo, and not only by
container, and making use of the Tonle Sap and the

countries indicates could be half as expensive as
