Review of Recent
Economic Developments

E
         conomic growth is expected to recover in FY14, albeit from a low point. Agricultural
         potential has expanded in the first half of the year on the back of a good monsoon
         and the sharp increase in remittance inflows should support services sector growth
as well. The structural bias toward consumption led growth – as opposed to investment- is
expected to continue with relatively low levels of both public and private investment.

Nepal, for the second year in a row, should achieve a twin surplus reflecting healthy developments
(particularly domestic revenue mobilization) but also deep absorptive bottlenecks, which are
really missed opportunities for growth. First, the slow pace of budget execution has translated
into a sizeable budget surplus that is not leveraged to build the country’s infrastructure.
Second, the sharp increase in remittances has more than made up for Nepal’s chronic trade
gap but it has also resulted in a buildup of liquidity in the financial system that may be in
excess of the private sector’s ability to translate it into sound credit.

Managing Excess
Liquidity in the Short Run
                    N
                                  epal’s financial system is currently characterized by excess liquidity reflecting a
                                  combination of conjunctural and structural factors. On the one hand, bank lending
                                  to the private sector has slowed –with lending rates adjusting sluggishly to available
                    liquidity- possibly remaining below optimal levels. On the other hand, high external inflows of
                    cash into the economy are creating significant pressure that could translate into prices if banks
                    are unable to channel this liquidity to sound investments and if the monetary authorities do not
                    act to effectively and predictably manage the overall level of liquidity in the system.

                    In the short run, therefore, it may make sense for the NRB to clarify its monetary stance by
                    articulating a liquidity management strategy in relation to both growth (credit) and inflation
                    goals as well as financial stability and development objectives. This may call for creating new
                    instruments to manage excess liquidity, which has become a feature of the Nepali economy.

                       A credit slowdown can be defined as a general                      supply phenomena, it is difficult to disentangle
                       decline in credit growth that may have been                        supply from demand effects since some of the
                       generated by either demand or supply factors,                      same factors that reduce the willingness to lend
                       or both. Broad changes in the demand for                           may also restrain the desire to borrow.
                       credit may be cyclical (varying with the pace
                       of economic activity) or structural (induced by                    A credit crunch implies changes in the relationship
                       changes in the tax code etc.). Credit supply can                   between credit availability and interest rates: (i)

                       a reduction in the available supply of credit.                     the term credit rationing is commonly used
                       During a period of credit crunch, lenders become                   for situations in which the supply of credit is
                       reluctant to lend either because of funding                        allocated through non-price mechanisms. In
                       problems stemming from disintermediation, or                       general, credit rationing episodes are considered
                       because regulators have urged credit restraint.                    to be a subset of credit crunches in which the

                         Box 5: The Use of Sterilization Bonds in Asia
                         In the wake of the Asian Crisis, a number of Asian economies have accumulated large FX reserves to
                         sustain exchange rate regimes, leading to large increases in their balance sheets. In order to maintain
                         monetary stability central banks have resorted to sterilization through non-market and market based
                         approaches. Among the latter sterilization bonds –mostly the sale of own securities by CBs- have been
                         increasingly popular and seen as a way to deepen local bond markets and develop a yield curve while
                         avoiding the negative impact of non-market measures on financial intermediation.
                         In Korea, “Monetary stabilization bills” were issued for the first time in 1961 and used as the primary
                         method to remove excess liquidity, reaching an amount equivalent to 20% of GDP in 2005.
                         China issued central bank bills, alongside other instruments (including reserve requirements, open
                         market operations, etc) beginning in 2003. In China market based issuance has also been combined with
                         targeted issuance to specific commercial banks experiencing abundant liquidity and fast credit growth.
                         While the Reserve Bank of India is not allowed to issue its own securities a new instrument was created in 2004,
                         namely the “Market Stabilization Scheme” – or government treasury bonds and medium-term dated securities
                         used solely for sterilization purposes (with the proceeds from the auction placed on a separate cash account).

Expanding the Reach and the

           he Central Bank’s policy stance is consistent with the interpretation that commercial
           banks are excessively cautious in their credit allocation decisions and thus simultaneously
           restricting the economy’s growth potential and hurting customers by maintaining high
spreads between deposit and lending rates. Specific policy measures, such as the proposed cap on
interest rate spreads and directed lending to deprived sectors and priority sectors are meant to
correct such market inefficiencies. However they run the risk of introducing additional distortions
and should be evaluated carefully. Moreover such interventions are at best ‘second best’ while a
more sustainable option would be to improve the ability of the market to function efficiently.

The section below contains recommendations on how such an agenda could be pursued
to improve access to finance, release under-exploited economic potential and help banks
diversify their risk.
