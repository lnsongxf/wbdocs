T       urkey’s demographic and economic
        transformation has been one of the
        world’s most dramatic, with urban
growth and economic growth proceeding hand
in hand. In the 1950s, despite concerted efforts

to promote industrialization and the concentra-
tion of population in cities necessary to support
it, Turkey still featured a largely agrarian econ-
omy with no more than 25 percent of its popu-
lation in cities. But over the next five decades,
starting in 1960, the share of industry in GDP
rose from 18 percent to 27 percent and that of
services from 26 percent to nearly 64 percent.
These structural shifts and accompanying pro-
ductivity gains paid dividends, as per capita
GDP more than doubled from $6,000 in 1980 to
$13,800 in 2013 1. Some 92 percent of Turkey’s                               Distinguishing Turkey from many other devel-

                                 Box 1: The Rise of the Anatolian Tigers
 Turkey’s system of cities is evolving, particularly over the last decade, giving rise to the “Anatolian Tigers.”
 The Tigers have increased their share of urban population in the last 10 years, and they continue to expe-
 rience modest population growth. Meanwhile, the shares of Turkey’s largest agglomerations—Istanbul,
 Ankara, and Izmir—have declined.
 This demographic growth among the Anatolian Tigers has contributed to an equally impressive economic
 expansion. Turkey’s secondary cities are not only growing faster demographically—they are also growing
 faster economically. Istanbul, Ankara, Izmir, and Antalya are well ahead of other Turkish cities in gross
 value added per capita, but many of the Tigers have been catching up. Led by provincial cities like Ga-
 ziantep, Samsun, Malatya, and Trabzon, which recorded some of the fastest growth in gross value added
 per capita during 2004–11. This is largely explained by market forces, as Turkey’s secondary cities benefit
 from economic spillovers. Rising land-rent values and labor costs in its primary cities force firms to find
 lower cost alternatives. And connections to external markets have helped cities like Gaziantep position
 themselves as gateways to regional markets. Factoring in the change in firm location and population
 movements, Turkey looks today much more spatially distributed than it did only a decade ago. Istanbul is
 no longer a mountain among molehills, but a city among many that are attracting firms (Figure 3).

                  Box 2: Permissive policy toward informal settlements
     Turkey experienced a major surge of rural migrants to cities in the 1980s, rapidly expanding informal ur-
     ban settlements. Many cities could not accommodate this growth, and the influx of migrants took place
     so quickly that these informal settlements became known as gecekondu, “houses erected overnight.”
     Estimates of informal housing in major cities during that period range between 30 percent–60 percent of
     the urban housing stock. Most in-migration was concentrated in large cities along the coast (Istanbul and
     Izmir) and in Ankara.
     During the period from 1949-1990, the government issued eight amnesties legalizing irregular residences.
     The prevailing attitude of the government, and tacitly accepted by the public, was the notion that all Turks
     have a right to some form of basic housing. The amnesties gave residents either outright legal title to the
     land or the temporary right to use it, removing the fear of eviction. With their tenure secure, residents of
     informal areas began to invest in their housing, in some cases adding rooms later rented to new migrants,
     and municipalities connected them to vital infrastructure services. Turkey was also fortunate that the vast
     majority of land where the informal settlements took shape was public. That may have foreclosed criti-
     cisms about property rights from private land owners.
