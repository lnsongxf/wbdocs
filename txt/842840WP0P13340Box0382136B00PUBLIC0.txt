T   his booklet has been produced by the World Bank. Its
    purpose is to provide county governments, citizens, and other
stakeholders with basic information on existing and planned
World Bank-financed projects in their counties, in order help
the public understand where these projects are active, to assist
counties take account of these projects as they plan and budget
their development programs, to improve coordination between
counties and national agencies, and improve the harmonization of
development assistance to Kenya.

This booklet presents the ongoing and planned World Bank
projects in Kenya, by sector, and identifies the counties where they
are being implemented.

The book is structured in the following way. First, it provides a
matrix and overview of World Bank-financed projects that shows
which counties are covered under each project. Second, the booklet
provides details of each project including: funding; project life; line
Ministry; implementing agencies; objectives and key activities;
project components, and those components of the project that
support capacity building, as well as Government counterpart
contacts; responsible World Bank task team leader.

Readers are encouraged to first refer to the matrix/overview to see
which projects are active in a given county, and then refer to the
project description for more information.

We hope that this contributes to improved awareness of the
geographical distribution of the World Bank’s portfolio in
Kenya, improved coordination of development initiatives, and
improved results.

  Objectives: The development objective of this technical assistance is to improve
  service standards in selected utilities in the urban water sector of Kenya. The
  MajiVoice software is a new, modern customer feedback system for the water
  sector that allows utility customers to submit feedback using standard mobile
  phones (call. USSD or SMS), mobile internet or by walking into utility offices,
  receiving a reference number in return with which complaint status can be
  checked by SMS or internet.

  The benefits of this system are manifold: For citizens, feedback is easier
  to submit and unique reference numbers will increase accountability and
  encourage faster resolution of problems. Utilities will gain a straightforward
  tool to communicate with clients, process complaints and analyse feedback
  to enhance their performance under their Service Provision Agreements.
  MajiVoice also provides a tool for sector regulation by increasing the regulators
  ability to systematically analyse utility performance by receiving detailed
  summary reports. In this way MajiVoice will operationalize a full accountability
  chain using new technological solutions.

    Objectives: To increase access to commercial financing for basic water supply
    and sanitation services for the poor in urban centers.

    Counties             All 47 counties
    Covered:

    Component 1: Capacity building of urban water and sanitation utilities. The key
    aspect of the technical assistance will be raising the financial and operational
    capacity of utilities to a level sufficient to obtain commercial financing. Based
    on the Utility Shadow Credit Rating Report, 13 utilities were rated investment
    grade with another 16 that could become investment grade rated with some
    management improvements. However, currently it is unlikely any utility would
    receive a commercial loan due to operational inefficiency and lack of financial
    management skills, including project modeling, business plan writing and loan
    application procedures.

    Component 2: Capacity building of local commercial lenders. The focus of the
    technical assistance will be to increase the knowledge of local banks in the
    operations and risks in the water and sanitation sector in Kenya, utility credit
    analysis, and project finance (no collateral) lending practices. A survey of the
    five potential lenders in the market is under way. The technical assistance will
    create water sector lending guidelines and facilitate one-day training sessions
    for senior bank staff. Banks in Kenya are reluctant to work with each other;
    therefore, one-day trainings with individual banks will likely be a better option
    than a sector-wide seminar. The guidelines, however, will be made available to
    the entire banking industry.

    Component 3: Capacity building of national government entities. The technical
    assistance will support national government entities directly involved with
    commercial financing in the sector: MoEWR, MoF and WASREB. Commercial
    financing is new to the sector so legal and regulatory frameworks must be
    enhanced to support borrowing. In pilot loans, some specific exemptions and
    approvals must be given in order to allow utilities to meet the requirements of
    commercial borrowing. These ministerial exemptions must then be incorporated
    into the existing laws and/or guidelines in order to create a sustainable process.
    Regulatory guidelines already incorporate commercial borrowing; however, the
    required tariff and license documentation changes will fall under the purview
    of the regulator. This technical assistance will vary greatly and is difficult to fully
    define what is needed at this point.

 Covered:

 Component 1: The project incorporates technical and financing components
 to fit the unique requirements of households living in low income areas in
 Nairobi. This project will be one of the first large-scale initiatives in Africa
 to apply low-cost sewerage approaches in low-income communities and
 informal settlements, with the potential to develop innovative incentive-based
 financing models. Notably, this project will innovate by using an OBA subsidy
 as an incentive for landlord/householder investment in sewered sanitation
 facilities, with the aim of avoiding past failures of sewerage projects, such as
 low connection rates and the exclusion of the poorest households.

  Objective: Sustainable management of fisheries resources.

  Counties               Kilifi, Kwale, Lamu, Mombasa and Tana River
  Covered:

  Component 1: Sustainable Management of Fisheries Resources. Though the
  fishery resources of the Coast are poorly understood and underutilized, they
  could create opportunities for improved livelihoods and economic growth.
  For example, current local catches are insufficient to meet domestic demand
  in the Coast Province, and fish is imported for local consumption. The KCDP
  aims to increase the benefits and revenue generation derived from coastal
  fisheries through (a) improving governance, including monitoring, control
  and surveillance of the fishery in the EEZ; (b) advancing research on coastal,
  and nearshore fish stocks, promoting alternative fishing technologies, and
  supporting linkages between fishermen, processors and fishmongers; and
  (c) increasing fish production through aquaculture, which will have national
  implications given the falling revenue from the Lake Victoria Nile Perch fishery.

  Component 2: Sound Management of Natural Resources. There is a direct
  link between the quality of natural resources and economic growth through
  tourism. Coastal tourism relies on clean beaches, good water quality, and
  healthy marine ecosystems, all of which are in decline in Kenya. This component
  aims to (a) improve sound management and regeneration of natural resources
  and biodiversity; and (b) identify biodiversity products and markets that will
  assist in promoting eco-tourism and spin-off industries.

  Component 3: Support for Alternative Livelihoods. Equitable sharing of benefits
  that accrue from the sustainable use of local natural resources requires careful
  planning, legislative support, and a local population both willing and able to
  participate effectively in the use and management of those resources.

 Objectives: The objectives of the Health Sector Support Project (HSSP) for
 Kenya are to improve: (a) the delivery of essential health services for Kenyans,
 especially the poor; and (b) the effectiveness of planning, financing and
 procurement of pharmaceuticals and medical supplies.

 Counties            All 47 counties
 Covered:

 Component 1: Is the effective and transparent implementation of the Kenya
 Essential Package for Health (KEPH) through Health Sector Services Fund
 (HSSF) grants and performance strengthening through Results Based Financing
 (RBF) at the primary health facilities. The project will support the effective
 implementation of the KEPH, through financing the HSSF targeted at health
 service delivery levels one, two, and three.

 Specifically the additional financing will support scaling-up of successfully
 piloted RBF program to 20 counties in arid and semi-arid regions of the
 country including nation-wide implementation of free-maternity-services with
 emphasis on quality and improving independent verification. Support will
 also be provided for Kenya’s initiative to achieve Universal Health Coverage
 by providing support to first phase of health insurance subsidies for the poor
 households in all 47 counties. It will also support capacity building of county
 departments of health to develop sustainable institutions to effectively manage
 the devolved health system.

 Component 2: Is the availability of essential health commodities and supply
 chain management reform. This component will be implemented in parallel
 with the HSSF, to ensure an improved availability of commodities in, and
 enhance the quality of care provided at, the lower levels of the public health
 system.

  Objectives: To assist Kenya to expand the coverage of targeted HIV and AIDS
  prevention and mitigation interventions through: (a) sustaining the improved
  institutional performance of the National Aids control Council (NACC); and (b)
  supporting the implementation of the Kenya National Aids Strategic Plan.

  Counties               All 47 counties
  Covered:

  Component 1: Strengthening Governance and Coordination Capacity. This
  component provides support for the strategic leadership function of the NACC,
  as the Kenyan institution charged with leading, guiding and coordinating
  the implementation of the KNASP. It further focuses on the institutional
  strengthening of NACC and its decentralized structures and on activities by
  these institutions to coordinate the national program and project activities.
  The role of NACC would be emphasized as primarily a program coordinator and
  service component and would also support the further strengthening of the
  implementation of the national M&E framework, as well as capacity building
  for the implementing partners. This component therefore will help strengthen
  the national institution for managing and implementing the long-run response
  to HIV in Kenya, and enhance the country’s capacity to use effectively resources
  from all sources for results.

  Component 2: Support for Program Implementation. This component would
  make financial resources available to civil society, public sector, private
  sector, and research institutions, focusing on initiatives inline with the KNASP,
  responding to priorities identified by the JAPR. It would also support the
  procurement of essential commodities.

 Objectives: The overall objective of this two-phased Adaptable Lending
 Program (APL) Program is to increase private investment in the Kenya
 infrastructure market across sectors and to sustain this participation over an
 extended period of time. This involves three key areas of development: (a)
 enabling environment; (b) pipeline; and (c) financing. The specific objective of
 the APL 1 project is to improve the enabling environment to generate a pipeline
 of bankable Public-Private Partnership (PPP) projects.

 Counties           Mombasa, Nairobi and Nakuru
 Covered:

 Component 1: Institutional Support and Regulatory Reform. Provide
 comprehensive support for the establishment and sustainable functioning of

 its PPP program. This sub-component will support further policy dialogue
 and design on the legal and regulatory framework for PPPs, including the
 implementation of the PPP Policy, the PPP Law and regulations.

 Component 2: PPP Pipeline Preparation. Assist the GoK (particularly procuring
 ministries and the Nodes that are to be established as centers of PPP expertise
 within the procuring ministries) in ensuring that the first projects to come
 before the PPPSC and PPPS are well-prepared, “bankable,” and take into
 account lessons learned from previous PPP projects, the privatization program
 in Kenya, and regional and international experience.

 Component 3: Improvements to Fiscal Commitment and Contingent Liability
 (FCCL) Risk Management Framework. The capacity of GoK for the assessment,
 monitoring and management of fiscal commitments and risks associated with
 PPPs is limited. Provide support and guidance to the MoF and other relevant
 agencies on the fiscal commitment and risk framework associated with
 infrastructure, with an emphasis on contingent liabilities from PPPs.

 Objective: To improve water security and build climate resilience in the Coastal
 Region.

 Counties            Kwale and Mombasa
 Covered:

 Component 1: Mwache Dam and Related Infrastructure. This component
 will finance the construction of the main dam (Mwache), three check dams,
 raw water transmission lines (gravity-fed) to the treatment plant, transport
 infrastructure (approach road to dam site and bridges), electromechanical
 equipment and buildings related to the dam site i.e. all of the infrastructure
 needed to supply water (raw water, before treatment works) to the Mombasa
 water supply system. The component would also include implementation of
 the environmental management plan.

 Component 2: Irrigation and Livestock Development. It would support the
 development of an irrigation scheme of 2,500 ha in Kwale county, as well as
 intensive training of farmers through participatory approaches, introduction
 of new high value crops, a marketing study and development of market
 linkages, strengthening of the existing irrigation service, and formation of, and
 capacity building for, an irrigation Water Users’ Association(s). The direct target
 beneficiaries of the proposed irrigation scheme at full development would be
 approximately 25,830 people – i.e. about 2,200 households including that are
 currently farming land in the proposed irrigable area, and some 1,500 other
 households who would gain incremental wage employment opportunities
 on the new irrigated farms and through related economic activities. The
 component will increase the value of food production in the area from about
 KSh. 240 million to about KSh. 2 billion per year contributing to enhanced food
 security in the coastal region and the development of food exports to other
 regions of Kenya.

 Component 3: Rural Area Development and Water Resources Management.
 This component is aimed at developing and uplifting the livelihoods (economic
 and social) of communities in the immediate Mwache area as well as other
 areas in Kwale County and would be geared to improving the livelihoods of the
 PAPs (i.e. approximately 5,300 households—approximately 37,000 people) in
 Mazeras, Mnyenzeni, Chigato and Mwatate sub-locations of Kinango District. It
 will also include targeted Water Resources Management activities, both in the
 catchment area as well as more broadly in the Coastal Region.

 Component 4: Project Management. This component will establish and finance
 a Project Implementation Unit (PIU) within the Coastal Development Authority
 (CDA). It is currently envisioned that the PIU will take the lead on execution
 of project activities (including preparation of tender and design documents,
 technical supervision of works, and contract management as well as planning,
 coordination and reporting for all project activities. The PIU will be supported
 by an Implementation Support Consultant(ISC), which could be a consortium of
 firms with relevant national and international experience.
