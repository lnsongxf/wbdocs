  Recommendations
  n	 Streamline Curricula – Reducing the number of subjects covered, tightening curricula to reduce the number of
    textbooks required, and shortening their length would significantly lower textbook costs.
  n	 Make  Textbooks Conform to Curriculum – Many SSA countries still do not have textbooks that conform to their
    curriculum. India, the Philippines and Vietnam have standardized one-book policies per subjects that conform to each
    countrie’s national curriculum.
  n	 Strengthen  Textbook Development – SSA countries could adopt one of two new models for developing textbooks. In
    Ethiopia and the Philippines textbook development is part of textbook procurement through international competitive
    bidding. In India and Vietnam textbooks are developed through subject experts identified by state agencies, and
    textbooks go through an extensive well-defined consultation and evaluation process.
  n	 Make  Textbook Printing Competitive and Ensure Timely Delivery – Competitive printing is an effective cost
    cutting technique and in countries with under-developed printing industries, international competitive bidding is a
    cost-effective option. Delivery of textbooks to schools should also be part of textbook procurement so that all schools
    receive them at the beginning of the academic year.
  n	 Secure  Sustainable, Predictable Funding – Sustainable, predictable and earmarked budget allocation for textbooks
    is essential to adequate textbook provision. If countries put in place necessary systems required to address textbook
    costs, funding should not be a binding constraint on textbook availability in SSA.
  n	 Exercise  Caution in Large-Scale Technology Adoption – Technology is an inevitable part of education today, but
    it’s best to sync technology’s role with the adaptive capabilities of the local systems and the availability of supporting
    infrastructure and financial resources.
