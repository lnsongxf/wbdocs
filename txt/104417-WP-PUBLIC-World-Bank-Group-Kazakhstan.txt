Kazakhstan possesses a significant forest resource of 11.5 million hectares of forested land, which in absolute terms is the
third-largest forest area in the Europe and Central Asia region. These forests are home to a biodiversity of global
significance and play an important role in preserving the soil, wildlife and watershed management, and tourism. They are
also a key to protecting the watershed of the Aral Sea Basin and to reducing the desertification and siltation of waterways
and reservoirs. About 300,000 people directly depend on the sector, while an estimated 2.5 million live in or rely on the
forests for fuel, fodder, and other resources. Kazakhstan’s forests, like the rest of its vast natural resources, have been
subject to various challenges associated with the transition. The threats to forests have intensified in recent years as
government funds have dwindled, hindering even the most basic forest management activities.
The Project Development Objective is to develop and initiate ways of cost-effective and sustainable environmental
rehabilitation and management of forest lands and associated rangelands, with a focus on the Irtysh Pine Forest, the Dry
Aral Seabed (DAS), and the saxaul rangelands (saxaul is a plant growing in Central Asian deserts). The development
objective is both local and global in nature.
The project will address a range of forestry sector issues through the following components:
  1. Reforestation activities and the purchase of fire management equipment in the Irtysh Pine Forest
  2. Amelioration of the Dry Aral Seabed
  3. Capacity building of the national forestry institution


Implementation Status and Key Results:
    About 40,600 hectares in the Irtysh Pine Forest have been planted to help rehabilitate the forest and reverse fire
     degradation trends.
    Land degradation has been prevented on the Dry Aral Seabed, with 56,500 hectares of dry seabed area covered with
     vegetation, including 47,100 hectares planted with project resources.
    Rangeland management activities on 20 demonstration sites have been fully completed. Some 168,000 hectares benefit
     from the improved access to water for livestock.
    To date, about 7,000 people have been employed under other project activities (planting, construction works,
     competitive grants, etc.).
    Construction of the Nursery and Seed Complex is nearing completion and scheduled to be operational in June 2015.
    Five councils for participatory forest management were created and are operational in the Irtysh Pine Forest.
    The capacity of forestry authorities significantly increased through improved knowledge of modern planting and fire
     management technologies and natural resource dynamics and also through management gained from project activities,
     study tours abroad, and inland trainings.

Kazakhstan ranks among the top 10 most energy-intensive economies in the world and uses more than three times as much
energy per unit of GDP as the countries in the European Union (EU). This high energy intensity results in significant costs
for the country in terms of economic competitiveness, public health, and the environment. Reducing the inefficient use of
energy would allow Kazakhstan to save up to US$1.3 billion per year in energy expenditures in the public and private
sectors.

International experience shows that public buildings can readily achieve 20–40 percent energy savings through cost-effective
retrofits. To this end, the project will support investments in energy-efficient upgrades in about 75 public and social
buildings throughout the country. These improvements are expected to enhance the working conditions of more than
30,000 pupils, teachers, hospital patients, children, doctors, and others benefiting from improved indoor comfort levels in
these buildings.

The Project Development Objective is to improve the energy efficiency in public and social facilities and the enabling
environment for sustainable energy financing. The project will address a range of energy-efficiency issues through the
following components:
     1. The upgrading and modernization of public and social facilities, such as schools, kindergartens, clinics/hospitals,
        and street lighting;
     2. Technical assistance to help address the existing financial, technical, institutional, and legislative barriers that are
        preventing the public sector from tapping into its large energy savings potential.

Implementation Status and Key Results:
     Following the signing of the grant and project agreements on July 18, 2014, the Law on the Ratification of the Project
      passed the Parliament and was submitted to the President for approval.
     All of the project’s effectiveness conditions have been met, including the following: the Steering Committee has been
      set up, the Subsidiary Agreement has been signed, the Project Operational Manual was adopted, the project
      implementation unit (PIU) has been set up and staffed, and the Memorandum of Understanding between MID, EEDI,
      and Akimats oblast have been signed, as well as the project agreement between EEDI and the social facilities.
     The project implementing agency (EEDI) has commenced the project implementation activities. Nineteen subprojects
      in Atyrau, Mangistau, Karaganda, Kyzylorda, Pavlodar, and East Kazakhstan oblasts have been selected for the first
      year of implementation. The procurement of an energy audit and the designing and hiring of supervision consultants is
      ongoing.
     Three technical assistance activities were included in the first year of project implementation: (i) a comprehensive
      energy-efficiency market assessment of Kazakhstan; (ii) computerization of the State Energy Registry; and (iii) a public

The project will address the environmental pollution in Ust-Kamenogorsk City, linked to industrial hazardous waste
accumulated before 1990. The project will optimize the design and implementation of a program for groundwater cleanup and
the remediation of waste disposal sites in Ust-Kamenogorsk based on technical, economic, financial, social, and ecological
assessments. In addition, the project will cover investments and activities to control groundwater downstream of treatment
sites and the development of a long-term Groundwater Quality Monitoring System.
The Project Development Objective is to prevent contaminated groundwater from becoming a risk for residential areas,
drinking water resources, and the Irtysh River, and to strengthen the institutional mechanisms for groundwater quality
monitoring.
The Project comprises the following components:
1. Containment of high-priority sources of groundwater contamination (US$19.36 million). This component will develop
     immediate cleanup activities to prevent further infiltration into the aquifer of contamination from the identified high-risk
     waste dumps and slurry ponds located within or near the city, mostly in the area of the Central Industrial Complex.
2. Remediation of Current Contaminated Groundwater Sites (US$20.13 million). This component includes two
     subcomponents: (i) a pump and treat groundwater remediation system; and (ii) a groundwater quality monitoring network.
     This component will support the interception, treatment, and monitoring of contaminated groundwater in the project area
     and prevent the further migration of groundwater with unacceptable contamination levels to sensitive areas, groundwater
     users, and the Irtysh River.

Implementation Status and Key Results:
   Investigation program to assess the contamination level of seven industrial high-priority waste dumps in Ust-
    Kamenogorsk was concluded, and the detailed design for remediation of these industrial waste dumps developed. State
    approval for the detailed design has been obtained for six out of seven industrial waste dumps.
   Civil works started in April 2013. The rehabilitation of four industrial waste dumps is about to be fully completed, work
    on two other industrial waste dumps is pending the Ministry of Agriculture’s facilitation, and one waste dump was already
    remediated with public funding when the design work for the other waste dump remediation was carried out.
   Telemetry, leak detection, and other equipment has been supplied at the Vodokanal. The water leakage reduction program
    in Ust-Kamenogorsk is being implemented. Laboratory equipment to measure heavy metals and organic chemicals in the
    ground, surface water, and soil in Ust-Kamenogorsk has been successfully installed, and laboratory staff trained.
   Detailed sampling and analysis have been undertaken in the Capacitator sludge pond for laboratory analysis to determine
    the precise concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and required remediation technologies in line with the
    Stockholm Convention. Technical options of the treatment system confirmed and tested; works are completed.
   The Groundwater Monitoring Program for the groundwater remediation component is being implemented. Twenty-two
    multilevel monitoring wells drilled and installed. The design of the groundwater treatment system has been finalized,
    reviewed, and actively discussed by all parties concerned.

Kazakhstan is the ninth-largest country in the world, with a land area equal to that of Western Europe. The upgrade of the
Western Europe-Western China (WE-WC) Road Corridor is among the top priorities of Kazakhstan’s infrastructure
development agenda. It is the main road corridor crossing Kazakhstan from the border with China in the southeast, through
Almaty, Taraz, Shymkent, Kyzylorda, and Aktobe, to the border with Russia (a total of 2,787 kilometers). The construction
of the corridor started in 2009. The World Bank is financing the rehabilitation of a section of the corridor in the south of
Kazakhstan.
The Project Development Objective is to increase transport and trade efficiency along the 1,150-kilometer road section
from the border of Aktobe/Kyzylorda oblasts to the border of South Kazakhstan (SKO) and Zhambyl oblasts, and to
improve road management and traffic safety in Kazakhstan. The project will boost Kazakhstan’s (and its neighbors’) trade,
competitiveness, logistics, and infrastructure connections with the world, while providing an artery for regional economic
cooperation. The upgrading of the corridor will facilitate a more efficient movement of goods and people and improve road
safety. It will also facilitate industrial, agricultural, and commercial activities, with improved trade and services along the road
and in adjacent towns and cities.
The Project comprises five components:
  1. Upgrade and reconstruction of road sections (788.5 kilometers, two-lane infrastructure north of Kyzylorda and four-
      lane infrastructure south of Kyzylorda) within Kyzylorda oblast.
  2. Upgrade and reconstruction of road sections within SKO (361.5 kilometers of four-lane infrastructure).
  3. Assistance to the Committee for Roads (CR) with the management of activities associated with the projects funded by
      other international financial institutions.
  4. Institutional development and preparation of action plans to improve road safety and road services.
  5. Supervision of civil works.
Implementation Status and Key Results:
More than two-thirds of the road length is open to traffic, with 90 percent of the works completed.
 Works are ongoing on the additional 80 kilometer section, a four-lane highway along the same road corridor (east of
   Shymkent), which became part of the project after its first restructuring in 2012.
 In 2014, the Borrower requested to restructure the project for the second time to allow the financing of one more
   additional section of 85 kilometers and to commit US$217 million of accrued savings, resulting from the lower cost and
   more efficient procurement of civil works and also the devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge.

The East-West Roads Project is part of the Government’s plan to upgrade and improve the international transit corridor
linking Europe and Russia to China through Kazakhstan (a total of 2,787 kilometers). The Bank has been helping to
upgrade 1,150 kilometers of the corridor through the financing of the ongoing South-West Roads Project. The East-West
Roads Project is expected to provide an efficient transport link from Almaty—one of the major economic centers of Central
Asia—to Khorgos, the primary road border crossing point between Kazakhstan and China, thereby completing the upgrade
of the WE-WC Road Corridor.
The Project Development Objectives are to increase transport efficiency along the section of the WE-WC Road Corridor
within Almaty oblast and to modernize highway management on sections of the WE-WC Road Corridor.
The project will provide an efficient transport link from Almaty to Khorgos, thereby completing the upgrade of the WE-
WC Corridor. The upgrading of this 305-kilometer long section of the WE-WC Road Corridor in Almaty oblast would
facilitate a more efficient movement of goods and people and improve road safety. It would also facilitate industrial,
agricultural, and commercial activities, with improved trade and services along the new road and in adjacent towns and
cities.
Long-Term Development Impact:
The project will focus on increasing the quality of services provided to road users, including a reduction in road user costs
and improved road safety and services, by undertaking pilot operation and maintenance activities along the WE-WC Road
Corridor. Additionally, a study will be launched to review different user pay mechanisms, such as tolling options, to help the
Government to recover costs for the operation and maintenance of parts of the corridor. Based on the experience of the
pilot activities, the study will also develop realistic cost estimates for the operation and maintenance of the other road
corridors in Kazakhstan.
The Project comprises two components:
  1. Upgrade and construction of the road section of the WE-WC Road Corridor within Almaty oblast
  2. Modernization of highway management on sections along the WE-WC Road Corridor
Implementation Status and Key Results:
    Procurement for all eight lots, civil works, and the supervision consultancy was completed by the time the project
     became effective to fully utilize the construction season.
    JSC KazAvtoZhol National Roads Operating Company has been authorized to implement day-to-day management
     and operation functions under the project, with the Roads Committee responsible for overall project implementation.
     Institutional strengthening activities are being procured to support the development of a tolling strategy for the road
     section from Almaty to Khorgos and to support the development of a concept and instruments for operation and
     maintenance of the road network.
    In 2014, the Borrower requested to restructure the project to allow the financing of one more additional section of 98
     kilometers between the border with Uzbekistan and Almaty toward the border with Kyrgyzstan and to commit
     US$213 million of accrued savings, resulting from the lower cost and more efficient procurement of civil works and
     also the devaluation of the Kazakhstan tenge.

Kazakhstan, a fast growing middle-income country, has a vision of becoming an industrialized country by 2025, but low
work force productivity and huge gaps in skills are major impediments to increased competitiveness. The present technical
and vocational education (TVE) system in Kazakhstan has been engineered to support a command economy and therefore
today, suffers from a lack of linkages to a market economy and faces daunting challenges in terms of relevance,
management, quality, and internal efficiency.
The Project Development Objective is to raise the relevance, quality, and efficiency of TVE through an improved policy
framework and institutional capacity. In the long term, the project will help (i) improve the employability of TVE graduates,
as the quality of TVE rises and “new quality” TVE graduates are more demanded in the labor market; (ii) increase rates of
returns to TVE as the skills and competencies of the graduates of the new TVE system are significantly enhanced and
match the requirements of the dynamic labor market; and (iii) increase workforce productivity and competitiveness as a
result of the increased supply of new skills that are of high quality and relevance.
The project aims to assist Kazakhstan in linking the supply of skills to the demands of industries and employers and focuses
on: (i) developing the National Qualifications System and occupational standards in selected priority sectors and upgrading
the assessment of the qualifications and institutional accreditation of TVE institutions; (ii) modernizing the governance,
management, and financing policies and structures for TVE; and (iii) strengthening the skills delivery capacity of TVE
institutions through competitive financing of the institutional development of both public and private providers.

Implementation Status and Key Results:
    Project implementation accelerated in 2013, attributable to the progress on policy development and the strengthening
     of the institutional capacity of TVE institutions, resulting in total disbursement at 64 percent.
     As a result of policy development, the National Qualification System, 13 sector qualifications frameworks, and 147
     occupational standards covering 10 economic sectors were adopted by the Government. Close coordination and
     partnership between the Ministry of Education, Ministry of Labor and Social Protection, sector ministries, employers,
     and the business community represent a significant achievement at the institutional and policy level.
    The financing mechanisms of the TVE system have been revisited to reflect best international practices on funds
     distribution through a per capita financing model. Pilots will be launched in two regions, complemented by the training
     of local government officials and college administrators.
    The educational capacity of TVE institutions has increased as a result of the professional development of teachers in
     support of a competency-based modular curriculum. The second round of competitive grants was carried out in 2014.
     Forty-one colleges (in addition to the 27 in 2012) from the remaining nine regions received grants to enhance
     institutional development, provide teacher training, develop a competency-based curriculum, and strengthen social
     partnerships through dual-system training programs at the plants. The last round of grants is planned in 2015 to
     strengthen the collaboration of 15 colleges with industry representatives and to finalize the pilot of new education
     standards.
    The development of new education standards and a core curriculum linked to occupational standards is under way,
     with methodology developed in 2014 and standards planned for piloting in 2015.

Youth development is regarded as an important national issue in Kazakhstan, which is reflected in the ratification of the
first Law on State Youth Policy in the Republic of Kazakhstan in 2004. Three domains appear to be important for positive
youth development in Kazakhstan: (i) community engagement/service, to promote concern for the welfare of others
and enhance young people’s integration into society, (ii) skills development, in particular behavioral/life and technical
skills that are needed to make the transition from school to productive employment, and (iii) initiative, to tap into young
people’s naturally inventive, creative, and enterprising characteristics. The proposed project supports the Government’s
various policies related to youth, particularly the Concept of State Youth Policy 2020. The project is also aligned with the
overarching objectives of the Country Partnership Strategy (CPS), specifically “improving competiveness and fostering job
creation.”
The Project Development Objective (PDO) is to promote positive youth development in Kazakhstan through service
learning opportunities that serve the community while enhancing youth initiative and life skills. The project is expected to
also bring about wider recognition among the public that youth can be both an asset and part and parcel of the building
blocks of a just society.
1. Expected beneficiaries of the project are:
        Young people participating in the community-based service learning and skills development program: Youth
         (aged 14–29) will benefit from opportunities to participate in a community-based service learning and life skills
         development program. A cohort of youth will also benefit from access to entrepreneurial training and capital to launch
         their own community-based service learning activities. In total, the project is expected to benefit 8,500 young people,
         of which approximately 5,100 (60 percent of total direct beneficiaries) will be vulnerable youth.
        Youth-focused organization staff and Ministry of Education and Science officials: Some 150 youth-focused
         organizations will benefit from opportunities to implement community-based service learning programs with youth.
         They will receive training and become part of a network of organizations that focus on youth issues. Technical
         assistance to the Ministry of Education and Science (MOES) will help enhance the policy institutional framework and
         fiduciary and monitoring capacity.
2. Expected key PDO level results of the proposed project include:
-       Share of subgrant programs rated satisfactory at completion
-       Share of youth project beneficiaries who feel able to make a positive contribution to their community
-       Share of youth project beneficiaries who demonstrate an improvement in defined noncognitive skills
-       Direct project beneficiaries, of whom (i) vulnerable youth – 60 percent, (ii) female – 55 percent, and (iii) youth with
        disabilities – 5 percent
3. The project comprises three components:
-       Subgrants for Community-Based Service Learning and Life Skills Development (US$20 million)
-       Institutional Development for Youth Policy Implementation (US$0.763 million)
-       Project Management, Monitoring, and Evaluation (US$1 million)

Implementation Status and Key Results:
           The project was approved by the World Bank’s Europe and Central Asia Regional Vice President on March 25,
            2014. The next steps are Grant Agreement signing and project effectiveness.
           To start implementation of the project, subsequent ratification of the Grant Agreement by the national parliament
            is required. This step is expected to be completed by the Government of Kazakhstan by June 2015.

Kazakhstan stands on the doorstep of a new stage of social and economic modernization and political democratization.
The Government foresees the creation and strengthening of the rule of law and judicial institutions as an essential
component of this new stage of modernization for Kazakhstan. That is the main reason that Kazakhstan’s authorities
envisage the Justice Sector Institutional Strengthening Project (JSISP) as a strategic instrument to strengthen the
institutional capacity and performance of core justice sector entities and deliver measurable results; because of the
importance of this agenda, the Presidential Administration itself is overseeing project preparation.
The Project Development Objectives are to (a) strengthen the institutional capacity of selected agencies for effective
implementation of selected laws and (b) improve the efficiency and transparency of and access to select public services in
the justice sector.
The project will address a range of justice sector issues through the following components:
  4.   Strengthening the Implementation of Key Elements of the Legal and Institutional Framework
  5.   Improving Ministry of Justice Service Quality and Responsiveness
  6.   Strengthening Judicial Efficiency and Professionalism
  7.   Promoting Project Implementation, Coordination, and Fellowships
Key Expected Results:
      Strengthened institutional capacity of designated agencies for effective implementation of selected laws measured by
       private sector satisfaction level with the implementation of the Commercial Code, a new Law on Self-Regulatory
       Professional Organizations, and the Administrative Offenses Code.
      Improved efficiency of selected justice services measured by JSISP-supported pilot court-users’ satisfaction level with
       the quality of judicial services.
      Improved transparency of selected justice services.
      Improved access to selected justice services measured by the growth in the number of eligible persons, including
       women beneficiaries, provided with legal aid.
      Strengthened professionalism of judges and other public servants of the justice system.

The Technology Commercialization Project (TCP) was designed to revamp the way science is conducted and perceived and
contributes to social and economic development in Kazakhstan. Owing to several innovative design features, the TCP is
well positioned to effectively restore important productive linkages between scientific research and the private sector,
thereby contributing to improved innovation and commercialization outcomes. It is aligned with the Government’s efforts
to diversify and improve the regional and international competitiveness of the Kazakhstani economy.
The Project Development Objective is to demonstrate the significantly improved scientific performance and commercial
relevance of research performed by interdisciplinary teams of scientists selected through transparent competitive processes
in line with international best practice. By using merit-based selection procedures, the project will help to rebuild,
strengthen, and restructure segments of Kazakhstan’s research and development (R&D) base. The project will also help to
link this rejuvenated R&D capacity to integrate into national and international technology markets.
Project components include:
   1. Competitive grant program selected and overseen by the International Science and Commercialization Board to

   completion. Within three selection rounds, 33 scientific groups received funding for research activities, with a high
   potential for commercialization. The grant program’s tangible results so far: 10 scientific groups have reached or are
   very near to entering the commercialization stage, including six that have made their first sales; scientists have published
   articles in international peer-reviewed scientific journals; and one group has attracted foreign equity investment, another
   group has established an operational pilot production line for its products, and another group is running field tests in
   cooperation with a potential buyer of the technology.
 The IMSC is operating on the site of Karagandy State Technical University, under close guidance of the International
   Science and Commercialization Board.
 The TCO is working in partnership with a reputable international technology commercialization contractor, CRDF
   Global, and has run several knowledge-sharing and capacity-building workshops in Kazakhstan and one in the United
   States in addition to completing two selection rounds of grant applications for technology commercialization grants for
   prototype development and proof of concept.

In 2003, the World Bank and the Government of Kazakhstan embarked on a Joint Economic Research Program
(JERP), a key instrument in responding to the country’s core priorities in the medium-term development agenda. Thirteen
years on, the program has proved to be an innovative solution, with a client-driven knowledge agenda and Bank-selected
work, bringing in and building up international experience while developing wider lessons of a public good character. The
JERP is structured around the Country Partnership Strategy pillars focusing on development gaps in growth, governance,
and the public service delivery agenda. The JERP is a unique program of analytical work and technical assistance aimed at
building up the capacity to adapt the knowledge transferred. The program is designed to ensure strong government
ownership while enhancing the Bank’s contribution to the country’s development in a way that goes beyond funding. In
order to maximize its effectiveness as a knowledge service instrument, the JERP was transformed into a programmatic
structure in mid-2011 with activities developed as multiyear and interconnected engagements. The new structure proved to
be more effective in increasing and tracking the impact of the JERP by improving the strategic focus of the program and
providing more room to fully exploit analytical insight, capacity support, and synergies between sector works.
Programming as part of the JERP continued in 2015 with the inclusion of blocks of activities arranged by thematic groups
as identified in the Partnership Framework Arrangement (PFA).
A highlight of the JERP—the brainstorming session, co-chaired by the Prime Minister—brings the highest level of
Government, World Bank management, and experienced practitioners together for in-depth discussions on key
development issues. Since 2003, 18 brainstorming sessions have provided direct input into the Government’s ambitious
reform agenda.
The JERP for FY15 comprises 12 standard JERP activities that include a number of ongoing programmatic tasks as well as
one-year tasks requested by various government agencies that are not a part of the PFA program for a total of US$1.95
million, and 21 PFA technical assistance activities, aligned by eight thematic groups, for a total of US$7.845 million.
Key Achieved Results: In terms of results, the JERP has informed policies and built capacity in wide-ranging areas of the
Government’s reform program, such as macroeconomic management; public financial management; education, health, and
social protection; financial sector supervision; and private sector development. In some of these sectors, Kazakhstan has
become a leader in the region and a source of good practices for other countries.
Among the key JERP-supported results:
    Advisory support on public resource management led to improvements in public investment planning followed by a
     full assessment of budget/financial management systems, resulting in a new Budget Code, a new multiyear budget
     preparation system, an effective treasury system, and other efficiency-improving measures.
    Review of Kazakhstan’s tax policy and administration framework translated into the development of a new Tax Code
     based on JERP recommendations.
    Advisory services helped the Government to avoid fiscally risky general bailout strategies in the wake of the financial
     sector crisis and to balance macroeconomic and monetary stability with sustainable growth objectives while
     continuing to provide advisory support to maintain prudent management of oil revenues. Design of a countercyclical
     fiscal policy helped assess and improve the cyclicality of the Government’s economic policies.
    The Bank provided advisory assistance toward the establishment of a Committee for Financial Monitoring under the
     Ministry of Finance to lead efforts in Anti-Money Laundering and Combating Terrorism Financing.
    Assistance with civil service reform, enhancement of the public sector audit system, and implementation of the
     Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative contributed to increased transparency and accountability in public sector
     operations through the introduction of new legislation, regulations, and institutional arrangements.
    In the social protection area, policy advisory support is translating into a new employment program and social safety
     net system with a Conditional Cash Transfer component to improve the balance between the protection and
     promotion objectives of the Government’s interventions.
    In the health sector, analytical work initiated under the JERP has evolved into a comprehensive joint project
     (covering health program planning, financial management, quality improvement, reform of medical education and
     pharmaceutical policy, and food safety measures) that is now building international standards and institutional
     capacity in the health sector.
    Advisory support to the development of a new social modernization strategy informs the Government’s evolving
     program on the financing and delivery of social services for accelerated improvement of human capital outcomes.
    Assistance with business environment reforms has facilitated (i) a steady improvement in business entry and exit
     conditions, payment of taxes, and protection of investment rights, leading to an accelerated improvement in
     Kazakhstan’s overall Doing Business rating to 50th in 2014 from 74th in 2010; and (ii) the simplification of the licensing
     and permits regime through the development of a risk-based methodology.
    Assistance to Kazakhstan’s Export Promotion and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) Attraction Agency helped
     strengthen its institutional capacity to support local exporters and potential foreign investors toward establishing
     sustainable, long-term partnerships in foreign markets.
    A JERP assessment to strengthen national statistics supported the development of a Statistical Master Plan, which is
     now being implemented through a joint project as well as other government interventions.
    JERP analytical work on the improvement of industrial competitiveness through cleaner and greener production
     helped with an assessment of the economic and health costs of air pollution and the subsequent design of air
     pollution monitoring and emission registration systems.
    Technical assistance on agricultural reform helped deepen the analysis of specific subsidies programs and supported
     the development of impact monitoring and evaluation tools for the necessary reform.

                                   IFC ADVISORY SERVICES IN KAZAKHSTAN

The International Finance Corporation (IFC), a member of the
World Bank Group, provides advisory support to help private sector
clients in Kazakhstan attract investment by promoting resource
efficiency, strengthening corporate governance, and improving risk
management practices. IFC also supports microfinance institutions in
expanding access to finance for micro entrepreneurs and helps food
processing firms to improve safety standards.

Helping Companies and Banks Improve Corporate Governance
The Challenge: Corporate governance continues to be a subject of significant market concern in the Europe and Central
Asia (ECA) region. Many companies and banks in ECA remain vulnerable to corporate governance challenges and lack the
experience needed to strengthen their corporate governance practices. Local institutions are also not sufficiently developed
to be able to deliver full-fledged corporate governance services independently.
The IFC Approach: The IFC Corporate Governance Program in ECA (i) assists individual companies and banks in
implementing good corporate governance practices, leading to improved performance and increased investment
attractiveness; (ii) strengthens the capacity of local partner institutions; and (iii) contributes to the development of laws,
codes, regulations, and other corporate governance tools.
Key Achievements: Since 2012, the project has helped local partner institutions raise nearly US$412,000 in sales revenue
through corporate governance work; assisted in improving the performance of 37 companies; helped 19 companies access
financing in the amount of US$437 million; and contributed to the drafting and adoption of 19 laws and regulations.

Strengthening Microfinance
The Challenge: To grow further and in a sustainable manner, microfinance institutions in Kazakhstan need to expand their
reach to attract more clients with a diverse product and service range supported by a stronger funding base. To build a
stronger funding base, microfinance institutions can transform into a wider financial organizations, deposit-taking
institutions, or even banks.
The IFC Approach: IFC is working with selected microfinance institutions in Kazakhstan to strengthen and build capacity
by developing a modular package of fee-based advisory services. The modules cover such areas as financial management,
assets and liabilities management, funding strategies, treasury, development of deposit products, and risk management.
Key Achievements: IFC helped Arnur Credit microfinance institution to strengthen its human resources management and
corporate governance. IFC facilitated US$2 million in financing for Arnur Credit. The developmental impact is far reaching
in terms of economic support to entrepreneurs in Kazakhstan, especially in rural areas. IFC helped small entrepreneurs to
access finance and build business assets across the country.

Helping the Food Industry Improve Safety Standards
The Challenge: Improved food safety systems and practices can help food producers in Central Asia increase exports and
become more competitive.
The IFC Approach: IFC advises food producers in implementing HACCP (Hazard Analysis Critical Control Point), the
international food safety management system. Together with Metro Cash & Carry, IFC is also raising awareness about best
practices in food safety across the entire agro supply chain.
Key Achievements: The program trained more than 30 food industry participants and partnered with the Entrepreneurship
Fund DAMU and Kazakhstan Food Producers Union to stimulate the development of local institutional capacity and help
food businesses implement food safety standards.

Increasing the Resource Efficiency of Private Firms
The Challenge: Efficient use of power, energy, raw materials, and water along a company’s value chain not only helps
conserve resources and reduce waste, pollution, and greenhouse gas emissions, but can also reduce operating costs. Yet
many firms in ECA remain unaware of the potential cost savings and environmental benefits and are reluctant to invest.
The IFC Approach: The IFC ECA Resource Efficiency Program works at the firm and sector levels to stimulate
investment into resource-efficient technologies and practices. It helps improve management and operational practices in
industry across all sectors; raises awareness among decision makers; and drives market transformation through sector
studies such as benchmarking and assessment tools.
Expected Results: In ECA, the program will facilitate the investment of around US$90 million (including US$60 million
from IFC) and a reduction of CO2 emissions by 1.2 million tons.
Donor Partners: The Governments of Austria, the Netherlands, and Switzerland.

Eastcomtrans is one of the largest private railway operators in the transport market of Kazakhstan and has been operating
since 2003. It provides a full range of freight railway services for export, import, and domestic traffic. The company has
been a leader in providing oil product transportation services by railway. Eastcomtrans, with a fleet of about 8,350 railcars,
also provides railcars to major Kazakh and Russian companies on an operating lease basis.

IFC provided Eastcomtrans with long-term financing to help expand its railcar fleet, broadening commercial logistics
services and helping develop the country’s infrastructure for trade and industry. The investment will help Eastcomtrans to
expand its operations and meet the growing demand for new and reliable railcars in the country.

IFC’s investment will enable Eastcomtrans to continue its growth and assist it in diversifying its fleet and client base, while
also allowing it to continue to grow its proprietary freight forwarding business. This is IFC’s first investment in the
country’s railway sector, helping increase the quality and availability of rail transportation, reduce costs, and increase
transport reliability in Kazakhstan.

Key Expected Results:

The project’s anticipated development impact would be:
    Supporting the continued development of a key player in the still nascent private rail sector.
    Contributing to the development of the transportation and logistics sectors in Kazakhstan.
    Helping renew Kazakhstan’s aged railcar fleet and helping avoid a supply crisis over the next 5–10 years, as about
        half of the existing fleet needs to be retired.
