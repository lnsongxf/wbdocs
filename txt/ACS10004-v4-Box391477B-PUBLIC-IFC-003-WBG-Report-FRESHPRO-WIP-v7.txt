THE FRUIT OF HER LABOR
PROMOTING GENDER-EQUITABLE AGRIBUSINESS
IN PAPUA NEW GUINEA
FRESH PRODUCE SECTOR


I. BACKGROUND AND CONTEXT
The World Bank Group recently completed a study of gender issues in three agribusiness supply
chains in Papua New Guinea (PNG), including fresh produce. It found women to be key to ensuring
quality in agriculture. Therefore, it recommends that if PNG wants to bring better quality fresh
produce to market, it needs to focus on the contribution of women; improving their skills and
capacities and giving women a greater share of the benefits.

Agriculture accounts for approximately one-third of GDP, and the sector is dominated by
smallholders.


   The fresh produce industry has great potential in PNG. Market demand for fresh produce
   is likely to remain high in years to come, due largely to resource-led development, increased
   urbanization and a general rise in standards of living.

   Unlike coffee and cocoa, where the product is destined for export and the market is limited
   to a small number of exporters, markets for fresh produce in PNG are very diverse, and the
   supply chains are extremely varied.

   The key market segments for fresh produce include supermarkets, institutions, kai bars,
   distributors, and urban markets, all of which require different product attributes from their
   suppliers in terms of quality, quantity, shelf-life, and reliability of supply.


This document summarizes the main findings and recommendations relating to the fresh produce
sector from the joint World Bank-IFC report The Fruit of Her Labor: Promoting Gender-Equitable
Agribusiness in Papua New Guinea.

The report and sector summaries were prepared by consultants C. Mark Blackden (mblackden@
comcast.net) and Maxie Makambo Dominic (makambo020368@gmail.com), under the overall
guidance of Anuja Utz (autz@worldbank.org) and Amy Luinstra (aluinstra@ifc.org).
