Note: The distance to frontier score shows how far on average an economy is from the best performance achieved by
any economy on each Doing Business indicator. Starting a business is comparable to 2010. Getting credit, protecting
minority investors, paying taxes and resolving insolvency had methodology changes in 2014 and thus are only
comparable to 2013. Dealing with construction permits, registering property, trading across borders, enforcing
contracts and getting electricity had methodology changes in 2015 and thus are only comparable to 2014. The measure
is normalized to range between 0 and 100, with 100 representing the best performance (the frontier). See the data notes
starting on page 119 of the Doing Business 2016 report for more details on the distance to frontier score.

economies with an extreme total tax rate (a rate that is

greater impact on both these distance to frontier scores

  See Djankov, Manraj and others (2005). Principal components and
unobserved components methods yield a ranking nearly identical to
that from the simple average method because both these methods
assign roughly equal weights to the topics, since the pairwise
correlations among indicators do not differ much. An alternative to the
simple average method is to give different weights to the topics,
depending on which are considered of more or less importance in the
context of a specific economy.

  For getting credit, indicators are weighted proportionally, according
to their contribution to the total score, with a weight of 60% assigned
to the strength of legal rights index and 40% to the depth of credit
information index. Indicators for all other topics are assigned equal
weights
