Towards better investment in rural communities
The aim of Solomon Islands — Towards Better Investment in Rural Communities
is to assist policymakers, program sponsors and implementers to make informed
decisions about the design, financing, governance and overall advantages and
disadvantages of programs that invest in small-scale infrastructure and income-
generating opportunities for rural communities in the Solomon Islands.

Completed in mid-2014, the report identifies ways to strengthen the current
mechanisms for investing in rural service delivery by examining the three main
types of financing for small-scale infrastructure and livelihood activities —
constituency, province and community-oriented funds — in a national and
global context across four key programs between 2008 and 2012. A summary of
the programs is provided in Table 1.

The report explores the following key components across the four programs:
analysis and consolidation of sub-project data; local development planning;
efficiency and effectiveness; accountability, transparency and dispute
management; and sustainability.

context
Solomon Islands faces a range of challenges
in local governance and the delivery of basic
services, from low-income and fragility to a
highly dispersed population.                                           Locals travel between islands for supplies in the Solomon Islands.

Provincial
and Sector
Use of Funds
While there are some distortions in the data such as
the absence of RDP funding in Guadalcanal, Central,
Rennell and Bellona provinces, the highest proportion
of overall provincial investment in the Solomon
Islands was found in Malaita Province (25%),
followed by Western (19.3%). Per capita, the highest
investment was in Temotu ($US 576) and Choiseul
($US 539). To achieve greater equity, efforts should
be made to bring provincial per capita amounts closer
into alignment. Adjustments could also be made to
account for the cost of extreme remoteness, but this
should be based primarily on cost data.                          A sea wall is constructed to protect a small island in Malaita from
                                                                 losing land to erosion from the sea.

 As Table 3 illustrates, program funding was highest for the housing and community amenities sector (31%), followed by education. Water supply accounted
 for 63 per cent of the housing and community amenities sector, while 43 per cent of education sector funds was allocated to secondary education (43 per cent
 of education total) followed by primary education (37 per cent) and pre-primary (14 per cent).

      Efficiency & Effectiveness
                         “There is a lack of information available regarding rural investments
                        and this is an impediment to assessing development results and planning
                                      future investments at the sub-national level.”

            To assess efficiency and effectiveness, and allow for a
            visual comparison, a set of 10 performance measures
            was developed and each program was rated on a 3-point
            scale (weak, satisfactory and strong).
                 Findings
                    There is a trade-off between the speed of disbursement and quality
                    assurance processes, and each of the programs can benefit from
                    improvements in different areas.

Accountability,
Transparency &
Dispute Management
Findings
 Accountability from the programs to national government is reasonably
 strong in the cases of PCDF and RDP, with each convening regular project
 committee meetings and sharing progress reports. However, there are
 limited-to-no accountability mechanisms in place between communities
 and service providers to monitor the quality of service delivery.

 RCLF has no means of reporting progress to government stakeholders,
 except through ad hoc audits done by the Auditor General which have, to
 date not been circulated, even within government.

 There is very little information as to how RCLF funds are used, at all levels
 of government and society. This lack of information and accountability
 stokes concern and criticism of waste, fraud and corruption, which
 occasionally make their way into the media and public discourse (there
 is no regular media coverage).

 While there have been disputes regarding land and other natural
 resources, this has not escalated to violence. It appears informal and/or
 traditional mechanisms for resolving disputes in place are working even
 if they are not able to uphold agreements made with respect to the sub-
 projects.

              Overall Recommendations
There are major policy and program shifts underway for rural community infrastructure and service delivery in the Solomon Islands,
including a policy guiding use of constituency funds (2013 CDF Act and draft CDF Regulations). The Rural Development Program is
entering its second phase (RDP 2). The Provincial Government Strengthening Program, which previously supported PCDF, has concluded,
so PCDF is solely supported by government now. RAMP has come to an end. While each province is different, and flexibility is therefore
required, a framework is needed to illustrate how these and other rural, sub-national investment programs and activities fit together and
how public and donor funds can be leveraged to greatest effect.

The three overarching recommendations to help to design an improved second generation of rural service delivery programs in the
Solomon Islands are —



         1. Redefine Funding Streams
Redefine the three main funding streams — provincial, constituency and community.
Funds should be aligned to clarified and distinct mandates as well as appropriate capacities for implementation. Financing of similar activities across the funding
streams should be minimised (see Table 3).

 Provincial     Multi-ward benefits; major, yet medium-scale investments which require          Primary and secondary schools; hospitals and health clinics; major housing
                technical expertise; infrastructure maintained through recurrent service        projects; provincial administration infrastructure and equipment; provincial
                delivery grants (e.g. health); investments aligned to PG mandates in the        roads, and townships; and pumped water supply.
                PG Act; and sub-projects that lend themselves to contractor delivery.
 Constituency Sub-projects that can be managed and monitored by sector ministries;              Sustainable livelihood projects (agriculture, aquaculture and horticulture,
              income-generating support based on solid business plans; rapid response           manufacturing, sustainable forest products); minor road or bridge repairs;
              to disaster; living condition improvements for disadvantaged households;          improved housing stock; improved electricity access; supplies to rebuild houses,
              co-financing of provincial or community- level projects; CDF funds could          supply food, water and shelter, etc., after a disaster; and emergency repair of

              implementation.
 Community      Infrastructure that can be operated and maintained primarily by                 Small feeder roads,
                community-generated funding and labor; investments that have broad              ildings that already exist; community water supply and sanitation; community
                community benefit and have been prioritised by the community;                   electricity supply such as solar charging stations, mini-grid and micro-hydro;

                200,000.




              2. Redistribute and Institutionalize Funds
Shift the balance away from spending a majority of rural investment funds on CDFs and
redistribute funds towards the other, well-performing modalities at the provincial and
community levels.
To ensure all three funding streams continue to flow beyond donor financing, the Solomon Island Government should make a long-term commitment through
its development plans and through regularly allocated resources. These grants could be made into recurrent grants, such as a Provincial Development Grant to
complement the existing Provincial Service Grant that largely funds staff and operating expenses. Community or Ward Development Grants could allow Members
of Provincial Assembly to minimise the use of their discretional funds on development and focus instead on constituency engagement, which requires more
modest funds.

Overall
Recommendations
                3. Integrate Processes
   Implement an integrated planning process
  across the funding streams to align with the
        redefined focus of each stream.
The planning process should be fed from the bottom-up, starting with
participatory planning at the village and ward levels, then advancing up
through the provincial and national levels (see Table 4). Coordination across
the various levels and funding programs should be centred around the annual                           Villagers at the opening ceremony of a freshwater
