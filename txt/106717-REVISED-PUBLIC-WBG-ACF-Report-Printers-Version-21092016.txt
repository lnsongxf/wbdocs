Unlocking Africa’s Potential through Vigorous Competition Policy                                                                    i
     Foreword
     In a context of low growth in the global economy, countries are called upon to support the
      implementation of policies to improve the performance of domestic markets, diversify their
     economies, harness increasing integration into the global marketplace, and ensure that welfare
     distribution contributes to shared prosperity. Competition law enforcement and competition policy
     are effective tools for transforming product input markets, and boosting productivity, innovation,
     competitiveness, and inclusive growth. They also help the poorest population groups access a
     wider variety of competitively priced goods. Furthermore, competition in public procurement
     delivers savings for the government and increases the efficiency of infrastructure and social
     services provision. Competition authorities play an important role as champions, advocates, and
     enforcers of competition policy across economies.

     We are pleased to present the “Breaking Down Barriers: Unlocking Africa’s Potential through
     Vigorous Competition Policy” study, prepared by the World Bank Group (WBG) in partnership with
     the African Competition Forum (ACF). This study reviews the status of competition frameworks
     and implementation in Africa and zooms in on three important sectors for Africa’s competitiveness:
     cement, fertilizers, and telecommunications. More than 70 percent of African countries rank in the
     bottom half of countries globally in terms of intensity of local competition and prevalence of
     fundamental policies for market-based competition.

     The ACF is a network of competition authorities in Africa, comprising 29 national authorities
     and four regional authorities. The ACF was established in 2011 to promote the adoption of
     competition laws, help build the capacity of new authorities, and assist in advocating for the
     implementation of competition reforms to the benefit of member countries. The WBG, through
     the work of the Trade and Competitiveness Global Practice’s Competition Policy Cluster, advises
     governments on improving the effectiveness of competition enforcement and policy, generates
     knowledge and analytical products on the importance of competition and the design of stronger
     procompetition frameworks, and supports global initiatives to place competition policy on the
     development agenda.

     This report has been a collaborative effort between the WBG and members of the ACF, reflecting a
     shared vision for promoting competition policy and effective competition law enforcement across
     Africa. Information for this report was gathered through questionnaires, to which 22 jurisdictions
     responded. This report expands the scope of earlier ACF studies, considering not only the status
     of competition law enforcement and competition policy in each economy as a whole but also
     providing an overview of competition dynamics and challenges in selected markets of key sectors.

     The ACF and WBG have sought to take a step forward in the application of regionwide analytical
     tools to understand key risks to competition in vital input sectors, in particular cement, fertilizer,
     and telecommunications. Competition issues in road freight, air transport, and retail are also
     explored. The analysis shows that the effects of industry characteristics, regulations, and trade
     policies shape the competitive dynamics of these sectors and often span borders. There is scope,
     therefore, for national and regional competition authorities to increase their impact by taking

a regional perspective when assessing cases within their jurisdictions. This report brings home the
importance of strong cooperation between agencies involved in implementing competition policy.
The study’s findings on the range of competition policy frameworks in place across Africa—and the
richness of experience in enforcing those frameworks—highlights the great potential for peer-to-
peer learning, both within the region and across regions.

The evidence presented in this report shows how competition policy helps African countries boost
inclusive growth and sustainable development. The report finds that eliminating competition
constraints in food markets could lift families out of poverty. For example, a 10 percent reduction in
the prices of principal food staples is estimated to have the effect of lifting approximately 500,000
people out of poverty in three countries. Fundamental market reforms to increase competition
in key input services would also boost economic growth. For example, reforming professional
services markets would deliver an additional 0.16–0.43 percent of additional annual growth in
gross domestic product. While the benefits of competition are clearly observable in Africa, there
is still considerable effort required to ensure effective implementation of competition laws and
policies across the continent. This study provides an overview of factors to be considered in
pursuing that effort.	

We hope this analysis will raise awareness of the achievements made in Africa, stimulate debate
on how to address the remaining challenges, and reinforce the case for implementing competition
policy and strengthening enforcement of competition laws across the region. This report is a
resource that can be used to expand the understanding of markets and competition dynamics
across governments and to influence public policies more broadly for the benefit of consumers
and businesses in Africa. Based on report findings, we also encourage collaboration between
authorities in developing policy, building capacity, and shaping enforcement activities.

Executive Summary
C   ompetition policy can play a key role in achieving African countries’ vision of a prosperous
    Africa, based on inclusive growth and sustainable development. Competition bolsters
economic growth by fostering more productive firms and industries, allowing domestic firms to
become more competitive abroad, export more, and generate more value added to the economy.
In addition, competition increases household welfare by encouraging firms to deliver the best
deals for consumers, protecting households from paying overcharges for essential consumer
goods, and facilitating access to a broader set of goods.

Nonetheless, in many African countries, markets are restricted by business practices that
undermine competitive dynamics, and by government actions that create barriers to healthy
competition. When firms agree to fix prices, empirical evidence reveals that consumers pay 49
percent more on average, and 80 percent more when cartels are stronger (Connor 2014). Economies
are still marked by government actions—such as policies, regulations, procedures, programs, and
commercial decisions—that reinforce dominance by restricting the number of firms or limiting
private investment, increase business risks and facilitate agreements among competitors, and
discriminate against certain competitors or affect competitive neutrality. This is shown not only
by the Economist Intelligence Unit indicators on factors that increase operational risks, but also in
the analysis of cement, fertilizer, and telecommunications sectors included in this report. It is also
consistent with findings in World Bank Group (WBG) advisory projects in the region.

Private sector development is at the center of economic transformation in a number of African
states’ national and regional development strategies, and competition is necessary to ensure
that the benefits of private sector participation are passed on to citizens. Increasing private
investment in priority sectors is one of the main areas of economic transformation. A growing
number of African governments are moving toward reducing state involvement in providing
services and products that can be delivered more efficiently by the private sector. Yet the social
benefits of private sector participation can only be achieved when markets are competitive.
Effective competition policies—those that ensure open markets, an environment with low barriers
to entry and low operational risks, and effective rules that prevent anticompetitive business
practices, guarantee competitive neutrality, and enhance private sector participation in commercial
activities—will, therefore, contribute to achieving the goals of the region’s national and regional
development strategies. In response to this demand, various countries and regional blocs have
adopted competition laws and policy frameworks.

Competition authorities play an important role in encouraging and safeguarding competition in
African markets to allow for inclusive growth. Frameworks that enable competition help empower
the poorer segments of society, increase their buying power, and give them greater economic
opportunity. Empirical evidence shows that greater decision-making autonomy for competition
authorities would translate into higher growth in gross domestic product (GDP) through a 17
percentage point reduction in the total factor productivity gap with the United States, on average
(Voigt 2009). Competition law enforcement decisions to stop and prevent cartels, abuses by
dominant firms, and mergers that are likely to harm competition are among the principal activities
of competition authorities in Africa. Another key focus area is advocacy for the elimination of

     regulations that restrict competition and facilitate anticompetitive business practices. Authorities
     may also carry out market assessments to advise the government on regulatory changes that can
     allow markets to be more competitive, and analysis of proposed regulations and legislation to
     provide technical guidance for the design of procompetition instruments.

     This report aims to highlight Africa’s important progress in creating more effective competition
     institutions and to outline areas of focus in order to encourage vigorous competition in key
     markets in the region. The report presents the status of competition policy and competition law
     enforcement across various countries in Africa, both economy-wide and in selected sectors. The
     report is based on African Competition Forum (ACF) members’ responses to the 2015 ACF-WBG
     Competition Policy Questionnaire, additional research on other countries in the region, answers
     to previous ACF surveys, WBG advisory services in the region, and cross-country comparison
     of relevant indicators produced by various international organizations. The WBG’s Markets and
     Competition Policy Tool has been used as framework to assess both competition law enforcement
     and competition issues in sectors.


             Effective competition policies will contribute to achieving the goals
                of the region’s national and regional development strategies.


     1.	 Overview of indicators in the region and the potential gains from boosting
         competition
     Most countries in Africa are perceived to have lower levels of competition than other countries
     around the world. More than 70 percent of African countries rank in the bottom half on the
     perceived intensity of local competition (WEF 2015) and on the existence of fundamentals for
     market-based competition (BTI 2016). On average, African countries score 26 percent lower than
     other countries globally in terms of the existence and enforcement of competition law (BTI 2016).
     With regard to policy barriers to competition, trade and foreign investment policies in Africa are
     more restrictive of competition than those in other regions. Business risks generated by prices
     controls, vested interests, and favoritism are also higher.

     The prevalence of monopolies, duopolies, and oligopolies is relatively high in some African
     economies, even after considering market size. In the manufacturing sector, markets in countries
     with relatively high GDP per capita have fewer participants than some smaller economies in the
     region. In the services sector, in more than 40 percent of African countries, a single operator holds
     over half the market share in telecommunications and transport.

     Africa has much to gain by encouraging open and competitive markets, particularly as a
     means to spur sustainable economic growth. Reducing regulatory restrictiveness in professional
     services would, other things being equal, boost growth in value added in industries that use
     professional services intensively by between 0.16–0.42 and percentage points of GDP growth for
     a sample of nine African countries. The impact would be even larger if fundamental reforms were
     implemented in other services sectors with higher spillover across the economy, such as electricity,
     telecommunications, and transport.

Executive Summary



A lack of competition in basic goods in African markets harms all households through its effect
on prices—but the poorest are hit the hardest. Retail prices of 10 key consumer goods are, on
average, at least 24 percent higher in African cities than in other economies around the world,
even after controlling for transport costs, geographic variables, and other factors. This result may
stem in part from low competition. For example, reducing the prices of main food staples by even
a modest 10 percent (far below the average overcharge imposed by cartels around the globe)
by tackling anticompetitive behavior in these sectors or improving regulations that shield these
markets from competition could lift 270,000 people in Kenya, 200,000 people in South Africa, and
20,000 people in Zambia above the poverty line. Such a policy would save households in these
countries over $700 million (2015 US dollars) a year, with poor households gaining disproportionately
more than rich ones.


                   A lack of competition in basic goods in African markets harms
                all households through its effect on prices, but the poorest people
                                        are hit the hardest.


2.	 Toward a more effective competition policy framework
There has been important progress in the enactment of competition policy frameworks in
Africa. The number of jurisdictions with competition laws has tripled in 15 years. The number
of jurisdictions with a competition law grew from 13 in 2000 (12 countries and one regional bloc)
to 32 in 2015 (27 countries and five regional blocs). Importantly, competition authorities are now
implementing these laws in 25 jurisdictions (including two regional blocs). Looking to the future,
there is a need to prioritize resources and use the powers and tools available to competition
authorities more effectively in order to continue raising the relevance of competition policy within
the broader development agenda.

Functioning African competition authorities face some operational constraints. Competition
authorities have been operating for eight years, on average, in countries that have enacted
competition laws. On average, they employ 21 technical staff who work on competition, or
approximately 32 percent of total staff (as compared to 68 percent in a sample of 35 established
competition agencies around the world). Nine authorities have fewer than 10 technical staff
handling competition matters. The average annual budget of these agencies has increased by 39
percent in four years, but resources remain limited. Excluding South Africa, the average annual
budget is $1.4 million. Seven authorities operate with an annual budget below $0.5 million. The
average annual budget allocation per technical staff in African authorities is one-third of that in
a sample of 33 established competition authorities around the world. Despite these constraints,
competition authorities complete, on average,1 41 cases on merger control, 1.9 cases on abuse of
dominance,2 1.4 cases on horizontal agreements,3 1.4 sector inquiries, and 6 advisory opinions on
laws or regulations each year, but there is significant variation across authorities.

       Cartels are the most harmful anticompetitive practice, but anticartel enforcement remains
       relatively weak in Africa. In 2013–14, 42 horizontal agreement cases were completed by nine
       authorities; of those, 50 percent were investigated by the Competition Commission of South
       Africa. Products that have been found to be affected by cartels in Africa include fertilizers, food
       (including wheat, maize, and bread), pharmaceuticals, construction materials (including cement),
       and construction services. Research from South Africa sheds some light on the characteristics of
       these cartels. Overcharges have been estimated at 7–42 percent for wheat products, 25 percent
       for poultry, 15 percent for pharmaceuticals, and 7.5–9.7 percent in cement. The average duration
       of nonconstruction cartels in South Africa was eight years. Despite their harm, fines allowed and
       imposed for cartels in Africa are not high enough to deter their formation. In Kenya, the maximum
       fine possible is approximately $100,000, and in the East African Community (EAC) it is $10,000.
       Although the maximum fine imposed for cartels in South Africa is $116 million, on average fines
       are only 9 percent of excess profits compared to 26 percent in the European Union (Ivaldi, Jenny,
       and Khimich 2016). Practical implementation of key anticartel enforcement tools needs to be
       strengthened as well. At least 16 competition authorities have search and seizure powers, but few
       have carried out raids. Moreover, at least seven countries have a leniency program that allows a cartel
       member to confess its involvement in a cartel and fully cooperate with the resulting investigation in
       exchange for reduced sanctions. To date, leniency applications have only been received in South
       Africa and Mauritius. Challenges to the implementation of effective leniency programs include
       the low probability of detection and the fact that close collaboration with prosecutors is required
       for a leniency program to function in jurisdictions with criminal sanctions for cartels. Competition
       authorities have also addressed abuse of dominance and vertical agreement cases: 70 cases by 15
       authorities in 2013–14. Nevertheless, it would be useful to lay out more precise theories of harm
       to assess exclusionary effects, use tools to increase administrative efficiency such as settlements,
       and expand advocacy efforts to change government interventions that reinforce dominance and
       increase the risk of anticompetitive behavior.

       The role of competition authorities in assessing mergers has expanded considerably, but there
       is room to make the system more efficient. Merger control is operational in at least 17 out of 26
       jurisdictions. In most jurisdictions, premerger notification is mandatory, and it is therefore important
       to prioritize cases to avoid preventing investments and transactions that are not likely to harm
       competition. Six competition authorities use fast-track procedures to prioritize the most important
       merger cases. Merger notification thresholds have been set in at least 13 jurisdictions to reduce any
       undue administrative burdens on businesses and on the authority, but at least six jurisdictions with
       mandatory premerger notification do not have a threshold and thus require all transactions to be
       notified regardless of size. Over 1,200 merger cases were completed in 2013–14 by 15 jurisdictions
       with an operational merger control system. On average, each member of the technical staff in
       African competition authorities handles 3.2 merger notifications per year, compared to 0.8 in 35
       established competition agencies around the world. This system constrains the resources available
       for investigating anticompetitive practices. On average, 10 percent of mergers were blocked or
       conditionally approved in Africa, compared to 4 percent in a sample of 35 established competition
       agencies around the world. In 12 African jurisdictions, authorities consider public interest concerns
       other than competition. Five regional blocs have merger control provisions that aim to prevent
       changes in market structure that are likely to harm competition and trade among African countries.
       Currently, premerger notification is mandatory in EAC and the Common Market for Eastern and
       Southern Africa (COMESA), but only the COMESA system is operational. This demands close
       coordination with national authorities and other regional authorities with overlapping jurisdiction.

Executive Summary



Competition authorities are working with other government bodies to encourage competition.
Almost 60 percent of the African competition authorities studied have signed memoranda of
understanding with sector regulators—most of which have been in the telecommunications,
banking, energy, and transport sectors. Competition authorities often provide opinions on
government interventions to minimize restrictions on competition, which in most cases are not
mandatory or part of a formal process. Even without binding opinions, however, some competition
authorities in the region have succeeded in influencing policies through sound technical analysis
and clear strategies that engage key stakeholders to support reforms. Competition authorities
are increasingly conducting successful advocacy to open markets to competition. This includes
efforts in the areas of banking and public procurement in South Africa, mobile financial services
in Zimbabwe, saw milling in Zambia, health care and tea processing in Kenya, cement in Tanzania,
sugar in Malawi, and steel in Egypt. Other policies such as state aid and price controls affect
the development of competition in markets, but only in a few cases is competition analyzed in
granting state aid or setting price controls.


 There is room to prioritize resources and use the powers and tools available to
           competition authorities more effectively in order to continue
          raising the relevance of competition policy within the broader
                           development agenda in Africa.


3.	 Market dynamics and competition policy in key sectors
Certain sectors are particularly important in ensuring the competitiveness and growth of
African economies, and in boosting the welfare of less well-off households. The cement sector,
for example, plays a critical role in the construction of infrastructure and housing. The fertilizer
sector affects agricultural productivity, and the transport and telecommunications sectors shape
connectivity within countries and with the global economy. These products and services are
necessary inputs for businesses and small producers. Their prices, availability, and quality have a
direct effect on the competitiveness of African producers in international markets and the extent
to which households can harness the benefits of more open markets. These sectors also generate
spillover effects across the economy.

This report provides a focused examination of competition in cement, fertilizer, and
telecommunications sectors, along with an overview of competition issues in transport. These
sectors were selected on the basis of their relevance for African economies and their demonstrated
potential for displaying competition issues. Selection of the three core sectors, together with
road freight and air transport, takes into account the results of the ACF Needs Assessment 2014
and authorities’ previous activities in these sectors. In addition, also based on feedback from
ACF members, the report outlines three sectors in which competition authorities have recently
become active as a result of the perception that they are problematic for competition—namely,
energy, retail, and tourism. Market outcomes in the energy and retail sectors drive a great deal
of household consumption and welfare, while retail and tourism sectors are important sources of
jobs. Energy is an important input for large and small enterprises alike.

    Cement: a key input for infrastructure and housing

    Across African countries, cement production and imports display a number of common
    characteristics that shape market outcomes. First, the high economies of scale and high capital
    intensity of cement production and imports act as barriers to entry and, when combined with
    relatively low demand, mean that markets often cannot efficiently support a large number
    of players. The bulkiness of the product and high ratio of transport costs to value encourages
    vertical integration and regional concentration. As a result, suppliers form regional strategies
    that span borders, with actual and potential competition in a particular jurisdiction depending on
    the availability of lime (the key primary input for the production of cement) in a specific locality,
    the size of local demand, and the existence of import restrictions. In these circumstances, sound
    competition enforcement that prevents anticompetitive behavior may be critical.

    Cement markets in Africa tend toward high concentration, and plants owned by nine large
    panregional firms account for most of the continent’s cement capacity. Together, these firms
    have an average capacity of 18.9 million tons per annum (mta) compared to less than 3 mta for
    the smaller players that make up the remainder of the market. There is considerable multimarket
    contact between these firms, both in Africa and internationally, with the two largest meeting in
    seven countries in Africa. Three of the firms that meet in markets across the region were previously
    involved in a cement cartel in the Southern Africa Customs Union (SACU), which was uncovered by
    the Competition Commission of South Africa. Overall, in at least 18 African countries, one supplier
    holds more than half the market. At least 21 markets have witnessed entry over the last three years,
    and in at least 15 of them, one or more of the new entrants was one of the major panregional
    players. Dangote, for example, was a new entrant in 12 of those countries.

    Other supply-side factors that shape market structure and competitive dynamics include a
    country’s reliance on imports, state involvement in cement supply chains, and the degree of
    vertical integration. Many countries rely on imports for their supply of cement, making some
    markets susceptible to competition challenges in other countries as well as to import barriers. Over
    60 percent of the countries studied import more than half of their cement consumption, and at
    least five of those countries source more than half of their imports from African countries. Vertical
    integration along the cement supply chain is common, but this only poses a risk of exclusionary
    behavior if a dominant vertically integrated upstream producer of clinker (the key input for final
    cement production) is supplying to downstream rivals in cement production. This is the case in
    Botswana, Mozambique, and Rwanda, each of which has at least three cement producers but
    one dominant clinker producer. The state is involved in cement markets in just over half of the
    countries for which information is available. In most of these cases, the state holds less than 50
    percent of the market through direct holding in production plants.

    Government interventions in the form of policies, rules, and procedures governing the cement
    sector can hinder competition. In 69 percent of the countries that have limestone reserves, a
    key factor determining competition in cement markets is firms' access to lime. The award of
    temporary or geographic exclusivity over limestone reserves beyond the level necessary to attract
    investment and maintain efficiency may prevent entry of new firms. Import restrictions can also
    act as a barrier to entry. Of the 22 countries and regional bodies for which information is available,
    45 percent have restrictions on cement imports, including absolute import bans and the phasing

Executive Summary



out of import licenses (as in Angola, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and Nigeria) and antidumping tariffs (as
in Namibia and South Africa). The imposition of product standards that are more restrictive than
necessary to maintain quality (as imposed in Nigeria and Liberia) can also prevent entry, raise the
costs of competing, and facilitate collusion. Finally, in some countries, the government appears
to maintain some degree of control over cement prices (as in Ethiopia, Mozambique, Republic of
Congo, and Tunisia).

Competition authorities have been active in investigating potential anticompetitive behavior in
the cement sector. In the last three years, competition authorities have investigated three cartel
cases, six abuse of dominance cases, and six cases relating to other types of behavior such as price
discrimination. At least eight of these cases are still under investigation. Over the same period,
sanctions were only imposed in South Africa in the case of the SACU cartel. It is worth noting,
though, that Egypt also found and sanctioned a price fixing cartel involving nine producers in 2008.
Both the SACU cartel and the Egyptian cartel involved the largest player in the African market.

Cement prices in Africa are far above world prices, but the potential impact of fostering
competition in the cement market in Africa is significant. Final cement prices in Africa are 183
percent higher, on average, than world cement prices. Even a modest anticompetitive overcharge
on African cement of 9.7 percent (equivalent to that seen in the SACU cartel) would mean that
African consumers are overpaying for their cement by $2.5 billion a year. Gains have already been
in seen in Africa from tackling some of the competition challenges. Enforcement action to tackle
the SACU cartel has saved cement consumers $79–100 million per year in South Africa. Advocacy
action by the Tanzanian competition commission to encourage the removal of a suspended duty
on cement imports in Tanzania led to a 26 percent reduction in retail prices. Entry into South
African and Zambian cement markets has been followed by a fall in cement prices (of at least 5
percent in real terms in a year).


Small market size, economies of scale, excess capacity, reliance on intraregional
trade, and multimarket contact, among other characteristics, shape competitive
    dynamics in cement markets. Competition law enforcement, removal of
nontariff barriers, and procompetition rules to enable entry in limestone-clinker
        production would save African consumers $2.5 billion each year.


Fertilizer: a key input for agriculture productivity

Fertilizer production and imports share many of the characteristics displayed by cement markets,
but government participation along the supply chain is more prevalent. Production and imports
present high economies of scale and high capital intensity, combined with low local demand and
a high ratio of transport costs to value. As with cement, vertical integration is common, but state
participation is more prevalent. The state participates through direct stakes in fertilizer producers
in 63 percent of the countries studied, and in most of those cases it holds over 50 percent of the
market. State participation can be on a commercial basis (as in South Africa) or on a subsidized
basis. In the latter case, the size of the state-subsidized channel—and therefore the private sector’s
ability to participate—varies widely, from 10 percent in Mozambique and 30 percent in Kenya, for

      example, to 90 percent in Togo and 100 percent in Ethiopia. There is a high degree of multimarket
      contact between the major fertilizer firms, and the five firms that appear most frequently in Africa
      meet each other in five African countries, on average. Three of these firms have previously been
      involved in fertilizer cartels in Africa.

      Two key differences between cement and fertilizer markets affect competitive dynamics: more
      concentrated use of scarce resources and limited local production capabilities. First, the location
      and use of the scarce resources used as primary inputs for fertilizer (that is, natural gas for nitrogen
      (N) fertilizer production, phosphate rock for phosphorous          fertilizer, and potassium ore for
      potassium (K) fertilizer) are more concentrated. In P, for example, all producing countries have a
      monopoly producer, except Egypt. In N, Sub-Saharan Africa is the only region in the world where
      all ammonia producers are monopolies. Second, fertilizers are globally traded commodities. Only
      28 percent of countries in Africa have the ability to produce their own fertilizers from primary
      materials. Sixty percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s consumption of N and P fertilizers is imported
      from outside the region and 100 percent of its K fertilizer consumption. Market outcomes in Africa
      are shaped by global markets, which are dominated by: (i) two global export cartels in K; and (ii) a
      global duopoly in P, with one of the two global P producers being Morocco’s state monopoly, OCP,
      which holds an 82 percent market share in the supply of phosphate rock across Africa.

      Government interventions in the form of policies, rules, procedures, and farmer support programs
      in the fertilizer sector can hamper competition. These include long testing periods, unnecessary
      registration procedures (even where similar products are being used successfully in neighboring
      countries under similar conditions), a lack of regional harmonization in registration procedures,
      and the fact that in some countries registration is not a one-off procedure, but requires constant
      renewal. These interventions act as barriers to entry. Import tariffs and fees imposed contrary to
      the 2006 Abuja Declaration on fertilizer also increase the costs of market participation. In West
      Africa, product specifications in national fertilizer regulations can restrict the use of products that
      would otherwise be natural substitutes for each other. Meanwhile, a lack of competitive tendering
      in the provision of fertilizer through state channels distorts the level playing field in some countries.

      Fertilizer cartels have been detected by competition authorities in Africa. In South Africa, three
      firms were found to have agreements with each other on prices offered to customers. In a separate
      case in South Africa, a noncompete agreement was found between two firms in the market for P
      fertilizer. In Zambia, two firms were found to have divided the market for tendered fertilizer under
      the government subsidy program.

      A lack of competition in fertilizer markets raises prices for the final consumer. Part of this stems
      from global markets. Global export cartels increase the final price of K fertilizers in Sub-Saharan
      Africa by 29 percent. Regional factors also play a role. For example, retail prices of N fertilizers
      are generally well above competitive benchmarks in the Middle East and Black Sea regions. In
      about 58 percent of the African countries studied, one supplier controls over half the market, and
      57 percent of the countries have not seen any entry in the last three years, indicating a potential
      lack of competitive pressure. However, the potential savings from anticartel enforcement and from
      improvements in the regulatory environment could be significant. In Zambia, for example, savings
      from ending the bid-rigging cartel and reforming tender rules that previously favored incumbents
      were estimated at $21 million in 2013 alone.

Executive Summary




In more than half of African countries, one fertilizer supplier holds more than 50
percent of the market, and less than half have seen entry in import or production
 in the last three years. It would be beneficial to remove regulatory restrictions
 that inhibit entry, competitive public procurement, and market intelligence to
                              detect competition issues.


Telecommunications: a key input for reaping digital dividends

Mobile, wireless Internet, and international gateway services are the most important
telecommunications (telecom) services in Africa and critical to broadening Internet access on
the continent. Procompetitive policies in the telecom sector can help deploy these technologies
and benefit consumers with a greater variety of prices and better quality. Nevertheless, as of 2015,
Sub-Saharan African countries have the highest final prices for mobile broadband services in the
world. The median mobile phone owner in Africa spends nearly 3 percent of monthly income on
mobile services. Meanwhile, Internet use is the second-lowest among the regions, after South Asia.

Telecom markets are generally characterized by well-known industry characteristics that make
the sector more prone to market concentration and potential anticompetitive practices. These
include significant fixed costs and sunk investments, economies of scale and scope, essential
facilities and bottlenecks of network industries, and a reliance on scarce resources, including
spectrum. Access and interconnection issues arise in the sector given that operators need to
interact reciprocally to complete call or data transfers. The ability of operators to set different
prices for off-net versus on-net calls exacerbates the network effects in the sector. Club effects
enjoyed by the largest operators can make competition more difficult. Furthermore, vertically
integrated dominant firms with wholesale infrastructure have incentives to engage in exclusionary
behavior. Meanwhile, concentrated markets, high entry barriers,and cost homogeneity can
facilitate cartel behavior.

Other factors that shape telecom markets in Africa include state participation, the availability
of spectrum, and high termination rates. First, of the countries studied, 70 percent have state-
owned providers with more than 50 percent market share in fixed and wireless Internet services.
Four of the six countries globally that still have state-run monopolies in mobile services and
Internet are in Africa: Comoros, Djibouti, Eritrea, and Ethiopia. Second, the availability of spectrum
represents a key barrier to entry. Entry cannot occur if governments do not issue spectrum licenses.
Nigeria is the only country in Africa that has conducted auctions for the assignment of spectrum.
Most countries have awarded spectrum using a first-come, first-served method, which can lead
to inefficient outcomes. In Kenya, the incumbent operator had access to spectrum in the 4G
band, generating a first-mover advantage. Finally, although African countries have embarked
on regulatory interventions that reduce mobile termination rates4 toward the cost of an efficient
operator, high mobile termination rates are still common in Africa. For example, Rwanda’s mobile
termination rates are exceptionally high in comparison with others in the region, at more than 200
percent those of Tanzania and more than 330 percent those of Kenya.

    Mobile termination rates are the fees that mobile phone operators charge to other carriers to terminate calls on their networks. These
    represent a significant input cost in providing telecom services.

      Given the features of the telecom sector, government interventions in the form of regulation
      and competition policy are needed to tackle potential anticompetitive issues, but in some
      cases government policies can be improved to guarantee competitive neutrality. In Rwanda,
      for example, a partial government operator was granted spectrum for providing superior and
      more efficient 4G technologies on an exclusive basis and with a right of first refusal for additional
      spectrum available for new technologies. In Kenya, operators have to seek tariff approval regarding
      all telecom services, even those subject to competition, which raises the costs of competing.

      Partly as a result of these characteristics, African mobile and wireless markets display high
      concentration, and there is significant multimarket contact between the five largest mobile
      network operators. Out of 57 mobile and wireless markets in Africa, 27 have one player with
      more than 50 percent market share. Monopolies are present in key telecom services. There are
      11 monopolies in international gateway services in Africa and six in wireless Internet services. In
      the 42 countries where at least one of the five large panregional economic groups participates,
      25 countries have at least two of these groups competing for the market. In 88 percent of the
      countries in which two of these panregional economic groups participate, these companies jointly
      control more than 70 percent of the market.

      Competition authorities across Africa have been active in pursuing investigations in the telecom
      sector. Tunisia launched the highest number of investigations in the past three years, totaling 12,
      of which eight resulted in sanctions. Egypt is currently investigating a price fixing case against
      three large operators, which is in the prosecution phase. In South Africa, the dominant upstream
      fixed-line operator was found to have abused its dominance upstream to exclude competitors to
      its downstream retail division in the Internet segment. Investigations have also been carried out in
      Kenya, Malawi, and Mauritius.

      Opening mobile, wireless, and international calling markets to more competition could have an
      important impact on growth and competitiveness. Previous research has found that, in a sample
      of 40 African countries, the entry of an additional operator led to a 57 percent increase in mobile
      subscriptions (Gebreab 2002). A 10 percent increase in mobile penetration in developing countries
      has been shown to lead to a productivity increase of 4.2 percent (Deloitte 2012). Finally, opening
      up international calling services to competition was found to reduce prices by 90 percent and
      increase call volumes by 32 to 104 percent (GSMA 2012).


       African mobile and wireless markets display high concentration. In 27 countries,
       one player has more than 50 percent market share. Monopolies are still present
      in Africa: 11 in international gateway services and six in wireless Internet services.
       Fostering nondistortive state participation, competitive allocation of spectrum,
         and proper regulation of termination rates will be important for the region.

Executive Summary



Other key services with spillover effects across African economies

Regulatory actions to encourage open and contestable markets will be essential for the African
air transport market to reach its potential. Growth-constraining factors, including high fares and
lower quality of service in the region, may result from a lack of competition. Different economic
and regulatory features define the nature of competition in the air transport sector. In international
routes, market concentration on a number of routes remains high. Over one-quarter of the air
routes in Africa continue to be served by only one carrier (AfDB 2013), but entry has been observed
in some routes. Domestic routes remain concentrated, but some markets such as Kenya and South
Africa have seen entry by low-cost carriers. Regional efforts to open markets started over 15 years
ago, with 44 countries in Africa signing the 1999 Yamoussoukro Decision, but only a few countries
have observed its principles—despite some positive results in Kenya, South Africa, and the SADC
on passenger volumes and fares on routes that were opened up in recent years.

Competition law can play a role in the assessment of mergers, abuse of dominance, or
agreements among competitors in the air transport sector. At least four competition authorities
have handled cases related to the air transport industry. Most of these cases focused on abuse
of dominance in air transport services and ancillary services such as fueling. Alliances between
airlines have also been analyzed. In Cameroon and South Africa, competition authorities have
penalized infringements of the competition law in this sector.

High road freight rates in Africa and limited quality in terms of timeliness might be explained
in part by competition problems in transport and logistics. Given that various actors intervene
in the supply chain for end-to-end cargo transportation, sector prices, service quality, and
performance depend on the functioning of various interlinked markets, including trucking, freight
forwarding, brokerage, warehousing, cargo consolidation, and others. Traditionally, trucking
services have been more heavily regulated. Effective competition depends on factors that affect
not only trucking, but the entire transport and logistics value chain. Road cargo transport markets
in Africa generally consist of various operators, but some restrictions exist on entry to operations
in the domestic market. Based on responses to the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, prices are generally
unregulated, although in some cases (Malawi, Cameroon, and others in West Africa) governments
or associations still issue guidance on price levels. In some countries, freight allocation schemes
that sustain market-sharing agreements are present as well. For international freight, bilateral
agreements usually restrict the number of vehicles that are allowed to provide services between
two countries. Other examples of anticompetitive regulations in use in Africa include regulations
that limit which truckers can be used by shippers and bans on third-country trucking and cabotage,
which are common in West Africa. By contrast, southern Africa has no quotas or queues, which
allows direct contracting between shippers and transporters. Competition authorities have not
reported cases in road cargo transportation in the last two years, but the Competition and Fair
Trading Commission of Malawi is conducting an analysis of regulatory restrictions and competition
issues in the road transport sector.

Because of the retail sector’s direct impact on consumer welfare, it is an important sector
for competition authorities to monitor. In the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, both Botswana and
South Africa pointed out significant competition concerns in the retail sector. Kenya, Mauritius,
Morocco, Namibia, Tanzania, and Zambia indicated moderate competition concerns. A number
of competition authorities have been investigating anticompetitive practices in the retail sector. In

                                                                                         Executive Summary



      South Africa, an investigation found exclusive clauses in lease agreements between mall landlords
      and the three biggest retail chains, although the competition commission was unable to show
      an anticompetitive effect. A case on exclusivity clauses in lease agreements was also evaluated
      in Zambia. In Kenya, the competition authority fined two retail stores for agreeing to eliminate
      price competition between them. In addition to investigations, some competition authorities
      have advised the government on policy making to foster competition in the sector. The Namibian
      competition authority, for instance, conducted a study that supported the government’s initiative
      of developing a retail charter to help strengthen the Namibian retail sector. South Africa is now
      pursuing an advocacy approach in response to the findings on exclusive clauses in mall lease
      agreements and has opened an inquiry in the sector.

      With energy use rising in Sub-Saharan Africa, many governments are intensifying their efforts
      to increase investment in the energy sector by tackling regulatory and political barriers. Around
      30 African countries have established independent electricity regulators. Given the continued
      prevalence of state-owned energy utilities in Africa, however, competition issues often arise in
      relation to a lack of competitive neutrality. In some cases, state-owned enterprises or the entire
      sector fall outside the competition law. In other cases, there is a need to guarantee both tax and
      regulatory neutrality toward state-owned energy operators. Provisions that allow for independent
      power producers, as well as conditions to allow large consumers to select their power provider, are
      not prevalent in Africa. From an enforcement angle, upstream concentration in gas markets has
      led to investigations of abuse of dominance in South Africa and Zambia. In addition, a number of
      mergers have been reviewed by competition authorities in the energy sector.

      The growing role of tourism in country development strategies may indicate that competition
      authorities will begin to focus more on this sector. No significant competition issues have been
      reported by respondents to the 2015 ACF-WBG survey. Some countries did, however, report
      moderate concerns such as restrictive concession agreements for the provision of hospitality
      services, restrictive requirements to obtain licenses and permits, and restrictions on providers
      of tourist road transfers. Botswana, the Seychelles, and Tunisia have carried out investigations in
      the tourism sector, with Tunisia imposing one sanction. In 2013–14, 20 mergers were investigated
      in the sector. Competition problems can arise in markets connected to tourism value chains, for
      example in passenger air transportation, tourism transport, and travel agencies.


                  Competition issues have been identified in important sectors
                     such as air transport, road freight, retail, and energy.


      4.	 The way forward
      The study shows that governments could focus on a few key areas to encourage competition
      in markets and harness private sector participation for maximum impact. Areas of focus include
      competition law enforcement and advocacy for procompetition regulatory frameworks. The ACF
      has a role to play in supporting regulatory changes, sharing information, and building capacity to
      help strengthen competition authorities and increase the effectiveness of competition policy.

Executive Summary



The ACF could support the convergence of principles for effective implementation of
competition law enforcement. Such support could be particularly useful in: (i) efficient merger
control to reduce any undue administrative burden and refocus resources on transactions that
are more likely to raise competition concerns, including adequate merger notification thresholds,
two-phase procedures, transparent and clear guidelines on public interest considerations where
mandated, and mechanisms for coordination between national and regional bodies; and (ii)
effective anticartel enforcement to deter harmful practices through coordination and regional
analysis of detected practices that might affect more than one country, rationalization of the use
of exemptions for anticompetitive practices, improvements in the fining system and maximum fine
values, and adoption of policies to facilitate prioritization of case work and increase the efficiency
of enforcement.

Given the challenges present in African markets, authorities will benefit from prioritizing the
allocation of resources with a view to preventing the most harmful anticompetitive practices and
using available powers and tools more effectively. In some cases, there is a need to revise fines
to ensure adequate deterrence and to assess administrative procedures that could be increasing
the administrative burden on firms and authorities.

As shown by the analysis of the three core sectors, governments can take action to mitigate the
risks of potential anticompetitive behavior in sectors. The interaction of industry characteristics,
the degree of vertical integration, and the regulatory restrictions that apply to supply chains
yield different dynamics in markets. Certain features can incentivize particular behaviors, such as
collusion in cement and fertilizer markets and foreclosure in the telecom sector. Rules that make
markets more open and contestable—by facilitating imports, supporting entry in production or
operation, and giving all firms an opportunity to compete on common ground—would reduce
concentration and dominance, and therefore the likelihood of anticompetitive practices. Based on
the characteristics of certain markets and the past behavior of firms operating in the sector within
the region, competition authorities can closely monitor certain markets.

The ACF could enhance its support to its members’ advocacy efforts to adjust policies and
regulations that unnecessarily limit competition and facilitate anticompetitive practices. This
could be achieved by creating smaller, more cohesive subgroups of competition authorities
for countries with economic linkages, and by extending outreach to a broader group of
stakeholders such as sectoral regulators, the business community, academia, and civil society.
It would be important to continue carrying out research on competition analysis in domestic
markets for related countries; to expand the analysis of trade and competition to capture the
regional angle, given that market players make regional business decisions; and to prepare
a strategy to support the implementation of key report recommendations. Countries with an
incipient competition culture would benefit from drawing on examples from other countries to
show that competition matters for government policies to be more effective, and the ACF can
be a forum for exchanging this information.


   The ACF can help support regulatory changes, share market intelligence,
build capacity to strengthen competition authorities, and increase policy makers’
 ability to incorporate competition policy principles into other public policies.

        Résumé exécutif
        L  a politique de concurrence peut jouer un rôle clé dans l'atteinte de la vision d'une Afrique
           prospère, basée sur une croissance inclusive et un développement durable, et promue par les
        pays africains. La concurrence stimule la croissance en augmentant la productivité des entreprises
        et des industries, en permettant aux entreprises nationales de devenir plus compétitives à
        l'étranger, d'augmenter leurs exportations, et de générer une plus grande valeur ajoutée pour
        l'économie. En outre, la concurrence augmente le bien-être des ménages en encourageant les
        entreprises à offrir de meilleures offres aux consommateurs, en protégeant les ménages contre
        le paiement de surcoûts pour les biens de consommation essentiels, et en facilitant l'accès à une
        gamme plus étendue de biens.

        Cependant, dans de nombreux pays africains, les marchés sont restreints par des pratiques qui
        fragilisent la dynamique de la concurrence, et par des actions gouvernementales qui créent
        des barrières à une concurrence saine. Lorsque des entreprises fixent des prix, sur la base de
        preuves empiriques, il apparait que les consommateurs paient 49% de plus en moyenne, et 80
        % de plus lorsqu'il existe des cartels forts (Connor 2014). Les économies nationales sont encore
        caractérisées par des actions gouvernementales – telles que des politiques, la réglementation,
        les procédures, les programmes et les décisions commerciales – qui renforcent la domination
        au travers de la restriction du nombre d'entreprises ou de la limitation de l'investissement
        privé, qui accroissent les risques des affaires et facilitent les accords entre concurrents, et
        qui créent de la discrimination à l'encontre de certains concurrents ou influe sur la neutralité
        concurrentielle. Ceci est démontré non seulement par les indicateurs de la Cellule Economist
        Intelligence Unit sur les facteurs qui augmentent les risques opérationnels, mais également
        dans l'analyse des secteurs du ciment, des engrais et des télécommunications couverts dans ce
        rapport. Ce constat correspond aux conclusions des projets d'assistance technique du Groupe
        de la Banque mondiale dans la région.

        Le développement du secteur privé est au centre de la transformation économique d'un nombre
        de stratégies de développement nationales et régionales des pays africains, et la concurrence
        permet de s'assurer que les bénéfices de la participation au secteur privé sont transmis aux
        citoyens. Augmenter l'investissement privé dans les secteurs prioritaires est l'un des principaux
        leviers de la transformation économique. Un nombre croissant de gouvernements africains s'oriente
        vers la réduction de l'implication de l'État dans le fourniture de services et produits qui peuvent
        être offerts avec une plus grande efficacité par le secteur privé. Cependant, les avantages sociaux
        de la participation au secteur privé ne peuvent atteints qu'en présence de la concurrence. Des
        politiques de concurrence efficaces – celles qui favorisent des marchés ouverts, un environnement
        caractérisé par de faibles barrières à l'entrée et des risques opérationnels faibles, des règles efficaces
        qui empêchent des pratiques anticoncurrentielles, garantissent la neutralité concurrentielle
        et améliorent la participation du secteur privé aux activités commerciales – contribueront, par
        conséquent, à atteindre les objectifs poursuivis par les stratégies de développement nationales et
        régionales de l'Afrique. Pour répondre à cette demande, nombre de pays et blocs régionaux ont
        adopté des législations sur la concurrence et des politiques de concurrence.

Résumé exécutif



Pour favoriser une croissance inclusive, les autorités de concurrence ont un rôle important à jouer
dans la promotion et la protection de la concurrence sur les marchés africains. Des cadres qui
favorisent la concurrence permettent d'autonomiser les segments les plus pauvres de la société,
d'accroitre leur pouvoir d'achat et de leur offrir de plus grandes opportunités économiques. Selon
les données empiriques, une plus grande autonomie dans la prise de décisions des autorités
de concurrence se traduirait par une augmentation du produit intérieur brut (PIB) grâce à une
réduction, en moyenne, de 17 points de pourcentage dans l'écart total du facteur de productivité
comparativement aux États-Unis (Voigt 2009). Les décisions liées à la mise en application de la
politique de concurrence, dans l'optique de contrecarrer et d'empêcher les cartels, les abus par
les entreprises dominantes et des fusions qui pourront éventuellement nuire à la concurrence sont
parmi les principales activités des autorités de concurrence en Afrique. Un autre domaine d'intérêt
clé est le plaidoyer en faveur de l'élimination de la réglementation qui limite la concurrence et
facilite les pratiques d'affaires anti-concurrentielles. Ces autorités peuvent également mener des
évaluations de marché en vue de conseiller le gouvernement sur les orientations réglementaires
qui peuvent renforcer la concurrence des marchés, et des analyses de la réglementation et de
la législation proposées en vue de formuler des orientations techniques visant l'élaboration
d'instruments pro-concurrentiels.

Le présent rapport vise à souligner l'importance des progrès en Afrique en matière de création
d'institutions plus concurrentielles et efficaces et à mettre en exergue les domaines d'intérêt
dans l'optique d'encourager une concurrence robuste sur les marchés clés de la région. Le
rapport présente la situation de la politique de concurrence et la mise en application de la
législation de concurrence dans divers pays africain, à la fois dans l'ensemble de l'économie
et dans des secteurs spécifiques. Le rapport se fonde sur les réponses des membres du Forum
africain de la concurrence (FAC) obtenues dans le cadre du Questionnaire sur la politique de
concurrence FAC-GBM, sur la recherche supplémentaire sur d'autres pays de la région, sur les
réponses aux précédentes enquêtes FAC, sur les services consultatifs du GBM dans la région
et sur la comparaison, entre pays, d'indicateurs pertinents formulés par diverses organisations
internationales. L'Outil de la politique de concurrence et des marchés du Groupe de la Banque
mondiale (GBM) est utilisé comme cadre d'évaluation, à la fois, de la mise en application des
dispositions législatives et des questions de concurrence dans différents secteurs.


   Des politiques de concurrence efficaces contribueront à la réalisation des
objectifs des stratégies de développement nationales et régionales de l'Afrique.


1.	 Présentation des indicateurs et gains potentiels liés à la stimulation de la
    concurrence
Il apparaît que la plupart des pays africains présentent des conditions de concurrence moins
favorables aux autres pays du monde. Plus de 70 % des pays africains sont classés dans la
deuxième moitié du rapport sur la perception d'intensité de la concurrence locale (WEF 2015)
et de l'existence des éléments fondamentaux basés sur les principes du marché concurrentiel
commerciale (BTI 2016). En moyenne, les pays africains affichent une note de 26 % inférieure aux
autres pays du monde, notamment en ce qui concerne l'existence et la mise en application de la
législation sur la concurrence (BTI 2016). Au regard des obstacles contraintes règlementaires, les

                                                                                           Résumé exécutif



     politiques liées aux échanges commerciaux et à l'investissement étranger sont plus restrictives
     en Afrique en matière de concurrence que dans d'autres régions. Les risques d'affaires liés aux
     contrôles des prix, aux intérêts directs et au favoritisme sont également plus élevés.

     La prévalence des monopoles, duopoles et des oligopoles est relativement élevée dans certaines
     économies africaines, même après la prise en compte de la taille des marchés. Dans le secteur
     de la manufacture, les marchés des pays ayant un PIB par habitant relativement élevé ont un
     nombre de participants inférieur à des économies plus petites dans la région. Dans le secteur des
     services, dans plus de 40% des pays africains un seul opérateur règne sur la moitié des parts du
     marché des télécommunications et du transport.

     Il y va de l'intérêt de l'Afrique d'encourager des marchés ouverts et concurrentiels, notamment
     en tant qu'instrument de stimulation d'une croissance économique durable. La réduction des
     restrictions réglementaires dans les services professionnels permettraient, toutes autres choses
     restant égales, de stimuler la croissance des industries à valeur ajoutée qui utilisent les services
     professionnels intensivement, dans l'ordre de 0,16 à 0,42 points de pourcentage du PIB, dans
     un échantillon de neuf pays africains. L'impact serait plus grand si des réformes fondamentales
     étaient mises en œuvre dans d'autres secteurs de services ayant un effet élevé sur l'ensemble de
     l'économie, tels que l'électricité, les télécommunications et le transport.

     L'absence de concurrence en matière de biens essentiels sur les marchés africains nuit aux
     ménages à cause de l'effet sur les prix – et les pauvres sont les plus affectés. Les prix de
     détails sur dix biens de consommation clés sont, en moyenne, au moins 24% supérieurs dans
     les villes par rapport à d'autres économies à travers le monde, même après la maitrise des
     coûts de transport, des variables géographiques et d'autres facteurs. Une telle situation pourrait
     certainement découler, en partie, de la faiblesse de la concurrence. Par exemple, réduire les
     prix des principaux produits alimentaires, même d'une marge aussi modeste que 10% (bien en
     dessous de la surcfacturation moyenne imposée par les cartels à travers le monde) en rectifiant
     le comportement anticoncurrentiel dans ces secteurs ou améliorer la réglementation qui protège
     ces marchés contre la concurrence pourrait permettre à 270 000 personnes au Kénya, à 200 000
     personnes en Afrique du Sud et à 20 000 personnes en Zambie d'échapper de la pauvreté. Une
     telle politique pourrait permettre aux ménages dans ces pays d'épargner plus de 700 millions de
     dollars (valeur du dollar américain en 2015) par an, où les ménages pauvres gagneront de manière
     disproportionnée plus que les riches.


         L'absence de concurrence en matière de biens essentiels sur les marchés
        africains nuit aux ménages à cause de l'effet sur les prix, mais les personnes
                               pauvres sont les plus affectés.

2.	 Vers un cadre strategique efficace en matière de concurrence
En Afrique, il y a des progrès importants en matière de mise en application des politiques de
concurrence. Le nombre juridictions ayant une législation en matière de concurrence a triplé en
15 ans. Le nombre de juridictions disposant d'une loi sur la concurrence est passé de 13 en 2000
(12 pays et un bloc régional) à 32 en 2015 (27 pays et 5 blocs régionaux). Encore plus important est
le fait les autorités en charge de la concurrence mettent désormais en application ces législations
dans 25 juridictions (y compris 2 blocs régionaux). Au regard de l'avenir, il est nécessaire que les
autorités en charge de la concurrence hiérarchisent les ressources et utilisent plus efficacement
la législation et les outils dont elles disposent pour continuer à augmenter la pertinence de la
politique de concurrence par rapport à l'agenda global de développement.

Les autorités de concurrence en Afrique font face à des contraintes opérationnelles. Les
autorités de concurrence fonctionnent depuis huit ans, en moyenne, dans les pays qui ont adopté
des législations en la matière. En moyenne, elles sont dotées d'un personnel de 12 membres
techniques qui s'occupent de la concurrence, ou 32% environ du personnel total (comparé à 68%
dans un échantillon mondial de 35 agences chargées de la concurrence). Neuf autorités disposent
de moins de dix employés chargés des questions de concurrence. Le budget annuel moyen
de ces agences a augmenté de 39% en quatre ans, bien que les ressources restent faibles. À
l'exclusion de l'Afrique du Sud, le budget annuel moyen est 1,4 million de dollars. Sept autorités
fonctionnent avec un budget annuel inférieur à 0,5 million de dollars. En moyenne, les enveloppes
budgétaires annuelles par employé technique au sein des autorités africaines représentent un
tiers de celles allouées au sein de 33 autorités échantillonnées à travers le monde. En dépit de
ces contraintes, les autorités de concurrence traitent, en moyenne,1 41 dossiers de contrôle de
fusion, 1,9 dossier sur les abus de position dominante,2 1,4 dossier sur les accords horizontaux,3
1,4 dossier sur les enquêtes sectorielles et émettent 6 avis consultatifs en matière de législation et
de réglementation, mais il existe une grande variabilité entre les autorités.

Les cartels constituent la pratique la plus nuisible en matière de concurrence, cependant, la
lutte anti-cartel demeure relativement faible en Afrique. En 2013-2014, 42 affaires portant sur
des accords horizontaux ont été traitées par neuf autorités ; parmi lesquelles 50% ont fait l'objet
d'une enquête de la Commission sud-africaine de la concurrence. Il a été relevé que les produits
affectés par les cartels en Afrique sont, entre autres, les engrais, les aliments (y compris blé, maïs
et pain), les produits pharmaceutiques, les matériaux de construction (y compris le ciment) et les
services de construction. Les recherches menées en Afrique du Sud mettent en lumière certaines
caractéristiques de ces cartels. Les surfacturations ont été estimées à 7-42% pour les produits de
blé, 25% pour le poulailler, 15% pour les produits pharmaceutiques et 7,5-9,7% pour le ciment. La
durée moyenne des cartels hors secteur de la construction, en Afrique du Sud, était de huit ans.
Malgré leur nuisance, les amendes prévues et imposées aux cartels en Afrique ne sont assez élevées
pour dissuader leur formation. Au Kénya, le montant maximum d'une amende est de 100 000$
environ ; et au sein de la communauté de l'Afrique de l'Est, il est de 10 000$. Bien que le montant
maximum des amendes imposées aux cartels en Afrique du Sud soit de 116 millions de dollars ;
en moyenne, les amendes ne représentent que 9% des profits excessifs en comparaison à 26% au
sein de l'Union européenne (Ivaldi, Jenny et Khimich 2016). La mise en application pratique des

       outils réglementaires anti-entente clés doivent également être renforcées. Au moins, 16 autorités
       de concurrence disposent de pouvoirs de recherche et de saisie, mais très peu font des descentes.
       En outre, au moins sept pays ont mis en place un programme de clémence qui permet aux
       cartels de reconnaitre leur implication dans une telle organisation et de coopérer pleinement avec
       l'enquête qui en résulte, en échange de sanctions réduites. À ce jour, les demandes en clémence
       n'ont été reçues qu'en Afrique du Sud et en Île Maurice. Les défis liés à la mise en application de
       programmes de pardon efficaces sont, entre autres, la faible probabilité de détection et le fait
       que l'étroite collaboration des procureurs est requise pour le fonctionnement d'un programme
       de pardon dans des juridictions prévoyant des sanctions pénales pour les cartels. Les autorités de
       concurrence ont également traité des affaires d'abus de position dominante et d'accord vertical.
       70 affaires 15 autorités pendant 2013–14. Cependant, il est possible de fournir des efforts visant à
       élaborer des théories de nuisance plus précises en vue d'évaluer les effets d'exclusion, d'utiliser
       des outils permettant d'augmenter l'efficacité administrative, tels que les règlements, et d'élargir
       les efforts de plaidoyer en vue de modifier les interventions gouvernementales qui renforcent les
       abus de position dominante et augmentent le risque de comportements anticoncurrentiels.

       Le rôle des autorités de la concurrence dans l'évaluation des fusions a considérablement
       augmenté, mais le système nécessite des améliorations. Le contrôle des fusions est opérationnel
       dans au moins 17 juridictions sur 26. Dans la plupart des juridictions, la notification de pré-fusion
       est obligatoire et il est par conséquent important d'hiérarchiser les affaires en vue de s'éviter
       d'empêcher l'investissement et les transactions qui ne sont pas susceptibles de nuire à la
       concurrence. Six autorités utilisent des procédures accélérées en vue de mettre la priorité sur les
       affaires de fusion les plus importantes. Des seuils de notification des fusions ont été fixés dans 13
       juridictions au moins en vue de réduire des lourdeurs administratives indues sur les entreprises et
       sur l'autorité, mais 6 juridictions, au moins, prévoyant des notifications de pré-fusion obligatoires
       ne disposent pas d'un seuil et exigent, par conséquent, que toutes les transactions lui soient
       notifiées indépendamment de leur taille. Plus de 1200 affaires de fusion ont été traitées en 2013-
       2014 par 15 juridictions disposant d'un système opérationnel de contrôle des fusions. En moyenne,
       chaque membre du personnel technique des autorités africaines chargées de la concurrence a la
       gestion de 3,2 notifications par an, comparé à 0,8 dans 35 autorités existantes à travers le monde.
       Ce système met des contraintes sur les ressources disponibles pour enquêter les pratiques anti-
       conccurentielles. En moyenne, 10% des fusions ont été bloquées ou approuvées sous condition
       en Afrique, en comparaison à 4% dans un échantillon de 35 agences de concurrence à travers le
       monde. Dans 12 juridictions africaines, les autorités tiennent compte des préoccupations d'intérêts
       publics autres que la concurrence. Cinq blocs régionaux disposent de clauses de contrôle des
       fusions qui visent à prévenir des changements de structure des marchés qui sont susceptibles de
       nuire à la concurrence et au commerce entre les pays africains. Actuellement, la notification de
       pré-fusion est obligatoire au sein de la Communauté économique de l'Afrique de l'Est et de la
       Communauté économique de l'Afrique australe (COMESA), mais seul le système de la COMESA
       est fonctionnel. Ceci exige une coordination étroite entre les autorités nationales et les autres
       autorités régionales ayant des juridictions qui se superposent.

       Les autorités de concurrence collaborent avec les autres organismes gouvernementaux pour
       stimuler la concurrence. Près de 60% des autorités africaines examinées ont signé des protocoles
       d'entente avec les régulateurs sectoriels – la plupart de ces protocoles interviennent dans les
       secteurs des télécommunications, de la banque, de l'énergie et du transport. Les autorités en

charge de la concurrence formulent souvent des avis sur les interventions gouvernementales
en vue de réduire les restrictions sur la concurrence, qui dans la plupart des cas, ne sont pas
obligatoires et ne font pas partie d'un processus formel. Même en l'absence d'avis contraignants,
certaines autorités de concurrence de la région ont réussi à influencer les politiques au travers
d'une analyse technique sérieuse et des stratégies claires qui encouragent les acteurs clés
à soutenir les réformes. Les autorités de concurrence permettent de plus en plus d'ouvrir les
marchés à la concurrence grâce au succès de leur plaidoyer. Ce plaidoyer comprend des efforts
dans le domaine de la banque et les marchés publics en Afrique du Sud, les services financiers
mobiles au Zimbabwé, les scieries en Zambie, les soins de santé et la transformation du thé au
Kénya, le ciment en Tanzanie, le sucre au Malawi et l'acier en Égypte. Les autres politiques, tels
que les subventions gouvernementales et le contrôle des prix, affectent le développement de la
concurrence sur les marchés ; cependant, ce n'est que dans quelque cas où la concurrence est
perçue sous le prisme des subventions étatiques et le contrôle des prix.


Il y a des possibilités pour les autorités en charge de la concurrence de prioriser
     les ressources et utiliser plus efficacement la législation et les outils dont
   elles disposent pour continuer à augmenter la pertinence de la politique de
    concurrence par rapport à l'agenda global de développement en Afrique.


3.	 Dynamique des marchés et politique de concurrence dans les secteurs clés
Certains secteurs sont particulièrement importants pour assurer la compétitivité et la croissance
des économies africaines et pour renforcer le bien-être des ménages moins riches. Le secteur
du ciment, par exemple, joue un rôle essentiel dans la construction des infrastructures et du
logement. Le secteur des engrais affecte la productivité agricole, et les secteurs du transport et des
télécommunications affectent la connectivité à l'intérieur des pays et avec l'économie mondiale.
Ces produits et services sont des intrants nécessaires pour les entreprises et les petits producteurs.
Leurs prix, disponibilité et qualité ont un impact direct sur la compétitivité des producteurs africains
sur les marchés internationaux et dans la possibilité des ménages à tirer avantage des bénéfices
de marchés plus ouverts. Ces secteurs génèrent également des retombées à travers l'économie.

Le présent rapport met l'accent sur l'analyse de la concurrence dans les secteurs du ciment, des
engrais et des télécommunications, ainsi qu'une vue générale des questions de concurrence
dans le secteur des transports. Ces secteurs ont été sélectionnés sur la base de leur pertinence
par rapport aux économies africaines et leur potentiel avéré à mettre en exergue les questions de
concurrence. La sélection de ces trois principaux secteurs, au côté du fret routier et du transport
aérien, tient compte des résultats de l'Évaluation des besoins du FAC 2014 et des précédentes
activités des autorités dans ces secteurs. En outre, également sur la base des réactions des
membres du FAC, le rapport met en exergue trois secteurs dans lesquels les autorités de
concurrence sont devenues récemment actives, à la suite du constat qu'ils constituent une source
de problèmes pour la concurrence – notamment l'énergie, le commerce de détail et le tourisme.
Les retombées économiques des secteurs de l'énergie et du commerce de détail stimulent de
manière significative la consommation et le bien-être des ménages, alors que les secteurs du
commerce de détail et du tourisme sont des sources importantes d'emplois. L'énergie est un
intrant essentiel pour les grandes et petites entreprises.

       Ciment : un intrant clé dans les secteurs des infrastructures et du logement
       À travers les pays africains, la production et l'importation du ciment mettent en exergue un
       certain nombre de caractéristiques communes qui influencent les pratiques sur les marchés.
       Premièrement, le niveau élevé des économies d'échelle et l'intensité élevée de l'usage des
       capitaux dans la production et les importations de ciment constituent déjà des obstacles à l'entrée
       et, lorsqu'associés à une demande relativement faible, cela signifie que les marchés ne peuvent
       efficacement supporter un grand nombre d'acteurs. Le caractère volumineux du produit et le
       taux élevé des coûts de transport par rapport à la valeur encouragent l'intégration verticale et la
       concentration régionale. Par conséquent, les fournisseurs forment des stratégies régionales qui
       dépassent les frontières, avec la concurrence réelle et potentielle dans une juridiction spécifique
       dépendant de la disponibilité de la chaux (la principale matière première pour la production
       du ciment) dans une localité spécifique, de la taille de la demande locale et de l'existence des
       restrictions à l'importation. Dans de telles circonstances, une mise en application efficace de la
       concurrence qui empêche des comportements anticoncurrentiels peut jouer un rôle essentiel.

       Les marchés de ciment africains ont tendance à une forte concentration et les usines possédées
       par neuf grandes entreprises pan-régionales constituent la majorité de la capacité de production.
       Ensemble, ces entreprises ont une capacité moyenne de 18,9 millions de tonnes par an (MTA),
       comparé à moins de 3 mta pour les petits acteurs qui constituent le reste du marché. Il existe
       un contact multi-marché important entre ces entreprises, à la fois en Afrique et sur le plan
       international, où les deux grandes entreprises ont des contacts dans sept pays en Afrique. Trois de
       ces entreprises qui ont des contacts dans des marchés à travers la région ont été précédemment
       impliquées dans un cartel de ciment de l'Union douanière d'Afrique australe (SACU, acronyme
       anglais) qui a été décélé par la Commission de concurrence de l'Afrique du Sud. De manière
       globale, dans 18 pays africains au moins, un fournisseur détient plus de la moitié des parts du
       marché. Au cours des trois dernières années, on assisté à de nouvelles entrées sur 21 marchés au
       moins, et sur 15 d'entre eux au moins, un ou plusieurs nouveaux arrivants était l'un des principaux
       acteurs pan-régionaux. Dangote, par exemple, est un nouvel arrivant dans de 12 de ces pays.

       D'autres facteurs liés à la fourniture qui affectent la structure du marché et la dynamique de
       la concurrence sont, entre autres, une dépendance du pays aux importations, l'implication
       étatique dans les chaines d'approvisionnement du ciment et le degré d'intégration verticale.
       Nombre de pays dépendent des importations pour leur approvisionnement en ciment, exposant
       éventuellement certains marchés aux défis de concurrence d'autres pays, ainsi qu'aux barrières
       à l'importation. Plus de 60% des pays étudiés importent plus de la moitié de leur consommation
       de ciment, et au moins cinq de ces pays importent plus de la moitié de leurs approvisionnements
       auprès d'autres pays africains. L'intégration verticale le long de la chaîne d'approvisionnement
       est courante, mais ceci pose uniquement un risque de comportement exclusif si un producteur
       de clinker intégré verticalement en amont (le principal intrant à la production finale du ciment)
       est le fournisseur de ses rivaux en production de ciment en aval. Ceci est le cas au Botswana,
       en Mozambique et au Rwanda, chacun de ces pays a trois producteurs de ciment, au moins,
       mais un seul producteur de clinker dominant. L'État intervient sur les marchés de ciment dans
       juste plus de la moitié des pays pour lesquelles il existe des données. Dans la plupart de ces
       cas, l'État est détenteur de moins de 50% du marché au travers de participation directe dans des
       usines de production.

Résumé exécutif



Les interventions gouvernementales, sous forme de politiques, réglementations et procédures
régissant le secteur du ciment, peuvent entraver la concurrence. Dans 69% des pays qui ont des
réserves de calcaire, un facteur clé déterminant dans la concurrence des marchés de ciment est
l'accès des entreprises à la chaux. L'octroi de l'exclusivité temporaire ou géographique sur les
réserves de calcaire au-delà du niveau nécessaire à l'attrait des investissements et au maintien
de l'efficacité peut empêcher l'arrivée de nouvelles entreprises. Les restrictions à l'importation
peuvent également agir comme obstacles à l'entrée. Sur les 22 pays et les organismes régionaux
pour lesquels des données sont disponibles, 45% disposent de restrictions aux importations de
ciment, y compris l'interdiction absolue d'importer et la suppression progressive des licences
d'importation (tels qu'en Angola, au Cameroun, en Éthiopie et au Nigeria) et des droits de douane
antidumping (comme en Namibie et en Afrique du Sud). L'imposition de normes de qualité qui
sont plus restrictives que nécessaires pour maintenir la qualité (tel qu'imposé au Nigeria et au
Libéria) peut également empêcher l'entrée, augmenter les coûts de la concurrence et faciliter
l'entente. Enfin, dans certains pays, il apparait que le gouvernement maintient un certain degré
de contrôle des prix du ciment (tels qu'en Éthiopie, au Mozambique, en République du Congo et
en Tunisie).

Les autorités de concurrence ont effectué des enquêtes sur les comportements potentiels
anticoncurrentiels dans le secteur du ciment. Au cours des trois dernières années, les autorités
de concurrence ont enquêté sur trois affaires de cartel, six affaires d'abus de position dominante,
et six affaires portant sur d'autres types de comportements, tels que la discrimination tarifaire.
Huit de ces affaires, au moins, sont toujours font encore l'objet d'enquête. Au cours de la même
période, des sanctions ont été imposées uniquement en Afrique du Sud dans l'affaire du cartel
SACU. Il convient de relever, cependant, que l'Égypte a également identifié et sanctionné un cartel
de fixation des prix impliquant neuf producteurs en 2008. Le cartel SACU et le cartel égyptien font
intervenir le plus grand acteur du marché africain.

Les prix du ciment en Afrique sont bien au-dessus des prix mondiaux, mais l'impact potentiel de
stimuler la concurrence sur le marché du ciment en Afrique est important. Les prix du ciment à
la consommation en Afrique sont 183% plus élevé, en moyenne, que les prix du ciment à travers
le monde. Même une surfacturation anticoncurrentielle modeste sur le ciment africain de 9,7%
(équivalent à celui constaté dans le cartel SACU) signifierait que les consommateurs africains
paient leur ciment avec un surplus de 2,5 milliards de dollars par an. On a déjà obtenu des gains
en Afrique à l'issue de l'élimination de certains des défis de concurrence. Des mesures coercitives
visant à lutter contre le cartel SACU ont permis aux consommateurs de ciment d'épargner 79-100
millions de dollars par an en Afrique du Sud. L'action de plaidoyer de la Commission tanzanienne
de la concurrence, en vue d'encourager la suppression des droits suspendus sur les importations
de ciment en Tanzanie, a conduit à une réduction de 26% des prix de détail. L'entrée sur les
marchés sud-africain et zambien du ciment est caractérisée par une chute des prix du ciment (5%
par an au moins, en termes réels).

             La petite taille des marchés, les économies d'échelle, la surcapacité,
          la dépendance sur le commerce intrarégional et les contacts multimarché,
        entre autres, influencent la dynamique concurrentielle des marchés du ciment.
        La mise en application de la législation régisssant la concurrence, l'élimination
          des barrières non douanières et la mise en place de règles favorables à la
        concurrence et permettant l'entrée dans la production du clinker et du calcaire
                     permettront aux consommateurs africains d'épargner
                                  2,5 milliards de dollars par an.


       Engrais : un élément clé de la productivité agricole
       La production et l'importation d'engrais partagent nombre de caractéristiques observées sur
       les marchés du ciment, mais la participation du gouvernement le long de la chaîne logistique
       est plus prévalente. La production et les importations présentent un niveau élevé des économies
       d'échelle et une intensité élevée de l'usage des capitaux, associés à une faible demande locale
       et à un ratio élevé des coûts de transport par rapport à la valeur. À l'instar du ciment, l'intégration
       verticale est courante, mais la participation de l'État est plus dispersée. L'État participe par le
       biais des participations directes chez les producteurs d'engrais dans 63% des pays étudiés, et
       dans la plupart de ces cas, il représente plus de 50% du marché. L'État peut participer sur une
       base commerciale (comme en Afrique du Sud) ou sur la base de subventions. Dans ce dernier cas,
       la taille du mécanisme de subvention gouvernemental – et par conséquent du secteur privé à
       participer – varie considérablement, de 10% au Mozambique et 30% au Kenya, par exemple, à 90%
       au Togo et 100% en Éthiopie. Il existe un niveau élevé de contact multimarché entre les principales
       entreprises d'engrais, et les cinq entreprises qui interviennent le plus souvent en Afrique sont en
       contact dans cinq pays africains, en moyenne. Trois de ces entreprises ont déjà été impliquées
       dans des cartels d'engrais en Afrique.

       Deux différences clés entre les marchés du ciment et des engrais influencent la dynamique
       concurrentielle: utilisation plus renforcée de ressources rares et faiblesse des capacités de
       production locale. Premièrement, l'emplacement et l'utilisation des ressources rares utilisées
       comme intrants primaires pour les engrais (à savoir, le gaz naturel pour la production d'engrais N,
       le minerai de phosphate pour l'engrais P, et le minerai de potassium pour les engrais K) sont plus
       concentrés. Pour les engrais P, par exemple, il existe un producteur en situation de monopole dans
       tous les pays producteurs à l'exception de l'Égypte. Pour les engrais N, l'Afrique subsaharienne est la
       seule région du monde où tous les producteurs d'ammoniac sont des monopoles. Deuxièmement,
       les engrais sont des produits négociés à l'échelle mondiale. Seulement 28% des pays africains
       ont la capacité de produire leurs propres engrais à partir de matières premières. L'Afrique
       subsaharienne importe 60% de sa consommation d'engrais N et P de l'extérieur de la région et
       100% de sa consommation d'engrais K. Les pratiques commerciales en Afrique sont façonnées
       par les marchés mondiaux, qui sont dominés par : (i) deux cartels mondiaux d'exportation des
       engrais K ; et (ii) un duopole mondial pour les engrais P, avec l'un des deux producteurs mondiaux
       d'engrais P étant un monopole de l'État marocain, OCP, qui détient 82% des parts de marché de
       l'approvisionnement en phosphate à travers l'Afrique.

Résumé exécutif



Les interventions gouvernementales, sous forme de politiques, réglementations, procédures
et programmes d'assistance aux paysans dans le secteur des engrais, peuvent entraver
la concurrence. Celles-ci comprennent de longues périodes d'essai, des procédures
d'enregistrement inutiles (même lorsque des produits similaires sont utilisés avec succès dans
les pays voisins dans des conditions similaires), un manque d'harmonisation régionale dans les
procédures d'enregistrement et le fait que, dans certains pays, l'enregistrement n'est pas une
procédure ponctuelle, mais exige un renouvellement constant. Ces interventions agissent comme
obstacles à l'entrée. Les droits de douane et les frais d'importation, imposées en contradiction à
la Déclaration d'Abuja de 2006 sur les engrais, augmentent également les coûts de participation
au marché. En Afrique de l'Ouest, les spécifications de qualité dans la réglementation nationale
sur les engrais peuvent limiter l'utilisation de produits qui seraient, en principe, réciproquement
des substituts naturels. Pendant ce temps, l'absence d'appels d'offres concurrentiels en matière
d'approvisionnement d'engrais, au travers de mécanismes étatiques, rend le jeu inégalitaire dans
certains pays.

Les cartels d'engrais ont été détectés par les autorités de concurrence en Afrique. En Afrique
du Sud, il s'est avéré que trois entreprises disposaient d'accords entre elles sur les prix offerts aux
clients. Dans une autre affaire en Afrique du Sud, il a été constaté l'existence d'un accord de non-
concurrence entre les deux entreprises intervenant sur le marché des engrais P. En Zambie, il a été
constaté que deux entreprises avaient divisé le marché des appels d'offre d'engrais lancés par le
programme de subvention gouvernemental.

L'absence de concurrence sur les marchés des engrais augmente les prix pour le consommateur
final. Une partie découle des marchés mondiaux. Les cartels d'exportation mondiaux augmentent
le prix final des engrais K en Afrique subsaharienne de 29%. Les facteurs régionaux jouent
également un rôle. Par exemple, les prix de détail des engrais N sont généralement bien au-
dessus des repères concurrentiels dans les régions du Moyen-Orient et de la mer Noire. Dans
58% environ des pays africains analysés, un fournisseur contrôle plus de la moitié du marché,
et 57% des pays n'ont pas vu de nouvelles entrées au cours des trois dernières années, ce qui
indique un manque de potentiel de la pression concurrentielle. Cependant, il est possible que les
gains potentiels découlant d'une mise en application du contrôle anticartel et de l'amélioration de
l'environnement réglementaire soient importants. En Zambie, par exemple, les économies liées
à l'élimination de la fraude des cartels dans les appels d'offre et à la réforme des règles d'appel
d'offres qui, précédemment, privilégiaient les acteurs présents ont été estimées à 21 millions de
dollars en 2013 seulement.


 Dans plus de la moitié des pays africains, un seul fournisseur d'engrais détient
   plus de 50% du marché, et moins de la moitié ont vu un nouvel arrivant dans
 l'importation ou la production des engrais au cours des trois dernières années.
  Il serait profitable de supprimer les restrictions réglementaires qui empêchent
l'entrée, de disposer d'un système d'appels d'offres concurrentiel et d'effectuer
une intelligence des marchés en vue de détecter des problèmes de concurrence.

         Télécommunications : un atout clé pour bénéficier des retombées numériques
         Les services de téléphonie mobiles, d'Internet sans fil et de passerelle internationale sont
         les services de télécommunications les plus importants services (télécom) en Afrique et sont
         essentiels à l'élargissement de l'accès à Internet sur le continent. Des politiques favorables
         à la concurrence dans le secteur des télécommunications peuvent permettre de déployer ces
         technologies et de faire profiter les consommateurs de servies ayant une plus grande variété de prix
         et une meilleure qualité. Néanmoins, au cours de l'année 2015, les pays d'Afrique subsaharienne
         ont les prix finaux les plus élevés pour les services mobiles à large bande passante dans le monde.
         Le propriétaire médian d'un téléphone mobile en Afrique dépense près de 3% de son revenu
         mensuel sur les services mobiles. Pendant ce temps, l'utilisation d'Internet est le deuxième taux le
         plus bas entre toutes les régions, après l'Asie du Sud.

         Les marchés de télécommunications sont généralement caractérisés par des facteurs bien
         connus au sein de cette industrie et qui rendent le secteur plus susceptible à la concentration et
         à des pratiques anticoncurrentielles éventuelles. Ceux-ci comprennent des coûts fixes importants
         et des investissements irrécupérables, des économies d'échelle et d'ampleur, les installations
         essentielles et les goulots d'étranglement des industries de réseau, et une dépendance sur des
         ressources limitées, y compris le spectre. Les problèmes d'accès et d'interconnexion se posent
         dans ce secteur, étant donné que les opérateurs ont besoin d'interagir réciproquement pour
         l'interconnexion des appels ou pour le transfert de données. La capacité des opérateurs à fixer
         des prix différents pour les appels hors Internet et pour les appels exacerbe les effets de réseau
         dans ce secteur. Les effets de club dont bénéficient les plus grands opérateurs peuvent rendre
         la concurrence plus difficile. En outre, les entreprises dominantes et verticalement intégrées à
         l'infrastructure du service en gros sont incitées à adopter un comportement d'exclusion. Pendant
         ce temps, des marchés concentrés, des barrières à l'entrée et l'homogénéité des coûts peuvent
         faciliter le comportement de cartel.

         D'autres facteurs qui façonnent les marchés des télécommunications en Afrique sont la
         participation de l'État, la disponibilité du spectre et les tarifs d'interconnexion élevés.
         Premièrement, sur les pays étudiés, 70% ont des fournisseurs appartenant à l'État avec plus de
         50% des parts de marché dans les services Internet fixes et sans fil. Quatre des six pays dans le
         monde qui ont toujours des monopoles d'État dans les services de téléphonie mobile et Internet
         se trouvent en Afrique : Comores, Djibouti, Érythrée et Éthiopie. Deuxièmement, la disponibilité
         du spectre représente un obstacle majeur à l'entrée. Il n'y pas d'entrée si les gouvernements ne
         délivrent pas de licences de spectre. Le Nigeria est le seul pays d'Afrique qui a attribué son spectre
         par vente aux enchères publiques. La plupart des pays ont attribué le spectre sur la base de la
         méthode Premier arrivé, premier servi, qui peut conduire à des résultats inefficaces. Au Kenya,
         l'opérateur historique a eu accès au spectre de la bande 4G, générant un avantage de premier
         opérateur. En dernier lieu, bien que les pays africains se soient engagés dans des interventions
         réglementaires qui réduisent les taux4 de terminaison mobile vers le coût d'un opérateur efficace,
         des tarifs de terminaison mobiles élevés sont encore courants en Afrique. Par exemple, les taux de
         terminaison mobile du Rwanda sont exceptionnellement élevés par rapport aux autres pays de la
         région, à plus de 200% comparés à la Tanzanie et plus de 330% comparés au Kenya.

             Les tarifs d'interconnexion sont les frais que les opérateurs de téléphonie mobile facturent aux autres opérateurs pour écouler des appels
             sur leurs réseaux. Ceci représente un coût de facteurs de production important pour la fourniture des services de télécommunications.

Compte tenu des caractéristiques du secteur des télécommunications, les interventions
gouvernementales sous forme de réglementation et de politique de concurrence sont nécessaires
pour éliminer les problèmes anticoncurrentiels éventuels, mais dans certains cas, il est possible
d'améliorer les politiques gouvernementales en vue de garantir la neutralité concurrentielle. Au
Rwanda, par exemple, un opérateur para-étatique a reçu une bande de spectre pour la fourniture de
technologies 4G supérieures et plus efficaces sur une base exclusive et avec un droit de premier refus
pour le spectre supplémentaire disponible pour les nouvelles technologies. Au Kenya, les opérateurs
doivent obtenir l'approbation tarifaire concernant tous les services de télécommunications, même
ceux qui sont soumis à la concurrence ; ce qui augmente les coûts de la concurrence.

Partiellement liée à ces caractéristiques, les marchés de téléphonie mobile et sans fil africains
présentent une forte concentration, et il y a un contact multimarché important entre les cinq
plus grands opérateurs de réseaux mobiles. Sur les 57 marchés de téléphonie mobile et sans fil
en Afrique, 27 ont un acteur qui contrôle plus de 50% des parts de marché. Il existe des monopoles
dans les services de télécommunication clés. Il y a 11 monopoles dans les services internationaux
de passerelle en Afrique et six monopoles dans les services Internet sans fil. Sur les 42 pays où l'on
retrouve, au moins, l'un des cinq grands groupes économiques panregionaux, 25 pays ont au moins
deux de ces groupes en compétition sur leur marché. Dans 88% des pays où l'on retrouve deux de ces
groupes économiques panregionaux, ces sociétés contrôlent conjointement plus de 70% du marché.

Les autorités de concurrence à travers l'Afrique ont été actives dans la conduite d'enquêtes
dans le secteur des télécommunications. La Tunisie a lancé le plus grand nombre d'enquêtes
au cours des trois dernières années, soit un total de 12, dont huit ont donné lieu à des sanctions.
L'Égypte enquête actuellement une affaire de fixation des prix contre les trois grands opérateurs,
qui fait maintenant l'objet de poursuites judiciaires. En Afrique du Sud, l'opérateur de téléphonie
fixe dominant en amont a été reconnu coupable d'avoir abusé de sa position dominante en amont
pour exclure en aval les concurrents de sa division de vente au détail dans le segment Internet.
Des enquêtes ont également été menées au Kenya, au Malawi et en Île Maurice.

L'ouverture des marchés de téléphonie mobile, du sans fil et des appels internationaux à
la concurrence pourrait avoir un impact significatif sur la croissance et la compétitivité. Des
recherches antérieures ont montré que, dans un échantillon de 40 pays africains, l'entrée d'un
opérateur supplémentaire a conduit à une augmentation d'abonnements de téléphonie mobile
dans l'ordre de 57% (Gebreab 2002). Pendant ce temps, il s'est avéré qu'une augmentation de la
pénétration de téléphonie mobile de 10% dans les pays en développement a donné lieu à une
augmentation de la productivité de 4,2% (Deloitte 2012). Pendant ce temps, il a été attribué à
l'ouverture des services d'appels internationaux à la concurrence une réduction des prix de 90%
et une augmentation du volume d'appels de 32 à 104% (GSMA 2012).


  Les marchés africains de téléphonie mobile et des services sans fil présentent
 une forte concentration. Dans 27 pays, un acteur détient plus de 50% des parts
   de marché. Les monopoles existent toujours en Afrique: 11 dans les services
  de passerelle internationale et 6 dans les services d'Internet sans fil. Favoriser
    une participation étatique qui n'entraine pas de distorsions, l'attribution
   concurrentielle du spectre et une bonne régulation du tarif de terminaison
                      d'appels sera important pour la région.

      Autres services clés ayant des retombées à travers les économies africaines
      Les mesures réglementaires visant à renforcer l'ouverture et la concurrence des marchés jouent
      un rôle essentiel dans le développement du potentiel du marché du transport aérien en Afrique.
      Les facteurs de restriction de la croissance, tels que des tarifs élevés et une mauvaise qualité de
      service dans la région, peuvent donner lieu à une absence de concurrence. Plusieurs paramètres
      économiques et réglementaires définissent la nature de la concurrence dans le secteur du transport
      aérien. Pour les liaisons internationales, la concentration du marché sur un certain nombre de
      liaisons reste élevée. En Afrique, plus d'un quart des voies aériennes continuent d'être desservies
      par un seul transporteur (BAD 2013), mais on a observée l'entrée de nouveaux opérateurs sur
      certaines liaisons. Les liaisons nationales restent concentrées, mais certains marchés, tels que
      le Kenya et l'Afrique du Sud, ont vu l'entrée de transporteurs à bas prix. Les efforts régionaux
      d'ouverture des marchés ont commencé depuis plus de 15 ans, avec 44 pays africains qui ont
      signé la Décision de Yamoussoukro de 1999, mais seuls quelques pays respectent ses principes
      en dépit des résultats positifs au Kenya, en Afrique du Sud et au sein de la SADC sur le nombre
      de passagers et les tarifs sur les liaisons qui ont été ouvertes à la concurrence au cours des
      dernières années.

      Dans le secteur du transport aérien, la législation en matière de concurrence peut jouer un rôle
      dans l'évaluation des fusions, des abus de position dominante ou des accords entre concurrents.
      Au moins quatre autorités de concurrence ont traité des affaires liées au secteur du transport
      aérien. La plupart de ces affaires étaient liées à l'abus de position dominante dans les services
      de transport aérien et les services connexes, tels que le ravitaillement en carburant. Les alliances
      entre compagnies aériennes ont également été analysées. Au Cameroun et en Afrique du Sud,
      les autorités de concurrence ont qualifié au pénal les infractions au droit de la concurrence dans
      ce secteur.

      Des tarifs de fret routier élevés en Afrique et la faible qualité en termes de ponctualité pourraient
      être expliquée en partie par des questions de concurrence dans les secteurs du transport et la
      logistique. Étant donné que différents acteurs interviennent dans la chaîne logistique du transport
      bout en bout du fret, les prix appliqués dans le secteur, la qualité du service et le rendement
      dépendent du fonctionnement de différents marchés interdépendants, y compris le camionnage,
      l'expédition de fret, le courtage, l'entreposage, le groupage des cargaisons et autres. De manière
      traditionnelle, les services de camionnage ont été plus lourdement réglementés. Une concurrence
      efficace dépend de facteurs qui affectent non seulement le camionnage, mais la chaîne de valeur
      de l'ensemble du transport et de la logistique. Les marchés de transport de marchandises par
      route en Afrique sont généralement constitués de différents opérateurs, mais il existe certaines
      restrictions à l'entrée d'opérateurs sur le marché intérieur. Sur la base des réponses à l'enquête
      FAC-GBM de 2015, les prix sont généralement non réglementés, bien que dans certains cas (Malawi,
      Cameroun et d'autres pays en Afrique de l'Ouest) des gouvernements ou des regroupements
      émettent encore des orientations sur le niveau des prix. Dans certains pays, il existe également
      des systèmes de répartition de fret qui sous-tendent les accords de partage des parts de marché.
      En ce qui concerne le fret international, les accords bilatéraux limitent généralement le nombre de
      véhicules autorisés à fournir des services entre deux pays. D'autres exemples de réglementations
      anticoncurrentielles appliquées en Afrique comprennent les règlementations qui limitent les

compagnies logistiques que peuvent utiliser des expéditeurs et les interdictions de camionnage
par des pays tiers et le cabotage qui sont communes en Afrique de l'Ouest. En revanche, l'Afrique
du Sud n'a pas de quotas ou de files d'attente, ce qui permet des contrats directs entre les
expéditeurs et les transporteurs. Les autorités de concurrence n'ont pas signalé de cas dans
le transport routier de marchandises au cours des deux dernières années, mais la Commission
de la concurrence et du commerce équitable du Malawi effectue actuellement une analyse des
restrictions réglementaires et des questions de concurrence dans le secteur du transport routier.

En raison de l'impact direct du secteur du commerce de détail sur le bien-être des consommateurs,
il s'agit d'un secteur important que doivent surveiller les autorités de concurrence. Dans
l'enquête FAC-GBM de 2015, le Botswana et l'Afrique du Sud ont souligné les problèmes de
concurrence importants dans ce secteur. Le Kenya, le Maroc, l'Île Maurice, la Namibie, la Tanzanie
et la Zambie ont signalé des problèmes de concurrence d'ampleur modérée. Un certain nombre
d'autorités de concurrence ont mené des enquêtes sur les pratiques anticoncurrentielles dans
ce secteur. En Afrique du Sud, une enquête a révélé des clauses exclusives dans les contrats
de location entre les propriétaires de centres commerciaux et les trois plus grandes chaînes de
distribution, bien que la Comission de concurrence n'ait pu prouver l'effet anticoncurrentiel. Une
affaire relative aux clauses d'exclusivité dans les contrats de location a également été examinée en
Zambie. Au Kenya, l'autorité de concurrence a condamné à une sanction pécuniaire deux magasins
de distribution pour s'être mis d'accord d'éliminer la concurrence sur leurs prix. En plus des
enquêtes, certaines autorités de concurrence ont conseillé leur gouvernement sur l'élaboration
des politiques visant à augmenter la concurrence dans ce secteur. L'autorité de concurrence
de la Namibie, par exemple, a mené une étude qui a soutenu l'initiative du gouvernement en
matière d'élaboration d'une charte sur le commerce de détail en vue de soutenir le renforcement
du secteur namibien de la distribution de détail. Actuellement, l'Afrique du Sud poursuit une
approche de plaidoyer en réponse aux constats sur les clauses exclusives dans les contrats de
location de centres commerciaux et a ouvert une enquête dans ce secteur.

Avec l'augmentation de l'utilisation de l'énergie en Afrique subsaharienne, de nombreux
gouvernements intensifient leurs efforts d'accroissement des investissements dans le secteur
de l'énergie en éliminant les obstacles réglementaires et politiques. Environ 30 pays africains ont
mis en place des régulateurs d'électricité indépendants. Compte tenu de la prévalence continue
en Afrique des sociétés d'électricité étatiques, les problèmes de concurrence se posent souvent
en termes d'absence de neutralité concurrentielle. Dans certains cas, les entreprises publiques
ou le secteur tout entier n'est pas par la législation sur la concurrence. En outre, il est nécessaire
de garantir à la fois la neutralité de la fiscalité et de la réglementation vis-à-vis des opérateurs
étatiques du secteur de l'énergie. Les dispositions qui autorisent des producteurs d'électricité
indépendants, ainsi que les modalités permettant aux gros consommateurs de choisir leur
fournisseur d'énergie, ne sont pas très répandues en Afrique. Du point de vue de l'application
de la loi, la concentration en amont dans les marchés du gaz a conduit à des enquêtes sur des
abus de position dominante en Afrique du Sud et en Zambie. En outre, plusieurs fusions ont été
examinées par les autorités de concurrence dans le secteur de l'énergie.

        Le rôle croissant du tourisme dans les stratégies de développement des pays peut indiquer que
        les autorités de concurrence commenceront bientôt à mettre davantage d'accent sur ce secteur.
        Aucun problème de concurrence important n'a été signalé par les pays participants à l'enquête FAC-
        GBM de 2015. Certains ont, toutefois, signalé des préoccupations de moindre importance, telles que
        les accords de concession restrictives pour la fourniture de services d'accueil, des exigences restrictives
        en matière d'obtention des autorisations et des permis et des restrictions sur les fournisseurs de
        transferts des circuits touristiques. Le Botswana, les Seychelles et la Tunisie ont mené des enquêtes
        dans le secteur du tourisme. La Tunisie a imposé une sanction. Pendant la période 2013-2014, 20
        fusions ont fait l'objet d'enquête dans ce secteur. Les problèmes de concurrence peuvent survenir sur
        des marchés connectés à des chaînes de valeur touristiques, par exemple, dans le transport aérien
        des passagers, le transport de plaisance et les agences de voyages.


         Des problèmes de concurrence ont été identifiés dans des secteurs importants,
          tels que le transport aérien, le fret routier, le commerce de détail et l'énergie.


        4.	 L’agenda futur
        L'étude montre que les gouvernements pourraient mettre l'accent sur quelques domaines clés
        pour encourager la concurrence sur les marchés et exploiter la participation du secteur privé en
        vue d'un impact maximum. Les domaines d'intérêt sont : la mise en application de la législation
        en la matière et le plaidoyer en faveur de cadres réglementaires favorables à la concurrence. Le
        FAC a un rôle à jouer dans le soutien des changements réglementaires, le partage d'informations
        et le renforcement des capacités dans l'optique de soutenir le renforcement des autorités de
        concurrence et d'accroître l'effectivité de la politique de concurrence.

        Le FAC pourrait soutenir la convergence des principes régissant l'application efficace de la
        législation en matière de concurrence. Un tel soutien pourrait être particulièrement utile pour
        : (i) un contrôle efficace des fusions en vue de réduire la lourdeur administrative excessive et de
        réorienter les ressources sur les transactions qui sont plus susceptibles de soulever des problèmes
        de concurrence, y compris des seuils de notification adéquats des fusions, des procédures à double
        phase, des lignes directrices claires et transparentes sur la prise en compte de l'intérêt public en tant
        que de besoin, et des mécanismes de coordination entre les organismes nationaux et régionaux ; et
        (ii) l'application effective de la législation anti-entente dans l'optique de décourager les pratiques
        nuisibles au travers de la coordination et de l'analyse régionales des pratiques détectées qui
        pourraient affecter plus d'un pays, de la rationalisation de l'utilisation des dérogations favorisant
        les pratiques anticoncurrentielles, de l'amélioration du système de sanctions pécuniaires et des
        valeurs d'amendes maximales, et de l'adoption de politiques visant à faciliter la hiérarchisation des
        traitement des affaires et à accroître l'efficacité de la mise en application.

        Compte tenu des défis existant sur les marchés africains, les autorités tireront avantage à
        tenir compte des priorités pour la répartition des ressources en vue de prévenir les pratiques
        anticoncurrentielles les plus nuisibles et d'utiliser plus efficacement les pouvoirs et les outils
        disponibles. Dans certains cas, il est nécessaire de réviser les amendes en vue de parvenir à une
        dissuasion adéquate et d'évaluer les procédures administratives qui pourraient augmenter les
        lourdeurs administratives sur les entreprises et les autorités.

Résumé exécutif



 Comme le démontre l'analyse des trois principaux secteurs, les gouvernements peuvent prendre
 des mesures visant à atténuer les risques éventuels de comportements anticoncurrentiels dans
 différents secteurs. L'interaction entre les paramètres sectoriels, le degré d'intégration verticale
 et les restrictions réglementaires applicables aux chaînes logistiques créent des dynamiques
 différentes sur les marchés. Certains paramètres peuvent encourager des comportements
 particuliers, tels que l'entente sur les marchés du ciment et des engrais et la forclusion dans le
 secteur des télécommunications. Les règles qui rendent les marchés plus ouverts et concurrentiels
–– en facilitant les importations, en soutenant l'entrée dans la production ou l'exploitation, et en
 offrant l'opportunité à toutes les entreprises de compétir selon les mêmes règles –– faciliteront
 la réduction de la concentration et de la domination, et donc la probabilité des pratiques
 anticoncurrentielles. Sur la base des caractéristiques de certains marchés et du comportement
 antérieur des entreprises opérant dans le secteur dans la région, les autorités de concurrence
 peuvent surveiller étroitement certains marchés.

Le FAC pourrait renforcer le soutien qu'il offre aux efforts de plaidoyer de ses membres
dans leur optique d'ajuster les politiques et la réglementation qui restreignent inutilement la
concurrence et facilitent les pratiques anticoncurrentielles. Il est possible d'atteindre cet objectif
en créant des sous-groupes plus petits, plus soudés, constitués des autorités de concurrence des
pays ayant des liens économiques, et en élargissant la sensibilisation en direction d'un groupe
de parties prenantes plus large, telles que les régulateurs sectoriels, le milieu des affaires, le
milieu universitaire et la société civile. Il serait important de continuer à mener des recherches
sur l'analyse de la concurrence sur les marchés intérieurs des pays concernés ; à élargir l'analyse
du commerce et de la concurrence pour intégrer l'aspect régional, étant donné que les acteurs
du marché prennent des décisions d'affaires au niveau régional ; et à préparer une stratégie
permettant de soutenir la mise en œuvre des principales recommandations du rapport. Les pays
ayant une culture de concurrence embryonnaire bénéficieraient à s'inspirer des exemples d'autres
pays pour montrer que la concurrence influence le renforcement de l'efficacité des politiques
gouvernementales, et le FAC peut devenir un forum d'échange de ces informations.


     Le FAC peut aider à soutenir les modifications réglementaires, à partager
       l'intelligence économique, à renforcer les capacités des autorités de
  concurrence et à accroître la capacité des décideurs à intégrer les principes de
    la politique de concurrence dans d'autres politiques publiques nationales.

        C     ompetition policy is a tool through which African countries can achieve their aspirations
              of prosperity based on inclusive growth and sustainable development (AUC 2014).
        Competition fosters more productive firms and industries (Kitzmuller and Licetti 2012; Goodwin
        and Pierola 2015), while encouraging firms to deliver the best deals for consumers, to protect
        poorer households from paying more for consumer goods, and to facilitate access to a broader
        set of goods (Begazo and Nyman 2016). Competition authorities can play an important role in
        encouraging and safeguarding competition in African markets, both by enforcing rules against
        cartelization, abuses by dominant firms, and mergers that are likely to harm competition, and
        through advocacy for the amendment of policies and regulations that restrict competition and
        facilitate anticompetitive business practices.


        Nevertheless, in many African countries competition is restricted by businesses practices that
        undermine competitive dynamics and by government interventions and regulations that create
        obstacles to healthy competition.5 Many economies are still marked by entry restrictions, by
        limitations on private investment, by rules that increase business risks and facilitate agreements
        among competitors, and by rules that discriminate against certain competitors or affect
        competitive neutrality.


        This report reviews competition policy and competition law enforcement across various countries
        in Africa, highlighting the important progress made and identifying areas for further development.

               facilitate anticompetitive practices. Based on the strategy of the African Competition Forum
               (ACF), this report focuses on cement, fertilizer, and telecommunications—all key inputs to
               economic activity and relevant for citizens. It also summarizes emerging issues in air and

This report is based primarily on the contributions of ACF members and research conducted
by the World Bank Group (WBG). Building on WBG-designed instruments used in other regions,
the WBG and ACF developed questionnaires to collect information on the characteristics of
competition law and policy across the economy and in selected sectors. These questionnaires were
administered to national and regional competition authorities and entities in charge of promoting
competition. Survey responses were received from 19 national competition authorities and three
regional bodies.6 The information collected in the questionnaires was complemented by reports
prepared by the ACF during the period 2010–14 (ACF 2011; Mbongwe et al. 2014; ACF 2013),
by competition authorities’ reports on antitrust cases and advocacy actions for procompetition
reforms, and by desk research carried out by the WBG. The WBG’s Market and Competition
Policy Assessment Tool was used to analyze competition law enforcement and competition in
selected sectors.

A. THE Importance of Competition
   Policy for Africa
1. The benefits of removing barriers to competition

P   rivate sector development is at the center of economic transformation in a number of African
   states’ national and regional development strategies, and competition is necessary to ensure
benefits for citizens. A growing number of African governments are moving toward reducing their
involvement in providing services and products that can be delivered more efficiently by the private
sector. The social benefits of private sector participation can only be achieved when markets are
competitive, however. Competition policy—competition law enforcement against anticompetitive
business practices, together with market policies, regulations,and other government interventions
enabling all firms to compete on a level playing field—is therefore essential. Nonetheless, the
magnitude of the benefits that competition can deliver depends on institutional conditions such
as good governance within the private sector, public sector, and civil society.


Encouraging open and competitive markets is a means to increase productivity and spur
sustainable economic growth in Africa. Competition does this through two key mechanisms: it
shifts market share toward more efficient producers and induces the exit of inefficient ones, and
it incentivizes firms to become more efficient. This process drives firms to offer competitive prices,
higher quality, and new and more varied goods and services. Competition in domestic markets
in turn affects the international competitiveness of domestic firms.7 The economic benefits from
competition are well documented,8 but empirical research for African countries is limited. This
report aims to motivate the development of additional studies.


Competition policy reforms can deliver benefits for the poorest households and improve
income distribution. Frameworks that enable competition help empower the poorer segments of
society, increase their buying power, and give them greater economic opportunity. Uncompetitive
consumer product markets harm families, especially the poorest ones, while more open markets
benefit low-income households (Urzua 2013; Creedy and Dixon 1998, 2000; Argent and Begazo
2015).9 A lack of competition in food markets hurts the poorest households the most, as will be
seen in subsection 3 of this chapter. Consumers pay artificially high prices for goods and services
due to cartels (Connor and Lande 2010, 2012; Mncube 2013), and restrictive and burdensome
product market regulations hold back job creation (Bertrand and Kramarz 2001; Blanchard and
Giavazzi 2003; Nicoletti and Scarpetta 2005; Schiffbauer et al. 2015). Empirical literature also shows
that competition in input markets and between buyers helps farmers and small businesses (Begazo
and Nyman 2016).

    Lack of competition, on the other hand, dampens economic growth and welfare distribution.
    According to Dutt (1984), policies that reduce monopoly power can have positive effects on growth
    and income distribution. Furthermore, competition is an important factor in ensuring that trade
    liberalization has a positive distributional impact (Sexton et al. 2007; Borjas and Ramey 1995).


    Competition policy aims to foster economic welfare by ensuring that all businesses can interact
    on a level playing field and by facilitating entry to markets while penalizing and preventing
    anticompetitive behavior. The competition policy framework includes the set of policies and
    laws that ensure that competition in the marketplace is not restricted in such a way as to reduce
    economic welfare (Motta 2004). It encompasses measures designed to reduce or eliminate
    obstacles to well-functioning markets. These obstacles can arise as a result of business practices
    (such as cartel agreements, abuses by dominant firms, and anticompetitive mergers) or public
    policies that have unintended negative effects on competition (such as statutory monopolies,
    discriminatory treatment of firms, and regulations that facilitate agreements among competitors).
    An effective competition policy includes economy-wide enforcement of antitrust rules designed to
    deter anticompetitive practices and mergers, together with sectoral regulations and government
    interventions that actively encourage competition or minimize the negative effects of other
    government policies on competition. This report covers both aspects of competition policy.

    to gain from increasing competition.10 Figure A-1

                     North Africa and Sub-Saharan Africa have space to enhance the effectiveness of competition
                     policies. African countries rank lowest on the following two indicators: (i) the extent to which rules
                     prevent the development of economic monopolies and cartels; and (ii) the extent to which the
                     fundamentals of market-based competition have developed (Figure A-4).14 For both indicators,
                     there is substantial variation across countries. In the case of competition policy and enforcement—
                     according to Bertelsmann Stiftung’s Transformation Index (BTI), which is derived on the basis
                     of expert assessments—Eritrea and Somalia do not take legal or political measures to prevent
                     anticompetitive practices and mergers that are likely to harm competition, while South Africa has
                     appropriate laws that are enforced to a significant extent (Figure A-5).

                     Policy and regulatory barriers to competition affect how markets function; for example, rules
                     that restrict foreign investment can induce concentration of economic activities among a limited
                     number of domestic investors. Rules on foreign direct investment (FDI) are perceived to be less
                     favorable in Africa than in other regions (Figure A-6), and restrictions on foreign equity ownership
                     could limit entry in certain markets. Policies and rules on FDI are perceived most positively in
                     Rwanda and Mauritius and most negatively in Zimbabwe. Some countries impose caps on foreign

highest. These barriers to trade could reinforce the dominance of players in domestic markets and
create conditions that facilitate anticompetitive practices. As will be seen in sections C1 and C2,
non-tariff barriers to imports affect the functioning of key input markets (cement and fertilizers).

                                      3. Potential gains from boosting competition in Africa
                                      Addressing weaknesses in Africa’s competition policy would help strengthen the region’s
                                      competitiveness. Sub-Saharan and North African countries rank fairly low, on average, on indicators
                                      of innovation, technology adoption, and competitiveness. Based on available data, indicators
                                      of innovation present a clear positive correlation with both the effectiveness of antimonopoly
                                      policy and the intensity of local competition. Similarly, firm-level technology absorption shows
                                      a relatively strong positive association with the effectiveness of antimonopoly policy and the
                                      intensity of competition at both regional and global levels. Further analysis is needed to clarify the
                                      contribution of competition to export competitiveness and productivity growth in Africa.17


                                      Consumer welfare could be enhanced by more competitive markets—for example, through
                                      lower prices. Available retail price data provide preliminary evidence that retail prices are higher
                                      in Africa than in the rest of the world, potentially reflecting weak competition, among other factors.
                                      Even when controlling for GDP per capita and transport costs,18 prices of 10 consumer goods are,

                                         prevent firms from competing freely on a level playing field. The four factors include a lack of freedom to set prices, unfair competitive
                                         practices, vested interests, and discriminatory treatment of foreign firms.

equivalent increase in disposable income of more than $700 million (2015 dollars) a year would
lift people above the poverty line—approximately 270,000 in Kenya, 200,000 in South Africa,
and 20,000 in Zambia.

B. Toward a More Effective
   Competition Policy Framework

T  he basic purpose of competition laws and policies is to allow markets to work more
   efficiently for the benefit of consumers and to drive sustainable economic growth (Kitzmuller
and Licetti 2012). Effective competition policy has a positive impact on total factor productivity
growth (Bucchirossi et al. 2013) and competitiveness (Goodwin and Pierola 2015). In addition,
competition law enforcement can prevent overcharges (of as much as 49 percent) that may result
from anticompetitive conduct, such as cartel behavior.21 Competition authorities enforce these
laws and respond to market developments such as mergers and business behavior that can harm
competition, thus protecting African citizens and businesses. As of October 2015, competition
laws have been enacted in 27 African countries and five regional communities, and two regional
agreements include commitments to cooperate in the implementation of competition laws.22 At
least six countries are discussing the adoption of competition laws.23


Effective implementation of competition law and policy depends on several elements (Figure B-1).
It is not enough to have in place a primary legal and policy framework (A). It is also important
to have an adequate institutional structure and resources (B). More specific rules and skills are

     needed to enforce the law and use its powers and mechanisms to investigate, stop, and prevent
     anticompetitive practices and mergers (C). Finally, in order to encourage competition across
     the economy, authorities collaborate with other government bodies and inform government
     interventions based on fact-based market studies and advisory opinions (D). This chapter analyzes
     the major features of these elements in African jurisdictions.

     1.	 Legal and policy framework: increasing adoption and implementation of
         competition laws
     The number of jurisdictions with competition laws has almost tripled in 15 years. In 2000, 13
     jurisdictions had adopted competition laws. By 2015, this number had increased to 32 jurisdictions.
     Competition authorities24 have been operating in 23 countries and two regional communities
     for an average of 10 years (Figure B-2).25

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



Competition laws in African jurisdictions are similar in scope. Most competition laws cover
restrictive trade practices (anticompetitive horizontal and vertical agreements and abuse of
dominance), merger control, and competition advocacy.26 In some cases, such as Algeria and
Botswana, the law covers anticompetitive actions of state and public bodies and actions of public
officials that facilitate anticompetitive agreements.


The competition frameworks share similar goals. The three most common objectives are to
ensure an effective competitive process, promote consumer welfare, and enhance efficiency.
Some jurisdictions include other goals, such as those related to equity. For example, South Africa
seeks to promote a greater spread of ownership, in particular to increase the ownership stakes
of historically disadvantaged persons, and to promote employment and advance the social and
economic welfare of South Africans. In Botswana and Cameroon, citizen empowerment is also
included as an objective.


Recent reform of existing legal frameworks and the establishment of new competition
frameworks and authorities in some countries are steps toward increasing the effectiveness
of competition policy in Africa. Since 2009, Kenya, Zambia, Morocco, Egypt, Ethiopia, South
Africa, and Tunisia have reformed their competition frameworks. These reforms have provided the
competition authorities in Morocco and Egypt with greater independence, and those in Kenya and
Zambia with mechanisms to strengthen deterrence. Amendment of the competition law bolstered
the power of the Competition Commission of South Africa (CCSA) to carry out market inquiries as
part of its advocacy mandate. Box B-1 describes further examples of reform.


Most African countries have consumer protection frameworks, and some of these are
implemented by competition authorities. In some countries, the consumer protection framework
has been combined with competition regulation, while in others the two are separate and, in some
cases, enforced by different bodies. Countries where the competition law has been combined
with consumer protection regulation include Ethiopia, Kenya, Rwanda, Tanzania, Zambia, and
Zimbabwe. In The Gambia and Malawi, consumer protection and competition frameworks are
distinct but implemented by the same authority. Combining competition law with consumer
protection has been helpful in advocating for the enactment of competition laws and increasing
the visibility of authorities, but it requires a careful balance in the allocation of resources across
the two functions.




 	
26
     Competition advocacy is the role that competition authorities play in informing the formulation of national or regional economic policies,
     regulations, procedures, and other government interventions with the aim of promoting measures to safeguard and enable firm entry and
     rivalry in different markets across the economy.

 Box B-1
 Reform of existing legal frameworks and the establishment of new competition frameworks

     Kenya: The enactment of the Competition Act 2010, which came into effect in August 2011, established the Competition
     Authority of Kenya (CAK) as an independent body, replacing the Monopolies and Prices Commission (which fell
     under the National Treasury). Notably, price regulation provisions were eliminated. More recently, amendments
     to the Competition Act through the enactment of the Finance Act 2014 went some way toward addressing some
     outstanding issues. Among these amendments were provisions to allow for a leniency program, whereby firms could
     be incentivized to disclose cartel behavior or to cooperate with an investigation by the authority in exchange for
     reduced fines. The amendments also mandated that all professional associations apply for exemptions to horizontal
     agreements in case their rules could amount to a restrictive trade practice.

     Morocco: The adoption of the Freedom of Prices and Competition Law (Law No. 104-12) and Law No. 20-13 on the
     Competition Council substantially modified antitrust and merger control regimes in Morocco. The laws have not yet
     entered into force, however, as they are awaiting adoption of the decrees necessary for their implementation. Before
     this reform, the original 1999 competition law granted the Competition Council only consultative powers and limited
     its responsibilities to issuing advice, guidance, and recommendations. The prime minister was regarded as the
     administrative authority responsible for competition policy and had the exclusive power to decide whether or not to
     follow up on the Council’s recommendations (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2014), while also having the power to designate
     members of the Competition Council (see Merghadi n.d.).

     Tunisia: Tunisia amended its competition law in 2015, after almost two years of intense discussions. The new
     law strengthens: (i) the mandate of the Competition Council; (ii) the transparency of the decision making of the
     Competition Council and the Ministry of Commerce; (iii) the redefinition of exemption criteria; (iv) the possibility to
     engage in targeted economic analysis to motivate decision-making; (v) leniency for cartel cases; and (vi) provisions
     on sanctions that are more severe than in the previous regime, among others.




             2. Operational framework: institutional independence and additional resources
              Most agencies responsible for the administration of competition policy are structured as
              independent bodies, according to survey responses (ACF 2013; ACF-WBG 2015). Of 28
              authorities surveyed, 64 percent identify themselves as structurally independent bodies. Under
              at least 10 regimes in the region, however, the competition authority is embedded in a ministry
              as a government department (or is under the strict supervision of the prime minister). In these
              cases, the competition authority remains budget-dependent or administratively dependent
              on government ministries under different forms of accountability. It is widely recognized that
              competition authorities require a substantial degree of independence to conduct their activities in
              a professional, technical, nonpartisan, competent, and effective manner.


              Having access to enough budgetary resources is essential for competition authorities to be able
              to effectively implement competition law and policy. Government budget allocations are common
              and usually carried out by the parent ministry (usually the trade ministry). Other mechanisms are
              parliamentary allocations, self-financing by charging fees for merger review, or a combination of
              the two. Provision of a competition agency’s budget by the ministry in which the agency is housed
              is generally considered to be suboptimal, since it creates financial dependency that can damage

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



the agency’s perceived independence and political neutrality. Kenya, Malawi, and Tanzania are
examples of countries whose authorities are partially self-financing. In the ACF 2013 survey, Kenya
and Malawi stated that 10 percent of their total funding came from fees, whereas Tanzania reported
this figure to be 21 percent. Among countries that reported 2013 allocations, competition agency
budgets ranged from de minimis fractions of GDP for some (such as Cameroon and Tunisia) to 0.04
percent and 0.03 percent of GDP, respectively, for The Gambia and Namibia.


The annual budget of competition authorities has increased, pointing to their greater importance
and more significant government support. The average annual budget of competition authorities
in Africa grew by at least 39 percent between 2009 and 2014.27 The average annual budget
amounts to approximately $3 million, but falls to $1.4 million when South Africa is excluded. Seven
authorities hold an annual budget below $0.5 million. Among African competition authorities, the
average annual budget allocation per technical staff member is one-third of that in established
competition authorities around the world.28



      The average annual budget of African competition authorities increased
                  by at least 39 percent between 2009 and 2014.


Heads of governments and ministries in Africa appear to play a key role in appointing competition
authority members (such as commissioners, chairpersons, or directors), which may hamper
their independence. In none of the countries that responded to the 2015 survey were members
appointed by parliament, although in Kenya members were vetted by parliament. It was most
common for members to be appointed by the president or the prime minister; this procedure
was reported in Algeria, Malawi, Mauritius, Morocco, Rwanda, Senegal, and Tunisia. Next most
frequent was appointment by a single minister, such as the trade minister (in Botswana, Burkina
Faso, Egypt, Mali, Namibia, Zambia, and Zimbabwe), the national treasury minister (in Kenya), and
the economic development minister (in South Africa). In a few cases, appointments were made by
the president or prime minister in conjunction with a minister; usually the competent minister would
propose the candidate, and the president or prime minister would make the appointment (as in the
Seychelles, Tanzania, and Togo). For COMESA, the members of the board and the board director
are appointed by the COMESA Council of Ministers upon nomination by the secretary general.


It is a positive finding for independence, however, that for 15 of the authorities surveyed in 2015,
the government cannot veto the authority’s decisions. The government (usually the minister or
the prime minister) holds this type of veto power in only a few cases. In Morocco, for example,
the minister can overturn a decision to prohibit a merger on public interest grounds. Similarly, in
Namibia, the Competition Act allows the minister of trade and industry to review commission
decisions on mergers. In the EAC, the Council of Ministers may, upon appeal, approve a merger
objected by the authority.

     Staffing is an important determinant of a competition authority’s operational capability.
     Authorities in Africa employ, on average, 21 technical staff who handle competition matters.
     There is a great deal of variation, however, with 132 staff in South Africa compared to fewer than
     10 staff in nine out of 23 authorities. In a number of cases, survey respondents identified limited
     human resources as one of the main factors undermining their efficiency and their power to detect
     and sanction anticompetitive conduct effectively. These limitations include both overall staff
     numbers and the economic or legal skills of staff members. Authorities citing such issues include
     Egypt, Malawi, Mauritius, Senegal, the Seychelles, Togo, and Tunisia. Since 2009, however, the
     situation appears to have improved for a number of authorities. Of note are Botswana, Ethiopia,
     the Seychelles, and Swaziland—all of which had fewer than 10 staff members in total in 2009 and
     increased steadily to over 10 staff members by 2013 in most cases (ACF 2014). Furthermore, the
     proportion of staff working on competition in African authorities is approximately 32 percent of
     total staff, less than half the average of 68 percent in a sample of 34 established non-African
     competition authorities.


     3.	 Competition law enforcement: the role of competition agencies in fighting
         anticompetitive conduct
     In most African countries that have enacted a competition law, the law covers two main areas—
     restrictive trade practices and merger control—but many frameworks provide for exclusions
     from the law’s application. Restrictive trade practices (or restrictive business practices, in some
     jurisdictions) consist of agreements, further distinguished as horizontal (between competitors in a
     market) or vertical (between firms along the supply chain), and abuse of dominant position. Based
     on responses to the 2015 ACF-WBG survey,29 competition laws cover restrictive trade practices
     in all jurisdictions and merger control in 90 percent of jurisdictions. Authorities have been active
     in conducting investigations in all areas; in two years, they completed 112 cases on restrictive
     trade practices and 1,216 merger reviews (Table B-1).30 Competition law applies to all economic
     sectors, products, and types of organizations carrying out commercial activities in at least five

countries: Cameroon, Kenya, Senegal, the Seychelles, and Togo. In some jurisdictions, certain
sectors or products as well as state-owned enterprises can be excluded from the application of the
law if another legal instrument provides for that. Conduct that is required or authorized by other
government authorities falls outside the scope of the competition law in at least nine jurisdictions.


 Each year, competition authorities in Africa complete, on average,31 41 cases on merger
  control, 1.9 cases on abuse of dominance,32 1.4 cases on horizontal agreements,33 and
          1.4 sector inquiries, but there is significant variation across authorities.



Cartels and other horizontal agreements

Given their potential to significantly reduce competition and consumer welfare, restrictive
agreements between competitors in a market are an enforcement priority in many jurisdictions.
Examples of these harmful agreements include those in which competitors coordinate to fix prices
at a higher level or total quantity at a lower level than would be sustained under competition.
Alternatively, they may agree not to compete by dividing or sharing markets, thus reducing
consumer welfare.


Cartels in Africa have reduced consumer welfare and affected value chains. A South African
cartel in precast concrete products rendered an overcharge in the range of 17–28 percent in
Gauteng, and 51–57 percent in KwaZulu-Natal (Khumalo et al. 2014), exerting a downstream effect
on the construction industry. Furthermore, studies show that in South Africa, for example, a cartel
between major bread manufacturers from 1996 to 2007 overcharged independent bakeries by
7–42 percent on the price of wheat flour (Mncube 2013), which harmed not only bakeries but also
consumers of bread. A recent WBG study finds a significant reduction in poverty—0.4 percentage
points, or over 200,000 individuals—from simultaneously tackling cartels in wheat products, maize
flour, poultry, and pharmaceuticals in South Africa (World Bank 2016a). In Zambia, an alleged
cartel in fertilizer for the national input support program (currently under investigation) would
have cost the government $21 million (Box B-2). Cartels can also involve more than one country;
the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) cement cartel included market division agreements
involving markets in South Africa, Namibia, and Botswana.34

Most jurisdictions in Africa consider hard core cartels to be illegal.35 A hard core cartel is defined
as “an anticompetitive agreement, anticompetitive concerted practice, or anticompetitive
arrangement by competitors to fix prices, make rigged bids (collusive tenders), establish output
restrictions or quotas, or share or divide markets by allocating customers, suppliers, territories, or
lines of commerce” (ICN 2005). In most regimes, per se prohibited practices include fixing the sale
prices of goods and services; dividing markets by allocating customers or territories; colluding on

     Box B-2
     Examples of African cartels

     Zambian fertilizer cartel: In 2012, Zambia’s Competition and Consumer Protection Commission received a complaint
     in relation to the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP). Nyiombo Investments Limited and Omnia Fertiliser
     Zambia Limited had been supplying fertilizer under the FISP for 10 years. The complainant alleged that Nyiombo
     and Omnia were dividing the market for tendered fertilizer under the FISP. Based on documents seized from the
     two parties, the Commission established that there was an agreement between them and imposed a fine of $20
     million. The parties appealed the matter to the Competition and Consumer Protection Tribunal, which ruled in their
     favor. The Commission then appealed to the High Court, which also ruled in favor of the parties. The Commission
     has further appealed the matter to the Supreme Court against the judgment of the High Court, and the matter is
     currently pending. Vilakazi (2015) estimates that savings from ending the cartel would have been around $21 million.

     SACU cement cartel: In 2008, the CCSA initiated investigations against the country’s four main cement producers:
     PPC, Lafarge, AfriSam, and NPC (Cimpor), raiding their offices in 2009. The investigation was sparked by research
     findings that cement prices had doubled since 2001 and, despite fluctuations in demand and input costs, producers’
     prices for cement had increased in tandem every six months—by a much greater degree than the producer price
     index, the leading indicator of overall costs in the economy (Madiba 2009). Subsequently, PPC applied for leniency
     and confirmed the existence of a cartel among the four cement producers. AfriSam also admitted that it had entered
     into agreements with PPC, Lafarge, and NPC to divide markets and indirectly fix the price of cement.

     According to the CCSA, there was a strong regional dimension to this cartel. Part of the collusion was an agreement
     that PPC would not compete with Lafarge in the northern South African market of Kwa Zulu-Natal in exchange for
     Lafarge not competing with PPC in the Botswana market. Moreover, the cartel had agreed that PPC would supply the
     Botswana cement market, while AfriSam would supply Namibia. The companies were able to monitor the collusive
     agreement in part by sharing monthly sales data through the Concrete and Cement Institute of South Africa.

     PPC received leniency in exchange for a complete and truthful disclosure of all cartel activities between itself and its
     competitors. Meanwhile, Lafarge and AfriSam settled with the CCSA and agreed to pay penalties of 6 percent and
     3 percent, respectively, of their yearly turnover for cement sales in the SACU region in 2010. The CCSA referred the
     case against NPC to the Competition Tribunal for prosecution.

     Govinda, Khumalo, and Mkhwanazi (2014) estimate that the CCSA’s intervention resulted in a total savings of $424.5–
     547.1 million during 2010-13.




              tender offers; and collectively limiting production, market outlets or access, technical development,
              or investment. Cameroon and Morocco do not consider hard core cartels to be illegal per se. In
              some laws, hard core cartels cannot be exempted (Zambia), but in others it is possible to exempt
              any agreement—including hard core cartels (Ethiopia, Kenya).


              Seven competition authorities detected and punished cartels during 2013–14, the most active
              of which has been South Africa’s CCSA. Three other jurisdictions report having concluded
              investigations on horizontal agreements during the same period. Five out of 15 operational
              competition authorities did not report any horizontal agreement case completed in that time,
              which could be explained by limited resources, tools, and strategies to carry out investigations
              and detect cartels.

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



Cartel activity can be discouraged through measures to reduce incentives for firms to join
cartels or engage in collusive behavior, to increase incentives for firms to deviate from a cartel
agreement, and to increase the probability of detection when a cartel exists. These measures
include: (i) using effective tools to detect cartels (such as leniency programs and dawn raids) and
investigate them; (ii) deterring cartel activity through sufficiently high penalties; and (iii) fostering
market conditions and regulatory frameworks that render cartelization unstable, such as sectoral
regulations that allow for contestability and enable competition in markets. Figure B-3 describes
the steps involved in investigating a potential cartel. Each step requires two resources: the
appropriate legal powers, and staff with adequate experience and training.

Most jurisdictions have the power to conduct investigations, but implementation has been
limited. At least 16 authorities have broad powers of search and seizure through dawn raids
for the gathering of evidence. In some jurisdictions, such as Botswana and Togo, the power to
conduct dawn raids is not clearly and adequately provided for in the competition law. Although
many authorities have search and seizure powers, few have carried out raids. This reduces the
probability of detection and hinders the effectiveness of leniency policies. While authorities
work to increase their capacity to plan and execute dawn raids, they could also proactively
identify and monitor markets where collusion is more likely. Some authorities have teams
dedicated to market intelligence.


The possibility of a hefty sanction can be a significant deterrent against cartel activity, but fines
imposed in African jurisdictions are relatively low. In most jurisdictions the fines for hard core
cartels and anticompetitive practices as stated in the law are in line with international practice

     (10 percent of turnover). In some jurisdictions, however, the maximum fine for hardcore cartels is
     low. 36The value of fines imposed by the CCSA is the highest in the region; companies involved in
     the construction cartel paid $116 million in fines in 2013 alone. In Mauritius, total fines imposed in
     the brewery cartel in 2014 were $748,000. In Kenya, the Association of Kenyan Reinsurers was fined
     $7,000 in 2015 for colluding on reinsurance rates, while two retailers were fined a total of $51,200
     for price fixing. As shown by Ivaldi, Jenny and Khimich. (2016), even in the case of South Africa,
     fines are only 9 percent of excess profits, (on average, considering four cases), compared to 26
     percent in the European Union.


     Leniency programs can be effective in detecting and proving the existence of cartels, but these
     programs are not common in African jurisdictions. A leniency program typically allows a cartel
     member to confess to its involvement in a cartel and cooperate fully with a cartel investigation by
     providing evidence that will aid in proceedings against other cartel members. In exchange, the
     cooperating cartel member receives full or partial immunity from penalties that would otherwise
     have been imposed. Leniency programs can help to detect cartels and obtain the evidence
     required to successfully prosecute them, particularly when competition authorities have proven
     that they have the power and resources to detect and punish cartels. Leniency can also deter
     cartel formation, given the risk that cartel members will cooperate with the competition authority.
     At least seven jurisdictions in Africa have a leniency policy in place, and at least 10 have provisions
     that allow for reduced fines for those who cooperate with investigations and that could be used
     to develop a leniency program. Some authorities, such as the CAK and COMESA Competition
     Commission, are in the process of launching a leniency program. South Africa has received 514
     applications for leniency since the inception of its leniency program in 2004; Mauritius has received
     two, and the other jurisdictions have received none thus far. In countries where there are criminal
     and administrative sanctions, collaboration with the prosecutor's office has not been easy; in South
     Africa, the implementation of a 2009 amendment to the competition law to criminalize cartels has
     been delayed until May 2016.


        In 2013–14, while nine authorities handled 42 horizontal-agreement cases
      (50 percent of which were in South Africa), five operational authorities did not
      complete any cases on horizontal agreements. In the same period, only seven
              authorities set sanctions for at least one horizontal agreement.


     Abuse of dominance

     Firms with sufficiently high market power may abuse their position of dominance by engaging
     in anticompetitive conduct to maintain or enhance their market power. This kind of conduct is
     more likely when markets are relatively small and present a long history of high concentration in
     an environment where market regulations limit entry, reinforce dominance, or favor incumbents.
     Abuse of dominance is typically a two-element offense, proof of which requires establishing

      	
     36
          The maximum fine that the competition authority can impose for hardcore cartels is $98,893 in Kenya, approximately $964 (MWK 500,000)
          or financial gain generated by the offence in Malawi, approximately $5,000 in Zimbabwe, and $10,000 in the EAC.

the existence of dominance (the dominance element) and that the dominance was perpetuated
through abusive conduct (the conduct offense),37 with the result that competition is prevented or
lessened substantially (effects analysis).


African competition regimes define dominance in similar ways, often involving only market share
criteria and without considering potential competition or other market factors. Dominance
is usually assessed by defining a relevant product and geographic market and proving the
existence of “market power” through economic analysis, including market share over time, buyer
power, entry barriers, and strength of rivals, among others. Although market share alone is an
imperfect approximation of market power, market share thresholds are applied across a number
of jurisdictions in Africa for the analysis of dominance. Certain jurisdictions with market share
thresholds for dominance, such as Kenya, Namibia, and South Africa, distinguish between a
threshold of “presumed dominance” in which further evidence is required to establish dominance,
and one of “deemed dominance” in which the market share is large enough that it constitutes
sufficient evidence of dominance. The threshold for deeming a firm dominant is static and
relatively low: between 45 and 50 percent of market share in three countries, and between 25
and 30 percent in three countries and one regional bloc. Figure B-4 shows individual dominance
thresholds for selected jurisdictions. There are, however, jurisdictions that use a behavioral
definition of dominance. In at least eight jurisdictions, there are no thresholds for deemed or
presumed dominance, and two jurisdictions have thresholds for presumed dominance only. In
Egypt and Tanzania, other factors are considered in addition to market share.

             Two types of abusive conduct are commonly defined—exploitative abuses and exclusionary
             abuses—although, in practice, authorities focus on exclusionary abuses. The former refers to
             cases in which firms charge excessively high prices to their customers, pay low prices to suppliers,
             or discriminate among consumers. The latter refers to cases in which behavior by a dominant firm
             excludes or weakens competitors (for example, by refusing to deal with certain players, engaging
             in predatory pricing, or raising rivals’ entry costs through the tying of products), thus allowing
             the firm to create or strengthen a dominant position. In Africa, jurisdictions largely follow the
             provisions of the European Union’s competition law (Article 102 of the Treaty on the Functioning
             of the European Union). Most African jurisdictions include exploitative practices as abuse of
             dominance. Of the 19 responses to the relevant section of the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, exploitative
             practices were prohibited in 18 cases, with Egypt being the only exception. Competition regimes
             across jurisdictions differ with regard to stipulated provisions relating to exclusionary practices, as
              shown in Figure B-5.

             The prosecution of abuse of dominance cases relies on the ability to obtain sound qualitative and
             quantitative empirical evidence and to rigorously analyze whether economic data are consistent
             with the exclusionary effects of the conduct at issue. This process can be cumbersome, particularly
             because of the burden of proof that the competition authority must satisfy (Heimler and Mehta
             2014). When deciding on these cases, the authorities have to consider the effects on consumers,
             the dominant firm, and competitors, and understand the trade-offs that their decisions imply.
             An “effects-based approach” was used successfully by the Competition Tribunal of South Africa
             to determine that the travel agent commission scheme implemented by South African Airways
             between October 1999 and May 2001 was abusive (Federico 2013). Using both qualitative and
             quantitative evidence and detailed empirical analysis, the tribunal determined that South African
             Airways incentivized travel agents to divert passenger traffic away from rival firms (Federico 2013).

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



According to the results of the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, the competition authorities of Botswana,
Namibia, and Algeria have been the most active in completing cases of abuse of dominance.
During 2013–14, Botswana handled the most cases (15), followed by Namibia (9) and Algeria (8).
In the same period, Botswana and Tunisia sanctioned the highest number of abuse of dominance
practices, with five cases each, followed by Egypt, Mauritius, and the Seychelles, with two cases
each. Box B-3 shows examples of abuse of dominance cases in Africa. Cases span various sectors,
including manufacturing and telecommunications.


Box B-3
Examples of abuse of dominance cases in Africa

     Botswana: The 2014 Annual Report of the Competition Authority of Botswana noted an increase in the
     handling of abuse of dominance cases. During 2013–14, investigations were ongoing in sectors such as
     banking, Internet services, and distribution of liquefied petroleum gas.

     Egypt: The Egyptian Competition Authority recently ruled that a carpet manufacturer abused its dominant
     position by enforcing exclusivity clauses in some distributors’ contracts, thereby foreclosing competitors.37
     Moreover, during 2013–14, the Egyptian Court of Appeal of the Economic Court convicted the country’s
     largest steel manufacturer for abusing its dominant position in the steel market, imposing a fine of EGP
     200 million ($25.6 million) (OECD 2014a). The fine was set at EGP 20.5 million ($2.3 million) by the Cassation
     Court in 2016.

     South Africa: During 2013–14, abuse of dominance cases were investigated in the financial services sector
     (exclusive contracts), steel products (excessive pricing), and the pulp and paper industry (excessive pricing).
     In 2013, South African telecommunications company Telkom agreed to an R200 million ($15.4 million)
     settlement with the CCSA over abusing its dominant position in the internet services market.




Vertical agreements

Vertical agreements take place between firms operating at different levels of the supply chain.
These agreements can incentivize optimal investment in relationship-specific assets by reducing
opportunistic behavior and can increase investment in presale services downstream by reducing
free riding by downstream firms, and are therefore generally procompetitive. As long as the
parties face sufficient competition, the efficiency-enhancing effects of vertical restraints typically
outweigh any anticompetitive effect. A significant degree of market power held by any of the
parties can shift this balance, however. Table B-2 shows several examples of vertical agreements
and their anticompetitive and procompetitive effects, highlighting the importance of weighing the
two against each other in assessing the net competitive effect of a vertical agreement.

               Although many vertical agreements may have procompetitive justifications and may not harm
               competition, some effects-based scrutiny remains appropriate in certain contexts. In the United
               States, all vertical restraints (both price and nonprice) are currently subject to a “rule of reason”
               approach rather than illegality per se. The European Union provides a block exemption regulation
               for vertical restraints as long as none of the parties has more than 30 percent market share and the
               agreement does not contain certain types of severe restrictions of competition.


               Many competition laws in Africa cover vertical restraints, either implicitly or explicitly, and without
               the requirement that one of the parties possess significant market power. Competition laws
               cover, for example, exclusive contracts and resale price maintenance. There is room, however, to
               strengthen the analysis of these agreements to better distinguish anticompetitive agreements from
               harmless ones. For example, a number of Africa’s competition laws treat resale price maintenance
               as illegal per se (even for firms that may have a negligible position in the upstream market), despite
               the fact that resale price maintenance can yield efficiencies such as overcoming welfare losses
               from double marginalization. Resale price maintenance is prohibited per se in Botswana, Burundi,
               Kenya, Mauritius, Mozambique, Namibia, the Seychelles, South Africa, Swaziland, and Zambia. In
               Madagascar, resale price maintenance is prohibited per se unless certain criteria are met, such as
               the good being at risk of rapid deterioration or the product’s selling price being in line with the
               price of a trader conducting on business in the same area. In Malawi, an enterprise may apply to
               the competition authority for authorization to engage in resale price maintenance as long as the
               conduct will not: (i) limit access to markets; (ii) unduly restrain competition; or (iii) have an adverse
               effect on trade or the economy in general.

Competition authorities in Africa have begun to investigate restrictive vertical agreements more
actively. According to the results of the 2015 ACF-WBG survey and complementary information,
the most active authorities in this regard during 2013–14 were the Seychelles, with four completed
cases, followed by Algeria with two and South Africa with two. Anticompetitive effects were
not found in all cases. Cases in Kenya and Malawi illustrate examples of vertical agreements by
firms with significant market power that had negative effects on competition and were therefore
punished (Box B-4).


Box B-4
Examples of investigations of exclusive agreements by African competition authorities

 Cameroon: In 2011, CIMENCAM, a cement producer, was fined FCFA 505 million ($1 million) for a vertical agreement
 that excluded CAMSHIP, a transportation company, from the transport of clinker and gypsum. In the same year, the
 Competition Council mandated the elimination of the exclusivity clause between the airport corporation (ADC) and
 Pool HRS (a group of fuel companies including Total, Oil Libya, and others) to allow TRADEX to provide aviation
 refueling services at Garoua International Airport, operated by ADC.

 Kenya: Safaricom is the leading player in Kenya’s mobile financial services market, with a market share of 77 percent
 in terms of subscriptions and 69 percent in terms of the number of agents affiliated with the network as of December
 2014. Its main competitor, Airtel Kenya, has a corresponding market share of 12 percent and 9 percent, respectively.
 Following a complaint lodged by Airtel Kenya against Safaricom, the CAK found that Safaricom had abused its
 dominant position in the market by entering into exclusive contracts with M-PESA mobile money transfer agents
 and prohibiting them from: (i) selling, displaying, or promoting the products and services of any entity in indirect or
 direct competition with M-PESA; and (ii) displaying Safaricom’s branding alongside that of competitors. The CAK
 entered into a settlement agreement with Safaricom, with the latter undertaking to open up M-PESA agents to
 all market players. Safaricom commenced the amendment of the agreements immediately. Assuming, in line with
 international practice, that termination of this abuse of dominance by Safaricom were to lead to a 10 percent decline
 in prices for consumers due to increased competition between mobile financial service providers, the potential
 annual savings to consumers from the CAK’s intervention can be estimated at KSH 3.3 billion ($33.2 million).

 Malawi: Malawi’s Competition and Fair Trading Commission (CFTC) uncovered restrictive business practices by
 companies contracted to transport processed sugar from the country’s sole sugar producer to designated distribution
 centers, where the transporters also managed the warehousing of the product. First, the CFTC enforced its findings
 by issuing a cease and desist order to the principal transport/warehouse management company involved. Facing
 the risk of public pushback, of a successful appeal against the order, or simply of noncompliance with it, the CFTC
 conducted a competition advocacy campaign aimed at giving sugar industry participants and potentially affected
 parties a full understanding of competition laws and stimulating compliance. Coordination throughout the process
 with the ministry of industry and trade was crucial and the campaign achieved considerable success, opening up
 the sugar distribution system and indirectly bringing about other measures that are working to liberalize the sugar
 market more generally.




Justifications or exemptions for otherwise prohibited practices

In certain jurisdictions, specific justifications or ex post exemptions can be taken into account
for practices that would otherwise be prohibited. These provisions permit some of the practices
discussed so far on the basis that their benefits in terms of efficiency or other interests outweigh
their harmful anticompetitive effects. In most cases, the mechanism for recognizing the potential

                                                                            B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



     procompetitive effects of an agreement would be through an exemption, whereas for behavior
     that would otherwise be an abuse of dominance, efficiency defenses would be used to show that
     the behavior is actually procompetitive on a net basis. In some jurisdictions, however, justifications
     for exemptions go beyond economic efficiency.


     At least 18 jurisdictions in Africa contain a framework for exemptions to restrictive practices.
     In Botswana, Burundi, and Tunisia, the exemptions framework allows the analysis of economic
     efficiency factors for abuse of dominance and vertical agreements. In Botswana, Namibia,
     and South Africa, for example, justifications for exemptions also reflect broader public policy
     objectives such as effects on exports and employment, citizen empowerment, competitiveness
     of small and medium-sized enterprises, and stability of an industry. In Malawi, the law allows
     the commission to authorize any behavior or agreement that is not illegal unless abused—for
     example, vertical restraints.38


     When considering exemption applications, a few jurisdictions do not differentiate between
     horizontal agreements that constitute hard core cartel conduct and those that do not. Best
     practice indicates that exemptions should be available only to agreements that do not restrict
     competition as an objective. For example, laws enacted in Kenya and Namibia do not provide this
     distinction and allow for any agreement among competitors to be evaluated for an exemption.
     In Egypt and Tunisia, an efficiency defense can be used for horizontal agreements. Countries
     where hard core agreements are not prohibited per se, and where exemptions are allowed for any
     agreement, will benefit from strengthening their implementing regulations, guidelines, and practices
     to interpret the law in light of its objectives and avoid setting precedents to exempt cartels.


     Conversely, exemptions may provide an effective regulatory tool for addressing vertical restraints.
     Adopting well-designed block exemptions regulations for vertical restraints has proven effective
     in minimizing the workload of competition authorities and providing markets with certainty. For
     example, South Africa’s CCSA may grant an exemption for a category of agreements or practices.
     Kenya’s CAK was recently granted the right to issue block exemptions, but for any category of
     decisions, practices, or agreements between firms. In countries such as Mauritius and Zambia,
     agreements that are not prohibited per se (or that are not collusive agreements in the case of
     Mauritius) and that meet specific market share thresholds are subject to review by the competition
     authority (mandatory review for authorization in the case of Zambia and an optional review in the
     case of Mauritius).

     Mergers and merger control

     Merger control aims to prevent mergers that have a high probability of generating a significant,
     harmful impact on competition and consumers. Merger control is a policy tool that seeks to
     complement the enforcement of behavior regulations and to identify situations in which a change
     in market structure would be likely to affect market outcomes and harm consumers. Mergers arise

        agreement, or understanding that is not prohibited outright by the law—that is, one that is not necessarily illegal unless abused—if it
        is consistent with the objectives of the act and the commission considers that, on balance, the advantages to the country outweigh the
        disadvantages.

through a transaction between two enterprises in which one entity assumes control over another
and two independent economic entities cease to exist. Most mergers benefit consumers and the
economy by encouraging innovation and allowing companies to become more efficient. With
some mergers, however, there is a serious prospect of an increase in market power and resulting
drop in competition and consumer welfare. Postema, Goppelsroeder, and Bergeijk (2006) show
that merger control in the Netherlands led to net benefits of about €100 million per year ($130
million). In the United States, the Department of Justice reported consumer savings of about $1
billion in fiscal year 2009 through merger control review.


More than 25 African jurisdictions have a merger control system in place, although not all are
yet being enforced. At least 15 countries and two regional communities have an enforceable
merger control system. An effective merger control framework consists of four main elements: (i)
appropriate and clear definition of which transactions are subject to review; (ii) clear and efficient
procedures for review; (iii) a robust and technical economic analysis framework; and (iv) enough
human resources and a solid institutional setup (Figure B-6). Most mergers are procompetitive
or neutral to competition, and they facilitate investment and business decisions. Therefore,
competition frameworks provide for instruments to prioritize authorities’ resources and focus on
those mergers that are more likely to have a significant impact on the economy. This approach
minimizes any undue regulatory burden on merging firms and the competition authority. One
option is to establish a system without mandatory notification such as those in Mauritius or the
West African Economic and Monetary Union (WAEMU). In mandatory notification regimes, the
existence of notification thresholds at an appropriate level is essential for an efficient system.

     In systems where notification is mandatory, merger notification thresholds are the norm in most
     jurisdictions, but the level of thresholds varies widely. At least 13 authorities have thresholds
     in place for merger notification, while at least six do not (ACF-WBG 2015). The thresholds are
     objective in most cases, but in some they still depend on market shares (for example, in Cameroon).
     In Ethiopia, Kenya, Malawi, Swaziland, and the EAC, for example, all mergers (regardless of size)
     that meet the stipulated definition in the respective laws are notifiable to the authorities. In
     many cases, however, laws are passed but thresholds are either not set or are too low. Merger
     thresholds were increased in South Africa in 2009 in response to an increased merger review
     workload, accompanied by an increase in filing fees. The COMESA Competition Commission
     revised its thresholds, previously set at zero, and reduced filing fees in 2015. In jurisdictions where
     all mergers must be notified, authorities have set thresholds to clear automatically mergers that
     fall below those values. Kenya has implemented this approach, and Ethiopia is in the process of
     implementing a similar one. There is considerable variation in threshold levels across jurisdictions:
     for COMESA and South Africa, collective thresholds are above $50 million, whereas the collective
     threshold in Tanzania is below $500,000, and collective thresholds in Botswana, Zimbabwe, and
     Zambia are between $1 and $1.5 million.


     Survey results suggest that two-phase procedures for more effective merger review are still
     not common in Africa. Of the 19 responses to the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, only six countries had
     adopted two-phase procedures. COMESA, for example, has adopted a clear two-phase procedure.
     There is widespread recognition globally that conducting two-phase merger reviews can speed
     up the review process and prevent imposition of an undue burden on the private sector. The
     first phase of review is intended to filter out the mergers that are unlikely to prevent or lessen
     competition in the relevant market. The second phase is reserved for mergers that are judged
     to be potentially harmful to competition and therefore merit deeper analysis. Filtering merger
     investigations in this way significantly reduces unnecessary administrative costs for the merging
     enterprises and for competition authorities.


     The role of competition authorities in assessing and clearing mergers has expanded considerably,
     and this has been their most active area by far. South Africa accounts for over half of the 1,216
     merger cases completed by 15 authorities in 2013–14. Botswana, COMESA, Ethiopia, Tanzania,
     and Zambia handled approximately 50 mergers in that period, while Namibia and Kenya handled
     more than 100. The number of merger cases in each jurisdiction reflects not only the size of the
     economy and level of merger activity, but also the triggers for notification and the clarity of merger
     definition, as well as the level of compliance.


     In general, the proportion of mergers that move forward with conditions or are prohibited due
     to competition concerns is limited. On average, 10 percent of mergers are blocked or approved
     with conditions, compared to 4 percent in a sample of 35 established agencies outside Africa.
     As a proportion of completed cases, the number of mergers that were prohibited or accepted
     with remedies is highest in Botswana (39 out of 55) and in South Africa (60 out of 640). In South
     Africa, only one out of 60 of the mergers was prohibited; the remainder were accepted with

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



conditions. In Ethiopia, Kenya, Zambia, and COMESA, most notified mergers have been cleared
without conditions to address competition concerns. For each jurisdiction, it would be important
to analyze whether there is a need to adjust the conditions that trigger mandatory notification
and the internal procedures that allow authorities to screen for mergers that are likely to affect
competition, in order to concentrate efforts on analyzing the most problematic mergers and
designing effective remedies.


              Technical staff handle, on average, 3.2 merger notifications per year,
              compared to 0.8 in established non-African competition authorities.


Many jurisdictions in Africa have adopted some form of public interest test in their review of
mergers, but few have issue guidelines to facilitate implementation and increase predictability.
Of the 19 respondents to the relevant section of the 2015 ACF-WBG survey, 13 authorities stated
that an anticompetitive merger or acquisition could be allowed on noncompetition grounds (such
as public interest) in their jurisdiction. In South Africa, for example, the CCSA and the Competition
Tribunal found that, while the proposed Walmart-Massmart merger did not raise any competition
concerns, it raised public interest concerns related to employment and the potential displacement
of small businesses in markets underserved by large retailers. The merger was approved
subject to conditions addressing these public interest concerns. The first challenge in adopting
a public interest test as part of the merger review process is setting parameters to determine
when a certain public interest is to be addressed (Raslan, forthcoming in 2016). Although some
jurisdictions provide a list of factors that comprise the primary criteria used to evaluate public
interest considerations, these lists are usually not exhaustive.39 Some jurisdictions do not define
public interest issues explicitly, but instead adopt a broad objective in relation to the well-being
of the economy,40 socioeconomic concerns,41 or a national development program.42 In addition,
it is important to set clear boundaries and criteria for the application of a public interest test by
competition authorities. For example, South Africa requires that a public interest consideration
be merger-specific and substantial. Botswana,43 Kenya, Zambia, and South Africa are some of the
countries that have developed or are in the course of drafting guidelines on the assessment of
public interest considerations.

Due process and procedural fairness

Due process is an important factor for effective and sound competition law enforcement that
strengthens the reputation of the competition authority. All of the authorities surveyed in 2015
believed that their competition law provided fair and transparent procedures for the parties
involved in antitrust proceedings. The instruments through which African competition legislation

     or privileged business information would
     not be disclosed to third parties.


     Other tools, such as rules regarding conflicts of interest and separation of functions in handling
     a case, are also present in Africa. Most authorities surveyed in 2015 said that there were clear rules
     to avoid conflicts of interest among case handlers and members of the decision body (15 out of
     19), and most also guarantee the independence of different teams involved in cases by separating
     the three functions of opening an investigation, prosecuting, and reaching a decision (12 out of
     19). Usually the team or body that investigates does not have the power to make decisions or
     to impose orders and fines.44 According to survey results, however, the functions of investigator,
     prosecutor, and adjudicator are not separated in Algeria, Cameroon, Egypt, Tanzania, or the EAC.

     4.	 Integration of competition principles: embedding key concepts into
         government policy
     Government policies, regulations, procedures, and actions affect the level of competition in
     markets and can make markets more prone to anticompetitive practices; therefore, competition
     authorities have an important role as advocates for competition within the government.
     Competition advocacy is the role that competition authorities play in formulating national or
     regional economic policies with the aim of promoting measures to safeguard and enable firm entry
     and rivalry. It entails policies and actions that aim to: (i) ease market entry barriers and guarantee
     equal business opportunities to market participants; (ii) inject market principles into the operations
     of state-owned or state-controlled enterprises; (iii) play the role of a competition advocate in order
     to ensure that sectoral policies follow market principles; and (iv) develop a culture of competition
     by instilling a competition mindset into market players.

        Ministry of Trade is the body of investigation on competition matters and does not have the power to make decisions or impose sanctions.
        Decisions are made by the Competition Council. In Senegal, national authorities investigate while supraregional authorities investigate
        and decide.

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



There are a number of reasons why governments adopt rules and regulations to intervene in
the market. Governments often play a role in correcting market failures, setting the framework
within which natural monopolies operate (as in the case of ex ante regulation), or ensuring that
firms have incentives to compete and that they can do so on a level playing field (as in the case
of competition policy). Governments also intervene in order to achieve social objectives like
poverty reduction.


In some cases, however, regulatory tools and government interventions adopted to achieve
policy objectives may also hinder competition. Regulatory obstacles to competition include
interventions that, in practice: (i) alter entry conditions in a market and reinforce dominance;(ii)
limit businesses’ strategy options, increase costs to compete in the market, or are conducive
to collusive outcomes; and (iii) create discriminatory conditions among players, distort the level
playing field, and protect vested interests. This includes policies, regulations, procedures, and
decisions that affect the whole economy, as well as those that affect specific sectors.


Typically, a competition authority engages in advocacy by providing opinions and statements
on policy and legal reforms, or by conducting sectoral studies and making recommendations to
other government bodies. African competition authorities issued a number of opinions on laws,
regulations, and other government decisions (181 by 13 authorities) and conducted several sector
inquiries (41 by 11 authorities) during 2013–14. South Africa, Tunisia, Kenya, Morocco, and Egypt
have been more active in contributing to the formulation of economic policies through inquiries or
advisory opinions (Figure B-8), while the Seychelles, Tanzania, and COMESA did not carry out any
market inquiries but did issue opinions. Market inquiries covered sectors such as food processing,
agriculture, health, telecommunications, and financial services.

              In most jurisdictions, there are laws in place that specifically authorize or require the competition
              authority to study and comment on legislation or regulations that are being proposed. Almost
              every regime provides that their opinions are not binding, but competition authorities have been
              able to influence the government with technical arguments and to adjust legal frameworks to make
              them more procompetitive. In only a few countries (Burkina Faso, Rwanda, and the Seychelles),
              advocacy powers are not explicitly provided for by the law. Many examples of successful advocacy
              can be cited (Box B-5), including those that have been recognized by the Competition Advocacy
              Contest organized by the WBG in collaboration with the International Competition Network
              (Goodwin and Licetti 2016; World Bank 2014b).45 Successful advocacy spans sectors such as banking,
               mobile financial services, health care, agroprocessing, steel, cement, and public procurement.


                Each year, a competition authority in Africa completes 1.4 sector inquiries and issues
                 6 advisory opinions on laws, regulations, or government interventions in markets.

     Examples of competition advocacy in Africa

      Kenya: The Tea Board of Kenya is mandated with regulating the tea sector and issuing licenses to investors. In order
      to be issued a license for a new tea factory, an investor is required to obtain a “no objection” from existing factories.
      In 2012, Njeru Industries lodged a complaint with the CAK that the Kenya Tea Development Agency (the leading
      management agency for the small-scale tea subsector), Michimikuru Tea Factory, Kiegoi Tea Factory, and Igembe
      Tea Factory were jointly restricting its entry into the market by opposing its request to the Tea Board for a license
      to construct a specialty tea factory. In response, the CAK provided an advisory opinion to the Tea Board indicating
      that the tea market was contestable and that it was therefore possible to license more investors. As a result, Njeru
      Industries was granted a license and has been processing specialty purple tea (80 percent of production), oolong
      tea, and orthodox black tea in its new factory since early 2014. This has not only facilitated investment in the sector,
      but also allowed farmers to receive higher farm-gate prices.

      South Africa: The CCSA contributed to a procompetitive mineral resources policy by providing opinions on the
      competition issues arising in the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Bill 201292. The CCSA’s comments,
      relating to the definition of market dominance and information exchange, were taken into consideration by the
      mineral resources department in drafting the legislation. The CCSA also holds an annual Public Sector Forum that
      serves as a platform for debating key competition concerns and addressing issues such as bid rigging in procurement
      spending. As a result of the engagement on this topic, the National Treasury amended the procurement policy to
      include bid rigging detection and state-run service providers and enterprises (ESKOM, TRANSNET and DENEL)
      committed to using a Certificate of Independent Bid Determination as part of their standard bid documentation.
      There has also been an observable increase in the referral of bid rigging cases from the public sector to the
      Commission for investigations.

      Zimbabwe: The Competition and Tariff Commission worked with the Telecommunications Regulator and the Central
      Bank of Zimbabwe to address regulatory barriers in the telecommunications sector in order to ensure financial
      inclusion. This initiative resulted in a significant reduction in mobile money transfer transaction costs, thereby
      increasing access to mobile payment systems in rural and remote areas.

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



Promoting competition in regulated sectors

Competition law is generally applicable across economic sectors and is a useful complement
to ex ante sector regulation in boosting competition. The roles of competition authorities and
sectoral regulators are essentially complementary. However, when national regulatory authorities
hold competition enforcement powers alongside competition authorities, this generates issues of
concurrent jurisdictions. These issues are present in some countries in Africa. In addition, sector
regulators are in charge of designing the regulatory framework, and competition authorities play
a role in offering advice to integrate competition principles and take advantage of competition
forces to achieve sectoral goals such as expanding access to regulated goods and services.


In Africa, in addition to competition authorities, sector regulators have specific mandates
on competition issues. Fifteen authorities agree that sector regulators have a competition law
mandate in at least one sector of the economy (ACF-WBG 2015). In Kenya, for example, the
Communications Authority and the Kenya Civil Aviation Authority have antitrust mandates. In
Tanzania, although the competition law applies to all sectors, sectoral laws in energy and water,
transport, communications, and civil aviation state that sector regulators shall deal with all
competition issues in the sectors but the Competition Commission can report to the minister if it
is of the opinion that any conduct required, authorized, or approved by the regulators would be
in breach of the Competition Act.


Collaboration between competition authorities and sector regulators is key to enhancing the
effectiveness and efficiency of their actions to the benefit of consumers. A lack of coordination
may generate risks in terms of jurisdictional
conflicts between authorities, double Figure B-9

     Government support to firms: state aid and investment incentives

     Governments provide economic incentives and state aid to businesses to achieve development
     goals, but they can negatively affect competition. State aid can be defined as a transfer of state
     resources that provides an economic advantage to certain private or state-owned firms that carry
     out economic activities. Investment incentives are an example of state aid. State aid encompasses
     tax exemptions, loan guarantees, grants, government resources (such as land, spectrum, or
     water) provided at prices below market level, subsidies, cash transfers, accelerated depreciation
     allowances, and capital injections, among others. State aid provided to select firms can: (i) facilitate
     anticompetitive behavior by protecting or creating dominant players; and (ii) generate market
     inefficiencies by discouraging efficiency and productivity gains of aid recipients.


     Investment incentives and state aid frameworks that provide economic advantages should
     minimize distortions to competition. It is critical, therefore, to have a consistent legal framework
     for regulating the granting of economic advantages to firms. From a competition perspective,
     the effectiveness of an incentive framework can be evaluated according to four key criteria. First,
     incentives should have a clear and measurable objective that aims at address market failure.
     Second, incentives should be awarded on the basis of transparent criteria applied consistently
     across economic activities and firms. Third, incentives should be designed to minimize distortions
     to competition. Fourth, incentives should be granted to broad segments of the economy under
     equal conditions, rather than on an individual-firm basis.


     Most authorities that responded to the 2015 ACF-WBG survey did not report a specific
     framework or procedure for public bodies to follow in granting state aid. Only three authorities
     indicated that criteria to grant state aid included an assessment on market competition (Algeria,
     Senegal, and Togo). Regional trade blocs, such as WAEMU, also have specific supranational state
     aid control rules. The EAC’s Competition Act provides for control of subsidies, but the provisions
     have not yet been implemented. Of the nine authorities that responded to the question on which
     sectors were most frequently the subject of state aid, the most frequently mentioned sector was
     agriculture/agribusiness (mentioned by five countries), followed by small and medium enterprises
     and transport (mentioned twice). In the context of various government initiatives to update
     investment frameworks and to create special economic zones to grant investment incentives, as
     well as the operation of state-owned enterprises that access government funds, understanding
     the effects of state aid on markets and effective competition would be key to conduct a cost-
     benefit analysis.

     Price controls

     Price control rules are among the regulatory tools instituted by governments, often with the aim of
     protecting consumers from excessively high prices or protecting the incomes of small producers.
     While regulating prices in traditional monopoly sectors such as utilities might be warranted, price
     controls in markets where there are many potential suppliers may have adverse effects. Economic
     theory suggests, however, that in most cases the negative effects of such policies on competition
     and innovation outweigh the benefits. Figure B-10 describes the economic circumstances under
     which price controls may be justified.

In Africa, it is fairly common to have laws and regulations that explicitly allow for price controls,
and these are implemented across a range of sectors. Of the 19 ACF-WBG survey respondents
on this topic, 12 responded that such regulations existed. The application of price controls was
most common in gasoline and other fuels, pharmaceuticals, and basic staple foods. In Africa, we
also find institutions that are in charge of both implementing competition law and setting price
controls, mainly in response to concerns about high prices—for example, the National Directorate
for Commerce and Competition in Mali and the Ministry of Trade in Cameroon.


Some competition authorities are consulted in the process of deciding on setting prices controls.
Of the 12 entities that reported having regulations that explicitly allow for price controls, in only
four does the competition authority issue an opinion before the price control enters into force
(Botswana, Mauritius, Morocco, and Senegal). This is a useful tool that allows authorities to assess
where competition conditions do not exist and where price regulation is needed at a particular
moment in time. Six respondents indicated that the competition authority does not issue such
an opinion. Moreover, in six of the 12, price controls are not typically time-bound. It is important
to carefully assess the competitive effect of regulations on prices, with consideration given to
alternative means of meeting policy objectives.

Regional frameworks to promote competition: regional integration agreements
and regional networks

Regional integration can deliver important benefits for African countries, particularly if barriers
to competition are removed in domestic markets. Barriers to competition can stem from policies
and regulations established by member states, but also from anticompetitive business practices
that restrain trade and competition across borders. In this context, supranational competition law
frameworks are necessary to help realize the benefits of integration.

              At both regional and national levels, considerable work has been done in recent years to
              establish basic rules, institutions, and procedures for competition law enforcement. The role
              of supranational organizations is becoming increasingly important, especially in dealing with
              cross-border business activities. Africa is seeing the emergence of regional competition rules and
              organizations that require economic players to use a pan-African approach to assessing risks and
              compliance to competition law. The emergence of a pan-African competition regime for COMESA,

              Competition Policy of 200748 and Competition Act of 200849 are indicative of the inclination
              toward the enforcement of regional competition frameworks. There is, nonetheless, a significant
              amount of overlap in the membership of regional blocs in Africa, and many members lack national
              competition frameworks. This poses additional implementation challenges (Table B-3).

              A key strength of supranational authorities is that they have a broad mandate to legislate and
              detect anticompetitive practices and mergers within their region that have a cross-border
              impact, without being limited by national boundaries. Their greater extraterritorial reach could
              help them address cross-border practices that go beyond the powers of national authorities. It is
              necessary, however, to clarify the boundaries of supranational jurisdictions, especially on merger
              control, to give businesses and national authorities legal certainty. Moreover, under their advocacy
              mandate, regional competition authorities might be able to exert a more independent influence

in giving general advice on competition matters to national competition authorities and member
states, and in sharing competition knowledge and best practices. Some national authorities have
begun to sign MoUs with supranational authorities such as COMESA’s Competition Commission.


With the emergence of new competition agencies in Africa, cooperation among national
and regional competition authorities is crucial to counter the asymmetric development of
competition law regimes in neighboring countries. Eleven authorities reported having cooperated
with another ACF member in the last three years. Furthermore, some countries have entered into
bilateral “Agency-to-Agency Agreements.” This kind of cooperation helps to realize the benefits
of cooperation between competition agencies, without imposing additional commitments or
requiring cooperating agencies to synchronize their laws (Table B-4).

Several projects have been developed among ACF member countries. These projects have aimed
to support the evolution of key institutions of economic governance in participating countries
and to develop an understanding of the importance of regional integration and of competition
matters. These projects include, among others, workshops, capacity building initiatives, training
of staff members from fellow ACF member countries, research, and enforcement cooperation.
One key project was the research program on Competition Dynamics and Regional Trade Flows
that focused on understanding competition issues from a regional perspective. Research projects
were conducted on three key industries: (i) cement (Botswana, Kenya, Namibia, South Africa,
Tanzania, and Zambia); (ii) sugar (Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa, and Zambia); and (iii) poultry
(Botswana, Namibia, South Africa, and Zambia). Training workshops covered topics such as agency
effectiveness, bid rigging in public procurement, and investigative skills.

     A number of authorities participating in the ACF-WBG survey suggested ways in which
     cooperation among authorities could be strengthened through the ACF framework. Among the
     suggestions was the design of a cooperation mechanism framework that would promote sharing
     of information and technical assistance in investigations in specialized areas, as a means to build a
     pool of professionals for the Africa region who can move from one agency to the other to support
     investigations and other missions. A number of authorities mentioned that the development of
     MoUs would help strengthen cooperation among ACF members. One related suggestion was to
     have a specific standard or joint Memorandum of Information Sharing and Cooperation signed
     by all ACF countries to harmonize cooperation efforts in the region and avoid the need to sign
     individual MoUs. It was also suggested that the ACF could increase support for the capacity
     building needs of emerging competition agencies and take a greater lead in sector studies and
     competition assessments to guide the enforcement work of its members.


     5. Achievements, challenges, and priority objectives among ACF members
     Competition enforcement in the region has advanced steadily, but there are challenges with
     regard to achieving priority objectives in the broader economic agenda. This subsection
     presents the views of competition authorities or ministries in charge of competition policy on
     their achievements in recent years, critical challenges faced in implementing their mandate, and
     goals for the future. Submissions were provided by 19 countries (Algeria, Botswana, the Republic
     of the Congo, Gambia, Guinea, Kenya, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles, South Africa,
     Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Egypt, Tunisia, Morocco, and Togo) and three regional
     bodies (COMESA, EAC, and SADC).


     Several countries stepped up enforcement and implementation of the competition law.
     Authorities noted progress on combating anticompetitive practices. Kenya handled two
     landmark cases, one involving an uncompetitive agreement between two supermarkets and one
     covering issues of vertical restraint between a dominant mobile telecommunications operator
     and its money transfer agents. Zimbabwe’s commission ordered a medical aid society to cease
     its refusal to deal with other private dialysis centers. The commission also took out a cartel in
     cotton production, encouraging cotton merchants to compete and pay higher producer prices to
     farmers. Authorities highlighted their role in reviewing mergers. Botswana’s authority rejected two
     merger transactions in the security sector that could have caused competition issues in the market.
     Kenya’s competition authority has handled over 170 merger cases in the last two years using a
     fast-track procedure that allowed them to focus on mergers that would be more likely to generate
     anticompetitive effects. In South Africa, a merger between Walmart Stores Inc. and Massmart
     Holdings Ltd. was approved with conditions, although unions challenged the decision. According
     to the competition authorities’ analyses, the merger did not raise competition concerns per se, but
     rules on public interest concerns were implemented employing a technical approach.

B. Toward a More Effective Competition Policy Framework



Other countries took steps to support the adoption and implementation of a competition
law. A draft competition law has been prepared in the Republic of the Congo and is awaiting
consideration by the Council of Ministers. Although Uganda does not yet have a competition
authority, a draft competition policy and bill have been developed. The East African Community
Competition Act, 2006, is in force after its gazettal in 2014, and the EAC’s competition body is
expected to start functioning in 2016.


Awareness-raising campaigns on the importance of competition and collaboration with
government institutions were highlighted by the responding authorities. These campaigns
focused on government officials, consumers, or the private sector. Several competition authorities
signed an MoU with other government institutions, paving the way for advocacy initiatives to
enhance competition in sectors of common interest and for collaboration in enforcement. This
achievement was reported by authorities in Botswana, Malawi, Mauritius, Namibia, Seychelles,
and Tunisia, in sectors such as telecommunications, banking, civil aviation, and nonbanking
financial sectors.


Several countries reviewed and amended
their competition law to empower Figure B-11

the tools authorities can use to combat
anticompetitive practices.


Although competition authorities face a wide range of challenges, survey results pointed to a few
recurrent themes (Figures B-12 and B-13). Human capacity constraints figured as a key issue with
regard to the training of officials. More than half of the countries cited challenges resulting from
a limited culture of competition and lack of awareness of the benefits of promoting competition
and combating anticompetitive practices. Most countries identified budget constraints as a
key challenge in competition enforcement and advocacy. Lack of political will and limitation by
government policies were also observed as challenges in these countries. Lack of competition
curricula in academic institutions also came up as a challenge in Egypt.

C. Boosting Competition in Key
   Sectors in Africa

S   ome sectors are particularly important for ensuring the competitiveness and growth of
    African economies, and for boosting the welfare of less well-off households. This is the
case for cement, given its importance for the construction of infrastructure and housing; for
fertilizers, which affect agricultural productivity; and for transport and telecommunications, which
affect connectivity within countries and with the global economy. Such products and services are
necessary inputs for businesses and small producers. Their prices, availability, and quality have a
direct effect on the competitiveness of African producers in international markets and the extent
to which households can harness the benefits of more open markets. These sectors also generate
spillover effects across the economy.


This section of the report provides a focused analysis of cement, fertilizer, and telecommunications
markets, along with a brief overview of competition issues in transport, retail, energy, and
tourism. These sectors were selected based on their relevance for African economies and their
demonstrated potential for displaying competition issues. The selection of the three core sectors,
road freight, and air transport takes into account the results of the ACF Needs Assessment 2014
and previous activities of authorities in these sectors. In addition, and also based on feedback
from ACF members, areas that competition authorities perceive as problematic for competition
in energy, retail, and tourism are outlined, as these are areas where competition authorities
have recently started to become active. Market outcomes in energy and retail are key drivers
of household consumption and welfare, while retail and tourism are important sources of jobs.
Energy is an important input for large and small enterprises alike.


This section aims to assess the market dynamics and government interventions that pose a risk
to competition in key sectors in Africa, and to estimate the impact of tackling these risks. The
analysis here follows an application of the WBG's Markets and Competition Policy Assessment
Tool (MCPAT). The MCPAT provides practical guidance and an adaptable framework that policy
makers can apply to any sector to assess “red flags” for competition and identify potential
mitigating actions against these “red flags.” Following this framework, this section seeks to identify
key segments and relevant markets of the supply chain in the report’s focus sectors, understand
the competition dynamics created by market features, identify regulatory and policy barriers to
competition, and evaluate the likelihood of specific anticompetitive behavior in these sectors. This
report considers that government interventions and regulatory barriers to competition can take
several forms, including legal provisions that: (i) alter entry conditions in a market, impede consumer
choice and hence reinforce dominance; (ii) limit businesses’ strategy options; increase the costs
of competing in the market, or are conducive to collusive outcomes; or (iii) create discriminatory
conditions among players, distort the level playing field, and protect vested interests. The report
also seeks to collect evidence on the costs of a lack of competition and the potential benefits of
promoting competition in these sectors.

     The sector assessment reveals some key commonalities between sectors and highlights where
     knowledge of competition issues in one sector can be leveraged across sectors with similar
     characteristics. For example, the interaction of high economies of scale and relatively low market
     demand in Africa clearly has an impact on the degree of concentration across cement, fertilizer,
     and telecommunications sectors. All three sectors are characterized by the presence of a few
     large panregional players that engage in significant multimarket contact. And competition in
     all three sectors is shaped by access to scarce resources and the degree of vertical integration.
     Understanding these common factors can help understand the risks and efficiencies associated
     with certain market structures, and can provide for synergies in reform and advocacy efforts across
     sectors. Many of the arguments required to advocate for competitive award and antihoarding
     measures for spectrum, for example, could equally be applied to the potassium or limestone
     resources required for fertilizer and cement production, respectively. Having said this, it is equally
     important to understand what the unique characteristics of each sector (and each segment of each
     subsector) mean for competition.


     In telecommunications, for example, network effects give rise to specific anticompetitive incentives
     for firms. In the fertilizer sector, competitive dynamics are shaped by whether different fertilizers
     are viewed as substitutes for each other, which in turn relies on the level of education of end users
     and specifications in national regulations. In the cement sector, market outcomes are shaped by
     the clustering of firms around limestone reserves and by import restrictions. Fertilizer imports are
     even more important given the high global concentration in fertilizer production.

     1. Cement: A key input for infrastructure and housing


     Cement is a vital input in the construction industry and is crucial in fulfilling demand for public
     infrastructure and housing in Africa. Stronger competition in this market and elimination of
     constraints to entry will not only reduce costs for governments, businesses, and families, but also
     encourage investment in the cement sector. Nonetheless, given cement’s manufacturing process,
     the characteristics of the product, and the size of demand in Africa, the industry shows features
     that are conducive to high barriers to entry and potential anticompetitive practices.


     The world’s cement production industry has indeed been subject to a number of cartel cases, as
     well as other forms of anticompetitive conduct (Harrington et al. 2015). Internationally, cement
     producers are known to follow set product standards and specifications utilizing similar pricing
     structures (Zeidan and Resende 2009; Blum 2007; Röller and Steen 2006), and this can facilitate
     collusion. Two cement cartels have been sanctioned in Africa. One of these cases involved price
     fixing among nine producers in Egypt. The other, uncovered in South Africa in 2009, was a cartel
     between four major producers within the SACU.

     A. Key elements of the cement supply chain and product market definitions
     The structure of the cement supply chain influences the competition conditions in the market for
     the final product. The cement value chain can be divided into a few key steps before distribution:
     limestone production, production or import of clinker, and production or import of ordinary and
     blended cements (Figure C1-1). Given demand and supply factors, two distinct markets can be
     delineated here: (i) supply of clinker, and (ii) supply of ordinary and blended cements.50


     The vast majority of cement types used today are Portland Cements or blends of Portland
     Cement. Ordinary Portland Cement (OPC) is the basic form of cement,51 and it the most commonly
     used cement in construction. There are also different varieties of Portland Cement blends, such as
     a white variety and the less common Portland Pozzolana Cement (PPC) variety.52 These cements
     are typically considered to be substitutable and therefore belong to the same market, although
     they have slightly different characteristics. Blended products can be made to differ in strength,
     which has been used in some countries as a point of product differentiation.


     In countries that lack limestone deposits or have an imbalance between domestic production
     and demand, clinker and cement importers play an important role. They include producers who
     import clinker for grinding, construction companies that import cement for use in their own projects,
     and independent commercial importers. Imports have the potential to set a ceiling for the pricing
     power of local producers. The ability of imports to compete with domestically produced cement
     depends on a number of factors, including the level of import duties.
      	 The cement distribution market will not be covered in this report, in part because previous antitrust cases and market inquiries from
     50

        various countries have tended to identify competition issues occurring most frequently in the production of cement. See, for example,
        Competition and Markets Authority, United Kingdom,“Aggregates, cement and ready-mix concrete market investigation” at https://
        www.gov.uk/cma-cases/aggregates-cement-and-ready-mix-concrete-market-investigation. In addition, the distribution segment is likely
        to lend itself to a more case-by-case approach according to the characteristics of the local market, rather than a regional approach.

* This includes producing different blends of cement by grinding clinker with slag or fly ash (extenders) to produce cements of different strengths. Blended cements can
  either be prepared at a cement plant for sale as a finished blended cement product, or by doing the blending within a concrete mix on a construction site. In some cases
  firms or construction projects produce their own project specific blends.

B. 	How are cement supply chains organized in Africa? Three key market
    scenarios
Cement supply chains in Africa can be broadly captured by three market scenarios, depending
on the availability of limestone resources and clinker grinding capacity, and the level of
integration along these activities (Figure C1-2). Scenario 1 (a market with exploited limestone
deposits) typically occurs in countries with natural limestone reserves and is the most common
market scenario in Africa. In these markets, there are two categories of production plant. Those in
the first category have limestone-processing capabilities to produce their own clinker and carry out
grinding. Such plants are usually vertically integrated into limestone mining and are located near
limestone quarries.53 The second category of production plant includes purely grinding units. They
source clinker from external suppliers and simply undertake clinker grinding at their own facilities.54
Scenario 2 (a market without exploited limestone deposits or clinker production capacity, but with
capacity to grind clinker to cement) has only the second type of plant, which relies on imported
clinker. This setup typically occurs in larger cement-consuming countries without limestone.
Scenario 3 (a market with no production capacity), where all cement is imported, occurs in smaller
countries with relatively low cement demand.




 	 A common feature of such cement markets is the utilization of a hub-and-spoke model in which large integrated plants near limestone
53

   quarries supply clinker to smaller grinding units that belong to the same supplier, nearer to the output market.
 	
54
     Suppliers of clinker can either be firms that are dedicated to the marketing of clinker or cement producers with excess clinkering capacity
     who then sell clinker as a raw material.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



C. Industry characteristics that shape competition dynamics in African markets
Characteristics of segments along the value chain shape how cement markets function. Relatively
small market size and high transportation costs have an impact on market concentration. Reliance
on imports makes domestic markets dependent on competition dynamics in exporting countries,
and import policies play a more important role in the market. The degree of vertical integration and
access to limestone affects the level of competition in the cement market and on the incentives to
engage in potential foreclosure practices. Finally, the fact that government holds stakes in firms in
the sector could be perceived a source of additional risk for competitors.

Factor 1: Small market size combined with high economies of scale means that markets cannot
support a large number of players

The production and import of cement display significant economies of scale, high capital intensity,
and relatively small demand in many African markets. Median consumption of cement across 48
African countries in 2014 was 0.97 million tons per year. The mean was 4.08 million tons per year.
This compares to the minimum efficient cement production plant size of approximately 1 million
to 2.5 million tons per year (Mbongwe et al. 2014), meaning that, even taking the mean level of
consumption, the maximum number of players that could efficiently be supported is four. This is
reflected in the typical size of cement plants in Africa. The median plant capacity across 49 African
countries was 0.6 million tons per year, while the mean was 1.06 million tons per year.55 Given the
small national markets, it will be attractive for firms to target broader geographical markets to
achieve economies of scale.

Factor 2: Markets are relatively concentrated, and a group of panregional firms have an
important presence, but entry has been observed

Market characteristics help explain the structure of the regional cement production market.
Plants are clustered around limestone resources and coastal areas (Figure C1-4). Moreover, plants
with relatively higher capacity are owned by a small group of firms, which are present across the
region (Figure C1-5).


Around 54 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s cement capacity is accounted for by plants owned
by nine panregional firms.56 This figure is around 49 percent for Africa as a whole. These nine
major firms stand out in Africa, with an Africa-wide average capacity per firm of 18.9 mta. The
remainder of Africa’s capacity is generally made up of a large number of smaller suppliers, each
with an Africa-wide average capacity of less than 3 mta.57 North Africa has a significant presence
of LafargeHolcim plants in Algeria and Egypt, while Dangote’s Obajana plant stands out in West
Africa. Southeastern Africa appears more balanced, although PPC and LafargeHolcim seem to be
most prevalent. These maps capture only production and not competitive pressure from imports,
which in some countries can be significant. However, given the high transport costs involved in
trading cement and the import restrictions imposed on cement in a number of countries, the

 	
55
     It is likely that market support for a greater number of players will be even lower at the more local level of the geographical market.
 	
56
     This includes minority interests. The firms are LafargeHolcim, Dangote, PPC, Afrisam, Heidelberg, WACEM, CIMAT, ARM, and Italcementi.
 	
57
     Where two players hold a stake in a certain plant, the capacity of that plant is included in the average for both players.

                market structure of production is a crucial determinant of the level of competition in the region.
                Furthermore, given the prevalence of intraregional cement trade, competition issues in exporting
                countries can be relevant for importing countries.


                       In at least 18 countries in Africa, a single firm holds over half the market
                                    for the supply of cement (import or production).

                In a large proportion of African countries, one supplier holds more than half the cement market.
                Looking at the supply of cement in terms of both production and import (Market 2 in Figure
                C1-1), at least 18 African countries have one supplier holding more than 50 percent of the market
                (Figure C1-6).


                On the other hand, at least 21 markets have witnessed entry over the last three years. This
                pattern may overstate the competitive impact in the market, however. On closer inspection, it is
                clear that the firms entering markets tend to be among the largest players in the region. In at least
                15 of the 21 countries in which there was entry, one or more of the new entrants was one of the nine
                major regional players. Dangote, for example, was a new entrant in 12 of those countries. Figure
                C1-4 highlights clinker and cement plants that have entered the market since 2011, which brings
                to light the success of Dangote in entering new markets.


                     At least 21 countries in Africa have seen entry into the market for the supply
                           of cement in the last three years, primarily from panregional firms.

Factor 3: Significant intraregional trade means that competition issues can be exported
throughout the region

Because cement supply is dependent on imports in many countries, prices are linked to
competition conditions in exporter countries and import policies in importing countries. Imported
clinker and cement are critical components of supply in Africa. Over 60 percent of countries (28
countries) import more than 50 percent of their cement consumption (Figure C1-8), considering

Factor 4: Multimarket contact between suppliers is common

The major regional cement suppliers tend to be present across multiple African countries,
leading to multimarket contact among key cement producers in Africa. Figure C1-13 displays the
multimarket contact between Africa’s nine largest cement producers. These firms meet not only
in multiple markets in Africa but also internationally. This multimarket contact includes contact
between the firms that were sanctioned as part of the SACU cement cartel discovered in South
Africa involving Lafarge, PPC, Afrisam, and Natal Portland Cement. Two or more of these cement
firms are present in eight countries (Figure C1-14).

Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa




                                        There is multimarket contact among major cement producers in the region,
                                       including between firms that have been sanctioned in the only cement cartel
                                               that has been detected and sanctioned in Sub-Saharan Africa.


                                Factor 5: Excess capacity is relatively common in cement-producing countries

                                Of the 41 African countries for which cement production capacity is available, 29 countries were
                                operating at less than 75 percent of their capacity in 2014. The existence of excess capacity
                                (Figure C1-15) can be used as an entry deterrence mechanism. It lends credibility to threats of
                                punishment for deviations from cartel agreements by allowing firms to engage in predatory
                                behavior or price wars (Dixit 1979; Davidson and Deneckere 1990) and can therefore increase the
                                stability of cartels. Excess capacity is also common globally, with 66 percent of countries outside
                                Africa operating at less than 75 percent of their capacity.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Factor 6: Vertical integration is common in African markets

Vertical integration along the cement supply chain is common, both in Africa and globally.
Vertical integration is not a risk to competition per se and can in fact hold a number of efficiencies,
for example:
   •	 It can encourage investment in distribution networks by cement producers/importers by
       solving the free-rider problem.

     •	 It can encourage investment in clinker production capacity that is specific to a particular
        limestone quarry by solving the hold-up problem.

     •	 It can prevent double marginalization between two monopolistic segments, such as
        limestone production and clinker production.


It is relatively uncommon for firms to establish a cement grinding plant without being integrated
upstream—if not in the same country, then at least in another country from which the cost of
importing clinker would not be prohibitively high. In this sense, vertical integration may pose
a barrier to entry if a potential entrant in cement production could not also access limestone
reserves simultaneously. This would be mitigated by ensuring that regulations are set to allow for
contestability along the value chain.


This degree of vertical integration would only pose a potential risk of exclusionary behavior
if there were a dominant, vertically integrated supplier of clinker upstream who might have
an incentive to foreclose downstream non-vertically-integrated cement grinders. Table C1-1
presents a few examples of countries with vertically integrated players that hold significant market
share upstream.58 The risks associated with vertical integration in these countries depend on the
degree to which cement grinders can import clinker, which relies not only on the location of the
plants but also on government import regulations (Table C1-2).

Examples of countries with potentially dominant vertically integrated clinker producer

 Rwanda
                            now majority owned by PPC—is integrated into limestone production in Rwanda.
                            There are at least three active producers in Mozambique, but only the dominant firm—Intercement, which has
 Mozambique
                            a 70 percent share of the cement market—is integrated into limestone production.
                            Of Botswana’s three cement producers,only Matsiloje Portland Cement has access to the country’s limited
                            limestone from the Matsiloje Quarry. Other manufacturers source their clinker from neighboring countries.
 Botswana
                            PPC is vertically integrated into clinker across the border in South Africa, making Botsino the only producer
                            without an integrated source of lime.

 	 While not a key focus of this report, other forms of vertical restraint with regard to other key inputs could also be a consideration in
58

   assessing competition in the sector. In the case of Botswana, for example, fly ash (an input for blended cements) from the Morupule Coal
   Mine is provided to PPC on an exclusive contractual basis, which has been reported to have led to difficulties in sourcing for other cement
   players, potentially putting them at a competitive disadvantage. Botswana Power Corporation Presentation, January 2012.

     D. Government interventions that may act as obstacles to competition
     Competition dynamics along the supply chain are affected by regulations and government
     interventions that might restrict competition.59 In Africa, cement markets display rules that
     reinforce dominance or limit entry, that may be conducive to collusive outcomes, or that facilitate
     discrimination against certain players. For instance, certain countries grant temporary or geographic
     exclusivity over limestone resources—which are relevant for 69 percent of the countries with these
     types of resources. Import restrictions may in some cases act as an absolute ban on entry and are
     present in 45 percent of the 22 countries and regional bodies in the sample. Product standards that
     are more restrictive than necessary to maintain quality and direct price controls are also prevalent;
     in some circumstances, these characteristics can facilitate collusive outcomes. Lack of standard
     criteria for or discretionary award of licenses for exploration, production, and import have also
     been a concern in countries within the region. Rules that restrict competition in the cement sector
     can be grouped in three categories (Figure C1-17). These rules are more likely to be present in
     certain segments of the supply chain.60

                  For the purposes of the figure, wholesale functions are assumed to be integrated with import, and similar issues will therefore apply.

      Monopoly         Temporary         Nigeria. Dangote holds the Mining Lease Agreement (MLA) for the limestone quarry feeding Sub-

      absolute         geographic        for limestone resources. Together, these represent a total of 569 million tons of limestone and 119
      ban on           exclusivity       million tons of additive materials in the area, which is proposed to last for more than 90 years. This is
      entry            over              longer than the cement plant’s expected life of 50 years and would indicate that there may be some
                       limestone         room to either award a license to more than one firm in the area or to retender the lease agreement
                       resources         and licenses in future (Obajana Cement 2005). Under national regulations, however, the MLA has a
                                         duration of 25 years and is renewable for further periods of 20 years provided that the holder has
                                         complied with minimum work commitments and that other legal and regulatory requirements have
                                         been met (GEUS 2011; KPMG 2013).It is generally acknowledged that the high-capacity limestone with
                                         which Dangote has been awarded in Nigeria has helped the firm establish new grinding and import
                                         facilities across the region.

                                         Botswana. Only one firm, Matsiloje Quarry, has been granted the right to access Botswana’s domestic
                                         lime quarry.
                                         Kenya. An exclusive mining agreement was signed between a potential entrant and a county council,
                                         granting the entrant exclusive mining rights in the Greater Pokot region for a 99-year period and
                                         permission to extract limestone in all established limestone areas as well as those that may be identified
                                         in future. The competition authority provided an advisory opinion that the exclusivity period was too
                                         long and would foreclose the exploitation of limestone deposits by other investors. The authority
                                         recommended that any exclusive mining agreement be issued for a shorter period of approximately
                                         25 years but remain open for renewal in line with international best practice. In addition, since the
                                         limestone deposits were sufficient to cater for a cement plant with a capacity of 1 million tons for over
                                         550 years, the authority advised that the area would likely accommodate more cement plants, which
                                         would ensure greater royalty fees for the council over time.
      Relative         Lack of           The majority of competition authorities responding to the WBG-ACF survey stated that they were

      entry and        provisions to     however:
      expansion        discourage
      of activities    hoarding          •	 In Egypt, there are fixed fees associated with mining agreements which act to discourage hoarding.
                                         •	 In South Africa, the 2004 Mining Act contains “use-it-or-lose-it” provisions that require license
                                            holders to develop resources in a timely manner. It was the exercise of these provisions that allowed
                                            the new entrant, Sephaku Cement, to acquire Anglo American’s limestone reserves.
                       Product           •	 Liberia. All imported cement must meet the 42.5 grade specification (Ministry of Commerce and
                       standards            Industry of Liberia 2013). Dangote is now the sole importer of cement following its entry in 2013,

                       than                 limits the use of widely produced 32.5 grade cement (to plastering only) and imposes 42.5 grade
                       necessary            cement as the new standard for general purpose use (including block making). The SON has
                       to maintain          cited safety reasons for the restriction, despite the fact that 32.5 grade cement is commonly used

                                            Unicem—have filed a suit against SON challenging the order. Dangote, the main producer of 42.5

     Category         Rule         Examples from Africa
                                   •	 Ghana. In 2015, the Ghana Cement Manufacturers Association (consisting of Heidelberg and
                                      WACEM) called for the imposition of antidumping duties on imported cement.64
                                   •	 South Africa. Antidumping duties, ranging from 14 to 77 percent, are imposed on cement made in
                                      or imported from Pakistan. The duties will last for a period of five years.65
                                   •	 Namibia. Ohorongo was granted infant industry protection (IIP) in 2012, following reports that its
                                      products were being undercut by imports from Brazil, China, and South Africa. The IIP status will
                                      last for eight years from 2012. It enabled the government to levy an import duty of 60 percent on
                                      imported cement until 2014, decreasing annually to 12 percent in 2018.66
                                   •	 Tanzania. Since 2008, the government has allowed the importation of cement from outside the EAC
                                      by removing suspended duty on imported cement. Amid lobbying from manufacturers to reinstate
                                      the duty, a study conducted by the Fair Competition Commission of Tanzania found that this removal
                                      led retail prices to drop by 26 percent over the following year. The report recommended that the
                                      government resist the manufactures’ request and initiate moves at the EAC level to completely
                                      abolish tariffs on imported cement as the only economically viable means to lower prices in the
                                      cement market.
                                   •	 EAC. EAC countries agreed to set a high Common External Tariff (CET) to allow local cement
                                      manufacturers to become internationally competitive. Under the sensitive list of products covered
                                      by the EAC Customs Union Protocol, cement imports into the EAC were to face a 55 percent tariff
                                      that would be reduced by 5 percent per year from 2005 until it reached its target rate of 35 percent.
                                      In March 2015, however, the duty on cement imported into East Africa was lowered from its target
                                      rate of 35 percent to 25 percent.67

                                      shareholder. In 2014, for example, SONOCC threatened to stop the flow of product to Brazzaville
                                      after the government proposed a decrease in the cement price.71

                                   •	 Tunisia. Grey cement is excluded from freedom of pricing laws, and its prices are subject to an
                                      administrative pre-authentication system in both the production and distribution phases. Lime
                                      prices, meanwhile, are subject to an administrative pre-authentication system only on in the
                                      production phase (not distribution). There has been a continuous annual increase (of between 2.5
                                      and 7 percent) in these prices since the second round of privatization in the industry in 1998. The
                                      government has stated that it would use its control of 4.5 million tons of annual capacity to control
                                      prices following cuts to the subsidies it had been granting cement firms as recently as 2014.

                   An official and legal cement cartel operated in the country from the 1940s until its
                   disbandment in 1996. Subsequently, the firms agreed that each firm’s market share
                   should be proportional to their production capacities.
                   There was also a strong regional dimension to this cartel. Part of the collusion was an
                   agreement that PPC would not compete with Lafarge in KwaZulu-Natal in exchange
                   for Lafarge not competing with PPC in Botswana. Moreover, the cartel had agreed that
                   PPC would supply the Botswana cement market, while Afrisam would supply Namibia.

                   and Afrisam settled with the CCSA and agreed to pay a penalty of 6 percent and 3 percent
                   respectively of their annual turnover in cement sales in the SACU region in 2010. The
                   CCSA has respectively referred the case against NPC to the Competition Tribunal for
                   prosecution.
                   Prices and margins have declined steadily since the cartel’s breakup. Using price data
                   from cement producers, Govinda et al. (2014) estimate that the price difference between
                   the cartel and noncartel periods, controlling for cost drivers, was 7.5–9.7 percent. They
                   estimate the total savings to South African customers due to the breakup—assuming
                   an overcharge of 9.7 percent—to be in the range of R 1.1–R 1.4 billion a year ($79–100
                   million). Apart from the financial benefits, firms have been penetrating regions where
                   they were previously inactive. For example, before intervention, the Western Cape was
                   solely allocated to PPC, but Afrisam has since entered that market. The Northern Cape
                   was split 75 percent and 25 percent between Afrisam and PPC during the cartel years,
                   but Lafarge has since taken market share from them.72
                   A Fair Competition Commission (FCC) study of the cement market established that                 - Involvement of major
                   prices were considerably higher in regions close to cement processing plants than                 market players: Lafarge,
                   in shared markets. A survey conducted in 2010 showed that, while cement plans in                  Afrisam, Heidelberg
                   the two regions were an average of 600 km away from the Dar as Salaam market,                   - Some preliminary
                   retail cement prices were 7.6 percent and 3.4 percent higher in their local market than           evidence of regional
                   in Dar as Salaam price, despite the transportation costs involved.73 In other markets             market division
                   where all three locally manufactured brands were available, retail prices were the same.
                   This observation suggested that there could be a price-fixing arrangement between
                   manufacturers through tacit agreements. Manufacturers were found to record
  Tanzania         consistently higher margins than dealers.
                   Based on the study’s findings, the FCC recommended that, among other actions related
                   to the duty on imported cement, the government could:
                   -	Open cement supply for its large projects to international tendering to intensify
                     competition in the cement market
                   -	Advocate and promote new investments in cement manufacturing and importation
                     businesses through the investment promotion agency
                   -	Increase efforts to strengthen the railway transportation network to make cement
                     affordable in distant locations distant from the production source.74
                   In 2008, the Egyptian Competition Authority (ECA) uncovered a price-fixing cartel               - Involvement of major
                   among nine cement producers, which had been in place from 2003 until at least 2006.               players: Lafarge
                   The ECA Board took a per se approach and based its decision on evidence from
                   witness statements, price-cost correlations (price increase and cost decrease), stable
                   local market shares, and volatile exports market share. The District Court fined each of
                   the firms, including the state-owned National Cement Company (OECD 2013), EGP20
  Egypt            million ($2.5 million) in total.75
                   ECA’s Market Monitor Department subsequently conducted two comparative studies
                   on the cement sector to appraise whether its enforcement actions had affected prices.
                   These studies, using structural indicators and assessing market behavior, concluded that
                   market concentration had been reduced in terms of both sales volume and value. This
                   was attributed to both the court sentence against the cartelists and the issuance of new
                   licenses for new cement producers.

      In the last three years, at least 16 investigations into anticompetitive behavior
       in the cement industry have been opened in nine countries across the region.



     F. 	 A summary of potential competition issues for monitoring in the cement
          supply chain
     The interaction of industry characteristics, the degree of vertical integration, and the regulatory
     restrictions that apply to the cement supply chain lead to different dynamics in markets. Based
     on the investigations conducted on the ground by competition authorities, two key types of
     anticompetitive practices stand out for their relatively high potential of arising in the cement
     supply chain:77 (i) collusive horizontal agreements between rivals, and (ii) input foreclosure where a
     vertically integrated supplier of clinker (either a producer or an importer) refuses to supply inputs
     to downstream rival cement producers. There are several red flags discussed in previous sections
     that can incentivize a particular type of anticompetitive behavior.

     However, there are also factors that could mitigate the risk that these behaviors will occur,
     including setting regulations in a procompetitive way.78 Table C1-4 summarizes the red flags and
     mitigating actions to prevent collusion and market foreclosure.

     Figure C1-19 summarizes the most pertinent issues in the various segments of the cement supply
     chain. These are divided among issues that may require enforcement action from authorities and
     those that could be tackled through advocacy efforts.




      	
     77
          The types of anticompetitive behavior outlined here are not intended to be exhaustive, but instead summarize the most likely and most
          harmful types of behavior that might arise.
      	
     78
          Note that, although it is not explicitly included here, exclusion of cement importers by cement importers that are integrated into import
          facilities could theoretically take place in the case of cement.

  Two key types of anticompetitive practices have the potential to arise in the
   cement supply chain: (i) collusive horizontal agreements between rivals, and
 (ii) input foreclosure where a vertically integrated dominant supplier of clinker
          refuses to supply inputs to downstream rival cement producers.


G. The potential impact of fostering competition in the cement market in Africa
Cement prices in Africa were 183 percent higher, on average, than the world price of cement at
the end of 2014.79 The average price for a 50 kg bag of cement was around $9.57 across countries
for which information was available. South Africa had the lowest prices, at $3.25 per 50 kg bag, in
line with world free-on-board (FOB) prices. The highest prices were seen in South Sudan, at $27
per 50 kg bag. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, a 50 kg bag of cement cost $15 in areas
where it is produced or imported but cost up to $40 per bag in remote areas. Despite Dangote’s
recent, significant entry in West Africa, prices remain relatively high. In Nigeria, for example, prices
have been around $9 per 50 kg bag. However, Dangote was reported to be charging prices as
high as $10.54 in 2015.80 Figure C1-20 highlights the variation in prices across Africa.

African cement consumers could be overpaying by more than $2.5 billion per year due to a
lack of competition (Figure C1-21). The potential savings to cement consumers from removing
price overcharges was calculated across the 45 African countries for which price information was
available, using three benchmarks to proxy the competitive price of cement:

         Estimates find that the upper end of the range of world prices for grey cement is $3.38 per 50 kg bag. See CW Group 2014.

          1.	 Case 1. Assumes that an anticompetitive overcharge of 9.7 percent, equivalent to that found
              in the South Africa cartel case, is removed in every country (except South Africa, where it is
              assumed the overcharge has already been removed).
          2.	 Case 2. Takes the average cement prices across four states in India in 2014–15 ($5.63 per 50 kg
              bag) as a benchmark.84 All prices that are currently above average prices in India are assumed
              to fall to the average price in India. This affects 40 countries where prices are currently higher
              than in India. There is no change for the five countries where prices are currently below the
              average price in India.
          3.	 Case 3. Prices in Africa are assumed to fall to the level of retail prices in South Africa, which
              are the lowest on the continent.


     Even if prices in African countries are only around 10 percent higher than a competitive level,
     this would amount to 1 percent of the infrastructure financing gap that has been identified in
     Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2010, a World Bank report estimated that around $93 billion would need
     to be spent on infrastructure in Sub-Saharan Africa every year over the next decade to close
     the region’s infrastructure gap. It is estimated that the region loses 2 percentage points of GDP
     growth annually as a result of its infrastructure deficit. Of course, cement is a major input in
     infrastructure development. Cement price overcharges due to a lack of competition in the region
     therefore harm the ability of governments and private businesses to invest in the infrastructure
     necessary to boost growth.

     Entry of new players and removal of import restrictions have led to better market outcomes
     for businesses and consumers in Africa. In South Africa, after observing the entry of a new player
     in the cement market for the first time in 80 years in 2014, retail prices fell. The removal of a
     suspended duty on cement imports in Tanzania led to a 26 percent reduction in prices.

     Tackling anticompetitive behavior is critical for better market performance. Because of the SACU
     cartel, consumers in South Africa were being overcharged by almost 10 percent for bulk cement.
     This meant that tackling only this cartel could save $79–100 million per year.



                         African cement consumers could be overpaying by more
                           than $2.5 billion a year due to a lack of competition.

     2. Fertilizer: a key input for agricultural productivity



     F   ertilizer is a key input in all economies with a significant agricultural sector and is critical
         for productivity in the Africa region. Crop productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in
     the world and remains a crucial challenge to the development of large-scale agribusiness and
     to poverty alleviation through food security. Low productivity has been linked to limited use
     of agricultural technology inputs, and fertilizer in particular (Gregory and Bumb 2006). Indeed,
     fertilizer use in Sub-Saharan Africa is the lowest in the world (accounting for 3 percent of global
     fertilizer consumption in 2013, according to statistics produced by the Food and Agriculture
     Organization), although growth in fertilizer demand in Africa is estimated at 3.8 percent per year,
     the highest across all regions globally.

     A. Key elements of the fertilizer supply chain and product market definitions
     Agricultural productivity is dependent on external inputs of three complementary nutrients:
     nitrogen, phosphorus, and potash.85 The three nutrients serve different purposes, and a balance
     of the three is required to maximize production. This renders the three minerals complementary
     products and typically delineates them into three distinct value chains.

     Nitrogen is the most important nutrient, accounting for around 66 percent of demand in Africa.
     Potash has the lowest demand, at around 10 percent of total demand, while phosphorous accounts
     for 23 percent of demand. Unlike nitrogen, which must be applied every year to maintain yield,
     potash and phosphorus typically require less frequent application.

     The production of fertilizers begins with the production of a primary material. This is converted
     to an intermediate product,86 which is in turn converted to useable fertilizers. In the final stages of
     the value chain, these fertilizers can either be marketed as:

     1.	 Single nutrient fertilizers (herein referred to as “straight fertilizers”) designed to deliver one
         of the three nutrients; or
     2.	 Combined products, most commonly NPK fertilizers, which are combinations of the three
         nutrients (“complex fertilizers”). Straight fertilizers are used as an input for complex fertilizers.87

     The import and wholesale of fertilizers are key components of the supply chain. Imports of either
     straight or complex fertilizer typically contribute significantly to the supply of fertilizer, both as a
     blending input and for final application. The next step in the supply chain—wholesale distribution—
     can be carried out either by the importers or producers themselves or by independent wholesalers.
     Wholesalers manage: (i) the inland transportation of fertilizers from central distribution points to
     regional distribution points; and (ii) storage, from where it is sold either directly to large-scale
     farms and cooperatives or to retailers (agrodealers).88


      	 Magnesium, calcium, and sulphate are also used as secondary nutrients in fertilizers, but they are relatively peripheral markets and are
     85

        not included in this analysis.
      	
     86
          In the case of nitrogen and phosphorous; potash is used in its raw form.
      	
     87
          A summary of the characteristics of each nutrient’s uses and the various value chain components mentioned above is provided in Annex 2.
      	
     88
          Retail distribution of fertilizers is also relevant for determining competitive conditions but is not covered in this analysis.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Given their distinct uses, different nutrients will be treated as separate markets here. It will be
assumed that the competitive pressure they exert on each other is limited.89 Thus, this section
delineates the markets for each nutrient along the supply chain (Figure C2-1). The emphasis of
this section will be on Markets 1-5. The market for wholesale distribution (Market 6) will also be
covered. However, since it generally has lower barriers to entry and is often integrated with the
import function, it will not be taken as an explicit focus.

                                                                  MARKET 5. In some cases, supply of nal use straight fertilizers and complex fertilizers

                                                             In most regions, complex fertilizers have now largely replaced the need for straight fertilizer for nal
                                                             application. They provide a balance of nutrients, and are easier and cheaper to distribute and apply.
                                                             However, in many countries in Africa, it is still relatively common for straight fertilizers to be applied
                                                            directly. This may be due to their lower cost, the low cost of labor, as well as poor agronomic practices


Note: Wholesale distribution and retail distribution not depicted in the graph for simplification purposes. “CAN” stands for calcium ammonium nitrate.




A precise definition of relevant markets needs to be determined on a case-by-case basis, as
this would be important for competition enforcement or market inquiries. This depends on
characteristics that determine whether straight and complex fertilizers are substitutes for one
another, whether different minerals are considered substitutes, or whether different formulations
of complex fertilizer can be considered substitutes. Definition of precise relevant markets would
need to take into account the final use of the fertilizer, the agro-climactic conditions, the crop, and
prevailing agricultural practices.

The interlinkages between fertilizer types also need to be taken into account. For example,
straight fertilizers act as both an input to and a competitor to complex fertilizers. Moreover, there
can be interlinkages between types of nutrients. For example, straight phosphate (P) fertilizers,
di-ammonium phosphate (DAP), and monoammonium phosphate (MAP) all require ammonia as
an input.




 	 For example, Al Rawashdeh et al. (2016) find that the short- and long-run cross-elasticity between potash and phosphates is close to 0
89

   (about 0.005). In some contexts, largely due to poor agronomic practices, the various nutrients may in practice be substituted for one
   another. However, we assume that this effect is limited.

                   B.	 How are fertilizer supply chains organized in Africa? Three key market
                       scenarios
                   Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), and Potassium (K) supply chains in Africa can be broadly captured
                   by three market scenarios, depending on the production capacity of input and final fertilizer
                   (Figure C2-2). In general, Scenario 1 (a market with production of primary materials) occurs in larger
                   countries with natural resources that have been harnessed for fertilizer production. Scenario 2 (a
                   market without production of primary materials, but with capacity to produce complex fertilizers)
                   occurs in larger fertilizer-consuming countries without natural resources. Scenario 3 (market with
                   no production capacity) occurs in smaller countries with relatively low fertilizer demand.

                   Most countries have their own production plants, but only some of them produce primary
                   materials (Table C2-1). Few countries lack any type of production capacity, and some countries
                   (such as the Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Kenya, and Mozambique) are in the process
                   of building domestic plants.



                                    Only 28 percent of African countries have capacity to produce
                                                       their own basic fertilizer.

                       C. Industry characteristics that shape competition dynamics in African markets
                       As a result of industry supply characteristics, production up to the point of straight fertilizer
                       production is typically conducted at large-scale factories that are strategically located for access
                       to raw materials. Production of nitrogen fertilizer in Africa is therefore concentrated in regions
                       with relatively low natural gas prices. Reserves of phosphate rock used to manufacture phosphorus
                       fertilizer are located primarily in Morocco and the Western Sahara (75 percent).90 Annex 2 presents
                       supply and demand characteristics along the supply chain of fertilizer. The combination of various
                       characteristics defines six main factors that influence competition dynamics in African markets.

                        Factor 1: Fertilizer is a globally traded commodity, with final prices of fertilizer in Africa driven
                        largely by international fertilizer prices
                       Only 28 percent of African countries have the capacity to produce their own basic fertilizer,91
                       which makes fertilizer markets dependent on imports. Production of straight fertilizers is
                       concentrated in a few countries in Sub-Saharan Africa, and there is no production of potash
                       fertilizers, so imports play a crucial role in shaping fertilizer supply market outcomes in Africa.92
                       This includes both the supply of final products and provision of inputs for blending. On average,
                       60 percent of Sub-Saharan Africa’s consumption of N and P is imported, while 100 percent of K
                       consumption is imported (Figure C2-3).

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Given the concentrated structure of the global market and the relatively small size of import
markets in Africa, in most cases importers are price-takers in the global market. Importers
operate by negotiating contracts with large global manufacturers and traders (except where the
importer is integrated with a global supplier, as in the case of Yara and Omnia). These global
suppliers tend to have control over FOB prices to a large extent. IFDC (2007) find that, for seven
African countries examined, the FOB price of fertilizer constitutes on average 65 percent of the
final retail price. This means that fertilizer retail prices in Africa will depend heavily on competition
in global markets.

Globally, competition in fertilizer markets is considered to be relatively weak, which affects
market outcomes in Africa. In practice, market outcomes in Africa are shaped by global markets,
which are dominated by a small group of large producing countries, particularly for P and K. These
appear to operate as global duopolies of dominant firms, arranged in export cartels, with fringes of
small, high-cost firms. The market for nitrogen-based fertilizer appears relatively less concentrated
and more localized in nature, with China, the United States, India, and Russia controlling most of
the production capacity of urea (IFDC 2015). Box C2-1 outlines competition in global markets.

Competition in the global fertilizer market

 The global potash industry
 The potash industry is dominated by two export marketing groups that act as export cartels: Canpotex and Belarusian
 Potash Company (BPC). The two groups are acknowledged to have used their dominant position to maintain high
 prices by keeping production below competitive levels. Canpotex is the marketing organization for the three largest
 North American potash producers: PotashCorp, Agrium and Mosaic. BPC is a joint venture between the three
 largest Russian and Belarusian potash producers: Uralkali, Silvinit and Belaruskali. Together, Canpotex and BPC
 account for approximately two-thirds of global potash sales (Figure C2-4). Reserves are even more concentrated,
 with Canada and Russia accounting for 80 percent of proven global reserves.

          The global phosphorus industry
          The global phosphorus market is comprised of two major players: the United States export cartel, PhosChem
          (operating with limited antitrust immunity under 1918 Webb-Pomerene) and the Moroccan Office Chérifien des
          Phosphates (OCP), a government-owned monopoly on phosphate mining. The two members of PhosChem,
          PotashCorp and Mosaic,are also members of Canpotex.

          Over three quarters of global reserves of phosphate
          rock are located in Morocco and the Western                                Figure C2-5

          20–25 percent after Urakali’s exit from BPC, although
          they have now started to rise again. Meanwhile,
          Gnutzmann and Spiewanowski (2014) find that the
          potash cartel was able to impose an average price overcharge of 63 percent during 2008-12. Given estimates of
          pass-through of fertilizer prices to food costs, they estimate that this would have led to a 26 percent increase in food
          prices. The potential impact of the resumption of the global potash cartel in 2014 on fertilizer expenditure in Africa
          is estimated in section C2-F. Jenny (2012) estimates that under a competitive scenario, potash prices would reach
          CA$488 per ton by 2020. With the continuing presence of the cartel, however, prices would rise to CA$734 in 2020,
          equivalent to a 50 percent overcharge.

          Hernandez and Torero (2013) evaluate the impact of concentration in production capacity on urea prices in low-
          income countries. Based on the top four concentration ratio results, they find that a 10 percent decrease in the
          concentration of the top four regional producers is associated with an 8.2 percent drop in prices under a conservative
          scenario and an 11.6 percent drop under an optimistic scenario. In Africa, this increase in competition would be
          equivalent to building one nitrogen plant in a competitive regional location with annual production capacity of 0.7
          million metric tons.

          Competition enforcement action against global cartels
          Most antitrust authorities have not been active in removing legal protections for coordinated conduct by producers.
          In the United States, the Federal Trade Commission has not initiated any enforcement action against fertilizer
          producers involving potentially collusive agreements, or denied annual approval for PhosChem. Some authors have
          called for a comprehensive reassessment of the antitrust exemption for export associations such as PhosChem
          and Canpotex under the Webb-Pomerene Act and other provisions that create immunity for fertilizer cartels from
          competition laws (Taylor and Moss 2013). Despite a lack of government antitrust enforcement, there has been

Factor 2: The use of scarce resources in Africa is highly concentrated in a few countries and
among a few players
Production of primary materials is concentrated in relatively few countries and market
players in Africa (Figure C2-6). Like cement, the structure of fertilizer markets depends on
the availability of natural resources. However, the natural resources required for fertilizer are
less prevalent and less heavily exploited than the limestone required for cement production
and are generally confined to a small number of countries. Due to the location and scarcity
of natural resources, production of primary materials is concentrated in a few countries
across the region. Within those countries, control over these resources tends to be relatively
concentrated:

   •	 Phosphate production: Phosphate rock production is concentrated in North Africa, South
      Africa, and to some extent Tanzania and Senegal. All countries with phosphate production
        have a monopoly miner of phosphate rock—with the exception of Egypt, which has two.

   •	 Nitrogen fertilizer production:
        o	 Of the Sub-Saharan African countries that are producing ammonium at present, all
           (South Africa, Zimbabwe, and Nigeria) have monopolies in ammonia production,
           although in Nigeria an additional plant is under construction and there are another
           two firms that have signaled they will enter the market. This is despite the fact that
           ammonium production is generally a contestable market.
        o	 In North Africa, the production of ammonium appears at first sight to be relatively
           less concentrated, although in Algeria all three ammonium-producing companies
           are joint ventures with the state oil and gas producer and, in Egypt, there is a high
           degree of cross-shareholding, with the state and OCI (Egypt’s largest chemical
           producer) holding stakes across a number of producers.
   •	 Potash production: There is no commercial production of potash in Africa at the time of
      writing. The Democratic Republic of Congo and Ethiopia are the only countries in Sub-
      Saharan Africa with commercially viable deposits of potash (Wanzala and Groot 2013). There
      are currently three potash explorations underway in the former and two in the latter.



    Every country in Africa with phosphate rock production is a monopoly at
    the national level except Egypt; all ammonia producers (as part of the N
  fertilizer supply chain) in Sub-Saharan Africa hold monopolies at the national
 level, despite ammonium being generally thought of as a contestable market.


While concentrated markets are not uncommon globally, Sub-Saharan Africa is particularly
striking for the proportion of countries with a monopoly producer. As an example, Figure C2-7
compares the structure of the ammonia market (for plants that are currently operating) in Sub-
Saharan Africa with that in other regions. Not only does Sub-Saharan Africa have relatively few
producing countries, but it is also the only region where all producers hold monopolies.

                   The market for the supply of straight and complex fertilizers (Market 5) is less concentrated
                   than the upstream primary production segment. However, there are still a notable number
                   of markets with high concentration and a lack of firm entry.


                               Of 19 countries examined, 58 percent had a single importer or
                            producer holding more than half the market and 57 percent had not
                            seen entry into the market for fertilizer supply in the last three years.

Factor 3: Small market size combined with high economies of scale and high transport costs
mean that markets tend toward a small number of vertically integrated players
Demand for fertilizer in Africa is the lowest of any region (FAO 2015). As in the case of cement,
the presence of economies of scale in production and import and the limited demand across
Africa imply that fertilizer markets typically do not efficiently support many players. An example
of this is that, in some countries, importers cooperate in buyers’ groups in order to reach large
enough orders to benefit from economies of scale (for example, Ghana and Uganda). In Malawi,
two significant firms that compete in import markets also jointly own a blending factory. Although
such cooperation may be efficient and reduce costs, it could be important to ensure that it does
not generate collusive behavior and that the benefits are passed on to consumers.

Moreover, as a bulky product, the ratio of transport cost to value is low along the fertilizer value
chain, particularly at the upstream end. It tends to be more efficient to process primary materials
and intermediate products in more concentrated locations. This encourages vertical integration.
The level of competition in transport also plays a role.

Factor 4: Multimarket contact between suppliers
The five firms that appear most frequently in Africa meet each other in five African countries on
average. The two firms with the largest presence supply 15 and 16 countries, respectively (Figure
C2-10). Three of these firms have been involved in cartels investigated and detected in South
Africa and Zambia (Figure C2-11).

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Factor 5: State involvement in fertilizer markets is common throughout Africa
In Africa, the state is involved in the fertilizer supply chain through three key channels:

  1.	The state provides fertilizer directly on a commercial basis through ownership of
     production or distribution facilities.
   2.	 The state provides fertilizer directly at subsidized rates through ownership of production,
       import, or distribution facilities.
   3.	 State provides fertilizer indirectly at subsidized rates through allocation of production,
       import, or distribution rights to private sector operators.


Channel 1 is present in North African countries, Zimbabwe, and South Africa. In countries with
fertilizer subsidy schemes, subsidized fertilizer is marketed through either channel 2 or 3.

Unlike the case of cement, state-subsidized marketing channels usually exist in parallel
with commercial supply (Figure C2-12 and Figure C2-13). One notable exception is Ethiopia.
Subsidized supply can distort markets, however, leading to an unlevel playing field and crowding
out the private sector.

private sector.




The potential for market distortions from subsidy schemes depends on the design and
subsequent implementation of the scheme. Fertilizer subsidy schemes can impede competition
and strengthen large or incumbent suppliers’ market positions by acting as a barrier to entry
due to increased uncertainty for new entrants, and through tender conditions that restrict the
participation of some firms or nontransparent tender procedures that favor well-connected firms.
In the former case, there is some evidence that firms face greater guaranteed demand but also
a number of uncertainties (regarding, for example, the outcomes of tendering processes or

              government payments) by engaging in subsidy schemes, and therefore competing suppliers
              tend to raise their margins (Druilhe and Barreiro-Hurlé 2012). In Zambia, subsidized inputs
              were more expensive than the private-sector benchmark in four out of five provinces surveyed
              by the World Bank (2010). In Ghana, Filipski and Taylor (2011) estimate that the subsidy was
              effectively lowered from 50 percent to 30 percent of the price as a result of this effect, and
              subsidy costs for the government were raised by an additional $4.03 million. Another common
              concern over fertilizer subsidies is whether they crowd out the private sector by making it
              difficult for commercial providers to compete with subsidized products (Box C2-2).



 Box C2-2
 Do fertilizer subsidy schemes crowd out commercial supply?

     Following a wave of liberalizations in the 1980s and 1990s, fertilizer subsidy schemes have once again become a
     major pillar of many agricultural development strategies in Africa. Ten African governments spend roughly $1 billion
     annually on input subsidy programs, amounting to 28.6 percent of their public expenditures on agriculture (Jayne and
     Rashid 2013).

     Fertilizer subsidies can crowd in the private sector—and therefore potentially increase competition—by sensitizing
     farmers to the benefits of fertilizer, boosting demand for it, and helping commercial players to raise their profitability
     through economies of scale from importing and distributing a larger volume of fertilizer. On the other hand,fertilizer
     subsidies can crowd out the private sector if the right conditions are not in place.

     Those opposed to fertilizer subsidies believe that subsidy schemes, while intended to meet the needs of remote
     and poor smallholder farmers, undermine the market for private traders more generally and weaken prospects for
     building a vibrant market-oriented fertilizer distribution system. Under this line of reasoning, one alternative would
     be to restructure the fertilizer market fully to remove constraints on the private sector and to ensure adequate
     investment in infrastructure to allow rural and remote communities to be served. Another, less drastic, alternative is
     the implementation of “smart subsidies” or voucher-based systems that rely on the private sector for the supply and
     distribution of fertilizer. These schemes have become increasingly popular in an attempt to promote the development
     of commercial input distribution systems without phasing out subsidies.

     The recent literature on Sub-Saharan Africa generally suggests that fertilizer subsidies have crowded out the
     commercial fertilizer sector, particularly when subsidy schemes have not been adequately targeted at the poor (Xu et
     al. 2009; Ricker-Gilbert et al. 2011). Takeshima and Nkonya (2014) examine how the previous fertilizer subsidy program
     in Nigeria affected the demand for commercial fertilizer, finding that for every 10 kg of fertilizer distributed,demand
     for commercial fertilizer fell by 1.9–3.5 kg. Jayne et al. (2013), meanwhile, show how earlier estimates of crowding out
     may have been seriously underestimated by not taking into account the diversion of program fertilizer by authorities.

     There is some evidence, however, that a subsidy can stimulate fertilizer demand through improved beneficiary
     targeting. Liverpool-Tasie (2013) found evidence of crowding-in of commercial fertilizer demand in Nigeria, the
     success of which appears to be related to the fact that fertilizer vouchers were mainly targeted to areas where private
     commercial markets were relatively weak and to households that were relatively poor.

Factor 6: Vertical integration along the fertilizer supply chain is common in Africa
All countries with blending capacity in Africa have vertically integrated producers or importers.
Vertical integration is not a risk to competition per se and can in fact hold a number of efficiencies
in the fertilizer sector:
     •	 It can encourage investment by fertilizer producers and/or importers in distribution and agro-
        dealer networks by solving the free-rider problem.
     •	 It can encourage investment in straight fertilizer production capacity, which is specific to a
        natural resource production site—such as investment in gas pipelines or phosphoric acid
        plants on the site of phosphate rock mines—by solving the hold-up problem.
     •	 It can prevent double marginalization between two monopolistic segments, such as natural
        resource production and straight fertilizer production.


There are some situations in which vertical integration may affect competitive outcomes. As
in the case of cement, the risk of vertical integration as a potential barrier to entry is limited if a
potential entrant can enter various segments of the vertical chain simultaneously. The degree
of vertical integration would only pose a potential risk of exclusionary behavior if there were a
dominant, vertically integrated supplier of primary materials or straight fertilizers with a possible
incentive to foreclose downstream non-vertically-integrated complex fertilizer producers.

                 D. Government interventions that may act as obstacles to competition
                 Anticompetitive behavior along the supply chain can be facilitated by regulations that restrict
                 competition. Several rules, regulations, and government actions in Africa may be affecting how
                 fertilizer markets along the value chain perform (Figure C2-15). A star indicates where those factors
                 are present in Africa. Other rules are summarized below in Table C2-2.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Fertilizer markets register several rules that limit entry and facilitate dominance across the value
chain. Some countries grant the state a monopoly over natural resources, which may act as an
absolute barrier to entry to other players in fertilizer production. In other cases, there is a lack
of licensing provisions to discourage hoarding of these resources. It is also common to impose
restrictions on the number of licenses granted that go beyond the level necessary to satisfy
standards (for example, in Ethiopia). Similarly, burdensome registration procedures increase the
costs of participation, with long testing periods acting as barriers to entry (as in Ghana). In some
countries, registrations are not one-off but require frequent renewal (for example, in Rwanda
and Uganda). Finally, the absence of a harmonized regional registration framework reduces
intraregional trade (as in the case of ECOWAS) and distortive import tariffs, contrary to the Abuja
Declaration, are present (for example, in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Kenya, and Mozambique).

Rules that facilitate collusion or restrict firms’ choice of strategic variables have been identified,
particularly in production and import. Rules reducing the number of approved fertilizers affect
market dynamics. This is the case for product specifications in national regulations that can restrict
entry of substitutable products (as in ECOWAS).

Finally, rules that discriminate or protect vested interests are present in some countries. A lack
of competitive tendering hinders competition in some countries (such as Burkina Faso, Egypt, and
Mali). Selective treatment of certain firms, either state-owned or private, has also been a concern
(as in Egypt and Tanzania).

E. Anticompetitive behavior detected and sanctioned in Africa
Investigations into anticompetitive behavior in the fertilizer industry have been opened in
Egypt, South Africa, Tunisia, and Zambia in the last two years, according to the WBG-ACF survey.
Only in Zambia were sanctions imposed (Box C2-4). However, another noteworthy case in which
sanctions were imposed were the complaints launched against Sasol, Yara, and Omnia in South
Africa’s fertilizer sector relating to collusion and abuse of dominance (although ultimately only the
collusion case was sanctioned). Both the Zambian and South African cases displayed factors that
may have increased the risk of anticompetitive behavior (Figure C2-16). The South African case is
of particular interest given the integral role played by several industry associations in maintaining
the cartel. A summary of the cases can be found in Box C2-3 and Box C2-4.

     Box C2-3
     Collusion and abuse of dominance in South Africa’s fertilizer markets

      The 2003 complaint
      In 2003, Sasol—South Africa’s former state-owned gas and oil company—was the exclusive producer of ammonia
      in South Africa, which it supplied as an input for the production of ammonium nitrates (ANs) such as limestone
      ammonium nitrate (LAN) and ammonium nitrate solution (ANS), which are used either as straight fertilizers or an
      input to the production of complex fertilizer. The AN fertilizers were produced by three firms: Omnia, AEL, and
      Sasol’s own downstream subsidiary. Sasol and Omnia were integrated further downstream into the production of
      complex fertilizer, while AEL operated under an exclusive contract for supply of AN to Yara (a previous subsidiary
      of AEL) for production of complex fertilizers. Neither AEL nor Omnia supplied significant amounts of AN to
      independent producers of complex fertilizer, leaving those independent producers dependent on either imports or
      urea (an imperfect substitute for ANs) or on Sasol. Sasol, Omnia, and Yara were then also integrated into the retail
      distribution segment of the value chain.

      In November 2003, Nutri-Flo, a small producer and distributor of complex fertilizer, lodged a complaint with the
      CCSA alleging that Sasol, Yara, and Omnia were engaged in collusion by dividing the markets for various fertilizer
      products, including LAN, and by fixing prices of LAN and other fertilizer products in both the market for retail and
      the market for supply of complex fertilizer. Nutri-Flo, as a customer of Sasol, also alleged that Sasol had abused its
      dominance by engaging in excessive pricing with respect to LAN and ANS, and in exclusionary conduct through an
      effective margin squeeze. The case was referred to the Competition Tribunal in 2005.

      The 2007 complaint
      During 2007, the CCSA initiated another complaint, this time against Sasol and Foskor for collusion in the phosphoric
      acid industry. Foskor, the partly state-owned monopoly phosphate miner in South Africa, had entered into an
      agreement with Sasol whereby Sasol agreed to manufacture phosphoric acid exclusively for Foskor. According to
      the investigation, this amounted to collusive conduct, with Sasol effectively agreeing not to compete with Foskor in
      the phosphoric acid market.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa




     In 2009, a settlement agreement was reached between the CCSA and Sasol in which Sasol admitted that it had
     agreed with Yara and Omnia on various pricing formulae for, and discounts applicable to, the products that the
     three firms manufactured and supplied. Having admitted to collusive conduct, the firm agreed to pay a penalty of
     $15.7 million, representing 8 percent of its Sasol Nitro division’s turnover.

     The settlement covered Nutri-Flo’s collusion complaint and the CCSA-initiated investigation against Sasol for
     collusion with Foskor. It did not, however, cover any abuse of dominance issues. In addition to paying a penalty,
     Sasol undertook to cooperate with CCSA in prosecuting the remaining respondents. Sasol provided the CCSA with
     additional evidence on cartel conduct among the respondents.94

     The role of Information exchanges
     One of the factors that the CCSA identified as pointing to the possibility of collusion was that the respondents had
     established and participated in various committees in which detailed information was exchanged on a range of
     nitrogenous fertilizer products.

     Das Nair and Mncube (2014) assess how this information exchange could have allowed the maintenance of
     collusion in certain fertilizer markets. Information exchange in the fertilizer industry occurred through the following
     platforms: the Nitrogen Balance Committee (NBC), the Import Planning Committee (IPC), the Export Club, and an
     industry association, the Fertilizer Society of South Africa (FSSA). The respondents were the main members in each
     of these forums.

     In the NBC, a body established to ensure the security of supply of nitrogen-based fertilizers, individual members
     shared highly disaggregated information containing forecasts (requirements by regions and planned imports) for
     a number of key fertilizer products. The detailed nature of the information exchanged created a high level of
     transparency, allowing each firm to forecast competitors’ market shares for the next year.

     Through the IPC, data around imported fertilizer product volumes were shared. The claimed purpose of the
     committee was to coordinate volumes of imports of various products and to share logistics and minimize supply
     chain costs. The respondents also used information exchanged during these meetings to agree on pricing formulae
     used to calculate the base price for certain fertilizer products.

     Through the Export Club, information on fertilizer sales designated for export markets was shared. The purpose of
     the club was to coordinate bids for the supply/export of products to the Southern African region through traders.
     The combination of sharing competitors’ future projections of local sales from data exchanged in the NBC, import
     data from the IPC, and export data from the Export Club left very little uncertainty about competitors’ future market
     shares. Meanwhile, information on past market shares by region was collated by the FSSA, allowing deviations in
     market shares in each region to be monitored, given that only three players were present in most markets.

      Yara and Omnia objected to the CCSA’s reliance on the additional evidence provided by Sasol on the basis that this evidence was not
      covered by the complaint. This gave rise to a legal battle between the CCSA, and Yara and Omnia in the Tribunal, the Competition
      Appeals Court (CAC), and the Constitutional Court.The CAC foundthe referral against Yara and Omnia invalid since the complainant had
      not intended to complain against the anticompetitive behavior submitted by third parties.

 Box C2-4
 The Zambian fertilizer cartel

     Introduction	
     In 2012, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission (‘the Commission’) of Zambia received a complaint
     in relation to the Farmer Input Support Programme (FISP). Nyiombo and Omnia (‘the Parties’) had been supplying
     fertilizer under the FISP for 10 years. The complainant submitted that the tendering and eventual award of the
     contract by the Zambia Public Procurement Authority (ZPPA) were in contravention of the Competition and Consumer
     Protection Act. In particular, the complainant alleged that the Parties were dividing the market for tendered fertilizer
     under the FISP.

     It was alleged that the Government of Zambia required companies to submit bids for 10 provinces, but that the two
     firms divided the markets in such a manner that, where one party was bidding the other agreed not to bid. It was
     stated that Nyiombo in 2011 was awarded Central, Copperbelt, Luapula, Northern, North Western, and Muchinga
     provinces, while Omnia was awarded Western, Lusaka, Eastern, and Southern provinces. The complainant also alleged
     that Nyiombo worked closely with Omnia and that Nyiombo bought fertilizer and later shared its stocks with Omnia.

     Historically, Nyiombo and Omnia had dominated supplies to the FISP. Vilakazi (2016) points out that this was likely
     due in part to tender bidding requirements that favored incumbents and inhibited an open and competitive process.
     In response, in 2012/13, the permanent secretary of agriculture intervened to remove some restrictive clauses of the
     tender bidding requirements and open up the market to more bidders.95

     Action taken by the Commission
     The Commission conducted dawn raids at the premises of Nyiombo and Omnia and referred to related studies it
     had conducted in the past. Various market developments and trends were observed and taken into account. Omnia’s
     conduct in other countries, including South Africa (Box C2-3), was also taken into consideration.

     Based on the documents seized from the Parties, the Commission established that there was a collusive agreement
     between them. The documentation had demonstrated the agreement between the two firms in pursuing a coordinated
     course of action on the market.

     Current status
     The Parties appealed the matter to the Competition and Consumer Protection Tribunal,and the Tribunal ruled in favor
     of the Parties. The Commission thereafter appealed to the High Court, which also ruled in favor of the Parties. The
     Commission has further appealed the matter to the Supreme Court against the judgement of the High Court, and the
     matter is pending judgement.

     Effects
     According to Vilakazi (2016), there is some evidence that the fine imposed on the two firms in 2013 and the government’s
     moves to open up the tender process to other companies have disrupted the existing arrangement between the
     players. Available information suggests that ETG has been able to grow substantially in Zambia in the past two
     years. Although ETG and other firms have been in the market for some years, the market became more contestable
     following the cartel finding, such that ETG has been able to gain share at the expense of Nyiombo in particular, and
     Omnia to some extent. Savings from ending the cartel would have been around $21 million in 2013.96

F.	 A summary of potential competition issues for monitoring in the fertilizer
    supply chain
The interaction of industry characteristics, the occurrence of vertical integration, and the
regulatory restrictions that apply to the fertilizer supply chain lead to varying market dynamics.
In the fertilizer supply chain, this report has identified the two types of anticompetitive practice
that are mostly likely to arise,97 namely collusive horizontal agreements between rivals and input
foreclosure, where a vertically integrated supplier (for example, of primary materials or straight
fertilizer) refuses to supply inputs to downstream rivals (in straight fertilizer production or complex
fertilizer production). As discussed in previous sections, several red flags can lead to a particular
type of anticompetitive behavior. There are also factors, however, that could mitigate the risk
that these behaviors will occur, including setting regulations in a procompetitive way. These red
flags and potential mitigants are outlined in Table C2-3. Finally, Figure C2-17 summarizes the
most pertinent issues in the various segments of the supply chain. These are divided into issues
that may require enforcement action from authorities and issues that could be tackled through
advocacy efforts.

 Red flags          •	Industry-wide supply-side characteristics that facilitate collusion are most common in primary materials,
                      straight fertilizer, and complex fertilizer production.
                    •	Other country-specific supply-side characteristics that facilitate collusion can be analyzed, including
                      the presence of information-exchange mechanisms such as industry associations, excess capacity,
                      symmetric firm size, frequency of transactions, multimarket contact, or current or historical price
                      controls, which can act as a focal points.
                    •	In a number of countries, supply of straight fertilizer and complex fertilizer through a subsidized
                      government channel makes up a significant part of the market.
                         • Unless awarded in a transparent and competitive way, such contracts and can lead to bid rigging
                           for government contracts.
                    • Where suppliers of straight fertilizer and complex fertilizer face small retailers or agricultural groups
                      such as cooperatives, as their buyers, buyer power to counteract collusive pricing is likely to be low
                      given the relatively small order size, the relatively disperse structure of the buyers, and the limited
                      scope for backward integration into imports due to a lack of economies of scale.
                    •	Wholesale sharing agreements in which a nonintegrated fertilizer producer uses the wholesale
                      capabilities of an upstream rival for the wholesale of its fertilizer are present in some markets. This
                      increases exchange of information on prices of fertilizer and could facilitate collusive agreements.
 Mitigating         √ Set regulations for straight fertilizer and complex fertilizer to allow for entry where viable
 actions            √ Set the import-licensing regime to allow for greater competition from imports. For example:
                         √ Allow for registration of products after testing for a minimum number of seasons in other countries
                           with similar agro-climactic conditions.
                    √ Award tenders through a competitive process rather than through negotiation with firms.
                         √ Design tender processes to minimize the chances of facilitating collusion, including, for example,
                           restrictions on information shared during the tender process. Minimize the frequency of
                           transactions to the extent possible.
                         √ Set rules on participation in tenders to allow for foreign competition or permit entry of those who
                           have not participated in tenders before, as long as they meet certain criteria on financial strength.

                                  • Indeed, the risks of exclusion of complex fertilizer producers is more likely if there has
                                     been foreclosure of straight fertilizer producers as there is greater likelihood of upstream
                                     dominance
                            • Presence of a vertically integrated dominant upstream firm.
                            • Assessment is required of whether downstream profits from foreclosure are likely to be greater
                               than the potential loss in upstream profits.

                                 √ Ensure that licenses and quotas for upstream activities are awarded to allow maximum
                                   competition, taking into account natural monopoly characteristics, the need for scale to
                                   recover investment costs, and other national security measures.
                                √ Implement antihoarding measures for primary material production.
                                √ Award licenses based on clear criteria, including potential efficiency.
                                √ This is particularly important where new licenses for mineral resource extraction are now
                                  being awarded, as in the case of potash reserves in the Democratic Republic of Congo
                                  and Ethiopia.
                            √ Set regulations and licensing for import of straight fertilizer and complex fertilizer to mitigate
                              against upstream dominance and to counteract effects of downstream foreclosure.
                            √ Ensure nondiscrimination in the type of licenses granted among firms in terms of their ability to
                              vertically integrate into straight or complex fertilizer production.
                            √ Where exclusive rights to operate an import facility are granted to one integrated importer,
                              assess the extent to which this facility constitutes an essential facility and ensure application of
                              access regulations for other importers.

               G. The impact of a lack of competition on fertilizer prices in Africa
              A primary concern of countries in the region is that fertilizer prices are generally higher in
              African countries than in peer countries in other regions. World Bank (2014a) examines a sample
              of African countries—including Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mozambique, Nigeria,
              Rwanda, South Africa, Tanzania, and Zambia—and finds urea prices at retail outlets to be well
              above FOB prices and higher than average retail prices in the Middle East and in the Black Sea
              region (Figure C2-18). There is also a high degree of variation in prices among the sampled
              countries, with Ghana and Kenya having the lowest prices, and Mozambique, Nigeria, and
              Burkina Faso having the highest prices.

              The potential savings from boosting competition in fertilizer markets could be significant. Fertilizer
              markets in Africa have exhibited high and stable levels of concentration, with relatively few entries
              in the last few years. In 58 percent of African countries, one supplier holds more than half of the
              market, and 57 percent of African countries have seen no entry in import or production in the last
              three years. Therefore, removing regulatory restrictions that inhibit entry and closely monitoring
              markets to detect potential cartels will be beneficial. In the case of cartel enforcement, the direct
              savings from ending the Zambian bid-rigging cartel were around $21 million in 2013. Eliminating
              regulatory restrictions that act as barriers to entry in fertilizer markets can also benefit farmers and
              businesses by reducing their costs and increasing productivity.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Based on available data, global export cartels such as the Belarus Potash Company export
cartel, could increase final consumer prices of certain fertilizers in Sub-Saharan Africa by at
least 29 percent. In the case of potash, a conservative estimate suggests that the export cartel’s
overcharge is 44 percent98 (Figure C2-19). Given that global FOB prices tend to make up around
65 percent of the final retail price of fertilizer across a number of African countries (IFDC 2007),
this would equate to an increase in fertilizer prices of around 29 percent to the final consumer,
assuming a simple pass-through. This is consistent with retail prices in Africa being significantly
above prices in the Black Sea and Middle East regions. Based on the consumption of potash in
Africa in 2014 and 2015 (FAO 2014), and global prices of potash,99 the potential cost to Africa of
the resumption of global cartel activities in 2014 and 2015 would be equivalent to an additional
expenditure of $109.8 million over the two years. This estimate is a first-order approximation and
does not take into account the demand effect that would arise from a reduction in potash prices.
Overall, consumption of potash is very low at present (and below optimal levels), due in part to
high prices.

 Global export cartels could be raising final prices for K fertilizer by 29 percent.
  On a national level, tackling collusion in Zambia has already led to savings of

      As a conservative approach, the average price during the breakdown of the BPC export cartel is used as an approximation of a competitive
      price. An energy price index was used to control for cost drivers of the potash price, and the agricultural price level was used to control
      for underlying demand conditions. Comparing the average price level during the breakdown of the cartel to the average price level
      following the resumption of the cartel, gives an approximate estimate of the overcharge from the cartel as 44 percent. This is in fact
      somewhat below a recent estimation of the overcharge from the exercise of market power from the phosphate and potash cartels during
      the period between 2008 and 2012, estimated at 63 percent (Gnutzmann and Spiewanowski 2013, building on Taylor and Moss 2013).
      It is also significantly below the differential between potash prices under the Canpotex export cartel versus the potential prices under
      a hypothetical situation in which PotashCorp left the cartel and ramped up its activity to full production. The estimate was put at 181
      percent for 2015 and 141 percent, on average, between 2012 and 2015 in a report prepared for the Canadian government (Conference
      Board of Canada 2010), as highlighted by Jenny (2012).

3.	Telecommunications: a key input for reaping digital dividends100



T   he telecommunications sector is key for promoting development, and competition policies are
    necessary for ensuring that the benefits of the digital economy can be distributed evenly. The
World Development Report 2016: Digital Dividends (World Bank 2016c) highlights the importance
of having “analog complements” to assure that the benefits of digital technologies—mainly
Internet and mobile phones—can positively affect development. One of the key policy conditions
is a regulatory environment that promotes market competition and encourages private operators
to innovate, be more productive, and, as a result, promote universal access to telecommunications
services. There is a consensus that strategies for achieving digital development must be broader
than information and communication technology (ICT), and create the conditions and incentives
for firms to compete and to provide better services (World Bank 2016c).

The lack of telecommunications infrastructure in Africa makes mobile and broadband wireless
technologies the most effective means to broaden Internet access on the continent. Fixed-line
penetration across Sub-Saharan Africa was 0.3 percent in 2012—the lowest of any region in the
world, and prices for accessing these networks tend to be relatively high. Thus, mobile technologies
are best placed to provide connectivity and deliver Internet access to the poorest populations.
Given its potential transformational effects on key sectors of the economy, estimations indicate
that if Internet access achieved an impact of the same scale as mobile telephony in Africa, it could
account for 10 percent of the region's total GDP in 2025 compared to 1 percent in 2013.

     Moreover, while the structure and level of competition in the telecommunications sector
     in Africa have changed over time, key segments of the industry still exhibit monopolistic
     structures. Until the 1990s, most telecommunications services in African countries were provided
     by a state-owned monopoly. During the initial stages of liberalization, state-owned monopolies
     gave way to private monopolies, which
     were regulated (Blackman and Srivastava Figure C3-2
     2011). The next stage saw the entry of Firms with more than 50 percent market share in African

     This section will focus on mobile and wireless Internet services given their current degree of
     development in African markets, and their significant spillover effects on economic growth and
     development. The potential for broadband to become a driver of sustainable economic growth
     and job creation in Africa is significant. However, mobile services have shown a significant degree
     of deployment across the continent, and given the lack of fixed line infrastructure, the wireless
     network will be the most feasible alternative for providing Internet access. Mobile technology
     is used by 99 percent of Internet subscribers and is considered the main vehicle for expanding
     Internet penetration in Africa. In addition, these telecommunications services help businesses
     and consumers directly.101 As such, the report will examine the value chains for wireless Internet
     services as well as international gateways.102



      While the structure and level of competition in the telecommunications sector
        in Africa have evolved over time, key segments of the industry—such as
      wireless technologies and international gateway services—still exhibit a high
      degree of state participation in the market, as well as regulatory restrictions.

A.	Overview of the telecommunications industry: main features and competition
   issues that arise from market structure103
Telecommunications markets are characterized by high fixed costs and economies of scale
that make the sector more prone to market concentration and anticompetitive practices.
Entrants face high fixed costs due to upfront investments in infrastructure, as well as commercial
investments in sales and distribution channels. These high initial fixed costs give incumbents a
strategic advantage over new entrants, because the latter have fewer clients to spread their fixed
costs. Given these features, incumbents are incentivized to price higher and aggressively in order
to hinder the entry of new competitors.

As a network industry, telecommunications networks present essential facilities and bottlenecks
that lead to market concentration. Market entry in the retail supply of telecommunications
services requires access to infrastructure. High infrastructure costs limit the economic viability of
replicating some facilities and thus limits the number of entrants. This can lead to the emergence
of a dominant wholesale infrastructure supplier or a small number of retail suppliers with their own
duplicated infrastructure. Although wireless technology introduced the possibility of increased
facilities-based competition, in Africa significant infrastructure bottlenecks remain.

Access issues arise in the sector when operators need to interact reciprocally to complete call
or data transfers. This two-way form of access could create—depending on the regulatory system
adopted (commonly calling party pays, CPP)—incentives for the terminating operator to exercise
its market power through its sole control by charging the receiver high prices for termination.
This competition issue can arise in both fixed and mobile networks and provides justification for
regulatory intervention to limit the incentives for this anticompetitive behavior.

Given the features of the telecommunications sector, government interventions in the form of
regulation and competition policy are necessary to tackle potential anticompetitive behaviors.
Fixed networks in particular, but also mobile networks, exhibit characteristics that require regulatory
intervention to assure market efficiency and protect consumers and competitors from abuse of
market power. The two instruments that governments can use to achieve this goal are competition
policy and sector regulation. Although they provide different degrees, and feature at different
stages of intervention (ex ante remedies versus ex post intervention), usually both types of
instrument converge. Regulatory systems must therefore define sound rules for the application of
these instruments to the different competition issues that can arise in telecommunications markets.

The telecommunications sector is characterized by disruptive technology and continues to
evolve at a fast pace. Technology changes lead to constant innovation and evolution of services
and markets, which creates new rivals and shifts the economic strength of existing rivals. These
evolving dynamics make it challenging to define relevant markets, identify barriers to entry, or
assess market power.104 105

  	 Price regulation may be premature in emerging markets, even if they do not yet appear to be fully competitive. Thus, given that
104

    telecommunications markets are subject to continuous technological change, best practice suggests that prices generally not be
    regulated in competitive or emerging retail and wholesale markets. Market intervention through price regulation should be reserved only
    for any mature relevant market in which a participant is dominant or there is evidence of collusion.
  	 When network externalities are significant, the biggest network will tend to attract a larger number of new clients. This is known as the
105

    bandwagon effect. In the medium term, it could create a situation in which only one enterprise, technology, or standard dominates the
    industry (a “winner-takes-all structure”) (Kwoka and White 2004).

                When the government participates in the market as a competitor with private enterprises, it can
                distort the level playing field. There is a risk that state-owned enterprises might enjoy preferential
                treatment. This may include preferential access to public properties that are essential for building
                network infrastructure. It may also include exemptions from licenses, as well as spectrum and
                other regulatory fees and taxes. Best practice advises that governments play a subsidiary role in
                the provision of telecommunications services. State-owned suppliers are also often relatively
                poor performers, and therefore create a perceived need for political favoritism to overcome
                their shortcomings.

                   dynamics that can create regulatory barriers to entry and that require both
                     ex ante and ex post regulatory intervention to assure market efficiency
                      and protect consumers and competitors from abuse of market power.

                The introduction of mobile networks has radically changed the competitive dynamics of
                telecommunications markets. By allowing several networks to coexist, the introduction of mobile
                technology made clear that competition was possible in the sector, as compared with the monopoly
                in fixed networks.

Key Industry characteristics and how they affect competition
Competition in mobile markets occurs at different levels of the value chain. The level of
competition in the mobile market depends on the competition dynamics at different levels of
the value chain, such as network, devices, and services. Market entry conditions into devices have
undergone significant technological changes in the past decade, and markets seem more open
to competition. In the case of mobile services, the regulatory framework was developed to enable
competition, taking into account factors like infrastructure and spectrum policies (Chetan 2011).

Mobile markets commonly have a small number of networks. Demand and supply factors play
an important role in determining the market structure. Mobile networks are significantly easier to
replicate than fixed ones. The initial investment costs can be low, with more capacity added as
demand increases. Regulation also plays a role in shaping the competition dynamics of the market,
through both the license regime and spectrum assignment. As a result of these two factors, mobile
markets are often oligopolistic (Cave 2013). Observations of the structure of the mobile industry
suggest that, with few exceptions, the number of mobile network operators usually lies between
two and five. In addition, there is a global trend toward greater concentration in mobile markets
through mergers and acquisitions and, in some cases, the exit of unsuccessful operators.

Input markets
Given that spectrum is an inherently scarce public resource, how it is managed can set the
competition dynamics of the market; sector regulators must therefore establish and administer
spectrum policy to achieve maximum competitive benefit. Spectrum allocations and assignments
should be able to address the following regulatory objectives, among others: competitive entry,
innovation, service quality, and customer demand. Regulatory authorities must also ensure the
efficient use of spectrum and its reallocation as and when technology and market behavior evolves.
It is therefore advised that regulatory authorities not only design an efficient spectrum management
policy but also enforce and implement appropriate monitoring mechanisms.

The limited availability of spectrum represents a key barrier to entry. Entry cannot occur if
governments or regulatory authorities do not issue spectrum licenses. Furthermore, in markets
with dominant operators, competition can be harmed if spectrum caps or other mechanisms are
not considered for future assignments to preserve or encourage competition in the market. There
is also a risk that market players could adopt foreclosure strategies by limiting the access of actual
or potential competitors to available spectrum.
	
When the available spectrum is insufficient to meet the demand from new entrants, international
best practice advises selecting new entrants through a competitive process. In both mobile and
wireless markets, there are usually more market players interested than spectrum available for
the service. By requiring potential licensees to compete for the license, scarce spectrum can be
allocated to the operator that is best placed to maximize the benefit to customers and to succeed
in a competitive market. Complementarily, international best practice advises setting, as part of
the competitive auctions, spectrum fees for commercial spectrum use that ensure the highest-
value use, while at the same time allowing the authorities to achieve other regulatory objectives.
Including the possibility of spectrum trading and secondary markets in the regulatory framework
can allow for efficient spectrum use over time.

           Spectrum is an essential input for mobile services, and it is a natural
          scarce resource; an efficient spectrum management policy is therefore
            key to shaping efficient competition dynamics in the mobile sector.


     Wholesale level
     Regulation of termination charges based on costs is critical to promoting competition in the
     mobile sector. Each mobile operator’s termination is a separate market with a monopoly supplier,
     since it is a service for which there are no available alternatives. Termination rates are based on the
     marginal costs of the originating network, and the terminating network operator and customers
     are not affected by these costs. In this context, operators have an incentive to set these charges
     at a monopolistic level. Wholesale termination is therefore classified as a noncontestable market,
     in which each network can impose market power. Considering this, there is a need to impose
     termination rates in order to limit operators’ incentives to indirectly exploit the consumers of the
     other network. Several regulators and competition authorities around the world have followed this
     approach (Cave 2013). It is important to consider the existence of two-sided markets in mobile
     telephony when regulating this service.

     Additionally, a pricing issue that arises in mobile services is the “on-net”, “off-net” strategy
     that can exacerbate network effects. This strategy, a modality of price discrimination, consists
     of imposing higher charges to call subscribers of different mobile networks (“off-net” calls) than
     to call other subscribers on their own network (“on-net” calls). Differential on-net and off-net
     pricing could be used by large operators as a foreclosure mechanism against smaller competitors.
     Indeed, this strategy can lead to large “club effects,” advantaging the largest operator, weakening
     competitors, and increasing “bandwagon effects.” Several solutions can be adopted to deal with
     this issue. Setting low termination rates can help on the regulatory side. On the competition side,
     this strategy can be seen as a case of margin squeeze or abuse of a dominant position. International
     best practice has adopted regulatory solutions to address this.

     Competition at the wholesale level is possible trough mobile virtual network operators (MVNO).
     Many mobile operators around the world have entered into voluntary agreements with MVNOs,
     which service their own retail customers by utilizing the facilities of a mobile network operator
     (MNO). Empirical evidence from other countries shows that customers often benefit from the
     entrance of MVNOs in the telecommunications market, through lower prices for voice calls and
     text messages (Kiiski 2006). MVNOs run on the networks of existing operators but provide services
     independently, including issuing subscriber identification module (SIM) cards, billing, and customer
     care. Where MNOs refuse to contract with MVNOs, however, the question may arise as to whether
     a competition authority should consider this to be an anticompetitive act.



       On-net, off-net price discrimination is a common strategy in mobile markets
        and can exacerbate network effects and create competition distortions.

Retail segment
Competition dynamics in retail mobile markets are affected by external competition from over-
the-top (OTT) operators. Enterprises like Google, Facebook, Skype, WhatsApp, Microsoft, and
Apple are progressively competing with mobile operators in certain markets, and their presence
over wireless platforms is redefining the industry. Revenues from external mobile applications
(such as apps and downloads) exceed those for the typical offerings of mobile services (such as
messaging). This phenomenon is increasing steadily, forcing mobile operators to seek new sources
of revenue. Areas such as mobile banking, mobile advertising, and mobile commerce represent
an opportunity for current mobile operators to deal with threats from OTTs. Some alliances and
collaborative schemes among mobile operators in segments where they do not compete are also
expected as a result of this new reality. Areas include devices, customer equipment, and service
platforms, among others (Deloitte 2014).

Given the industry characteristics and the competition dynamics presented above, some
potential anticompetitive practices arise frequently in mobile markets (Figure C3-5). In the case
of unilateral strategic behavior, dominant operators can engage in anticompetitive practices in the
input sector by hoarding spectrum in auctions, creating barriers for potential new competitors and
competition disadvantages for existing competitors in the market. In the wholesale market, given
that each network enjoys a monopolistic position in termination, they can try to impose excessive
fees or engage in margin squeeze practices. In addition, as explained, discrimination between
on-net and off-net prices by dominant firms can lead to anticompetitive outcomes. In terms of
network sharing, dominant wholesale networks can engage in direct or indirect refusals to provide
access to key elements of the network (active or passive infrastructure), not only to other MNOs
but also to MVNOs that need this access to provide their services in the final market. Collusive
behavior can arise at both the wholesale and retail level. At the wholesale level, mobile networks
can engage in collective refusals to deal with or boycotts of MVNOs in an attempt to block their
access to the market. Finally, collusive behavior can arise in retail markets if operators collectively
set prices or other commercial conditions to final consumers.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



Industry characteristics that shape competition dynamics of mobile markets
in Africa
Several countries in Africa currently allow full competition in mobile phone services. According
to the International Telecommunications Union (ITU) (2013), 26 countries allow full competition in
the sector and 11 have partial competition through the issuance of a limited number of licenses
(Figure C3-6). The latter include Botswana, Côte d’Ivoire, Eritrea, Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Malawi,
Senegal, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Tanzania has no state-owned
providers, while in Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius, Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa, there are
providers with state shareholding of more than 50 percent of the market share. Africa compares
well to the rest of the world, with lower monopoly rates than among Arab States and countries
in Asia and the Pacific, and levels of full competition that are equivalent to those in Europe and
higher than those in Asia and the Pacific and among Arab States (ITU 2013).

Mobile market expansion in Africa has been driven mainly by the high penetration of prepaid
services. Between 2005 and 2015, prepaid subscriptions have sustained the exponential growth of
mobile technologies around the continent. The only exception to this trend is South Africa, where
postpaid services have a small but relatively steady market share. Among the mobile technologies
that are present on the continent, GSM is the most relevant in terms of subscribers, with 168 percent
of penetration in 2015. These high rates of penetration can be explained by the phenomenon of
multi-SIM ownership. Ownership of multiple SIM cards is widespread, and actual penetration of
individuals could be closer to 40–50 percent in some countries, potentially leaving room for further
growth. This is the case in Nigeria, for example, where mobile penetration is above 60 percent but
individual penetration just above 26 percent (GSMA 2012). Internet mobile penetration has also
expanded significantly.

      The characteristics of mobile markets in Africa can be grouped into four main
      factors that determine competition dynamics


      Factor 1: Concentrated markets and high presence of panregional economic groups
      In 2015, mobile markets in Africa included seven monopolies,106 11 duopolies,107 20 economies
      with three competitors, and 19 countries with at least four suppliers. This landscape has not
      changed dramatically since 2010. In this
      period, 17 countries experienced either Figure C3-7

      competitors throughout the continent has
                                                      More than
      not changed significantly. The number of     3 Competitors

      providers expanded in only four countries:
      Libya and Mozambique, from two to three,     3 competitors
      and Cameroon and Rwanda, from three
      to four.109 On the other hand, five have
                                                       Duopolies
      reduced the number of competitors: the
      Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya,
      Madagascar, and Sierra Leone moved             Monopolies
      from four to three players, and Namibia
      from three to two. Figure C3-7 summarizes                  0        3       6      9     12      15       18 21 24

        	 Comoros, Djibouti, Ethiopia, and Eritrea have state-owned enterprises as providers. São Tomé and Príncipe (Oi Group), Swaziland (MTN

          group), and Saint Helena, Ascension and Tristan da Cunha (Batelco group) have private providers. Data for Saint Helena is available only
          from Q3 2015 on, as 100 percent Batelco; this number was considered to 2010.
        	 Mayotte and Reunion, despite having three providers, are considered to be duopolies in the analysis: the Altice group owns two of the
      107

          three providers in each country.
        	 Six countries had entries: Cameroon, Côte d’Ivore, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ghana, Libya, and Mozambique. Six experienced
      108

          exits: Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, Namibia, Sierra Leone, and South Sudan. Five countries saw companies both
          entering and exiting their markets: Burundi, Nigeria, Rwanda, Tanzania, and Uganda.
        	 The number of providers also increased in Ghana, Tanzania, and Uganda, but all of these countries already had at least four different
      109

          suppliers before 2010 and all entries were marginal: three new companies in Ghana, with combined market share of 5.43 percent; three
          new companies in Tanzania, with combined market share of 5.7 percent; and three new companies in Uganda, with combined market
          share of 1.6 percent. One of the entrants in Uganda was Vodafone, with 0.52 percent market share in 2015.

Although there has been a subtle change in the number of competitors, market shares show that
the majority of African mobile markets have a strong market leader. As of 2015, 27 countries in
Africa have a mobile provider with more than 50 percent market share. This represents a decline
from 2010, when there were 37 operators holding this level of market share.111

Notwithstanding the general trend of redistribution of market shares, some countries also
faced sharp concentrations during the period. Namibia, for example, which in 2010 was already
a highly concentrated market, lost its second player, Powercom. Powercom’s 13.7 percent
market share was almost entirely absorbed by the market leader (Oi Group) which reached
96.2 percent market participation in 2015. In Sierra Leone, Comium Group—formerly the third-
largest player in the country, with 26.71 percent in 2010—exited the market. Again, the result
was that a leader absorbed almost all the remaining market share, reaching more than 71.88
percent, and the number of players dropped from four to three. The second player was left with
a 25.37 percent share.



                        In 2015, 27 countries in Africa have a strong market
                           leader with more than 50 percent market share.


Five panregional groups offer telecommunications services in 42 economies in Africa. In 2015,
78 economic groups offered telecommunications services in 57 African countries. Despite the
apparent diversity, some of these groups are present throughout the continent. The five largest
providers are (in order of the number of countries covered): Orange, in 19 markets; MTN group in
18; Bharti Airtel in 16; Etisalat Group in 13; and Vodafone/Vodacom in eight countries. At least one
of these five groups can be found in 42 countries, which represent more than 70 percent of African
economies. Figure C3-8 summarizes the presence of each of the five largest groups that provide
telecommunications services in Africa.112




  	 From 2010 to 2015, seven of the eleven duopolies of the continent saw their market leader losing market share. The same happened
111

    with 14 of the 20 countries with three competitors and 11 of the 19 economies with at least four players. Across the continent as a whole,
    64 percent of the leaders lost market share during this period. The reduction in the average magnitude of the market share of leaders is
    portrayed by the following graph: the percentage of leading companies holding more than 65 percent market share in duopolies or more
    than 50 percent in economies with three or more players has diminished significantly.
  	 Since 2010, the only changes have been Vodafone’s entry in Uganda and Bharti Airtel’s entry in Rwanda.

These five economic groups concentrate 64 percent of total connections in Africa. Individual
operators (not pertaining to groups) are much smaller, the largest individual being a state-owned
monopoly in Ethiopia. The above figures show the presence of these groups in the continent, as
well as the significant differences in the volume of connection among these groups and individual
operators not pertaining to the groups operating in other countries.

These economic groups are becoming more symmetric over time, while holding their total Africa-
wide share constant. Between 2010 and 2015, MTN, Vodafone, and Orange have decreased their
share of total subscribers, while Airtel and Etisalat Group have increased their share on the continent.
Their overall shares on the continent, however, have remained similar over the five-year period.

                    During the period of analysis, there has been considerable change in the country-specific market
                    shares of these economic groups. A closer analysis of the market dynamics within these countries
                    shows that the market shares of each of these five economic groups have changed significantly at
                    the country level.

Factor 2: Multimarket contact between suppliers
There is significant multimarket contact between the five largest telecommunications groups
across Africa. The major regional mobile providers tend to be present across multiple African
countries, leading to multimarket contact among them. From the 42 countries covered by at
least one these five groups, 25 have at least two companies competing for the market. Even
though four or five of these groups are never present simultaneously, nine countries have three
of them competing for their markets and 16 have two among their providers. Moreover, there are
five countries that are only supplied by a combination of these five groups: one monopoly (MTN
in Swaziland); two duopolies (Orange and Etisalat in Mali; Bharti Airtel and MTN in Malawi); and
two instances in which there are three suppliers, all of whom are among the five largest providers
(Orange, Etisalat, and Vodafone in Egypt; Bharti Airtel, Orange, and Vodafone in Kenya). Finally,
in 76 percent of the countries covered by at least one of these five groups, one of them is market
leader.113 One of these five groups is the market leader in 32 of the 57 African countries considered
in the sample. Figure C3-13 displays the multimarket contact among these providers. In 88 percent
of the countries in which two of these panregional economic groups participate, these companies
jointly control more than 70 percent of the market.

There is significant multimarket contact among the groups that operate across
           Africa. In 88 percent of the countries in which two of these
      panregional economic groups participate, these companies jointly
                    control more than 70 percent of the market.



  	 There are 10 countries that, despite participation from one of these groups, are led by other providers: Central African Republic, Mayotte,
113

    Mozambique, Reunion, the Seychelles, Sierra Leone, South Sudan, Sudan, Togo, and Tunisia. Only Mozambique and Togo are led by state-
    owned enterprises; the remaining countries are led by other private economic groups that are less prevalent across the African continent.

      Although cartels have not been detected among these five groups across the region,
      awareness of multimarket contact can improve the effectiveness of competition policy in the
      region. Although the market structures of mobile and wireless markets in Africa suggest that
      potential anticompetitive practices in the form of unilateral behavior are more likely to occur,
      and this presumption is consistent with the practice of competition authorities, it is important to
      bear in mind the multimarket contact when authorities deal with mergers or potential horizontal
      agreements in the region. The cost structure of mobile telecommunications leans towards a “small
      numbers” market structure; therefore, the sector seems to be a natural oligopoly, which can lead
      to tacit coordination.114 Indeed, it is likely that the conditions for tacit coordination are met in
      many cases in the mobile telecommunications market, since transparency of rates is a feature of
      the marketplace, cost structures are broadly similar, and the largest operators often have roughly
      symmetrical market shares and interact frequently in the market (Cave 2013). In addition, unilateral
      practices could be conducted by the same group in different countries. There is a need, therefore,
      for regional coordination to address the potential anticompetitive effects of Africa’s multimarket
      telecommunications sector.



               There is a need for regional coordination to address the potential
                 anticompetitive effects of the multimarket telecommunications
                  sector. These include tacit coordination across the region and
            unilateral practices conducted by the same group in different countries.


      Factor 3: Lack of use of competitive mechanisms for spectrum assignment
      Market-based spectrum pricing is increasingly acknowledged as an important mechanism to
      encourage the most effective use of spectrum. However, not all spectrum can be priced through
      market-based mechanisms such as auctions and spectrum trading. Where these are not possible,
      any prices set must be calculated administratively rather than set through market-based methods.

      To date, Nigeria is the only country in Africa to have carried out spectrum auctions (Song 2014).
      Spectrum auctions in Africa can serve several regulatory objectives, including control of market
      power through caps on spectrum holding and limitations of dominant firms, and universal access,
      imposing coverage obligations in less developed areas.

      Policies for assigning spectrum need to be updated to ensure efficient and procompetitive
      allocation of spectrum freed up by the digital switchover. Kenya, Mauritius, Namibia, Rwanda,
      South Africa, and Tanzania use a first-come, first-served basis to allocate radio spectrum. This
      method, though time-efficient, does not always lead to desirable outcomes, since firms that
      cannot make the best use of the spectrum may nonetheless win rights to it. Egypt is planning
      to use auctions to allocate 4G spectrum. Nigeria is another example of the use of auctions for
      assigning spectrum. In South Africa, the regulator has attempted to launch a spectrum auction
      for 4G spectrum, but the process is on hold. In markets where there is a predominant firm, special
      consideration has to be given to imposing appropriate spectrum caps to safeguard competition,

        	 According to best practice, tacit coordination requires that firms are able to reach an agreement and to supervise their partners,

          coordination must be internally sustainable among the members of the agreement, and coordination needs to be externally sustainable.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



as has been the case in various countries. In Rwanda, the government assigned the 4G spectrum
to a joint venture with government participation and declared it to be the sole mobile broadband
wholesaler. Other countries, such as South Africa, have considered creating a monopoly for the
provision of 4G broadband services. While this arrangement is expected to boost productive
efficiency, the lack of competition could constrain deals for consumers.

In Kenya, the most efficient band has been assigned to the dominant operator, creating a first-
mover advantage. Safaricom controls almost two-thirds of spectrum in bands below 1 GHz, and
43 percent of spectrum between 1 GHz and 3 GHz. This allows it to offer considerably higher
maximum data speeds and/or carry a considerably larger volume of traffic for a higher number of
subscribers than its rivals. Safaricom has been assigned spectrum in the 800 MHz frequency band
on a trial basis as part of a public-private partnership to supply services to the police, and awaits a
full spectrum license under which it would be required to share 30 percent of its network capacity.

There is a need to adopt an approach to spectrum pricing and assignment that incentivizes
efficient use of a scarce public resource, for instance through auctions and other competitive
selection methods. In many countries, spectrum is assigned administratively to operators that
are already in the market or to the largest or state operator, as in Cameroon and Rwanda. Tenders
in mobile markets are sometimes designed without considering competition implications.
There is a need to protect consumers against the accumulation of spectrum, providing for
safeguards against concentration of spectrum in the hands of a few players while considering
efficient use of spectrum.

The biggest impact of the release of the global 700 MHz band is most likely to be felt in Africa,
as its excellent propagation characteristics make it an ideal technology for rural broadband
in terms of both reach and cost of rollout. This band will be central to delivering broadband
services on an unprecedented scale, along with the attendant social and economic impact. So
far, no African countries have assigned spectrum for broadband in the 700MHz band. In the
majority of countries, it is still a part of the spectrum allocated for terrestrial television broadcast.
The challenge for regulators will be to make the spectrum available in a manner that promotes
competition and encourages rapid deployment (Song 2014).



 To date, Nigeria is the only country in Sub-Saharan Africa to have carried out
   spectrum auctions. The remaining countries use a first-come, first-served
    basis to allocate radio spectrum, which can lead to inefficient outcomes.


Factor 4: State participation in the provision of mobile services
The government participates in companies that compete with private operators, highlighting the
importance of measures necessary to ensure competitive neutrality. According to the 2015 ACF-
WBG survey, several countries have providers with state participation at over 50 percent market
share (EAC, Kenya, Morocco, Mauritius, Namibia, and South Africa). This issue will be addressed
in greater detail in the following section.

      Government interventions that may act as obstacles to competition in mobile markets
      While governments set the rules that create the conditions that allow firms to operate and
      generate incentives for firms to thrive for the benefit of consumers, certain regulations and
      government interventions are more likely to restrict or distort efficient and competitive markets.
      Anticompetitive behavior along the supply chain can be facilitated by government interventions
      that restrict competition through:

        i)	    Rules that limit entry and facilitate dominance by increasing concentration and entrenching
               dominant positions, thereby increasing the risk of abuse of dominance or collusion;
        ii)	   Rules that facilitate collusion or restrict firms’ choice of strategic variables; or
        iii)	 Rules that discriminate or protect vested interests, and therefore indirectly increase
              concentration. 115


      Within these broad categories, specific types of restrictions can be identified. Figure C3-14
      presents government interventions and specific regulations that can restrict competition in
      mobile markets.116 Figure C3-15 shows specific examples of government interventions that restrict
      competition in certain African countries.




        	 Within each category, there are restrictions that can be considered most restrictive regulations. This specific guidance is provided in
      115

          the Markets and Competition Policy Assessment Tool (MCPAT), developed by the World Bank. Agencies should bear in mind, however,
          that although some restrictions are not considered the most pervasive ones—and are therefore not immediate candidates for priority
          reforms—the combination of these regulations within a specific sector or relevant market could create significant restrictions to
          competition. This can happen, for instance, when they recur in specific market subsegments or, when assessed collectively, it is clear
          that they are part of a strategy, for example, to prevent the entry of new players by imposing barriers to competition in the form of
          standards or excessive requirements.
        	 These examples have been developed considering the World Bank’s experience in working on procompetition interventions in several
      116

          markets.

              Mobile termination rates are high in the region due to the lack of adequate regulation
              Given the monopolistic characteristics of call termination, termination rates should be based
              on the costs of an efficient operator. There is overwhelming international evidence that cost-
              based termination rates encourage competition and are more affordable for consumers. Indeed,
              several studies show that appropriate regulation of mobile termination rates has generally had a
              considerable impact on tariffs (Cricelli et al. 2012; Hurkens and Lopez 2012), and empirical reviews
              show that Africa follows this pattern (Stork 2012). Regulators are moving toward the forward-
              looking long-run incremental cost (LRIC) methodology to determine the most appropriate glide
              paths after the European Commission recommended this methodology in 2009 (Commission of
              the European Communities 2009).

             Although African countries have embarked on regulatory interventions that reduce mobile
             termination rates (MTRs) toward the cost of an efficient operators, high mobile termination
             rates are still very common in Africa. Comparing termination rates of selected countries in Africa
             against the cost of Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) low-user
             baskets for mobile telecommunications for the cheapest product available confirms the link
             between high termination rates and high prices for these African countries (Stork 2012).

              Rwanda’s MTRs, for example, are exceptionally high compared to others in the region. Kenya,
              after some reduction had already taken place, took a much stricter stance in June 2010, cutting
              MTRs in half. This move had a powerful impact on tariffs, with average prepaid on-net tariffs
              decreasing by 32 percent and prepaid off-net tariffs decreasing by 57 percent (postpaid reduced
              even further) by the end of June 2011 (CCK 2013; Stork 2012). Tanzania had, up until late 2013,
              exceptionally high rates within the region, but has recently taken a stronger stance, cutting MTRs by
              almost 70 percent.117 Whether this move will have a similarly transformative effect on the Tanzanian
              market as in Kenya remains to be seen. In Mozambique, mobile termination charges have been cut

significantly starting in 2013, and positive effects on competition have been reported (Calandro,
Chair, and Mabila 2014). Rwanda’s mobile termination rates are now more than 200 percent those
of Tanzania and more than 330 percent those of Kenya.



       Although African countries have embarked on regulatory interventions
        that reduce mobile termination rates toward the cost of an efficient
          operator, high mobile termination rates are still common in Africa.


Restrictions on foreign investment are present in some countries
Private investment is critically important in the telecommunications sector and remains the key
driver of the expansion of telecommunications networks. In Sub-Saharan Africa, the majority
of countries allow foreign investment and permit

investment in their telecommunications sectors.

C. Wireless broadband services
In Africa, the monopoly of incumbent operators over undersea cables, landing stations, and
international gateways has contributed to the high cost of telecommunications services.
Monopoly rights were typically granted because it was believed that these facilities were natural
monopolies and that the state would provide services in the most efficient way. The experiences
of various countries clearly demonstrate, however, that where the provision of international
communications has been opened to competition, prices have been driven down while demand
has gone up. As Internet connections in Sub-Saharan Africa remain among the most expensive in
the world, it is necessary to identify and evaluate the main competition challenges that continue
to hamper the development of truly competitive telecommunications markets.

                   Low levels of Internet access in Africa may be explained in part by how the Internet connection
                   market functions (ITU 2013). Accordingly, this section provides a brief overview of the value chain
                   for the provision of Internet connection.118 Each segment of the value chain may be affected by
                   different barriers, which in turn determine the overall level of competition. Figure C3-17 describes
                   the wireless value chain from the perspective of services that, taken together, allow end users to

                   While the deployment of submarine cable has substantially increased bandwidth capacity in
                   Africa, the benefits that can be reaped from this development are yet to be fully exploited. The
                   main challenge lies in extending the capacity offered by submarine cables to landlocked countries
                   and rural areas, and opening this market to more competition. Landlocked countries generally pay
                   higher prices for bandwidth than coastal countries. In Africa, for instance, being landlocked adds
                   an average of $232 to the monthly price of fixed broadband access (World Bank 2016c).

                   Before 2006, most African countries granted monopoly rights to incumbent operators to
                   operate a submarine cable landing station. In fact, incumbent operators in 13 of the 19
                   countries in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region enjoy exclusive control over
                   access to international submarine cable connectivity (World Bank 2014). Cameroon granted
                   CAMTEL (Cameroon Telecommunications) an exclusive right to access the SAT-3 international
                   fiber optic submarine cable, which in turn allowed the company to charge high prices to Internet
                   Service Providers (ISPs).

                         Internet service providers (ISPs), national or international backbone providers, and Internet access providers (IAPs). While these types of
                         suppliers can be independent of each other, it is possible for all three functions to be subsumed under a single operator.

positive impact that competition can have on prices. Until 2009, South Africa’s bandwidth relied
on satellite and a single submarine cable, SAT-3. This translated into one of the highest bandwidth
prices in the world. The incumbent telecommunications operator was the sole owner of the
cable. Since 2009, however, three new submarine cables have landed in the country, leading to a
significant drop in prices.



              As Internet connections in Sub-Saharan Africa remain among
                the most expensive in the world, it is important to identify
              the main competition challenges that continue to hamper the
             development of truly competitive telecommunications markets.


Main regulatory restrictions and competition issues
In many Sub-Saharan African countries, mobile operators are allowed to deploy their own
backbone networks to provide services to their retail customers, but are or were prohibited
from offering wholesale backbone services
to other telecommunications operators. This Table C3-1

is Cameroon (Schumann and Kende 2013).

Applicable taxes and tax administration can constitute a significant barrier to entry, thereby
dampening network investment and potentially discouraging telecommunications operators
from upgrading or expanding their networks. In Nigeria in 2014, for example, mobile operators
paid $850 million in taxes and regulatory fees. The GSMA reports that “adding to this cost,
international comparisons reveal that the amount of time needed to comply with tax duties is
the highest in the world, and the number of different taxes paid are high, particularly for mobile
operators who are subject to numerous sector-specific taxes and to local taxes across their
national footprint” (GSMA 2015).

      In most African countries, full competition is allowed but the presence of large firms in the
      market and government ownership are common. Table C3-1 shows the status of competition in
      cable modem and wireless local loop services in Africa. Based on available data, in cable modem
      services, 10 countries allow full competition, five have monopolies, and Sierra Leone is the only
      country with partial competition (ITU 2013). As far as wireless local loop is concerned, 10 countries
      have partial competition, 18 allow full competition, and six have monopolies (ITU 2013). According
      to the ACF-WBG survey, seven out of 11 countries have one firm with more than 50 percent market
      share, and there has been entry in the last two years in Botswana, Kenya, Mauritius, and Zambia. It
      is worth noting, however, that four countries impose legal limits on ownership by foreign investors.

      The government participates in companies that compete with private operators, highlighting
      the importance of measures that can ensure competitive neutrality. Based on the ACF-WBG
      survey, Zambia is the only country with no state-owned providers in the fixed and wireless Internet
      service sectors. However, the state owns a fiber network that provides wholesale services to
      other providers and retail data services. Seven of the remaining 10 countries have providers with
      state participation of more than 50 percent market share (Botswana, Egypt, Kenya, Mauritius,
      Morocco, Namibia, and South Africa). The Gambia, Tanzania, and Tunisia have providers with state
      participation of less than 50 percent market share.

      Some governments in Africa have developed broadband infrastructure and are gradually
      incorporating private partners. Mauritius was the first in the world to develop a nationwide
      wireless broadband network in 2005. Mauritius Telecom has a 57 percent market share in the fiber
      optic broadband market and a 93 percent market share in the asymmetric digital subscriber line
      (ADSL) market through its fully owned subsidiary, Telecom Plus Ltd. Mauritius Telecom has been
      partly privatized, with France Telecom (Orange S.A.) now holding a 40 percent stake. In Rwanda,
      the fiber optic network developed by the government and the 4G infrastructure are managed by
      a joint venture between the government and Korea Telekom. 120



                  Government involvement in developing broadband infrastructure
                 has risen in Africa, as has the need for accompanying regulation to
                ensure competitive neutrality and minimize distortions to competition.


      D. International gateway services
      Traditionally, monopoly rights to operate international gateway (IGW) services and to provide
      international services were granted to fixed incumbent operators. The main argument was that a
      monopoly over IGW would allow a given country to keep high prices for international calls. It was
      believed that high charges for outgoing calls would discourage such connections, while profits
      made from incoming calls121 would be used to fund network deployment by the fixed incumbent

      120	
             After a period during which telecommunications development was led largely by the private sector, there has been a recent move toward
             more direct government involvement. Increased government participation in the data sector has been accompanied by solid regulatory
             frameworks to ensure competitive neutrality and minimize distortions to competition.
      121
         	 The argument was that “consumers in developed countries had a better ability to pay for high international call charges than those in
           developing countries”GSMA, 2012.

operator.122 Over the years, the cost of entering into the IGW market has dropped significantly due
to technological advancements, in particular the deployment of voice-over IP (VoIP) services and
very small aperture terminals (VSATs). Despite these advancements, some countries have preferred
to postpone or avoid liberalization of the IGW market on the grounds that more competition
would lead to lower prices, which in turn would increase outgoing and decrease incoming calls,
thereby decreasing the incumbent operator’s funds for the deployment of its network.

Given the attractiveness of entry into this market, countries that chose to keep a monopoly
structure have witnessed illegal bypassing made possible by technological advancements.123
While illegal bypassing (which can account for 30–60 percent or more of traffic) delivers lower prices
to consumers, it also compromises the quality of service, as there is a risk of service interruption.
The possibility of bypassing the IGW of incumbent operators, either through illegal bypassing
or by rerouting traffic through third countries, therefore significantly undermines any rationale
behind maintaining a monopoly.124

The experiences of African countries clearly demonstrate that full liberalization of the IGW market
has the potential to deliver significant benefits, both to consumers and to the country as a whole.
It appears that consumers benefit from liberalization of IGWs either when governments allow
the entry of competing IGW service providers, including mobile operators, or when competing
operators provide IGW services by accessing the existing gateways of the incumbent operator.
Prices tend to be lower in countries with competing international gateways than in countries with
just one submarine cable. According to a GSMA study, average international call prices in countries
that were liberalizing fell by as dramatic an extent as 90 percent in the years immediately following
full liberalization (GSMA 2012). In Kenya, for example, international calling prices decreased by
70 percent after mobile providers obtained IGW licenses. Likewise, in Nigeria, prices fell by 90
percent. In the aftermath of IGW liberalization in Tanzania in 2005–06, international prices fell by
57 percent and mobile international tariffs by 68 percent. Evidence shows that the introduction of
competition not only lowers prices, but also stimulates demand and leads to increased traffic. For
example, the GSMA observed that the volume of international traffic increased by 40 percent in
Kenya and by 65 percent in Nigeria after liberalization.

In addition to having a positive impact on voice services, competition in the IGW market can also
lower prices for access to the Internet. Overall, the opening of the IGW market to competition
increases consumer welfare by fostering lower prices, higher volumes of international traffic, and
higher-quality telecommunications services as competition between multiple providers leads to
improved and more reliable international connectivity.125


  	 Typically, fixed operators would each have their own international gateway and a network reaching to a point where both gateways would
122

    connect. Commercial relations between the operators are governed by bilateral agreements that specify, among others, compensation
    mechanisms and other financial arrangements.
  	 In particular, GSM gateways or SIM boxes are used to bypass international termination rates.
123


  	 In countries that opted for gradual liberalization, during the initial phase mobile operators were often prevented from deploying their
124

    own IGW. Instead, these operators were required to either access the incumbent operator’s international services or to interconnect
    through competing fixed international gateway providers where multiple IGWs were available.
  	 For example, “in Kenya, prior to liberalization of the international gateways, the incumbent subjected ISPs to sudden and enormous price
125

    as well as technical problems which, for instance, meant that the country did not have access to the global Internet for an entire weekend
    in August 2004” (GSMA 2012).




Unlocking Africa’s Potential through Vigorous Competition Policy                                                                                 115

             In African countries that were liberalizing the IGW market, average
       international call prices fell by as dramatic an extent as 90 percent, and traffic
       has increased significantly in the years immediately following full liberalization.


      Main regulatory restrictions and competition issues
      Monopoly rights and other restrictions on the provision of IGW services have a negative impact
      on consumers and on the economy as a whole. Not only are consumers charged high prices for
      international calls, but the country can become less attractive to foreign investors. This is particularly
      the case if neighboring countries have already successfully liberalized their IGW markets.

      Monopoly over international gateways126
      To ensure optimum connection, each domestic fixed and mobile network should be connected
      directly to the IGW. Where a fixed operator continues to enjoy monopoly rights over an IGW,
      however, it may have both the ability and the incentive to request other domestic networks to
      convey their traffic at a lower point in its fixed network. Indirect connection to the IGW implies
      more carriage and, consequently, higher interconnection charges, but also a lower share of the
      charges paid by the foreign operator because the incumbent carries the call further over its
      own network.

      Prohibitively high fees
      The state of competition in the IGW market is determined not only by the liberalization policy,
      but also by the prices charged for international capacity, which in turn have a direct impact
      on the price and usage of Internet access. Zambia, for example, had kept its IGW market
      closed for over 20 years because the first liberalization steps were taken in other areas of the
      telecommunications sector. During that period, state-owned Zamtel routed all international calls
      through its international gateway. However, the gateway could not meet all the traffic demand
      and the incumbent operator did not have sufficient incentive to invest in the facility, as it did not
      face any competition. Although IGW services have eventually been liberalized and two service
      providers have obtained licenses to access the international gateway facility previously operated
      exclusively by Zamtel, private sector investment in these services was virtually nonexistent until
      2010 due to prohibitively high license fees. Until 2010, the license fee for the international gateway
      was $12.5 million per year, which acted as a barrier to entry.127 As of 2010, when this fee was
      reduced to $300,000, the market has attracted more investment and prices paid by end users have
      declined substantially.

      Government-sanctioned cartels
      An increasing number of countries have recently restricted or even fully eliminated market players’
      commercial freedom to set termination charges for incoming international telecommunications
      traffic by imposing binding rate floors. As the OECD notes, these charges “act as a government-

        	 In 2013, a monopoly on the international gateway continued to exist in Côte d’Ivoire, while incumbent operators in Cameroon and
      126

          Botswana were still state-owned (Schumann and Kende 2013).
        	 In comparison, the fee for international gateway services was set at $214,000 in Kenya and at $50,000 in Uganda.

sanctioned cartel, precluding competition and raising prices for consumers in the countries
involved (as some operators in other countries take reciprocal action which raises the prices for
outgoing calls) as well as for users in other countries”(OECD 2014).

Although over half of respondents in Africa consider their IGW services market to be open to
either full or partial competition, this falls considerably below the proportion in Europe, the
Americas, the Common Wealth of Independent States (CIS), and Asia and the Pacific regions.
According to the ACF-WBG survey, Cameroon, Ethiopia, and The Gambia have a state monopoly
in the provision of IGW services.

The government participates in some countries as a commercial operator. Botswana,
Kenya, Namibia, Tanzania, Tunisia, and Zambia have no state-owned monopoly providers in the
international calling services market. In The Gambia, Kenya, Morocco, and South Africa, providers
with state shareholding account for more that 50 percent of the traffic. In Mauritius, the state-
owned enterprise has less than 50 percent market share.

Finally, regulation of the price of IGW services is crucial where there is a monopoly in order to
facilitate competition in international communications services and roaming. According to the
ACF-WBG survey, prices for accessing the service are not regulated in Namibia or the Seychelles,
whereas Botswana, Egypt, The Gambia, Kenya, Mauritius, the Republic of Congo, Rwanda, and
Tanzania regulate prices for accessing the service.

An increasing number of African countries have restricted or even fully eliminated
  market players’ commercial freedom to set termination charges for incoming
     international telecommunications traffic by imposing binding rate floors.

                  The Competition Authority of Egypt has referred three major mobile operators—Mobinil, Etisalat, and          Illegal
                  Vodafone—to the prosecutor general following charges of engaging in an anticompetitive agreement             agreement

                  division in the value-added network service (VANS) market. In 2004, the Commission referred the              position in
                  case to the Tribunal, having determined that Telkom had unlawfully sought to extend its monopoly             Internet access
                  rights by refusing to supply essential facilities (in the form of its fixed-line network) to independent     markets
                  VANS providers, inducing VANS providers’ customers not to deal with them (by approaching them
                  with claims of the illegality of the VANS model), charging their customers excessive prices for access
                  services, and discriminating in favor of its own customers by giving them a discount on distance-related
      South       charges that it did not advance to customers of the independent VANS providers.
      Africa      Between 2005 and 2007, five separate complaints against Telkom were submitted by the Internet
                  Service Providers’ Association and three other ISPs. In its investigation, the CCSA found that Telkom
                  had engaged in margin squeeze against ISPs by charging excessive prices for inputs; had refused to
                  lease essential facilities; and had engaged in anticompetitive conditional selling of managed network
                  services and Internet access services by bundling these products with access services that were priced
                  far lower than the equivalent access services that end customers would purchase when considering
                  the purchase of managed network services and Internet access from other operators. Telkom and the
                  CCSA agreed to settle the case and, as part of the settlement, Telkom admitted to contravention of
                  the Competition Act in regard to margin squeeze and anticompetitive bundling and tying of products.

                  The Competition Commission of Mauritius opened an investigation on the potentially exclusionary and          Abuse of
                  exploitative pricing conduct of two mobile telephony operators, Emtel and Orange. The major concern          dominant
      Mauritius
                  is that on-net/off-net price discrimination could be anticompetitive. Mobile termination rates are not       position in

                  Cell C lodged a complaint with the CCSA against Vodacom and MTC, alleging anticompetitive on-                Abuse of
                  net/off-net price discrimination on voice calls. According to Cell C, the alleged conduct discourages        dominant
      South
                  consumers from switching to smaller networks by creating a so-called “club-effect.” The ongoing              position in
      Africa

E. Anticompetitive behavior detected and sanctioned in Africa
Competition authorities across Africa have been fairly active in pursuing investigations in the
telecommunications sector. According to the ACF-WBG survey, Tunisia had the most investigations
in the past three years, totaling 12, of which eight resulted in sanctions.

F. The potential benefits of more dynamic telecom markets in Africa
Prices for mobile and Internet services are still high and affordability low in Africa, compared with
other regions, which indicates that increased competition would deliver benefits for consumers.
Based on data from 2015, Sub-Saharan African countries have the highest final prices for mobile
and fixed broadband services around the world. Moreover, prices for fixed broadband access
are 100 percent higher than those in the second-most expensive region, EAP. Although prices
of mobile services are not so high compared with other regions, it is clear that a gap remains in
the affordability of these services compared with regions such as MENA and EAP. The fact that
prices are generally cheaper for mobile than for fixed-line data can be explained by policy and
market failures: most African countries jumped straight to mobile networks without investing first
in connectivity. The consequence for many users is a second-class Internet: slow, expensive, and
rarely always on. Internet usage in Africa is the second-lowest among the regions, after South Asia
(World Bank 2016a). The affordability of mobile phones and the Internet is a key issue in Africa:
the median mobile phone owner in Africa spends nearly 3 percent of monthly income on mobile
phones and texting. In the Central African Republic, one month of Internet access costs more
than 1.5 times the annual per capita income (World Bank 2016c). Table C3-3 provides a detailed
comparison of average prices and the share of Internet usage among the world’s regions.

4.	Other key services with spillover effects across African economies


A. Air transport
Regulatory actions to encourage open and contestable markets will be essential for the African
air transport market to reach its potential. Growth-constraining factors, including high fares and
lower quality of service in the region, may be the result of a lack of competition. Based on public
information on the cheapest available price per km for a seven-day return trip, booked seven days
in advance, the Infrastructure Consortium for Africa (2014) report notes that “the price per km
for intra-European flights [is] significantly lower than African flights, over similar distances.” The
average intra-European fare price per km for the 26 analyzed routes is approximately two-thirds of
the average intra-African airfare. Limited competition in Africa is one of the possible explanatory
factors, as are higher operational per-passenger costs given the level of demand, and the level of
taxes and charges imposed by African States and airports. In most of the cases, weak competition
stems from the fact that firms' ability to enter and operate in the market is restricted by regulatory
barriers, while in other cases anticompetitive practices take place.

The nature of competition in the air transport sector is defined by different economic and
regulatory features. Air transport markets are generally defined by route. Routes can be domestic
or international, for short-haul and long-haul traffic. The sector exhibits economies of scope
and scale. The demand size and cost structure for these different routes, as well as the distinct
regulatory frameworks for each type of route, define different market features that give rise to
various competition issues.

In international routes, market concentration on a number of routes remains high and stable
over time; over a quarter of air routes in Africa continue to be served by only one carrier (AfDB
2013), but entry has been observed in some routes. Meanwhile, taking the EAC as an example,
more than half of the top intraregional routes (about 90 percent of the international traffic within
the EAC) are operated by only one carrier. Based on the ACF-WBG survey, eight out of 13 countries
surveyed had one firm with more than 50 percent market share in the international air transport
sector. Nevertheless, eight out of the 13 countries surveyed have seen entry in the last three years
in the international air transport sector, showing some degree of contestability.

Domestic routes are also concentrated, but some markets such as Kenya and South Africa have
seen entry by low-cost carriers. In the domestic air transport sector, all but one of the 13 surveyed
countries have one operator with more than 50 percent of the market and in some cases statutory
monopolies still exist. Seven countries have state-owned carriers dominating the market.

Regional efforts to open markets started more than 15 years ago, with 44 countries in Africa
signing the 1999 Yamoussoukro Decision (YD). The YD was intended to "open the skies" by
minimizing government involvement and allowing multilateral exchange of up to fifth freedom128
air traffic rights between any African country that is a signatory. The YD became fully binding in 2002,
but only a few countries have observed its principles—despite some positive results from Kenya,
South Africa, and the SADC on passenger volumes and fares on those routes that were opened

  	 Fifth freedom is the right to carry passengers from one's own country to a second country, and from that country to a third country.

      up in recent years. In addition to aspects that can be regulated with international agreements (like
      frequencies, number of providers, capacity, prices, and freedoms), national legislation on access
      to essential facilities at airports (such as landing slots, ground handling services, and fuelling), and
      procedures for licensing operators and authorizing their operations, affect competition dynamics.

      Competition law can also play a role in the assessment of mergers, abuse of dominance, or
      agreements among competitors in the sector. At least four competition authorities have handled
      cases related to the air transport industry. Most of these cases related to abuse of dominance
      in air transportation services and ancillary services such as fuelling. Alliances between airlines
      have also been analysed. In Cameroon and South Africa, competition authorities have penalized
      infringements to the competition law in this sector.

      B. Road transport
      Road freight rates in Africa are high and quality in terms of timeliness is limited. Regulations
      that reduce barriers to entry and allow for competition on the merits are expected to have a
      positive effect on the sector’s performance. Given that various actors intervene in the supply chain
      for end-to-end cargo transportation, the level of prices, quality of services, and performance of
      the sector depend on the functioning of various interlinked markets—trucking, freight forwarding,
      brokerage, warehousing, and cargo consolidation, among others. Traditionally, trucking services
      have been more heavily regulated. A recent study on competition in the road freight sector in
      Malawi, Tanzania, and Zambia found that implementation of procompetitive regulation would
      affect both the price and quality of service (Nleya 2014).

      Effective competition depends on factors that affect not only trucking but the whole transport
      and logistics value chain. Road cargo markets are generally defined by routes, and their competition
      characteristics vary by type of transported cargo (for instance, containerized, bulk dry, bulk liquid,
      and refrigerated). The degree of vertical integration of the transport and logistics supply chain
      also has an effect on market characteristics and competition issues. The buyer power of large
      users (importers, exporters) and the option of own-carriage of goods creates countervailing buyer
      power. Multimodal competition between road and railways can also be relevant above a certain
      transportation distance. In a few countries, waterways can also be a substitute.

      Road cargo transport markets in Africa are generally composed of various operators, but some
      restrictions exist on entry to operations in the domestic market. Based on the ACF-WBG survey,
      as far as market share is concerned, none of the respondents reported having one firm with more
      than 50 percent market share, and only Namibia and South Africa indicated the existence of state-
      owned enterprises operating in their road freight sector. Mauritius imposes some conditions
      on the number of firms allowed to operate in the sector based on a needs assessment. Based
      on the responses to the ACF-WBG survey, prices are generally unregulated, although in some
      cases (Malawi, Cameroon, others in West Africa) governments or associations still issue guidance
      on the level of prices. In some countries, freight allocation schemes that sustain market-sharing
      agreements are present as well.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



For international freight, bilateral agreements usually restrict the number of vehicles that are
allowed to provide services between two countries. A World Bank study (Kunaka et al. 2013)
evaluated 77 international bilateral road freight agreements and found that intra-Africa agreements
were the most restrictive, with four out of five of the most restrictive agreements being between
African countries. Moreover, implementation of some regional regulations affects competition
conditions in the road transport sector, particularly for international routes. In the context of the
SADC, implementation of certain regulations constrains the full development of regional transport
market. In ECOWAS, the Interstate Transport Convention allocates two-thirds of port freight
destined to inland countries to transporters from the destination country, affecting competition
on the merits in those routes. Examples of anticompetitive regulations in use in Africa include
regulations that limit which truckers shippers can use and banning of third-country trucking and
cabotage, which is common in West Africa. By contrast, in Southern Africa, there are no quotas or
queues, which allows direct contracting between shippers and transporters.

Competition authorities have not reported cases in road cargo transportation in the last two
years, but the Competition and Fair Trading Commission of Malawi is conducting an analysis of
regulatory restrictions and competition issues in the road transportation sector.

C. Retail
Low rates of formal retail, combined with urbanization and a bourgeoning middle class, implies
massive potential for growth in the retail sector in Africa. Moreover, due to its direct impact on
consumer welfare, it is an important sector for competition authorities to monitor.

In the ACF-WBG survey, both Botswana and South Africa pointed out significant competition
concerns in the retail sector. Tanzania, Kenya, Mauritius, Zambia, Morocco, and Namibia indicated
moderate competition concerns. Botswana flagged the involvement of professional bodies
in granting licenses or permits, as well as exclusivity in retail leases for shopping malls as two
significant concerns. South Africa also raised shopping mall lease exclusivity, which has been the
topic of a recent investigation, as a significant concern. In Mauritius, the Competition Commission’s
concerns pertain mainly to the pharmacy sector, where the regulations regarding applications for
entry are ambiguous on how to determine whether the requirement that an area is in need of an
additional pharmacy is fulfilled.

A number of competition authorities have been investigating anticompetitive practices in the
retail sector. As mentioned, in South Africa, an investigation found exclusive clauses in lease
agreements between mall landlords and the three biggest retail chains, although in this case
the CCSA was unable to show an anticompetitive effect. A case on exclusivity clauses in lease
agreements was also evaluated in Zambia. In Kenya, the CAK fined two retail stores for agreeing
to eliminate price competition between them. In 2010, Mauritius completed its first case on abuse
of monopoly in the market for block-processed cheddar cheese. The Seychelles undertook seven
investigations in the retail sector, though none resulted in sanctions being imposed. Namibia’s
Competition Authority received six complaints in the retail sector though none have resulted in a
formal investigation yet. Egypt investigated a case but did not find an infringement.

                                                                  C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



      In addition to investigations, some competition authorities have been advising the government
      on policy making in the sector in order to foster competition. Some have also reviewed mergers
      and acquisitions in order to prevent anticompetitive outcomes in the sector ex ante. Namibia,
      for instance, conducted a study that supported the government’s initiative of developing a retail
      charter to help strengthen the Namibian retail sector. In addition, South Africa is now pursuing
      an advocacy approach in response to the findings on exclusive clauses in mall lease agreements
      and has opened an inquiry in the sector. Mergers in the retail sector have been approved with
      modifications or conditions in Namibia (30 mergers in the last three years), South Africa, and Kenya.

      D. Energy
      With energy use rising in Sub-Saharan Africa, many governments are now intensifying their
      efforts to increase investment in the sector by tackling various regulatory and political barriers.
      Around 30 African countries have established independent electricity regulators. Some countries,
      including Kenya, Ghana, Nigeria, and Uganda, have also started privatizing some operations
      of their state-owned utilities, while others, including Tanzania, Namibia, and South Africa have
      remained with the state-ownership model.

      Given the continued dominance of state-owned utilities in the various segments of the electricity
      sector in Africa, competition issues are often related to competitive neutrality that affects power
      generation. Provisions that allow for independent power producers as well as conditions to allow
      large consumers to select their power provider are not prevalent in Africa. In some cases, state-
      owned enterprises or the whole sector fall outside the competition law. For example, in Egypt,
      public utilities are excluded from the scope of competition law, while in Mauritius, petroleum
      products as well as liquid petroleum gas are exempt from competition law.

      In the gas sector, concentration upstream has raised competition concerns in some countries
      in Africa. For instance, in South Africa, Sasol is virtually the only supplier and importer of natural
      gas. In 2009, the CCSA found evidence of market allocation and price-fixing arrangements with
      potential competitors. In addition, two other cases have been investigated in the gas sector, also
      involving Sasol. In Egypt, the competition authority has undertaken a study of the retail of natural
      gas. One issue that has been identified is the differential treatment of firms by the Egyptian
      Ministry of Petroleum in the sale of natural gas. The Egyptian authority also reported issues
      related to the limited number of licenses in oil assembling and refining, and noted that the state-
      owned petroleum corporation is responsible for all petroleum activities in Egypt, is party to all
      concession agreements, and is also entitled to a share of production once commercial discovery
      has been made. In Zambia, the Commission decided on an abuse of dominance matter regarding
      Puma Energy.

      There have also been a number of merger cases in the sector. Mergers have been approved
      without conditions in Botswana, Kenya, Tanzania, Zambia, and Morocco. In South Africa, between
      2005 and 2012, there were 25 mergers in the coal industry, of which 14 were large mergers. In 2011,
      the Tanzanian Fair Trade Commission approved the acquisition of 50 percent of BP Tanzania by
      Puma Energy.

C. Boosting Competition in Key Sectors in Africa



E. Tourism
Given the dispersed structure of the sector consisting in various markets that are relatively open
to competition, no significant competition issues have yet been reported by the respondents
to the ACF-WBG survey. However with a 300 percent increase in tourists arriving in Sub-Saharan
Africa since 1990, and an increasing role in country development strategies, it may become a
sector of greater focus for competition authorities.

Some moderate concerns have been reported by some countries, including restrictive concession
agreements for provision of hospitality services. Egypt, Kenya, Botswana, Tanzania, and The
Gambia noted this as a moderate concern in the ACF-WBG survey. The next-most-frequently
mentioned moderate concerns were restrictive requirements to obtain licenses and permits, and
restrictions on providers of tourist road transfers—each cited by three countries.

Competition authorities have carried out some activities in the sector. Botswana, Tunisia, and The
Seychelles have carried out investigations in the tourism sector, with Tunisia imposing one sanction.
The Gambia's competition authority completed a tourism market study in collaboration with The
Gambia's Tourism Board. In Egypt, the competition authority approached the Ministry of Tourism
and the Ministry of Civil Aviation regarding a recently adopted initiative to encourage domestic
tourism, which in fact favoured a state-owned enterprise at the expense of other competing,
privately owned companies. As a result, the initiative was altered to include private firms. In 2013–
14 there have been 15 mergers in this sector examined in Namibia, three in Botswana, as well as
two in Kenya and Tanzania. Competition problems can arise in markets connected to tourism value
chains, for example in passenger air transportation, tourism transport, and travel agencies.

D. The Way Forward

G    overnments can play an important role in encouraging competition in markets to get the
     most out of private sector participation. Areas of focus include enforcing competition laws
and implementing procompetition regulatory frameworks that can transform markets and generate
positive welfare distribution effects. Competition authorities play an essential role in these efforts
and are called to become champions of these reforms. Nonetheless, great efforts are needed
to show the gains of designing market regulations that incorporate competition principles and
reduce the prevalence of anticompetitive practices. Placing competition policy at the center of the
microeconomic reform agenda will enhance the benefits of other government policies targeted at
sustaining economic growth and shared prosperity.


Given that sources allocated to competition authorities are finite, strategic prioritization is key
for effectiveness and efficiency. In most of the cases, the legal framework is good enough to allow
competition authorities to perform their mandate, but implementation challenges and trade-offs in
the allocation of scarce resources are present. In general, authorities seem more active in merger
control than in investigation of anticompetitive practices, so it would be useful to discuss strategies
to transition to potentially more effective approaches. Collaboration with sector regulators and line
ministries is necessary to address sector-specific challenges that can have spillover effects across
the economy, such as those in fertilizers, cement, and telecommunications, highlighted in this
report. Actions in this advocacy area require not only technical tools but also political capital and
strategies to seek support from actors beyond the competition community. Market inquiries are a
tool for arriving at a common understanding of competition issues in sectors; therefore, focused
and in-depth analysis of market dynamics that provide implementable specific recommendations
could be an area in which resources could be pooled to address competition issues.


Regional initiatives can support regulatory changes to help strengthen competition authorities
and increase the effectiveness of competition policy. Given its coverage and mandate, the ACF is
a valuable actor in supporting a common understanding of regulatory frameworks and principles
for competition law enforcement. Regional communities can also perform a similar role in their
jurisdiction. Based on this report, the following areas deserve special attention:

   •	 Efficient merger control: refocusing resources toward transactions that are more likely to
      raise competition concerns and reducing undue administrative burdens, including adequate
      merger notification thresholds, fast-track and two-phase procedures, transparent and clear
      guidelines on public interest where this consideration is mandated, and mechanisms to
      support coordination between national and regional bodies.




Unlocking Africa’s Potential through Vigorous Competition Policy                                          127
                                                                                          D. The Way Forward



        •	 Effective anticartel enforcement: increasing deterrence of harmful practices through
           coordination of country authorities and regional analysis of detected practices that might affect
           more than one country; improving fining systems and maximum fine values; and adopting
           policies to facilitate case-work prioritization and increase the efficiency of enforcement.

      Given the challenges present in African markets, authorities will benefit from prioritizing the
      allocation of resources with a view to preventing the most harmful anticompetitive practices and
      using available powers and tools more effectively. In some cases, there is a need to revise fines
      to ensure an adequate effect on deterrence and to assess administrative procedures that could be
      increasing the administrative burden on firms and authorities.


      As shown by the analysis of the three core sectors, governments can take action to mitigate the
      risks of potential anticompetitive behavior in sectors. The interaction of industry characteristics,
      the degree of vertical integration, and the regulatory restrictions that apply to supply chains
      yield different dynamics in markets. Certain features can incentivize particular behaviors, such
      as collusion in cement and fertilizer markets and foreclosure in the telecommunications sector.
      Rules that make markets more open and contestable—by facilitating imports, supporting entry
      in production or operation, and giving all firms an opportunity to compete on common ground—
      would reduce concentration and dominance, and therefore the likelihood of anticompetitive
      practices. Based on the characteristics of certain markets and the past behavior of firms operating
      in the sector within the region, competition authorities can closely monitor certain markets.


      Support to advocate for the adjustment of policies and regulations that unnecessarily limit
      competition and facilitate anticompetitive practices in member economies can deliver
      important benefits. This could be achieved by creating smaller, more cohesive subgroups of
      competition authorities for countries with economic linkages that can jointly study competition
      issues in a subregion, benefit from peer-to-peer learning, and design implementable strategies to
      address competition problems. Extending outreach to a broader group of stakeholders, such as
      sectoral regulators, the business community, academia, and civil society would also broaden the
      constituency of competition supporters. In addition to promoting competition in certain sectors,
      advocacy for the integration of competition principles into the implementation of state aid and
      price controls could give competition authorities a more important role to play in the economic
      agenda. The ACF could certainly support these efforts in collaboration with various partners.


      Finally, competition authorities and partners could play a useful role in knowledge creation and
      exchange. It would be important for the ACF to continue carrying out competition analysis in
      domestic markets for related countries, as well as to expand its analysis of trade and competition
      to capture the regional angle given that market players make regional business decisions, and
      to prepare a strategy for supporting the implementation of key recommendations. Countries
      with an incipient competition culture would benefit from the experiences of other countries in
      the region to show that competition matters for the effectiveness of government policies. The
      ACF could be a useful forum for exchanging this type of information: valuable enforcement and

advocacy experiences as well as studies that quantify the benefits of competition. Moreover, given
the importance of encouraging research on competition in the region and the limited availability
of systematized information on competition across countries, partners could help to collate and
disseminate relevant information, which would be of use not only to ACF members, but also to
researchers, policy makers, and development partners.

      Supply and Demand Characteristics of the
      Cement Production Chain
      Structural barriers to entry that facilitate abuse of dominance or collusion by
      reinforcing dominance or high market concentrations
      The following structural supply-side characteristics are generally acknowledged to reinforce
      the dominance of one firm or a small group of firms in a market. Dominance and high market
      concentration in turn increase the risk that abuse of dominance or collusion may occur.

        •	 Economies of scale and capital intensity: Establishment of a limestone quarry and
           construction of a clinker or cement plant are highly capital intensive. This capital intensity
           is enhanced by the scale economies characterizing the entire cement production chain.
           The minimum efficient cement production plant is between approximately 1 million and
           2.5 million tons per year, with start-up costs of approximately $300 million. (Mbongwe et al.
           2014). Plants operating below the so-called minimum efficient size face a considerable cost
           disadvantage compared to their competitors.

        •	 Reliance on scarce resources:

           o	 Limestone is the essential base input for cement and typically comprises 85 percent of
              the raw material input of cement. As a result, cement factories are often integrated with
              limestone quarrying operations, in order to reduce operating costs. Investors will seek
              locations with access and ease of extraction for cement plants. The size of the deposit is
              also important, and most plants are built near deposits that can supply the plant for its
              full 30-year life span. Unlike mineral inputs for fertilizer, limestone deposits are relatively
              abundant in Africa.
           o	 Energy is the second-greatest input into cement production (particularly the production
              of clinker). In some countries, firms are beginning to vertically integrate into coal mining
              in order to reduce energy costs. While nonvertically integrated firms are not necessarily
              prohibited from entering the market as long as they have access to limestone and energy
              at market prices, clearly integrated access to a source of raw materials and energy would
              confer an important cost advantage to vertically integrated firms.


        •	 Bulky product: The bulkiness of limestone, clinker, and the final cement product poses
           high costs for the road transportation of inputs and outputs. This has two implications.

         o	 The unfavorable ratio between weight and value in output markets for the final product
            discourages transportation by road over long distances so that, in some cases, producers
            tend to serve regionally close (including cross-border) markets, rather than national
            markets. For example, Lafarge (2007) puts the maximum radius at which a typical
            cement plant can remain competitive at 300 kilometers over land.129 Cement plants with
            waterborne shipping lanes, on the other hand, have a much greater competitive radius.

Supply-side characteristics: other factors that facilitate collusion
Other than high concentrations, collusion is facilitated by several other factors that increase
firms’ ability to coordinate. These can be divided into general and country-specific factors.


General factors that apply to the cement supply chain across countries include:

         1.	 Product homogeneity. While cement can be blended with an extender material to
             produce different strengths or colors, the different blends are generally considered to be
             substitutable for each other. While product homogeneity and high substitutability have
             the potential to lead to more intense price competition, they can also increase the risk of
             collusion since it is easier to reach an agreement on market outcomes.

         2.	 Similar cost structures in production make it easier for firms to coordinate and agree
             on a profit-maximizing price or output. Given that technology for cement production is
             mature and stable, firm costs are likely to be symmetric along the value chain.


Country-specific supply-side factors that can facilitate collusion would need to be assessed on
a case-by-case basis. These include excess capacity, multimarket contact, cross-ownership and
cross-directorships between firms, and mechanisms to facilitate explicit and tacit communication,
such as the presence of product-specific trade associations.

Demand-side characteristics
Given the high degree of vertical integration between limestone mining and clinker production,
and given that this report covers the segments of the cement market preceding wholesale or
retail supply, the most relevant buyers’ market to analyze is the demand for clinker from grinding
plants that are not vertically integrated backward into limestone mining or clinker production.
The following characteristics of buyers of clinker determine whether they have sufficient power
to lessen the ability or incentives of supplying firms to act in an anticompetitive way, or whether
demand characteristics in fact facilitate that behavior. These factors include the following:

      •	 Inelastic demand: Final demand for cement is usually considered to be inelastic (Competition
         Commission UK date; Boyer and Ponssard 2013). From this, it can be inferred that the
         demand for clinker from cement producers should be relatively inelastic.



  	 It has been argued however that this geographic segmentation of markets is less pronounced in countries with cement shortages and
129

    high prices, since the greater value of the product compensates for the high transportation cost. It might be argued that this applies to
    many African countries; at the same time, however, this effect is counteracted by the high cost of transportation due to poor overland
    infrastructure.

      •	 Stable demand: Since demand for cement is driven primarily by the construction industry,
         which is correlated with growth, in the medium to long term, demand for cement is likely to
         grow at a predictable pace in most countries. In the shorter term, however, demand may be
         susceptible to the cyclical nature of the economy in general and of construction in particular.

      •	 Buyer power: There are likely to be only a few large buyers of clinker in the market, with
         relatively large purchase volumes. This will confer some buyer power on cement producers
         to counteract market power from clinker suppliers.

      •	 Switching costs: These would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for a precise
         assessment, but in general, industrial buyers may be more constrained in their ability to
         switch than downstream retail and farm buyers, for example, by long-term contracts with
         suppliers or by the need to specify the source of their inputs in their manufacturing licenses.

      •	 Scope for backward integration: Large buyers of clinker should be able to integrate
         backward into import, unless there are import regulations or tariffs in place that limit this
         practice. While in some countries it would theoretically be possible for cement producers to
         integrate into production of primary materials, this will be affected by the availability of lime
         resources and the regulatory framework around limestone mining licenses.

      Structural barriers to entry that may reinforce dominance or high market
      concentration
      The following structural supply-side characteristics are generally acknowledged to reinforce the
      dominance of one firm or a small group of firms in a market. Dominance and high concentration
      in turn increase the risk that abuse of dominance or collusion may occur.

            •	 Economies of scale and capital intensity: Economies of scale are present throughout
               the value chain, particularly in the production of primary materials and straight fertilizer.
               Achieving these economies of scale requires significant up-front investment in capacity.
               For example:

               o 	 Straight fertilizer plants producing more than 500,000 metric tons (mt) of product generate
                   substantial economies of scale in production (Bumb, Johnson, and Fuentes 2011).
               o	 Bulk blending factories also display economies of scale, but are usually smaller than plants
                  producing straight fertilizer and local to the area where the fertilizers will be applied.
                  Investment costs for plant establishment are usually relatively small, as less equipment is
                  required than for straight production (Formisanin.d.).
               o	 Import of fertilizers also displays economies of scale, with bulk purchases and transport
                  being more cost effective than importing small quantities. Shipments of 25,000 to 50,000
                  mt generate economies in prices and shipping (Bumb, Johnson, and Fuentes 2011).130
               o	 Economies of scale in wholesale are likely to be lower than those for import.

            •	 Reliance on scarce resources: Straight fertilizer production—via production of intermediate
               products—requires a significant number of scarce raw materials (gas and minerals),
               constituting 70–90 percent of cash production costs (Hernandez and Torero 2013).131
               Production of complex fertilizers, on the other hand, can make use of imported straight
               fertilizer and therefore relies less on scarce resources.

            •	 Bulky product: The value to transport costs ratio of outputs is low along the value chain
               but is lower further the upstream the product, meaning that it tends to be more efficient to
               process primary materials and intermediate products in more concentrated locations. This
               is particularly true of phosphorous, as opposed to nitrogen.


      Supply-side characteristics: other factors that facilitate collusion
      Other than high concentration, collusion is facilitated by several other factors that can be divided
      into general and country-specific factors. General factors that apply to the fertilizer supply chain
      across countries include:

            •	 Product homogeneity within a particular nutrient group with similar attributes regardless of
               where they are produced. Whilst product homogeneity and high substitutability have the
               potential to lead to more intense price competition, it can also increase the risk of collusion
               since it is easier to i) reach agreement on the collusive
      130
         	 On the other hand, five have reduced the number of competitors: the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, Madagascar, and Sierra
           Leone moved from four to three players, and Namibia from three to two. Figure C3-7 summarizes the evolution of the market structure
           in terms of the number of suppliers per country, between 2010 and 2015.
      131
         	 For example, natural gas represents 72–85 percent of the costs of producing ammonia (Huang 2007).

Annex 2



      •	 Similar cost structures in production make it easier for firms to coordinate and agree on a
         profit maximizing price or output. Given that technology for fertilizer production is mature
         and stable, and since the products being produced are relatively homogenous, firm costs
         are likely to be symmetric along the value chain.

Country-specific supply-side factors that can facilitate collusion would need to be assessed on a
case-by-case basis. These include excess capacity, multimarket contact, cross-ownership and links
between firms, and explicit and tacit communication.

Demand-side characteristics
The characteristics of buyers and their demand at each level of the value chain help determine
whether they have sufficient power to lessen the ability or incentives of supplying firms to act in
an anticompetitive way, or whether demand characteristics in fact facilitate that behavior. These
factors include:

      •	 Inelastic demand: Generally, demand is inelastic for buyers along the value chain.132
          Producers of straight fertilizers and complex fertilizers are relatively restricted in the inputs
          they use for production, as well as the locations from which they can viably source inputs
          given the high costs of transportation. Farther downstream, there may be slightly higher
          elasticity from retailers or farmers if different product formulations or brands can be used
          in the same context. This will depend on agronomic practices, farmers’ knowledge and
          ability to switch between formulations, and whether there are regulations in place that limit
          permitted formulations (see section C2-C for more details). On the other hand, smaller buyers
          will be more restricted in the geographic markets from which they can source materials..
      •	 Stable demand: The fertilizer industry is relatively stable and growing at a predictable pace,
         making the maintenance of an anticompetitive agreement relatively easy.
      •	 Buyer power: Upstream industrial buyers, such as producers of straight or complex fertilizers,
         are likely to have more buyer power to counteract supplier market power than smaller
         downstream buyers such as retailers or farmer groups. In general, the larger the number of
         dispersed buyers and the smaller the order value, the lower the buyer power.
      •	 Switching costs: These would need to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis for a precise
         assessment, but in general, industrial buyers may be more constrained in their ability to
         switch than downstream retail and farm buyers, for example, by long-term contracts with
         suppliers or by the need to specify the source of their inputs in their manufacturing licenses.
      •	 Scope for backwards integration: If firms are able to integrate backward into supply of an
         input in response to anticompetitive behavior from upstream firms, it will limit the scope of
         upstream firms to act in an anticompetitive manner. Large industrial or wholesale buyers of
         fertilizers—that is, fertilizer producers, wholesalers, and large agricultural groups—should be
         able to integrate backward into import, unless there are import regulations or tariffs in place
         that limit this practice. While in some countries it would theoretically be possible for fertilizer
         producers to integrate into production of primary materials, this is less likely given the scarcity
         of these materials and the degree of exclusivity typically given in licenses for their use.
  	 For example, areview of the literature synthesizing this research during the 1970s suggests that farmers’ demand for fertilizer was more
132

    responsive to changes in output prices than to changes in fertilizer prices, with estimates of the price elasticity of fertilizer demand
    generally amounting to less than one,ranging from -0.17 to -2.03 due to variability across countries and differences in modeling
    specifications (Timmer 1974, 1976).
