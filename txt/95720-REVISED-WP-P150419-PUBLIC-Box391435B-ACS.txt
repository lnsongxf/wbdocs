This report is a companion piece presenting the findings of the Access to Justice research and analysis
carried out to inform the Serbia Judicial Functional Review, which analyzes functioning of institutions of
the Serbian justice system to provide an objective and data rich basis for Serbia’s EU accession
negotiations under the Chapter 23 of the Aquis Communautaire. The data collection and analysis was
done throughout 2014. This report was funded by the World Bank and the Multi Donor Trust Fund for
Justice Sector Support (MDTF-JSS), established with generous contributions from the EU Delegation in
Serbia, the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID), the Swedish
International Development Cooperation Agency (SIDA), Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, Slovenia,
Spain, and Switzerland. More information about the trust fund is available at www.mdtfjss.org.rs.

The report was prepared by a World Bank Team composed of Mr. Klaus Decker (Senior Public Sector
Specialist and Task Team Leader), Ms. Georgia Harley (Justice Reform Specialist) and Mr. Srdjan Svircev
(Public Sector Specialist). The field research was carried out by IPSOS Consulting and the Belgrade
Center for Human Rights. The team worked in close consultation with Mr. Tony Verheijen (Country
Manager for Serbia) and under the general guidance of Ms. Ellen Goldstein (Country Director) and Mr.

Executive Summary
Lack of affordability is the most serious barrier to access to justice services in Serbia. Court and
attorney costs represent a significant proportion of average income in Serbia. Pursuing even a simple
case is unaffordable for many. Citizens do their best to avoid the courts: nearly 63% of the general public
reported that, if they had a dispute which they thought should be settled in the court, they would
decide against pursuing it; and fear of costs was the most common deterrent. Over half of recent court
users surveyed considered the court-related costs in their particular case to have been excessive. The
schedules for court and attorney fees are also quite complex, so court users struggle to estimate likely
costs.1

Lack of affordability of justice services also causes a drag on the business climate. Over one-third of
businesses with recent experience in court cases reported that the court system is a great obstacle for
their basic business operations, and an additional 30 percent reported that courts are a moderate
obstacle. Businesses also report that the courts are becoming increasingly inaccessible to them due to
high court and attorney fees. Small businesses face particularly challenges in navigating the court
system, including high costs, cumbersome processes, lengthy delays, inadequate enforcement, and
constantly changing legislation.

On further examination however, it is not absolute costs to users but perceived value for money
which undermines access to justice. Although court users complain about costs (and non-users report
that costs deter them), the Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey found that recent court users who were
satisfied with the quality of services delivered were far less likely to consider the costs to be excessive.2
These data therefore suggest that improvements in quality and efficiency in service delivery could
improve access to justice, by increasing the perceived value for money for potential court users, while
also improving user satisfaction.

Attorneys play an important role in helping court users to navigate the system, but their fee structure
is out of step with European practice and creates perverse incentives which undermine access to
justice and efficiency and quality and service delivery.3 Self-represented litigants struggle to proceed
alone without lay formats, checklists or practical guides, and unsurprisingly therefore, they are less likely
to succeed. Attorneys are paid per hearing or motion, which encourages protracted litigation. Fees are
awarded based on a prescribed Attorney Fee Schedule, which prohibits from charging less than 50
percent of the rates prescribed. This arrangement is out of step with European practice.4 Serbia’s
prescribed fees are also highly inflated and unrealistic, and in practice many attorneys charge less than
the mandatory minimum because rates are beyond user willingness to pay. State-appointed attorneys

1 There is also a cap on court fees, which distorts incentives by encouraging court users to pursue
unmeritorious claims in high-value cases.
2 75 percent of court users who reported low quality of services also reported that the costs were excessive;

while the 29 percent of court users who reported that quality was high did not consider the costs to be
excessive.
3 71 percent of citizens with court experience found attorney-related costs to be one of the most

insurmountable barriers to access to the judicial system.
4 The European Court of Justice has held that mandatory minimum fees violate the EC Treaty. Further, 42 of

the 47 countries monitored by the CEPEJ allow free negotiation between lawyers and clients.

                                                     5
(known as ex-officio attorneys) may be appointed for indigent clients but there are concerns regarding
the mechanism for their selection and a lack of quality control.

A court fee waiver is available for indigent court users but its implementation is haphazard, resulting
in inconsistent access to justice for the indigent. There is very limited understanding among the public
of the court fee waiver program. There are no guidelines or standardized forms for judges who grant a
waiver and their decisions go unmonitored. Stakeholders report that some Court Presidents informally
discourage their judges from waiving fees, as fees are a source of revenue for courts. Waivers may
improve access to justice in some areas but without data its impact cannot be monitored.

Legal aid programs are provided by an incomplete patchwork of services across the country. Municipal
Legal Aid Centers cover around one-third of the country and around one-half of Serbia’s total
population. Yet, most citizens are unaware of any free legal services that might be provided in their
municipality.

Reforms are currently underway to expand legal aid in line with EU practice by providing both
‘primary legal aid’ (legal information and preliminary advice) and ‘secondary’ (legal representation) to
the poor and certain vulnerable groups. While the aims of the reform are admirable, there remains a
high risk that these laws, like other reforms in recent years, will become ‘stillborn’ if fiscal and
operational implications are not carefully planned or if implementation arrangements are weak. Despite
several years of deliberation in working groups, there remain some concerns with the latest draft of the
law. The current draft creates a bias in favor of secondary legal aid, to be provided predominantly by
attorneys, while doing little to encourage primary legal aid, which would be provided by CSOs, municipal
legal aid centers, and law faculties. Yet, the efficient delivery of primary legal services is likely to have
the greatest benefit in terms of increasing access to justice for the largest numbers of Serbian citizens
and could be delivered at much lower unit costs. It will be important to ensure that primary legal aid is
adequately funded and delivered consistently throughout the country. Meanwhile, proposals for
secondary legal aid could be considered more cautiously. A Fee Schedule will also need to be developed
for the compensation of service providers for both primary and secondary aid. Based on previous
analysis, the fees for these services should be far lower than the current Attorney Fee Schedule.5 Quality
assurance mechanisms will also be required and this is another area of high implementation risk.

Recent legislative amendments seek to promote mediation but there are significant implementation
challenges. Due in large part to previously failed reforms, there is limited awareness of mediation
among judges, attorneys, court staff, and court users. Among those who are aware of mediation
services, few report it to be a useful means of dispute resolution. A significant outreach initiative to
potential court users will be required, along with intensive training for judges, prosecutors, lawyers, and
court staff. Further incentives should be built in to the institutional framework to encourage the use of
mediation and integrate it into the court system.




5 Further analysis will be required to ensure that service delivery arrangements provide sufficient incentive
for high-quality service delivery without inflating costs or creating distortions in the market.

                                                     6
Awareness of law and practice is limited, even among professionals. Judges, prosecutors, and lawyers
struggle to conduct research and keep abreast of new legislation, cases, procedures, and practices.
Before 2014, the only legal databases with consolidated legislation were maintained by private
companies on paid subscription basis. Few courts publish their court decisions, so access to these even
among judges is very limited. On a positive note, the Official Gazette recently launched a free online
database, and this should improve access to legislation. Efforts to raise awareness and build the capacity
among professionals to conduct legal research could reap significant rewards in terms of consistency of
practice across the jurisdiction.

Among the public, awareness of law and practice is even more limited. Continuous changes in
legislation and scarce outreach of reforms combine to prevent the public from understanding their
rights and obligations, or how to uphold them in court. Businesses report that access to laws – and
frequent changes in legislation and regulations – causes uncertainty that affects their business
operations. A significant injection of outreach and awareness-raising of legal reforms among the public,
particularly among potential court users, is required. Existing court users also struggle to access
information related to their own case. Examples exist in Croatia and elsewhere of court portals which
could be applied in Serbia to enable court users to access information related to their case in a manner
consistent with privacy laws.

Women experience the judicial system differently from men in a few ways. Women report more than
men that justice services are inaccessible. More often than men, women find attorney fees to be cost-
prohibitive. Women are also more likely to experience barriers to access to justice and inefficiencies in
justice service delivery because they are more likely to be parties to certain types of cases, such as
custody disputes and gender-based violence, which exhibit specific problems relating to procedural
abuse and delay.

Equality of access for vulnerable groups poses specific challenges. The majority of citizens surveyed
reported that the judiciary is equally accessible regardless of age, socio-economic status, nationality,
disability, and language. However, those citizens who are over 60 years of age, live in rural areas or have
the least amount of education find the judicial system particularly inaccessible, suggesting that targeted
interventions are warranted. Individuals with intellectual and mental health disabilities experience
serious disadvantage through the process by which they are deprived of their legal capacity. Members
of the Roma community, refugees and internally displaced persons also report low awareness of their
rights, as well as concerns regarding fair treatment before the courts. For these groups, there is a case
for strengthening the dissemination of information to relevant CSOs and community leaders about the
functioning of the judiciary and basic legal rights. The experience of the LGBT community is slightly
different: though they appear more than the abovementioned groups to be aware of their legal rights,
they remain deterred from filing cases due to fear of reprisal and perceived discrimination.

Introduction
This report aims at identifying the particular needs and constraints faced by the poorest women and
men when accessing the judicial system. Similarly to the Judicial Functional Review,6 the scope of this
report focuses primarily on the courts because they are the main vehicle for justice service delivery and
the primary institutions of justice in Serbia. The scope includes all types of services and covers litigious
and non-litigious aspects of civil, commercial, administrative, and criminal justice. The focus is on the
actual implementation and day-to-day functioning of the sector institutions that deliver justice to
people, rather than the ‘law on the books’. The scope includes other institutions in the sector to the
extent that they enable or impede service delivery by the courts, including: the Ministry of Justice
(MOJ), the High Judicial Council (HJC), the State Prosecutorial Council (SPC), the courts, the Public
Prosecutor Offices (PPOs), the Judicial Academy, the Ombudsperson’s Office, the police, prisons, and
justice sector professional organizations (such as the Bar, notaries, bailiffs, and mediators).

The focus of this report is on access to justice services, including relevant financial, informational, and
geographic barriers to such access.7 In the EU accession process, the EC emphasizes the importance of
enhanced access in justice system reform, and relevant European standards detail how effective access
requires a fair and speedy trial, certain and swift enforcement procedures, access to legal
representation, and the promotion of alternative dispute resolution mechanisms. This report views
access via a series of dimensions, such as geographic, informational, and financial. Within that frame,
this Report focuses on core needs that would address the most significant barriers to access for the poor
and vulnerable groups while meeting minimum European requirements.

The available quantitative data presents challenges for any performance analysis, in particular in the
area of access to justice. Within the broader context of the Functional Review, significant amounts of
quantitative data from within the Serbian system were obtained and analyzed.8 They cover the period
from 2010 to 2014. In Serbia, much of the relevant and available data originates in case management
systems and in human resources and finance systems.9 The good news is that the data environment in


6 The Judicial Functional Review is published separately and available at www.mdtfjss.org.rs.
7 In lay terms, ‘justice’ is often perceived as a broader concept stretching beyond the determination of
disputes settled through formal mechanisms to encompass concepts such as human rights protection and
social justice. It may also refer to access to non-judicial bodies, such as ombudspersons, or to grievance and
complaint mechanisms related to the delivery of government services. Those broader concepts, important as
they are, fall outside the scope of this Report.
8 The quantitative data underlying the Functional Review was consolidated in a Mega Table. Existing

qualitative data was gathered in a desk review report. Both are published and available at
www.mdtfjss.org.rs.
9 The Functional Review relies on caseload, financial and human resources data from the SCC, including for

the 2013 calendar year. The HJC has created a dashboard system, BPMIS, which collects some of the same
data as well as some resource management information not collected in the reports submitted to the SCC. For
example, BPMIS contains information the age and condition of ICT and other equipment and specific data
about the use of contractual services, divided into a) experts, b) attorneys and c) professional services. These
additional data fields allow for more rigorous analysis of resource needs. However, because BPMIS was only
implemented in 2013, it does not allow for comparison with data from 2011-2012, also relied upon in the
functional review. In addition, differences in caseload data between that submitted by the courts to the SCC
and that submitted by them to the HJC suggest that there are data errors in BPMIS. In part, this is because

                                                       8
the Serbian judiciary is richer than ever before. One of the challenges with data is that information is
captured in a non-systematic and inconsistent manner, and is not conducive to analytical work. Also,
much of the data gathering is made in an ad-hoc fashion with much duplication and occasional errors,
requiring considerable data processing and triangulation.

Serbia’s system for registering case data records a large amount of information but unfortunately
does not work to its anticipated capacity. Databases are still localized at the court level and the
exchange of information among them is not automatic, requiring manual inputting of data transferred
from one court to another. This transfer duplicates work, is time-consuming, reduces efficiency, and
introduces errors. There is a centralized database managed by the SCC and another, the Budget Planning
and Management Information System (BPMIS), recently introduced by the HJC. Both consolidate
statistical reports sent periodically by the individual court units.
This arrangement presents several challenges to any assessment of performance. First, any analysis in
the context of the Functional Review depends on the pre-determined standard statistical reports
submitted to the HJC and the SCC. Therefore, it is exceedingly difficult to run advanced reports for in-
depth analysis without requesting all Courts to provide relevant data, suggesting that statistical reports
are either not carried out or not effectively so. Also, the existing systems do not help checking for
validity of submissions or entries at the court level. As a result, the data contain numerous yet minor
errors, and only an audit of courthouses could help identify the correct data, a task well beyond the
scope of this Report. Third, some Courts do not provide the required reports, submit them late, or send
information that is visibly incomplete.
System data tend not capture unmet needs and things that do not come to the system. This presents
particular challenges to a data-based analysis of obstacles to access to justice. Data from within the
system was therefore supplemented by extensive survey data. Most European Courts commission user
surveys to gauge user perspectives on performance aspects. In Serbia however, court user surveys are
not conducted within the system. To fill this gap, the World Bank carried out a series of perception-
based surveys.

The Multi-Stakeholder Justice Surveys 2009/2010 and 2013 measure perception on a range of issues,
including perceptions of access, timeliness, costs, quality, and experiences of corruption. The original
2009/2010 survey was replicated and in 2013. The follow-up survey measured progress against the
baseline and was also expanded to include new questions. Each survey has a representative sample of
over 6,000 respondents. Respondents include general populations (divided into users and non-users),
managers of private sector enterprises (divided into users and non-users), lawyers, judges, prosecutors,
and administrative staff. From the two surveys, tens of thousands of data points now exist on a range of
issues relevant to perceptions of justice in Serbia, and developments can be compared against the 2009
baseline.10



data entry in BPMIS is manual and after statistical data is submitted to the SCC by the courts. Courts report
that they made adjustments to some of their initially submitted data when providing it to the HJC for BPMIS.
10 The survey report is published separately and available at www.mdtfjss.org.rs.


                                                     9
A two-part Access to Justice Survey carried out in 2013 was an effort to overcome the challenges
commonly associated with collecting and analyzing data on access to justice. First, face-to-face
interviews were conducted with a representative sample of 1,003 respondents in their households
across 67 municipalities and 127 local communities in both suburban and urban settings. Respondents
discussed the kinds of disputes they and their households experienced, whether they considered taking
them to court, and what deters them from using court services. Second, focus group discussions were
conducted to gain a deeper understanding of behaviours, attitudes, and motives from specific target
populations including economically active urbanites, rural farmers, owners of micro and small private
enterprises, and members of LGBT populations. The focus groups consisted of 90-minute rounds with
eight participants per session.
Since access to justice de facto tends to be more challenging for poor people than de jure, the World
Bank also produced a series of Process Maps.11 A Process Map measures the number and type of
procedural steps that court users are required to take for a particular type of case to be decided from
the beginning until a first-instance merits decision – both under the law (a de jure map) and in practice
(a de facto map) – and then compares the two. Researchers mapped out de jure and de facto case
processing for four particular procedures relevant to poor women and men in particular: a divorce
proceeding, a domestic violence case, an eviction case, and the enforcement of a utility bill. Expert
assessments were made based on the key informant interviews and with legal experts and practitioners
specializing in the case type in question.

Access to Justice in Serbia Seen Through Cross-Country Data
In comparison with the rest of Europe, Serbia appears to have a problem with access to justice.
According to the World Justice Project’s Rule of Law Index 2014, Serbia ranks the lowest among the EU
and non-EU neighboring countries in terms of accessibility and affordability of the civil justice system
(see graphs below).

According to a 2014 Access to Justice Survey, citizens do what they can to avoid the court system.
Nearly 63 percent of respondents indicated that, had they had a dispute that they thought should be
settled in court, they would nevertheless decide against pursuing it or would seriously consider not
doing so. Court and lawyer costs, concerns about likely delay in court proceedings, and lack of trust in
the judicial system are the primary reasons cited as deterring individuals from using court services. In
the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, members of the public with experience in the court system
cited similar concerns with access to justice.

Notably, members of the public with court experience expressed greater concern with nearly every
aspect of court accessibility than those without court experience. This suggests that improving access
to justice requires going beyond merely demystifying courts or raising awareness about access to court
services. Rather, it requires efforts that substantively address the barriers actually experienced by court
users. Each of the reasons that citizens cite is addressed in this report.

Affordability of Justice Services

Financial access to the court system is the largest barrier to access to justice for most Serbians. Data
gathered in the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey provide an insight into the actual costs people
face. The average total costs as reported by court users including all court fees, lawyer’s fees, and travel
costs (but not including fines) are as follows:

 Misdemeanor Cases                                                  150EUR
 Civil Cases                                                        550EUR
 Criminal Cases                                                     550EUR
 Cases involving business representatives                         1,800EUR


On further examination, however, it is not absolute costs but perceived value-for-money which drives
court users’ concerns. Findings of the 2013 Access to Justice Survey highlight the clear relationship
between access to justice and quality of services delivered. Whilst court users complain about the costs
of going to court, they are far more willing to pay if they are satisfied with the quality of justice services
delivered. As shown in the figure below, 75 percent of court users who report that the quality of services
they received was low also reported that the costs were excessive. By contrast, the 29 percent of court
users who reported that quality was high considered the costs to be excessive.

and access. Users who experience a lengthy time to resolution are likely to have paid more and be less
satisfied with the service. By contrast, users who receive a prompt high-quality service are more likely to
be satisfied and to perceive value in that service.

Justice services entail many individual costs to the user. The section below examines court-related
costs, lawyer-related costs, and specific financial access issues facing lower-income Serbians, including
court fee waivers, court-appointed attorneys, and legal aid.

Serbia does not have a system of private insurance for legal costs, so court users must pay fees out-of-
pocket. Serbia is among only 13 countries monitored by the CEPEJ where such a system does not exist.14



Affordability of Court Fees
Court fees are set out in the Law on Court Fees.15 Fees are based on the stated value of the claim, up
to a cap of 97,000 RSD.16 Fees are paid on every motion submitted,17 every decision rendered,18 and
every court settlement reached in all litigious processes and commercial disputes. In uncontested
proceedings, a nominal fee of 390RSD applies in some instances, though higher fees apply for
uncontested processes involving property, such as inheritance procedures or division of property. Fees
are also charged in criminal cases initiated by a private party, and Serbia is one of only eight countries
monitored by the CEPEJ that charges such fees.19

Court users cite the court-related costs as a considerable obstacle to access to the judicial system in
Serbia. In the 2014 Access to Justice Survey, focus groups stressed that court processes (particularly
litigation) are considered very expensive even by educated citizens in Belgrade who are active in the
economy. In the 2009 and 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Surveys, the public with experience in court
proceedings identified court costs as the most significant constraint as well. (See Table below.)




14 See CEPEJ Evaluation Report, 2014 (based on 2012 data). Six EU Member States lack such a system,
including Croatia, Ireland, Latvia, Malta and Romania. A further six countries that report data to CEPEJ lack a
system, including Armenia, Macedonia, Moldova, Montenegro, Russia and Turkey.
15 Law on Court Fees (Official Gazette of the Republic of Serbia No. 28/94 ).
16 Fees range from 1,900 to 97,500 RSD in litigation and executive procedures, and 3,900 to 390,000 RSD in

disputes before commercial courts. Fees are periodically amended for inflation or changes in currency
exchange rates. In 2014, for instance, if the value of a claim is 10,000 RSD, a lawsuit fee will be 19 percent of
that amount. If 100,000 RSD, the fee will be 5.9%, 3.93 percent for 1 million RSD, and 0.00975 percent for 10
million RSD. Regardless of the value of the claim, the fee cannot exceed 97,500 RSD before civil courts, and
390,000 RSD before commercial courts. Criminal proceedings not initiated by the Prosecutor also incur fees,
though these are below 1,000 RSD.
17 E.g., initial claim, answer to the claim, counter-charges in litigious cases and in commercial disputes, motion

for execution, securing of a debt, appeal, appeal for revision, and appeal for retrial.
18 E.g., first instance judgment, decision in trespass cases, decision on the dismissal of the claim or motion for

execution, decision of the first instance court on the dismissal of the appeal.
19 See CEPEJ Evaluation Report , 2014. Court fees are charged to commence private prosecutions in Croatia,

Cyprus, Greece, Monaco, Montenegro, Portugal and Switzerland.

Notably, businesses report that the courts are becoming increasingly inaccessible to them due to high
costs.20 In 2013, nearly 20 percent more businesses without court experience reported that court costs
impact their access to courts compared with 2009. Approximately 7 percent more business entities with
court experience reported in 2013 that court costs impeded accessibility than in 2009.

Half of the public and business representatives surveyed considered court-related costs in their
particular case to have been excessive. These figures remain approximately the same as from 2009,
except in misdemeanor cases. The Misdemeanor Court is increasingly unaffordable to users. In
comparison with those who did not have experience with a court case, a considerably higher percentage
of experienced citizens cite high costs, suggesting that perceptions of high fees are not a myth but based
on the experience of users.

The majority of survey respondents state that costs of their own court case represented a burden on
their personal budget. Compared to 2009, these figures remained constant with the exception of
misdemeanor cases where, in 2013, a higher percentage of users stated that costs of their court case
were a significant burden on their budget.

These perceptions are rooted in reality, particularly for those from less affluent parts of the country.
As seen in Table 1 below, court fees for a divorce case, among the least costly in terms of court fees,
would require the average person in Novi Pazar to pay 76 percent of their monthly net income in court
fees alone. When attorney fees are included, even at the commonly discounted rate, the Novi Pazar
resident would be required to pay nearly five times (523 percent) of their monthly net income to cover
the total costs of the case. While a much wealthier Belgrade resident would pay only 20 percent of their
average monthly net income in court fees for a divorce proceeding, once attorney fees are included,
costs for a divorce would exceed the average Belgrade resident’s monthly net income.

claims, exploit procedural inefficiencies or mount frivolous appeals. This anomaly could be rectified by
removing the cap and simplifying the court fee structure based on the percentage of the claim.

Timing of Court Fees and Related Expenses
The Law on Civil Procedure envisages that each party pays court fees before they submit an initial
claim or answer. The court will not suspend litigation for failure to pay fees; however, many potential or
unseasoned court users may not be aware of the rule. In any event, the existence of significant upfront
fees may deter access to the courts.

While court users report that the highest percentage of the overall costs of court proceedings relate to
court fees, litigants may incur other significant costs. These include expert witness fees, witness
expenses,25 translation costs, and costs of placing ads on the court bulletin board. Users also incur
personal costs, including their own travel and time off from work to visit lawyers and participate in
proceedings. One participant in the focus groups noted that:

        ‘(...) I can’t do my job and do this [pursue the case in court] at the same time, so I lose money.
        That’s why it’s very expensive, really time consuming and burdening.’26

Expenses such as those of expert witnesses must generally be paid in advance by the party who
suggested their appearance before the court. In those instances, the court will proceed with the case
without the report of the expert witness unless/until the expert fees are paid.27 Some may be willing to
produce an opinion before they are paid, however, given the growing problems with arrears, fewer and
fewer experts are willing to do so (for further discussion on the impacts of arrears, see the Financial
Management chapter of the Functional Review). Other expenses related to evidence, including those of
other witnesses, shall be paid in advance or shortly after presentation of respective evidence.28 These
costs and their timing add further disincentives for parties to pursue cases.

Upfront costs further deter users because of the expected delay in recouping them. According to the
Access to Justice Survey, when respondents who had not taken cases to court were asked why they
would not do so, the most common reason cited was the expectation that proceedings would last too
long (49 percent).29 Serbia has also experienced periods of higher inflation in recent years, leaving court
users out of pocket because of the delay. The expectation of a long delay in recouping costs if the party
is successful may in itself deter access.

Constitutional Court cases pose slightly different access problems. Individuals who file an appeal to the
Constitutional Court of Serbia (the last legal remedy that has to be used before a case can be brought
before the ECHR) are not required to pay court fees but are generally required to cover their own

27 The only exception applies where certain facts need to be established by the court ex-officio. In these cases,

the burden of presenting and covering the costs of the evidence shall be taken over by the court.
28 For example, costs of a witness shall be paid in advance or within eight days after his or her testimony.

attorney costs. In addition, prescribed attorney fees for Constitutional Court proceedings are very high.30
The inability to recoup these expenses would deter many potential court users from pursuing their
claims.

Many courts maintain an online fee calculator that enables potential litigants to estimate their court
fees before filing a case. This conforms to the CCJE standard31 that ‘(…) technology should be developed
whereby litigants may (...) obtain full information, even before proceedings are instituted, as to the
nature and the amount of the costs they will have to bear’. It is arguable whether these calculators alone
can empower users to be informed about their costs up front, given that they don’t provide all
necessary information and explanations of the complexity of the fee schedule, including its dependence
on the value of the claim and the type of case. As a result, parties seeking to understand the likely fees
still need to visit the court to have court staff assist them. The online fee calculators would be more
helpful if they contained explanations as to when a specific fee has to be paid and whether it should be
paid by a plaintiff, a defendant, or both parties.


Accessibility of Court Fee Waivers                 Inconsistent Application of Court Fee Waivers
The Civil Procedure Code allows for court fee

with their claim or not. However, there is very
limited understanding of the court fee waiver option among the public, therefore many potential users
would be deterred from the courts unaware they could access this benefit.

The court fee waiver program is largely undocumented. Official statistics and information on the
number and amount of fee waivers granted by courts is lacking. Information about fee waivers is not
recorded in AVP,33 and manual registers of waivers are not kept. The only recording of fee waivers is by

while every further claim costs 50 percent of this amount.
31 CCJE Opinion No. 6, 2004.
32 The court also has discretion to allow only a partial waiver under which only court fees are waived and the

party pays other expenses.
33 AVP can calculate court fees based on the case value and enter a comment about fees. However, there is no

field or checkbox to indicate whether court fee waivers were requested or approved. In any event, many
courts do not enter the court fee fields at all. They have little incentive to do so since there is no
corresponding AVP report to make good use of the information by managerial staff. To improve the practice, a
clerk could enter ‘$0’ as a court fee and make a reference to the judge’s decision in the comment box.

                                                     16
individual judges in their orders, therefore aggregation of data is not possible. It is possible that court
fee waivers represent a ‘positive story’ where the court system is improving access to justice for poorer
court users. However, it is difficult to measure any impact without better data.

The court fee waiver program is unstructured and largely goes unmonitored, resulting in divergent
practices. There are no guidelines or standardized forms on granting a waiver. As a result, court practice
varies according to information provided in interviews with attorneys and judges. Two different courts
could rule on fee waiver requests entirely differently for persons in similar circumstances. Some courts
report they apply a ‘rule of thumb’ that the higher the court fees, the more that should be provided in
support of the claim; while other courts apply no such rule. In some locations, the judge or the presiding
judge of a panel decides, in others the judge confers with the Court President. In some locations, two
judges of the same court could rule differently, as shown in the box above. The lack of structure and
guidance on fee waivers creates an inherent inconsistency in access to justice across the court system.

Though practice varies, stakeholders report that primary courts take into consideration the party’s
property, income, and their family members. Courts may also consider the party’s financial dependents
as well as the value of the claim.34 In practice, interviewees indicated that judges would usually grant a
waiver if the party submits an official statement to show they are unemployed and own no real estate.
Recipients of social welfare may also be free from the duty of pay related costs of procedure, but again
this is applied inconsistently.

Stakeholders reported that some Court Presidents informally discourage their judges from approving
fee waivers as fees form a significant proportion of courts’ budgets (for further discussion of budgets,
see Financial Management section). It is not possible to verify this claim, but if proven accurate, would
suggest that extrinsic factors are influencing the access to justice of individual users and that practice is
indeed inappropriately divergent.

Affordability of Attorneys
Parties in most cases choose to hire a private attorney for representation. The law requires only in
some procedures that a party be represented by an attorney,35 but in civil cases 65 percent of court
users reported hiring an attorney, while 53 percent did so in criminal cases. There is also a high ratio of
lawyers-to-population in Serbia.

Hiring an attorney is advisable if not necessary, due to the complexity and ambiguity of law and
practice. Further, court users report they are strongly discouraged by peers to ‘go alone’ because the

waiver) may be granted to a person who would not normally qualify, particularly if they are responding to a
lawsuit.
35 The Civil Procedure Law requires representation by an attorney in proceedings initiated by extraordinary

remedial appeals. The Criminal Procedure Code also prescribes a number of specific circumstances (e.g., the
defendant is tried in absentia, is hearing impaired) in which counsel is mandated. Finally, all minor
defendants must have defense counsel. Applicants do not have to be represented by an attorney in
proceedings before the Constitutional Court and the Administrative Court.

lawyer’s relationship with the judge may determine the outcome of a case. As stated by a participant in
a focus group ‘the price of the lawyer also includes acquaintance with the judge.’36

Attorney fees and costs are highly regulated.37 The Attorney Fee Schedule specifies fees for each type
of proceeding and each legal action or motion.38 Parties can negotiate, but fees must not be greater
than 500 percent nor less than 50 percent of the tariff rate. In practice, assessments of payments reveal
that the Attorney Fee Schedule is unrealistic.39 Stakeholders reported it is common for parties to pay 50
percent of the tariff rate. In poorer areas outside of the cities, particularly in the South and East of
Serbia, rates are likely to go below the 50 percent threshold.

The Attorney Fee Schedule is out of step with European practice and should be removed. In 42 of the
47 Member States of the Council of Europe, lawyers’ remuneration is freely negotiated.40 The European
Court of Justice has found that the mandatory minimum fee violates Article 49 of the EC Treaty.41 To
align national legislation with the Acquis, there is a strong trend among EU Member States and
Candidate Countries to move away from fixed tariffs. During its accession process, Croatia amended the
Law on Attorneys Service in 2008 to provide greater flexibility to attorneys in setting fees. Similarly in
2004, Romania eliminated minimum fees and strictly prohibited price fixing.42 Existing EU Member
States have moved in the same direction.43 Where fixed prices have been removed, several EU Member
States have maintained recommended fee schedule for services, which may be set by either the
professional body or the MOJ. These are justified on the basis of being a guide for consumers and judges
in awarding costs, as well as a default scale in cases of where no agreement on fees is reached between
the lawyer and the client. However, the EC advocates that both fixed and recommended fee scales are
restrictive and anti-competitive forms of regulation and should be abolished at the earliest opportunity.
The EC also argues that relevant information on the costs of legal services for consumers could be

37  CEPEJ 2012, based on 2010 data. In around 41 or EU Member States, remuneration between private parties
is freely negotiated.
38 Attorneys are entitled to all expenses as well as fees in case, such as transportation and accommodation

costs, compensation for absence from office, per diem, and telephone bills.
39 The Fiscal Impact Analysis of the draft Free Legal Aid Law drew on census data, case file reviews and

interviews with attorneys to assess payment arrangements.
40 See CEPEJ Evaluation Report, 2014 (based on 2012 data). Only Cyprus, Germany, Slovenia and UK-Northern

Ireland prevent free negotiation of rates.
41 In the Cipolla Case (C-94/04 - Cipolla and Others), the Court considered that the prohibition of derogation

by agreement from the minimum fees set by the fee scale was a restriction within the meaning of Article 49
EC Treaty (free movement on persons and services), as the rules in question were liable to render access to
the Italian legal services market more difficult for lawyers established in a Member State other than Italy. The
Court held that the prohibition deprived those lawyers of the possibility, by requesting fees lower than those
set by the scale, of competing more effectively with lawyers established in Italy on a stable basis, who
therefore had greater opportunities for winning clients than lawyers established abroad.
42 Lawyers in Romania negotiate fees freely with clients, and these may be hourly fees, fixed fees or success

fees.
43 After prolonged debate, Italy moved away from its model in 2006, under which tariffs developed by the

Lawyers’ National Council and approved by their MOJ were binding. Italy eliminated minimum fees and
allowed lawyers to decide their fees freely and link fees to the outcomes of their services. In 2003,
Switzerland abolished its mandatory fee schedule under cartel laws.

                                                      18
provided through alternative means far less restrictive of competition, such as the publication of
historical and survey-based price information by independent parties, such as consumer organizations.44

Further, attorneys are paid per hearing or motion on the Fee Schedule, which is in conflict with CCJE
opinion that ‘the remuneration of lawyers and court officers should be fixed in such a way as not to
encourage needless procedural steps.45 Attorneys who accept payment by the case are rare.

Attorney fees are very high compared to the average per capita income in Serbia, particularly in
criminal and civil cases.46 The recent Fiscal Impact Analysis of Free Legal Aid Options conducted by the
World Bank indicates that the average attorney’s fee in a criminal case is 118,000RSD, while that for a
civil case is 75,000RSD.47 The average criminal advocate fee is thus 17 times that of the average monthly
net income of a resident of Novi Pazar, and more than four times that of the average monthly net
income of a Belgrade resident.

According to the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, 71 percent of the citizens with court
experience found attorney-related costs to be one of the most insurmountable barriers to access to
the judicial system.48 Perceptions of affordability have deteriorated since 2009. 76 percent of
respondents reported fear of inability to cover attorney-related costs strongly affects their decision on
whether to bring a dispute to a court. Strikingly, the percentage of companies that find the judicial
system inaccessible in terms of attorney-related costs rose by 18 percent from 30 percent to 48 percent
in the period between 2009 and 2013.

Attorney fees create a barrier to access to justice for business, particularly small businesses. 52
percent of companies with 3 to 10 employees cite that attorney-related fees make the judicial system
inaccessible, while 47 percent cite that court fees make the system inaccessible. Although these
percentages decreased with size of the company, they remained obstacles even for larger companies
(see

Figure 6).

There are also concerns regarding the variable quality of attorneys . Several stakeholders report
hearing large numbers of complaints regarding the quality of attorneys49. Mechanisms for redress
regarding the conduct of an attorney are opaque, and discipline of attorneys by any of the Bar
Associations is rare.50 Stakeholders were unable to point to any instance – of ex-officio attorneys or
private attorneys – where an attorney has been sanctioned for malpractice. In a positive step however,
attorneys are now required to hold professional liability insurance, and each Bar Association is able to
pay for collective insurance for its members. So claims by former clients against negligent attorneys may
be more likely in the future.51

Use of Ex-Officio Attorneys
Court users report that attorneys were appointed ex-officio in 17 percent of criminal cases and 2
percent of civil cases. Although the law requires ex-officio appointment in some cases,52 no official data
are collected on the number of appointments or the types of cases where ex-officio appointment is
most common.

Stakeholders expressed some concern regarding the integrity of the process for identifying ex-officio
attorneys. The respective Bar Associations maintain lists of attorneys who specialize in criminal law and
are available for work.53 However, practice differs regarding the use of this list. In the past in Belgrade,
the Bar Association had a telephone number that police, courts or prosecutors could call and be directed
to an attorney. This practice was perceived well by stakeholders. Unfortunately, the practice ceased in
2013 amidst uncertainty regarding the leadership and management of the Bar. Outside of Belgrade, no
such hotline has ever existed. Instead, the police make a series of phone calls looking for an attorney,


49 See for example, the Annual Reports of the Ombudsman’s Office fo r 2011, 2012 and 2013.
50 Stakeholders were able to point to rare instances of civil claims made by former clients against attorneys
for compensation or damage for losing a case when the attorney did not appear at the trial. In each case,
stakeholders reported that the claimant was unsuccessful.
51 See amendments to the Law on Attorneys, 2011.
52 Criminal defense is mandatory in cases where the defendant is detained or where the offence is punishable

by eight years imprisonment or more. Where the defendant is indigent, defense counsel may be appointed by
the court in cases punishable by imprisonment of three years or more, or where reasons of fairness so
require. In a very small range of instances, representation is required in civil cases.
53 It is not clear, however, how often these lists are updated.


                                                           20
relying either on the list (often an old copy) or their personal contacts. Since the introduction of the new
CPC, there has been some limited change in practice, but this has not addressed the problem.
Prosecutors in Belgrade reported that they are required to make calls looking for an attorney.54 They
express discomfort with this process, given their high workloads and potential exposure to criticism and
conflict of interest. Meanwhile in most if not all locations outside of Belgrade, police calls remain the
standard practice.

Stakeholders expressed similar concern regarding undue influence in the appointment of attorneys. In
some locations, the police, prosecutor, or the court reportedly narrow the list of attorneys and appoint
only those who will encourage confession and lessen the workload of the case. It is not possible for this
Report to substantiate these claims, but, if proven, such practices would deny defendants of the right to
legal assistance of their own choosing under Article 6 (3) of the ECHR. The same concern has been
expressed by the European Committee for the Prevention of Torture and Inhuman or Degrading
Treatment or Punishment (CPT) on several occasions. In 2011, it reported that:

        ‘As had been the case during the 2007 visit, several detained persons who had benefited from
        the services of ex-officio lawyers complained about the quality of their work; in particular, the ex-
        officio lawyers apparently met their clients only once (in court), and often tried to convince them
        to confess to the offence for which they were being charged. Once again, the delegation heard
        allegations that the choice of a particular lawyer had been imposed on the persons concerned by
        the police.’ 55

The work of ex-officio attorneys is not monitored to ensure quality control. Information regarding
appointments is not entered into AVP, or if entered, it is as a ‘general remark’ not suitable for r unning
analytic reports. Some stakeholders report that the quality of work by ex-officio attorneys is lower than
party-funded attorneys due to their limited accountability. Several stakeholders allege that ex-officio
attorneys are more likely to pursue unmeritorious claims and appeals to increase their billings. In the
absence of data or quality control mechanism, this Report is unable to substantiate these claims.

Accessibility for Unrepresented Litigants
Court users report that they represent themselves in around 30 percent of criminal cases and 30
percent of civil cases.56 No official data are collected on the number of defendants who self-represent.57

Self-representation would be very challenging in the Serbian context and place unrepresented court
users at some disadvantage in terms of their access to justice. Judges usually guide or support self-

54 However, it seems this practice, too, is inconsistent. In places under the jurisdiction of the First Basic
Prosecutor’s Office, the police are more likely to call attorneys, while in the Second Basic Prosecutor’s Office,
the prosecutors do it themselves. See Report of the National Preventive Mechanism Team under the Optional
Protocol to the Convention Against Torture, 2014.
55 See Report to the Government of Serbia from the Council of Europe Committee for the Prevention of Torture

and Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (CPT Report), 2011, at paragraph 22.
56 This is a decrease from 32 percent in criminal cases, but an increase from 25 percent in civil cases in 2009.
57 AVP was designed to record the identity of parties, their lawyers, and how much the lawyers are paid.

However, courts do not systematically provide this information, and there is little incentive for them to do so
as there is no standard report generated by AVP to aggregate and analyze the data.

                                                       21
represented litigants to ensure fairness. However, there is limited information or guidance for self-
represented litigants, such as lay guides, checklists (see discussion of informational access below). The
challenge is borne out in the results. In the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, respondents who
represented themselves had judgments go against them in a higher percentage of cases (60 percent)
than people represented by a private lawyer (44 percent). The introduction of an adversarial system
under the new CPC is likely to deepen the challenge in criminal proceedings. Initiatives to improve
access to laws and court procedure (see below) would better enable users to navigate the court system.
Initiatives to simplify case processing in the kinds of cases where users self-represent, such as in
Misdemeanor Courts and in the pursuit of small claims in Basic Courts, could also improve access to
justice for large numbers of people, while producing quality and efficient outcomes. For a further
discussion on small claims, see the Efficiency chapter of the Judicial Functional Review.

Legal Aid Programs for the Indigent
The right to an attorney when fundamental rights are at stake is enshrined in international standards.
The further right to an attorney provided at state cost when a person cannot afford an attorney is
outlined in the EU’s Charter of Fundamental Rights,58 the ECHR,59 and the United Nations’ Principles on
Access to Legal Aid in Criminal Justice Systems. In Serbia, the Constitution guarantees the right to legal
aid, but does not define ‘legal aid’ or who can provide it.

Current legal aid providers deliver an incomplete patchwork of services across Serbia. Around 46
municipalities have Municipal Legal Aid Centers (MLACs), and an additional 10 municipalities deliver
legal aid without an MLAC. Together, these cover around one-third of the country and around one-half
of Serbia’s total population. However, the remaining municipalities do not provide the mandated
services either because of funding or capacity constraints or because they do not prioritize the service.
In Vojvodina, 28 of the 47 municipalities offer legal aid to the citizens.60 Only six of these municipalities
provide legal aid that includes representation before courts and administrative bodies, and the rest
provide limited advice or information. Outside of Vojvodina, the situation is likely to be worse. Law
Faculty Clinics and CSOs also provide some legal aid services in specific topics, such as refugee law and
human rights protection.

National data is not collected on the number of instances of legal aid, nor on how much money is
spent on legal aid service provision. Among the 47 countries monitored by the CEPEJ, Serbia is one of
only four countries where it is impossible to identify the budget allocated for legal aid.61 Based on the
municipal survey across Serbia in 2012, the 56 or so municipalities that provide legal aid of any form
responded to 73,000 requests for assistance, offered advisory services 57,000 times, made 29,000 free

Vojvodina (Novi Sad, 2013), page 18.
61 See CEPEJ Evaluation Report, 2014 (based on 2012 data). The other countries where legal aid expenditures

are unknown are Armenia, Montenegro and Ukraine.

submissions, 17,000 paid submissions, and 17,000 written submissions. Requests for assistance equaled
slightly more than 2 percent of their collective populations. This was accomplished with a staff of around
80 legal advice providers and 20 support staff. In total, there were 911 requests per provider, 565
requests for submissions, and an estimated 379 actual court cases filings per provider.62

Most citizens are unaware of any free legal services that might be provided in their city or
municipality.63 In the Access to Justice Survey, 58 percent of respondents across Serbia reported that
they were not aware of any service that provided legal aid. An additional 25 percent indicated that no
organization in their city or municipality provides free legal assistance to citizens. Namely, 82 percent of
the respondents could not name a single organization or institution that provides legal aid free of
charge, even when an MLAC is present in their municipality. Some of those who named an organization
did so incorrectly – for example, 4 percent named the Ombudsman Office as an institution providing
free legal aid, when it does not.

Where services are provided, they are perceived by clients to be of good quality. In the Access to
Justice Survey, 93 percent of the respondents who used legal aid services were satisfied with those
services, a resoundingly positive endorsement.64

Rates of use of free legal aid, types of services provided, and satisfaction with services provided are
not tracked or assessed at a central level. Data are fragmented and neither collected nor analyzed –
some legal aid providers do not keep records at all.

Reform is underway to expand legal aid consistently with EU standards. A Working Group to draft a
Free Legal Aid Law has been working on-and-off for several years.65 A working group is aiming to finalize
the draft, although that group met once in 2014. Key features of the draft law are outlined below, and
some and remaining ‘sticking points’ and risks are highlighted.

     i.   Primary legal aid (such as an initial consultation and the provision of general information and
          initial advice, as well as the drafting of documents) would be provided for all case types except
          commercial cases by a host of service providers, including MLACs, CSOs, trade unions and Law
          Faculties. All persons providing primary legal aid must be law graduates. However, no state
          funding is to be provided for this primary legal aid service, and there is no requirement for
          municipalities to establish MLACs. Delivery would presumably rely on international donor
          support or funding from individual municipalities. This is an area of high risk for implementation,
          because there is a high likelihood that primary legal aid would be underfunded. It is also likely
          that, without support, those municipalities that do not already have MLACs will not open them.

62 This is based on the assumption that a portion of drafted submissions does not ultimately reach the court
as an incoming case. Based on interview estimates conducted for the FLA Fiscal Impact Analysis, it was
suggested that approximately two-thirds of submissions become incoming cases. Serbian Free Legal Aid Fiscal

65 A draft Legal Aid Bill was open for public debate in December 2013, and many comments were received,

particularly from CSOs. However, the service delivery model, namely the use of one-stop-shops through the
Ministry for Labor and Social Welfare, proved unfeasible so the draft required further reworking.

                                                      23
           Under the current scenario then, primary legal aid would continue to be provided inconsistently
           across the territory and underfunded compared with needs.

     ii.   Secondary legal aid (such as representation in courts and mediation) would be provided for
           certain types of cases only, focusing predominantly on criminal defense. It would be
           delivered by those providers who are eligible to represent clients in court, as per the
           procedural rules that govern the time of case in question. In effect, this means that Bar
           Association attorneys will be the predominant providers of secondary legal aid. It is not
           clear whether trade unions or some other professional organizations may also be in a
           position to represent their members. It is also not clear how representatives would be
           chosen or allocated to cases. This aspect of the policy also poses high implementation risks.
           Relying on Bar Members for the bulk of service delivery would significantly increase
           program costs beyond what the justice system can likely afford in a challenging fiscal
           environment.66 Further, Bar Members do not always have expertise in the types of cases
           where the poor need assistance, whereas associations and CSOs often have staff dedicated
           to specializing in this work, several of whom have law degrees and Bar exams, but are not
           members of a Bar Association. There is thus concern that Bar Members would deliver a
           lower-quality service for a higher-than-affordable price. Also, it is unclear how users would
           be aware of secondary legal aid services and referred to service providers in areas where
           primary legal aid does not exist.

 iii.      Persons eligible to receive secondary legal aid would be individuals who already receive
           social benefits, as well as members of certain vulnerable groups (such as victims of
           domestic violence). Eligibility to receive social benefits would be determined through the
           database of the Ministry for Labor, Employment, Veteran and Social Policy (MLEVSP).
           However, it is not clear how any additional grounds of eligibility (for example based
           membership of a vulnerable group) would be determined.

     iv.   The MOJ would develop a FLA Fee Schedule for the compensation of secondary legal aid
           providers. The Fiscal Impact Analysis of Free Legal Aid advises that this Fee Schedule
           should be significantly lower than the existing Attorney Fee Schedule, which has proven to
           be unrealistic.67 There is some concern regarding the costing arrangements for all these
           service providers, and planning will be required to avoid the accumulation of arrears.68


66 Were the official tariff amount paid to attorneys in Basic Court cases expanded to all those eligible for legal
aid, the cost is estimated at between 2.4 and 4.8 billion RSD per year. However, the cost of providing the same
services through free legal aid (making a number of assumptions about eligible providers, the range of
services provided, eligible recipients, and the administrative structure and the likely impact of quality
controls) is estimated to be significantly less (estimated at approximately 600 m RSD per year).
67 See Serbian Free Legal Aid Fiscal Impact Analysis: Volume, Costs and Alternatives, World Bank MDTF-JSS,

2013.
68 Article 32, draft FLA Law suggests that only attorneys, notaries and mediators will be compensated by the

state for the costs of secondary legal aid services and that the costs of all other services shall be borne by the
providers. Such an arrangement may well undercut the purpose of the law and may result in primary legal aid
services not being provided.

                                                       24
     v.   Quality standards would be proposed and a quality control procedure would be established
          by a unit that would be created within the MOJ to perform oversight and assure efficacy of
          legal aid service delivery. Both primary and secondary legal aid providers would be
          required to be listed in a Registry of FLA Providers, to be managed by the MOJ. The
          providers will be required to keep records on their services and report annually to the MOJ
          on the scope and form of provided assistance. For primary legal aid providers, this would
          increase their bureaucratic overheads, even though they would receive no funding from the
          State.69 It is unclear how the quality of legal aid service providers will be checked, and how
          data would be collected and monitored, particularly in secondary legal aid cases.

Of most concern, there appears to be an imbalance in the implementation and funding arrangements
between primary and secondary legal aid under the current draft of the proposed law. Efficient
delivery of primary legal aid is likely to have the greatest benefit in terms of increasing access to justice
for the largest numbers of people. It will be important to ensure that this aspect of the reform is
adequately funded (although costs need not be high) and delivered consistently throughout the country,
including in municipalities that lack MLACs. Meanwhile, proposals for secondary legal aid are likely to
impact fewer users and could be very costly. The proposal appears not to have applied lessons from the
current arrangements for ex-officio attorneys,70 so the quality of secondary legal aid services may be
questionable. As a result, under the current arrangement both primary and secondary legal aid will face
significant implementation challenges.

Refinement, finalization, and operationalization of the draft FLA Law should be a priority. After years
of languishing in successive working groups, it will be important for a simple and effective law to be
passed that is consistent with the minimum requirements of Article 6 ECHR and can be applied
consistently throughout the country. The law will need to be costed and funds allocated to enable
implementation of both primary and secondary legal aid. The oversight unit at the MOJ would also need
to monitor implementation carefully, including by collecting and analyzing data on cases, beneficiaries,
providers and service quality, and should be prepared to propose corrective measures for the continual
improvement of the program. Without significant financial and operational planning and oversight,
there is a risk that the reform may become ‘stillborn’ like others before it.

Lessons from legal aid systems in the region may be instructive in the final phase of refinement. A
comparative analysis of legal aid systems was conducted by the MDTF-JSS in 2013, particularly
highlighting Lithuania and Brcko, Bosnia, as two locations where legal aid has been implemented in a
simple, effective, and fiscally responsible manner.71 It is increasingly common in advanced justice
systems for legal aid to be provided on a user-provider payment system or voucher system, so that once
a beneficiary is deemed eligible, the person can choose their own legal aid provider, rather than be
allocated one. Such reforms have been known to improve both access and quality while enhancing user
satisfaction and engagement in the process.

If implemented effectively, the FLA law has the potential to transform access to justice, comply with
Chapter 23, and improve the perceptions of the judiciary in the public. It will not address the concern
that courts are too expensive for average Serbians, but it would help to ensure that those most needy
have improved access. Given the recent fall in incoming cases before all courts (particularly sizeable falls
in Basic Courts), the court system has the capacity to absorb such an increase in demand that may arise.
The effectiveness of legal aid delivery would also be greatly enhanced by the range of efficiency and
quality initiatives discussed elsewhere in the Report. For example, establishing a simplified small claims
procedure that encourages self-representation through a streamlined user-friendly process would
significantly reduce the demand for free legal aid and enable scarce resources to be focused on meeting
core needs to comply with Article 6 of the ECHR.

Access to information
Access to and Awareness of Laws
Access to and awareness of laws, a pre-requisite to access to justice, is limited in Serbia. Prior to 2014,
the only legal databases where statutes in their complete form were available were those established
and maintained by private companies. Private databases were available for an annual membership of
approximately 400EUR.72 The National Assembly publishes legislation only as adopted without inserting
changes in existing statutes. Ministries and other institutions that can adopt regulations do not always
publish them.

The beginning of 2014 brought a significant change in availability of laws and other regulations. On
January 1st, 2014, the Official Gazette (Službeni Glasnik) launched its online database where all
legislation, including regulations adopted by bodies other than the National Assembly (e.g., ministries
and courts), are available free of charge. The extent to which the new Official Gazette’s legal database
will increase effective availability of legislation remains unknown.

Nonetheless, court users struggle to find access information. In the 2013 ACA Court User Survey of
court users, nearly half of all respondents reported that they had no information or were for the most
part uninformed about the procedure that brought them to court.73 The Survey also found that for those
court users who were informed about the proceedings, over 40% reported that they got their
information from direct contact with court staff, and 23% took information from other peoples’
experiences. Focus groups suggested that people, regardless of their education, general awareness, or
computer literacy often do not know where to find regulations and miss practical information
concerning their rights or procedures for their protection. Those who have used the internet to obtain
information on law and procedure say their search was time-consuming and frustrating because they




72 For instance, the Paragraph Lex legal database, the most widely used, in 2014 charges new users RSD
44,990 (on April 2, 2014, approximately USD 537 or EUR 389) for its annual legislation package, while old
users       pay      RSD       41,470     to      renew      their     annual      membership.        See

                                                    26
had to visit a number of websites that sometimes offered unclear or different information from what is
actually practiced.74

Frequent changes of legislation also undermine individuals’ access to justice. Seasoned lawyers also
find it difficult to know what the current law is, given the frequent changes. Judges acknowledged in
interviews that they too struggle to be up to date with the constant amendments, especially when laws
may be interpreted in more than one way and the interpretation of an official authority (such as a court
or ministry) is lacking. For citizens, the challenge is compounded to the extreme.

Businesses report that frequent changes in laws and regulations create problems for their
operations.75 In focus group discussions, business representatives complain that laws are not
accompanied by information that is easily available to companies, and high attorney fees deter them
from seeking legal advice. As stated by the owner of an office supply company:

        “The most severe problem in small companies is lack of information, since we are simply not able
        to deal with these things, with different new regulations popping out every day, we are simply
        stunned. We don’t have legal departments, so that we can tell them – here are these invoices, do
        collect this money or sue them. We have to do it on our own, and I can’t do my job and do this at
        the same time, so I lose money. That’s why it’s very expensive, really time consuming and
        burdening. And lawyers also charge a lot for it, with fees and everything“.

Farmers report similar problems, and complain that they find out about legislative changes too late.
As one farmer in a focus group stated, ‘provisions should stay the same for a longer period of time, so
that peasants get informed about them and know what to do if they have a problem, how to react’.76

Individuals and companies would welcome free access to practical guidelines, authoritative
interpretations, and commentaries following new legislation. Where they exist, useful commentaries
on legislation by relevant experts are not available free of charge. Even the above mentioned Official
Gazette’s database, which now provides all laws and regulations free of charge, provides commentaries
on legislation only to subscribed and paying users.

Access to Court and Case Information
Access to court information is a necessary pre-requisite to enable a court user to engage with the
logistical and procedural aspects of their case. Ensuring that users are better informed can reap
significant benefits in terms of efficiency. As outlined in the Efficiency chapter of the Judicial Functional
Review, the Vrsac Basic Court prepared checklists of information for users, which has smoothed and
improved efficiency in case processing.

businesses and reports that over the last five years, these laws have been amended or overhauled 98 times in
total.

In the Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, 64 percent of the public and 76 percent of business sector
respondents reported that the judicial system is accessible in terms of general access to information.
Respondents agree that access to information on how to initiate judicial proceedings is not a significant
barrier in efforts to file a case in court. On a further positive note, and in contrast with 2009, a higher
percentage of business representatives report that information is accessible (see Figure 7 below).

Figure 7: Perceptions of Accessibility of Information among Public and Business Sector, 201377




                   Public                              Business Sector

However, the availability of information on misdemeanor proceedings is worsening. In 2013, 24
percent of respondents complained it is hard to collect information about misdemeanor cases,
compared with only 6 percent of respondents in 2009.78 Access to information in misdemeanor cases is
particularly important because the users in these cases usually research and represent themselves.
Easily accessible information in lay formats could thus also improve the efficiency and quality of
proceedings in Misdemeanor Courts.

Access to information is a particular challenge for seniors and the least educated citizens. 79 In the
Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, 58 percent of the elderly and 63 percent of the least educated
expressed that difficulties in finding the necessary information influences their decision to initiate a
judicial procedure or not.80 This information should be borne in mind when planning how to make
information on procedures more accessible.

Information on how to enter complaints against the courts is also not easily accessible . For further
discussion about complaints mechanisms, see the Quality chapter of the Judicial Functional Review.

Respondents use several sources of information when looking for information about their case. This
varies in frequency depending on the type of case. In criminal cases, lawyers are the most common
source of information at 44 percent, followed by unofficial sources such as friends and media, and then
official court sources of information. Unofficial sources of information prevail in misdemeanor cases (50
percent), followed by official court sources (39 percent). In civil cases, lawyers and official court sources
of information are used most frequently (34 percent). As for the business sector, lawyers are the


77 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, World Bank MDTF-JSS, 2014.
78 The proportion of those saying it was easy to obtain information declined in civil cases as well (from 61 to
48 percent), but this was accompanied by an increased proportion of those who let their lawyer collect
information (from 25 to 33 percent).
79 In the 2011 Census, ‘elderly people’ refers to those over 60 years of age, composing around 24.7 percent of

the population. ‘Uneducated people’ refers to those with nil or incomplete primary education, composing
around 13.7 percent of the population.

Respondents to both Multi-Stakeholder Justice Surveys indicated that among official sources of
information, court staff and the registry desk were used most often. Over 70 percent of respondents in
the public and business sector that used official information sources were satisfied.82 Little mention was
made of using printed materials from the court (e.g., informational brochures or leaflets), with only 3
percent of respondents relying on these sources of information. It may be that such information is not
readily available at courts. During field visits, such brochures and leaflets on basic procedures were
sought to be obtained without success.

Victims of crime are at a particular disadvantage when accessing information and navigating the court
system. All EU Member States (except Latvia) offer a free-of-charge service to inform and help victims of
crime, in recognition of their vulnerability and specific justice needs. Among those countries monitored
by the CEPEJ, Serbia is also one of only five states that lacks such a service.83 In Serbia, such services are
provided on a voluntary basis by a patchwork of local CSOs.

There is considerable room for improvement in making information available online. Some courts
have rich websites (for instance the Leskovac Basic Court), while others do not have a website at all.
Some CSOs also offer useful practical information. Providing online information enables potential users
to conduct research without assistance, prevents unnecessary travel to the courthouse, and can
improve the efficiency of court processes. In 2013, only 24 percent of survey respondents84 indicated
using the internet for information since websites do not contain useful information and litigants do not
know how to access these websites. In 2012, internet penetration in Serbia was approximately 60
percent,85 but this will invariably rise in the medium term and the Serbian judiciary should be prepared
for when it occurs. In the meantime, offline versions should also be readily available, particularly for
rural, elderly, and the least educated groups. For discussion of online resources, see the ICT
Management section of the Judicial Functional Review.

Availability of court information saw significant progress with the introduction of a web portal, the
Sudova Srbije. The portal provides information on the status of ongoing procedures in first instance
courts, including hearing dates. Due to privacy constraints, the portal can only be accessed by those who
know the case number, which causes some confusion for parties and lawyers alike.86 Further, the portal
does not currently provide information about matters before appellate courts and the SCC. None of the
four appellate courts or the SCC post daily schedules online. Hence, parties to proceedings are not in a
position to know when an appellate court or the SCC will hold deliberations in their case. The
Constitutional Court, which used to announce its daily schedule, have since abandoned this practice.
Croatia’s ‘e-case’ portal provides greater coverage as well as more detailed information. It has better
managed the privacy constraints by providing the initials of the parties and their case file numbers to
enable easy identification. Reforms similar to ‘e-case’ would be readily implementable and would
improve access to court information in Serbia.

Court notice boards could also provide better information to court users. As court users often are
required to wait in public areas for hearings or services, this provides a low-cost and easy-access option
for raising awareness to anything from changes in procedure, lay guides, checklists, lay formats of
annual reports etc. Court staff, under the direction of the Court President, could be more proactive in
enhancing the visibility of notice boards and ensuring that they provide accurate and relevant
information for court users.

Access to Court Decisions
The SCC is the only court with regular publication of all its decisions. The Constitutional Court has
made many of its decisions available online for the public. Other courts do not regularly publish their
judgments, although some, in particular appellate courts, make some particularly important decisions or
excerpts from decisions available on their websites. Selected decisions are also periodically published in
the Official Gazette. However, the number of decisions available online remains limited. Only the
Constitutional Court’s website has a search engine that allows keyword searching. A search engine for
the SCC’s website is currently under construction.

The Act on Free Access to Public Information allows all individuals can request a court to provide them
with its decisions.87 In general, courts fulfill this duty though in some cases, delays occur especially if a
request involves a large number of decisions. Parties to court proceedings can always ask courts for
decisions made in their case and also have access to their case files.

Access to Alternative Dispute Resolution
Evidence from numerous countries shows that the effective use of mediation can enhance the
efficiency of dispute resolution, reduce the number of pending cases, and help keep cases from
returning to the judicial system. Estimates from Serbia’s Free Legal Aid Working Group members
indicate that the cost of a case concluded through mediation will be approximately 25 percent of that of

86 In December 2013 the Commissioner for the Protection of Personal Data ordered the MOJ remove all
names and addresses from the portal.
87 The War Crimes Chamber of the Belgrade High Court does not make its judgments available to the public,

notwithstanding orders to do so by the Commissioner for Free Access to Public Information.

a case completed through litigation, with significant savings to the courts and to parties.88 Such a
reduction in costs indicates that mediation may directly enhance access to justice by allowing more
affordable dispute resolution.

The EU actively promotes methods of alternative dispute resolution, including mediation. Standards
require member states to encourage training of mediators and to urge judges to invite parties to try
mediation first. The EU also highlights certain safeguards, such that mediation must take place in an
atmosphere of confidentiality, and that mediators cannot be obliged to give evidence in court about
mediations.89

In 2005 a legal and institutional framework for mediation was established in Serbia, 90 but mediation
was never fully embraced. Despite the judiciary’s poor reputation, backlogs, and efficiency challenges,
the alternative course was not perceived to be more attractive. Over time, the number of mediation
cases in Serbia has reportedly decreased.91

Mediation has not been effectively incorporated into the regular proceedings of all courts. Instead, the
system sits astride the regular system and depends on individual judges, attorneys, or parties to propose
its use of their own initiative. To be effective, a court-annexed mediation system should be integrated
into the case flow, and a system developed to divert cases to mediation at the appropriate time.
Further, there is an absence of public awareness and understanding of the concept of mediation and its
potential benefits, so court-annexed mediation programs experience difficulties in finding citizens
interested in using mediation services. Lastly, there has been an absence of cooperation between
stakeholders in the field of mediation.92

Awareness of mediation is somewhat limited, although it is more commonly known in business
circles. According to the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, only 17 percent of general court users
and around 53 percent of business users know what mediation is, and these levels of awareness have
been constant since 2009.

Some limited mediation does occur outside of the court system. The National Bank of Serbia, the
Commissioner for the Protection of Equality, the Association of Mediators, and the Chamber of

   See for example, https://e-justice.europa.eu/content_eu_overview_on_mediation-63-en.do
90 The 2005 Law on Mediation enabled mediation in all disputes unless a law stipulated the exclusive

authority of a court or other relevant body. Mediation could be initiated either before or after the initiation of
court proceedings, or independent of any formal proceedings. Court-annexed mediation services in the Basic
Courts and certain courts of special jurisdiction could be used in civil matters, such as property, family,
commercial and employment disputes. In criminal matters, court-annexed mediation could be used to
facilitate an agreement between the victim and a juvenile offender (victim-offender mediation). Civil and
criminal mediators were mostly sitting judges, but occasionally included trained professionals. In family
disputes, particularly in cases involving parental rights, mediation was generally carried out in collaboration
with social welfare centers. In 2006, the ‘Republic Mediation Centre’ was established to organize mediation
services, organize training and expert conferences, and publish relevant materials.

Commerce and Industry all offer mediation for some types of disputes. However, a recent evaluation of
the use of mediation in Serbia indicated that these efforts are ad-hoc and used only sporadically.

Mediation also suffers from a perception problem, largely because previous reforms offered promise
but were ‘stillborn’. Among the general and business court users who heard about mediation, the
majority considers it useful, but they are more likely to think that it is just partly useful rather than very
useful. Furthermore, there has been a decrease in its perceived effectiveness. Among those who are
aware of mediation in the 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, 36 percent of the general court users
considered mediation very useful, a decrease of 15 percent from 51 percent in 2009. Conversely, 7
percent more people in 2013 consider it to be not useful at all. People who claimed to have had a
dispute they thought should be settled in the court but decided against such action rarely choose to
settle the dispute by mediation procedure. Only 1 percent of general population (out of those who had a
dispute but decide not to settle it in the court for any reason) opted to settle the dispute by mediation
process, while in business sector mediation was chosen by only 2 percent in 2009, and 0 in 2013.

Nonetheless, court users – and potential users – appear to want alternatives outside of the court
system, indicating that a well-designed mediation system would attract demand from potential court
users. In the Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey, 33 percent of the public and 46 percent of business
representatives who had a dispute prefer to negotiate with the other side or resolve it informally
somehow (see Figure 9 below). Similarly, in the 2014 Access to Justice Survey, the majority of people
reported having a dispute but opting not to take a suit to court. Of them, 23 percent said they
negotiated their dispute on their own with the other party, and a further 5 percent found an informal
way to settle the dispute. The remaining 72 percent said the dispute was still outstanding.93

Recognizing the problems of the previous ‘stillborn’ reforms, the MOJ formed a number of working
groups between 2010 and 2014 to consider amendments, and in May 2014, a new law on mediation
was adopted by the Serbian Parliament. Under the new law, the Republic Mediation Center has been
disbanded and mediation is expected to be brought under the umbrella of the courts. Judges are now

expected to act as mediators outside of their working hours and using court facilities. The 2014
Mediation Law allows for parties to be relieved from paying court fees if mediation is successful before
the end of first hearing. As with the first law, mediation may be used under the new law in any dispute
unless a law stipulates the exclusive authority of a court or other relevant body. In particular, mediation
is seen as suitable for property, family, commercial, administrative, environment, consumer, and labor
cases. In relation to criminal and misdemeanor cases, mediation may be used for damage and
compensation requests.

However, the new law on mediation has not addressed the institutional shortcomings that were
present under the first law. Other than providing for some fee relief and expanding the scope of cases
for which mediation is seen as suitable, the new law does not address the problems identified above.
The role to be played by attorneys and parties is not clear, though practice around the world suggests
that lawyers need not always be involved. If lawyers do participate, consideration will need to be given
to the extent to which it may charge for mediation or whether legal aid would be.95 It will be necessary
to monitor the potential misuse and failure of parties to comply with mediated available agreements.96
By-laws, to be developed within the next six months, may assist but the challenges of implementation
are likely to be significant with this model and should be carefully managed in the rollout. Legal changes
need to be supported by extensive outreach, regulatory considerations, and incentives to encourage the
use of mediation.

The judiciary can expect some challenges in implementing a system where judges become mediators.
The Multi-Stakeholder Justice Survey found that Serbian judges are not very supportive of mediation
(see Box below). A significant behavioral change and training would thus be required for them to
become champions of the process. The extent to which judges were consulted through this process is
also unclear, and no additional incentives were provided for judges to perform this further work outside
of normal hours, potentially creating a systemic vulnerability towards gift giving or malfeasance by
parties. Although mediation requires a very different skill set from judging, there remains no special
training for judges who mediate disputes. Further, as European standards require that judges should not
hear a dispute on which they have previously mediated,97 careful confidentiality and conflict of interest
rules will need to be managed.




95 CCJE also calls for legal aid to be available for mediation (and other ADR) phases of a case, not just when
cases enter the trial phase.
96 Under the new law, settlements at mediation are as enforceable as court decisions. Enforceability of non-

utility bill enforcement has been improving but issues remain. Deeper analysis is necessary to help improve
performance in this important area. See Efficiency Chapter.
97 See for example Directive 2008/52/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 21 May 2008 on

     Box: Attitudes of Judges and Prosecutors to Mediation

            About half of judges and prosecutors consider mediation partly useful, and only about one-third consider it
             very useful.
            53 percent of judges report to be informed about mediation. A substantial number of judges claimed that they
             are not well-informed about the mediation process.
            Only around 20 percent of judges and 8 percent of prosecutors have undergone mediation training.

Currently, judges and prosecutors report ambivalence about the proposed law . It is therefore timely
for a significant investment in outreach, awareness raising, and training of judges and court staff. The
proper functioning of the system presumes that all the actors in the system have basic knowledge of
mediation. Although some courts employ mediation coordinators, they are often individuals who
perform judicial functions and therefore cannot be expected to oversee effectively the administration
and management of cases referred to mediation in addition to their regular judicial duties. Partners in
Serbia suggest a tiered approach to training for mediators, attorneys, prosecutors, judges, and non-
judiciary people who will have some participation in mediation (e.g., business leaders, media, CSOs, and
other stakeholders).98

Support for mediation by the Court Presidents and other managers, and understanding of their role in
the mediation process, will be vital for the successful use of court mediation. The CCJE calls for judges
to encourage consensual settlement,100and elaborates that ‘understanding the respective roles of judges
and lawyers in the framework of friendly settlements by conciliation or mediation is a vital factor for
developing this approach.’ These factors are not yet present in Serbia.

Familiarity among the judges, court staff and the public is an issue, but it may not be the primary
barrier. In a recent crowd-sourcing survey,101 of those who answered the question about mediation, a
minority of respondents indicated they were prepared to use mediation, with some doubting its
efficiency. Impediments to use of mediation cited by participants included:

      a. insufficient incentives to use mediation, since some parties could simply afford to wait
         while the civil litigation drags for years on end;
      b. insufficient incentives for lawyers to recommend mediation because of its likely impact on
         their litigation fees;
      c. lack of trust by parties in the impartiality and fairness of the mediator; and
      d. unwillingness of the judiciary to direct parties to mediation, mainly due to inertia and
         resistance to change.

A case referral and management system for mediation is a critical step to optimize the benefits of
mediation and improve both quality and efficiency in the courts’ performance. Implementation of
mediation in courts will require clear criteria, such as the criteria for selection of cases suitable for
mediation, administrative procedures,102 and statistical monitoring and reporting. It may be worth
considering how best to incentivize judges to refer certain types of cases to mediation, perhaps via a
‘reward’ or ‘bonus’ earned via productivity norms. Mediation could for instance be counted as part of
the individual judges’ workload, and incentivized in evaluations and promotions for judges and Court
Presidents.

Access to Allied Professional Services
A vast array of professionals other than attorneys – including bailiffs, interpreters, expert witnesses,
and mediators – support the delivery of justice. Access to information on these providers and the
ability to retain them at a reasonable cost is needed to access the courts effectively. To ensure access to
these professionals, litigants need to be able to identify them easily by geographic area and needed
topic area (e.g., a Romanian speaker in a certain vicinity), understand likely fees, and) know if there are
pending complaints against them.

Information available on registries varies in quality and scope. The MOJ has created registries for most
enforcement agents and expert witnesses103 and a registry of interpreters is included on the Association
of Interpreter website as well as elsewhere. Interpreter and expert witness registries appear to be
adequate to make a selection by specialty or language. However, it can be difficult to access fee

individual judge is not described online. The only mechanism to complain would be to approach the
individual judge in the case.

Geographic and Physical Access to Justice Service
Geographic Access to Court Locations
Geographic barriers to access to justice are not a significant concern in Serbia, particularly in light of
its manageable size and population. Around 73 percent of citizens and 85 percent of business
representatives do not consider distance to the courthouse to be a problem. The elderly and the least
educated are the only cohorts to indicate in a sizeable minority that the distance to the courthouse
makes the judiciary less accessible.

Average distance to a courthouse has reduced even further due to changes to the court network,
effective 1 January 2014. An earlier UNDP survey found that the 2010 re-networking had somewhat
hindered access to courts for some parts of the population, increased costs for the parties and their
lawyers, and adversely affected lawyers working in smaller communities.105 However, the recent
expansion increased the number of Basic Courts to 66 from 34. The expansion of courts was largely
achieved by converting ‘Court Units’ to ‘Basic Courts’, thus almost doubling the number of Basic Court
locations that hear criminal proceedings and hold hearings on a daily basis.

Further expansion of the court network would be unnecessary. Future efforts to improve physical
access to justice services would be best addressed using online strategies, such as e-filing. As internet
penetration improves, geographic distance will become less relevant than before. The development of
streamlined online processes can bring a range of court services directly to the user.

Physical Layout of Court Locations
The layout of courts is generally accessible for court users. Notwithstanding suboptimal physical
conditions, in both the 2009 and 2013 Multi-Stakeholder Justice Surveys, respondents mentioned they
did not generally cite physical access as a barrier to the delivery of court services. This suggests that
access to justice efforts should focus on substantive access to services. Nonetheless, infrastructure
upgrades have the potential to improve public perceptions of access to justice by signaling a
modernization in justice service delivery and easing constraints for those who work within courts.106

Persons with disabilities experience particular challenges in accessing courthouses. Respondents to
the UNDP survey107 indicated that physical inaccessibility of judicial facilities is a primary barrier to

access to justice for this group. Their concerns relate to the primary entrance to buildings, movement
throughout facilities, and adaptability of information for those with visual, audio or learning disabilities.

Further, in a few locations, navigation within courthouses can be challenging as signage is limited and
the layout is not intuitive. In these locations, it is common for court users to roam the halls looking for
courtrooms or counters. This puts disabled court users at a particular disadvantage, but also affects
general court users. Increased use of clear navigation signs would be a low-cost initiative for these
locations that would also save the time of court staff and likely increase user satisfaction. In areas where
languages other than Serbian are common among court users, multi-lingual signs should be used. 108

Equality of Access for Vulnerable Groups
56 percent of the citizens surveyed consider the judiciary equally accessible to all citizens, regardless
of their age, socio-economic status, nationality, disability, and language. However, 38 percent of
reported that it is not equally accessible to all. Similarly, 59 percent of business sector representatives
consider the judicial system equally accessible to all companies, while 35 percent of the latter do not
share this opinion.

Compared with population average, citizens with less education (elementary school and lower) and
citizens over 60 years of age perceive the judicial system as less accessible to them in all aspects,
including costs. Citizens who live outside urban areas experience more difficulties in obtaining necessary
information, finding their way in the courthouse, and distance of the courthouse. These responses point
to the need for providing specific assistance to targeted populations.

Individuals with intellectual and mental health disabilities experience significant disadvantage in their
access to justice services. The process by which individuals can be deprived of their legal capacity is not
as stringent as European and international standards require.109 Research conducted in 2011 indicates
that a hearing by a judge is conducted in only around 12 percent of all cases.110 This appears to
contradict the requirement that such hearings may be dispensed for exceptional cases only.111 In 94
percent of deprivation of capacity cases, individuals are deprived of all their legal capacities. This
contradicts the CoE Principles Concerning the Legal Protection of Incapable Adults, which states that
different degrees of incapacity should be recognized, and that measures of protection should not
automatically result in a complete removal of legal capacity.112 Recent amendments in May 2014 to the
Act on Non-Contentious Proceedings introduced periodic re-assessments of capacity at least once every
three years, a move towards compliance. Stakeholders expressed concern that social welfare centers,

which act as legal guardians in many cases, are under-resourced and may visit their wards less than once
per year. The procedure for wards to challenge their deprivation of liberty and re-assess their capacity is
also opaque, and it is not clear whether individuals can apply on their own behalf. Some CSOs are
supporting applicants to do, so citing ECHR jurisprudence, though those without CSO support would
likely be unable to contest their status.

Gender disparities are minimal: there is no significant difference between the proportion of men and
women who would decide to bring a case to court when they think that court was the proper forum
for resolution. Approximately 8 percent of men and 2 percent of women decided not to bring a case to
court even though they believed court was the proper forum.113

The only significant difference between women and men respondents in perceived barriers to access
was found in lawyer-related costs. Considerably, more women (81 percent) than men (71 percent)
stated that lawyer-related costs would be relevant to their decision to take a dispute to court. This is
also the only problem women mentioned more than the population as a whole.

Members of focus groups from the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender population (LGBT) are less
likely than others to file cases to protect themselves or punish those who have harmed them. Most
cases related to violation of LGBT rights have been started with active participation of an NGO.
Anonymity in court cases is a common reason, and many LGBT citizens, especially those in small
communities, are reluctant to ‘come out’ in a public forum. Others are afraid of retaliation from their
alleged harassers, and experienced activists who follow court proceedings are deeply pessimistic.115

Members of the Roma community, refugees, and internally displaced persons (IDPs) share the opinion

Recommendations and Next Steps
Simplify the court fee structure to enable users to estimate likely costs. Remove the cap on court fees.
Standardize the court fee waiver process, and collect and analyze data on court fee waivers. 118
Implementation of this recommendation will align with EU standards and good international practice.119
The initial steps can be made in the short term for little to moderate costs.


       Simplify the court fee structure to enhance understanding of likely court costs. Remove the cap
        of 80,000 RSD on court fees and remove court fees for criminal cases initiated by a private party.
        (MOJ – medium term)
       Provide lay formats of information online and in paper brochures about the foreseeable costs
        and duration of proceedings to enable potential court users to better estimate the costs of their
        case. (MOJ – medium term)
       Adopt and disseminate standards for granting fee waivers, and create a standardized fee waiver
        application form and decision form for use by all courts. (MOJ, SCC – short term)
       Require staff to enter data on fee waiver requests and decisions in existing fields in AVP. Over
        time, monitor data fee waivers to encourage compliance with standards. (MOJ, courts – short
        term)

Remove the Attorney Fee Schedule to enable competition in the market for legal services. Develop a
more cost-effective Attorney Fee Schedule to apply only for legal services to the state (e.g., legal aid
services and ex-officio attorney appointments). Consider moving away from a pay-per-hearing model.120
The CCJE advises that remuneration of attorneys should not be fixed in a way that encourages needless
procedural steps.121 The European Court of Justice has held that mandatory minimum fees violate the EC
Treaty. In 42 countries monitored by the CEPEJ, lawyers’ remuneration is freely negotiated.122 Some
steps will entail low to moderate costs but they would likely be more than offset by savings in moving
from per-hearing payment to per-case payment for court-appointed attorney.

       Remove the Attorney Fee Schedule and allow attorneys to negotiate their fees freely with
        clients. Develop a lower Attorney Fee Schedule for legal services provided to the state (see
        below), which could also act as a default schedule for the awarding of costs. (MOJ – medium
        term)
       Periodically update Bar Association lists to inform the process of selecting ex-officio attorneys,
        and provide lists to all relevant stakeholders. Clarify the appointment process and re-
        instate/establish Bar Association hotlines for attorney referrals. Provide parties with information
        on how to make a complaint about an ex-officio attorney. (MOJ, Bar Associations – short term)
       Require court staff to enter data on ex-officio attorney appointments into existing AVP fields.
        Monitor the use of ex-officio attorney appointments by case type, outcome, appeal rate and
        time to disposition. Compare with data where attorneys were not appointed ex-officio. Over
        time, use data to inform future reforms of ex-officio appointments. (MOJ, Bar Association –
        short to medium term)
       Provide parties with information on how to make a complaint about an ex-officio attorney.
        Strengthen quality control mechanisms for ex-officio attorneys. (Courts, Bar Associations – long
        term)
       Consider whether the mandatory appointment of ex-officio attorneys in certain cases (known as
        mandatory defense) should be broadened. (MOJ – long term)


Prioritize the passage of an adequately funded, cost-effective Free Legal Aid law that expands the pool
of service providers and limits State costs.123 International standards establish the right to counsel to
protect fundamental rights, and the ECHR calls for state-supported defense for indigent parties when
the interest of justice demands it. The law should be passed as a priority, and rollout can occur in the
medium term. Potential significant costs can be contained by following these recommendations:


       Prioritize passage of the draft Free Legal Aid Law. Ensure that the operational and fiscal
        implications of the draft law are adequately addressed. Cost and provide funding for primary
        legal aid services and ensure its coverage across the territory. Secure funding to implement any
        expanded mandates provided in the law. (MOJ, MOF – short term)
       Develop an Attorney Fee Schedule for the reimbursement of providers of primary and
        secondary legal aid. Consider a payment mechanism whereby clients receive vouchers for legal
        aid services and can choose their own provider. (MOJ – short term)
       Task a Working Group within the MOJ to plan and oversee the rollout of the new law. Draft
        regulations. Provide training to service providers. Establish the proposed quality control
        mechanism and relevant protocols. (MOJ – medium term)
       Provide easy-to-read information about court processes in pamphlets and on the web, including
        guidance on assessing court and attorney fees, and how to make a complaint against attorneys.
        (MOJ – medium term)
       Disseminate information to the public about the availability of legal aid services. (MOJ – medium
        term)



123  This recommendation aligns with NJRS Strategic Guideline 2.5.1: Defining the structure of the
standardized system of legal aid trough setting up of a normative framework and establishment of
institutional support.

       Collect and analyze data on the use of legal aid by the public, including the most common case
        types, the workloads of service providers and the levels of satisfaction of users. (MOJ – medium
        term)


Improve services for self-represented litigants, including simple forms and checklists for court users,
and lay brochures and guides of basic laws and procedures.124 Improved information can enable
litigants to proceed smoothly through the system without an attorney, thus improving access to justice,
as well as efficiency in the delivery of services.


       Create fields in AVP to collect data the number of self-represented litigants, their case types,
        outcomes and times to disposition. Require that staff enter data. Over time, use the data to
        design more targeted interventions to support self-represented litigants. (MOJ – short term)
       Building on lessons from Vrsac Basic Court, develop checklists of routine processes for court
        users and disseminate widely. (Courts – short term)
       Develop lay information packs for case types that are (or could be) most commonly pursued
        without an attorney, including guides, flow charts and infographics (MOJ – medium term)
       Develop/improve registries of allied professionals, such as enforcement agents, mediators and
        private notaries, to include expertise, geographic area, clear fee descriptions, complaint
        procedures, and disciplinary actions initiated or fines levied against an individual. Include in the
        bailiff registry a calculator for assessing likely bailiff fees (similar to the court fee calculator).
        (MOJ, Chamber of Bailiffs – short term)


Operationalize the new Mediation Law, create incentives for court users and practitioners to opt for
mediation, and monitor the results. Conduct intensive training among professionals on mediation and
disseminate information to potential court users.125 The CCJE recognizes the critical role of judges and
lawyers for consensual settlements.126 EU Member States are required to ensure training and quality of
mediators and mediation confidentiality. While some steps can be taken soon, this is a large undertaking
requiring considerable time, money, and political will to accomplish. In order to encourage mediation,
the remuneration structure for attorneys will need to be changed from one based on fees paid for
hearings to one based on legal services and case resolution.


       Develop quality standards for mediators and a certified mediator registry. (MOJ – short term)



124  This recommendation aligns with NJRS Strategic Guideline 2.5.1: Defining the structure of the
standardized system of legal aid trough setting up of a normative framework and establishment of
institutional support.
125 This recommendation aligns with NJRS Strategic Guideline 2.5.3: establishment of an efficient and

sustainable system of dispute resolution through mediation, by improving the normative framework and
conducting the procedure of standardization and accreditation of initial and specialized training program for
mediators, as well as by promoting the alternative methods of dispute resolution. Establishment of the
register of licensed mediators in accordance with predefined criteria.

       Raise public awareness of mediation through websites, brochures, and public service
        announcements. Introduce a Mediation Self-Help Test, applying lessons from the Netherlands,
        so that parties can determine whether mediation would benefit them. (MOJ – short term)
       Establish a formal Court-annexed mediation program in all Basic and Higher Courts and
        standards for determining which cases are appropriate for mediation.127 Strengthen mediation
        confidentiality requirements, requiring that judges serving as mediators cannot serve as trial
        judge in the same case and providing trial judges only with confirmation that mediation was
        unsuccessful rather than the reasons no settlement was reached. (MOJ,HJC – medium term)
       Provide incentives to potential users of mediation, including:
        o Lawyers: provide subsidized, tiered training to familiarize attorneys with mediation and
            those lawyers who decide to become mediators. Require mediators who received subsidized
            training to provide a specified number of free mediations. Introduce a system of co-
            mediation and mentoring to enhance mediator skills. (MOJ, Bar Associations – medium
            term)
        o Judges: develop training and printed materials for Court Presidents and judges about the
            advantages and mechanics of mediation. Count dispositions achieved through mediation as
            part of the individual judges’ workload. (HJC, JA – medium term)
        o Public: introduce legal aid for mediation128 and provide a temporary financial stimulus via
            free mediation hours. Set fees for mediation at less than court litigation fees, reflecting
            likely lower court costs than through standard litigation. Reduce the mediation fee in small
            claims cases to bring it more in line with court fees for these cases. (MOJ – medium term)
       Create an effective mediation case referral and management system, including: a) criteria for
        selecting cases; b) procedures for selecting a mediator; c) statistical monitoring and reporting;
        and d) coordinating activities between the court, litigants and mediators. (HJC – medium term)


Make important cases, consolidated legislation, and information about open and disposed cases
freely accessible online.129 Implementing this recommendation will advance several CCJE goals.130 Most
of these efforts can be accomplished in the medium term for low to moderate costs.


       Provide public information about court processes via court websites and brochures and using
        radio and television public access channels. Start with information about misdemeanor case
        process for which citizens indicate that the least information is available and the highest
        demand for information exists. (MOJ, HJC – short term)
       Publish consolidated legislation online free of charge. For the most commonly-used legislation,
        provide annotated commentaries. (National Assembly, Official Gazette – medium term)
       Ensure that parties in pending cases can access the basic registry and scheduling information
        about their case on the web portal, applying lessons learned from Croatia. (HJC, MOJ – medium

                               BACKGROUND AND PROJECT OBJECTIVE

One of the issues surveyed in the Multi-stakeholder survey on perception of judiciary performance in
Serbia, conducted in November 2013, was readiness of the general public to settle the disputes in the
court and main reasons to decide against such action. The findings showed that citizens who stated to
have had a dispute they thought should be settled in the court but decided against such action most
frequently named the financial inaccessibility of the court proceedings as the main reason for this
decision. However, surveying the issue was limited to the subsample of the citizens who stated to have
had a dispute they felt should be settled in the court but decided against this action (9% of the total
population).

In order to get a wider picture of the citizens’ perception of the accessibility of judiciary as the barrier to
citizen’s usage of the court services when they feel in need for the service, the World Bank conducted an
additional quantitative survey and qualitative survey through focus group discussions.

The survey was focused on two issues: the citizens’ mood towards settling their disputes in the court
when they feel that it should be done, and perceptions of the main reasons against this action. For that
reason participants in the focus groups were either those with experience with court case in previous
three years or with some dispute which had a good ground for being brought to court, but they gave up
the court process.

Quantitative survey was realized on national representative sample of 1000 citizens 18+ years old. Focus
groups were conducted with general public, famers, owners of small enterprises, and members of LGBT
population.

                                     SUMMARY OF THE KEY FINDINGS

The top findings of the survey could be summarized as follows:

       Majority of the citizens, if they had a dispute which they think should be settled in the court,
        would decide against such action, or would have at least a great dilemma
       The main reasons against settling the dispute in the court are predominantly related to basic
        access to judiciary - primarily the cost of proceedings, and access to solution - primarily
        duration of the proceedings
       Reasons related to access to justice were less spontaneously accentuated as the reasons against
        settling the dispute in the court, but when prompted, somewhat more than half of the citizens
        stated that the enforcement of the decision, as well as the fairness of the judgment would be
        for them the issues to consider
       Compared with population average citizens with low education, older citizens, and citizens who
        live out of urban areas feel the judicial system as less accessible to them in all aspects of basic
        accessibility (in terms of costs, availability of information, distance of court building and finding
        one’s way in the courthouse)
       All participants in focus groups agreed that processes in Serbia lasted too long and that costs
        were too high. For members of general population participating in focus groups these two
        reasons were the main obstacles to starting a court process.


                                                      45
   For farmers and owners of small business court cases are usually connected with debts and
    damages they have not been able to collect from other business entity or state. However, they
    often give up on starting a process due to the fact that enforcement of court decision is not
    satisfactory and that even after winning the case they are not able to collect the money.
   Members of LGBT population are mainly concerned about inadequate penal policy since they
    are often faced with situations when the judicial system does not adequately prosecute
    perpetrators of crimes against LGBT persons and thus does not contribute to reducing
    discrimination which is their main expectation from court cases (“to send message that
    discrimination is against the law”).

1. Readiness of general public to settle a dispute in a court
Survey findings show that majority of the citizens are not really eager to settle their disputes in the
court. As much as 69% of the citizens stated that, if they had a dispute which they think should be
settled in the court, they would decide against such action, or would have at least a great dilemma.
More precisely: 5% stated that they had already had a dispute they thought should be settled in the
court but decided against this action, 37% stated that they did not yet have such a dispute, but if they
had one they would not settle it in the court, 27% were indecisive, and only 31% stated that if they had a
dispute they feel should be settled in the court, they would do it. (Figure 1.1)

 2. Reasons why people decide not to settle their disputes in the court

Spontaniously mentioned reasons against settling disputes in the court

The financial accessibility was found to be the top of mind reason why citizens would not take the
dispute to the court even if they thought that it should be settled in the court . High costs were
spontaneously mentioned by 65% of the citizens as one of the top three reasons for not taking the
dispute to the court. The second most frequently mentioned reason was excessive duration of court
proceedings, but which was spontaneously mentioned by considerably smaller percentage of the
citizens, 49%. (Figure 2.1)

Every other citizen (50%) who stated to have had a dispute they thought should be settled in the court
but decided not to do it, named also high costs of proceedings as the main reason for their decision.

In total, reasons related to basic access to judiciary were predominant, followed by reasons related to
access to solution of the dispute, while substantially less people named reasons related to access to
justice. If spontaneously named reasons against taking disputes to the court were classified in three
groups, basic access to judiciary134, access to solution of the dispute135 and access to justice136, the
findings indicate that basic access to judiciary is predominant (67% of the citizens named one or more

134 Affordability of court costs, access to necessary information, geographical distance of the court,

reasons in this category); access to solution of the dispute was the second most important reason
mentioned by majority of the citizens (57% named one or more reasons in this category), while access to
justice was named by less than one third of the citizens (31% named one or more reasons in this
category). (Figure 2.2)

Basic access to judiciary

All groups participating in the focus groups (general population, owners of small businesses, farmers
and LGBT population) also referred to basic access to judiciary as the main obstacle to participate in
court proceedings. However, although they also find high costs of proceeding as the most important
reason (the same as general population participating in quantitative study), they differ from general
population by emphasizing the importance of inaccessibility of information as important issue.

Costs of court proceedings, particularly for litigations, are considered too expensive due to high lawyer’s
fee and in some cases fees for expert’s opinion and travel expenses. The opinion is that the largest share
of costs goes on the lawyer’s fee, because this fee is considered as too high (every appearance in front
of the court is charged from 50 Euros on) and at the same time majority of the lawyers prolong the
already sluggish court process in order to earn more (the bigger number of hearings, the more money
for the lawyers). Other fees, such as fee for expert opinion (for example, surveying the land, etc.) and
traveling to court located in some other town are not present in every court case, but they are typical
for cases farmers are facing.


         „The problem here is money, and the fact that the whole process would unnecessarily be stretched to a
         very long period of time. The hearing is postponed because one of the parties doesn’t appear, and I

                                                             49
        have to pay the lawyer for every appearance in court, and so it goes on for years. Plus I have to have
        money to go there. I cannot instigate the proceedings here, because the wood is not here. I have
        neither money nor time for that, because the courts function the way they function, and I would have
        to take days off work to finish it, and I would have to pay for all that. It isn’t worth the money.“
        Litigation about ungrounded use of inherited woods which was not instigated
In case that potential court users decide to reduce the costs through own engagement in court process,
they run into next big obstacle that is inaccessibility of information. Participants in focus groups stated
that they were limited to the data available on the Internet, since other sources of information were not
accessible for them (for example some citizens didn’t get free legal assistance in municipality when they
applied). On the other hand, online information about laws and procedures are very complicated and
time consuming for amateurs. Farm and business owners, due to lack of legal department and high costs
of lawyers, are forced to keep continuously informed about regulations in their area of business, but
they are facing the problem of frequent changes of regulations (especially in agriculture), which are also
believed to be complicated and to have “loopholes”. Farmers are especially sensitive about this topic,
since they are often faced with disputes with the state and they give up on court proceeding fearing that
they will run into one of these “loopholes in regulations” (for example, procedure for starting a case for
damage inflicted on property is complicated and not clear enough and farmers often fear they will lack
some procedure or document due to lack of information).


        „You read that such case can be concluded in particular peri od of time, you read about your rights, the
        duration of particular processes, but when you get involved in this story it’s something utterly different,
        it is much longer and more complicated.“ Focus group with general population
Members of LGBT population, as compared with other groups participating in focus group discussions,
pointed to different weaknesses of judiciary as very important. Thus, lack of information refers to lack of
information about antidiscrimination which is the reason why cases of discrimination acts against LGBT
are not even recognized. However, sometimes even when victims recognize discrimination, they do not
start a proceeding due to insufficient availability of information on starting a court procedure (often in
small communities where there are no NGOs that would provide free legal help). Another basic
inaccessibility of judiciary specific for LGBT population is inaccessibility in terms of protection of
anonymity of LGBT persons seeking justice. Namely, insufficiently developed mechanism for protection
of anonymity of LGBT persons in court cases is one of the most common reasons why even cases of
severe physical attacks are not reported to the Police and the judiciary. Many LGBT persons, especially
residents of small places, decide not to report their case because it would mean exposing their sexual
orientation to the public, which they are not prepared to do.

Access to solution of the dispute

Access to solution of the dispute that was named as second most important category of reasons in
quantitative study was also mentioned in focus group discussions, but the importance of specific
reasons within that category was somewhat different. Similar to general population participating in
quantitative study, focus group participants named length of proceeding as very important obstacle,
but unlike them they were more focused on subjective involvement, such as personal time spent and
stressfulness of that personal involvement.

                                                         50
Excessive duration of proceedings is often the reason for giving up potential dispute solution in court.
Experiences of focus groups participants who had some court case coincide with expectations of
participants who gave up looking for solution in court: processes last for years, there are too many
hearings, and time intervals between two hearings are too long (if there are 3 hearings a year, this
means that the litigation would last for 5-10 years). Long intervals between hearings are considered a
result of inefficient judiciary, overburdened judges, and frequent change of judges during the process.
On the other hand, it is believed that excessive number of hearings is often the result of deliberate
obstruction of the proceedings by one party on lawyer’s advice (failing to come to the hearing, request
for postponement, etc.).

Long processes with large number of hearings require significant personal involvement of parties in the
process and are extremely time consuming. Citizens who work in private companies are faced with
serious problem of absence from work. Namely, the courts work only on weekdays, so although they
have the right to be absent from work if they have a court hearing, the employed citizens are forced to
ask for a day off (from annual holiday). Farmers also emphasized personal time spent as a big obstacle
for them given that agriculture requires daily and all-day engagement.

In addition to financial costs and time, citizens are even more concerned about the stress that they are
exposed to due to long and inefficient processes which they expect. Each new hearing, particularly those
where other party is absent, represents an extraordinary irritation. Stress was particularly accentuated
by female participants who had long litigations over custody, whose children were exposed to repeated
psychological testing due to repeated hearings.

        population


Access to justice

Reasons against taking disputes to court that can be classified as obstacles to access to justice were
given greater importance by focus groups participants as compared with general population from the
quantitative study. These reasons were spontaneously mentioned and discussed in detail, and they
refer to fair judgment, inadequate penal policy and enforcement of court decision, which all together
reduces trust in judiciary.

Main obstacle to fair judgment is inability to prove the case to court and, in so me cases, judge’s
performance. Fear that case will not be proven in court is closely related to the fact that witnesses are
often not willing to testify in favor of plaintiff or that perpetrator of the offence was not found. Lack of
witnesses is particularly frequent in cases of violation of labor rights (illegal work and unpaid salaries),
when testimony of other employees is one of the few ways to prove the case, but likelihood of witness’s
testimony is very small because of fear from losing their job. Cases when perpetrators are not found are
usually cases of theft from small businesses or farms. Companies and farmers do not file a private
lawsuit in that case because they believe they won’t be able to compensate the damage in court and


                                                      51
they all agree that the state and the judicial system are not protecting them enough in cases of damage
inflicted by theft (for example farmers do not have the possibility to institute court proceedings for
minor damages or thefts on their fields, of value lower than 15 000 RSD, which are very frequent, and
they lose 500 EUR on annual basis approximately).

Other important factor that sometimes stands in the way of fair judgment is unsatisfactory judges’
performance. Inadequate work of judges is considered more a consequence of indifference and
insufficient knowledge about the subject, than of work overload. According to focus groups participants,
judges’ lack of expertise in some field is particularly visible in cases regarding agriculture and rights of
LGBT population. Activists who attended hearings in court proceedings of LGBT persons state that
judges are neither familiar enough with problems of LGBT population, nor sufficiently conscious and
without prejudice. According to them, judges tend to interpret discriminating statements of the accused
in such a way as to soothe them, so court records and statements may be interpreted as a sign of
penitence of the perpetrator for the offense committed.


        “Hearings are not taped, and court records are interpreted by judges, which is us ually absolutely
        different from what was really said in the courtroom. For example, the accused for threatening the
        organisers of Pride said that if people like them ruled, thinking of LGBT population, it would be
        tantamount to an atomic bomb, and that he didn’t want his daughter to grow in such an environment.
        This was not part of the court records and he got just 2 month probation because he repented
        sincerely.” Focus group with LGBT activists
Inadequate penal policy and inadequate interpretation of laws appeared to be very important issue for
LGBT population, since their general perception of justice and importance of fair judgments is somewhat
different compared to other target groups participating in focus group discussions. Namely, they do not
perceive court cases merely as a mechanism for protecting their personal rights, but primarily as a form
of struggle for the rights of the entire LGBT community. They expect the judicial system and the state to
send the message and educate broader public (message to LGBT population to actively protect their
rights and to perpetrators that discrimination is punishable) with adequate penal policy and adequate
judgments in cases of discrimination, but so far it was not the case. According to focus groups
participants, the legal frame provides good foundation, but implementation and interpretation of laws
and penal policy are inadequate, so the message actually sent is likely to be just the opposite (the
perpetrators get minimum punishment, if any).


        “On one hand, I feel this inner anger, because we have laws and the laws have their say, and we can
        see that it is not observed at all. The state and the judiciary have to take a clear stand and send the
        message that violence and discrimination are not allowed. You must not harm a gay or a lesbian. My
        life is not worth any less.” Focus group with LGBT activists


Enforcement of court decision is generally considered important, but it appears to be most important
for owners of small businesses and farmers who are often faced with disputes where they are not able
to collect receivables or damages from other business entity. In such cases they rarely decide to initiate
a lawsuit due to impossibility to collect damages/debts because other enterprise went bankrupt before


                                                       52
or during the court proceeding. Even when the court decides in their favor, it is impossible to enforce
this decision, and companies that initiate court proceedings have to pay high court fees, VAT on goods
that are not paid for and tax on profit, regardless of whether the debt is collected or not.


        „One is completely alone here, and one feels like giving up the whole business, both because of money
        and nerves. It hurts me most of all to know that I am right, and I still receive that miserable court
        envelope where they inform me that enforcement decision was rejected because of other party’s plea
        or closure of company. I considered this as my debacle because I trusted that man and I gave him the
        goods, and then I trusted the state that it will quickly and honestly do its job, and I finally realised that
        all that was in vain. In this entire circle everyone earned money except me: the court collected the
        taxes, the other party took the goods and used my money, the state took VAT, and I was the only one
        who financed all that.“ Focus group with small business


All the mentioned weaknesses of judiciary are believed to be consequences of the fact that there is no
mechanism to control the work of courts, They reduce trust in this system in all focus groups, especially
among those who are trying to run a private business (company or farm) and members of LGBT
population. Members of LGBT population perceive insufficient cooperation between courts, prosecutor’s
office and the Police as one of the major problems in judiciary regarding cases of discrimination,
including also likely shifting of responsibilities of these institutions to the other two. Other participants
pointed out corruption in the judicial system as a huge problem, which is also considered extremely
widespread.

Relevance of promted reasons against settling disputes in the court

While costs of court case and duration dominate among the spontaneously mentioned reasons in the
quantitative study, when citizens are offered a list of reasons, they are a lot more likely to notice also
other problems of court accessibility as relevant in their case. When citizens see a list of reasons
instead of answering spontaneously, the results change a bit. The reasons most relevant for most
citizens are still costs of court case and its duration, but in a different order. In addition, citizens are also
a lot more likely to single out other relevant reasons they didn’t think of when answering spontaneously.
More than 60% of citizens indicate distrust in court system in general, and more than half that court
decision would not be enforced anyway, and that they do not expect a fair judgment. Even 45% suggest
that finding necessary information would be a problem, and more than a fourth that they would have
difficulties in finding their way around the courthouse and that courthouse is too distant from the place
where they live. (Figure 2.3).

3. Demographic differences in perceived accessibility of judiciary

Compared with population average, citizens with low education, older citizens, and citizens who live
out of urban areas feel that the judicial system is less accessible to them in terms of basic accessibility.
Citizens with low education (elementary school and less) and citizens over 60 years of age perceive the
judicial system as less accessible to them in all aspects of basic accessibility: in terms of costs,
availability of information, distance of court building and finding one’s way in the courthouse. Citizens
who live out of urban areas, compared with population average, see more problems in obtaining
necessary information, finding their way in the courthouse and distance of the courthouse.

If they were in a situation to decide whether to take a dispute to court or not, 90% of poorly educated
citizens and 82% of the elderly would consider trial costs a problem (which is 24%, and 6%, respectively,
more than population average regarding lawyer-related costs, and 26%, and 5%, respectively, more in
terms of court costs); 63% of the poorly educated and 58% of the elderly stated that they would have a
problem with finding necessary information (18% and 13%, respectively, more than population
average); 44% of the poorly educated and 40% of the elderly believe they would have problems finding
their way in the courthouse (17% and 13%, respectively, more than population average), while 42% of
the poorly educated and 36% of the elderly believe they would have problems with distance of



                                                                 54
courthouse from their place of residence (15% and 9%, respectively, more than population average).
(Figure 3.1)

Focus group discussions suggest that citizens themselves perceive socio-economic status as one of the
main determinants of accessibility of justice. Participants unanimously claim that the judicial system is
not equally accessible to all citizens, but that accessibility depends on socio-economic position. Giving
up potential court case due to estimation that outcome won’t be positive even though it should be,
according to the law, is particularly present if the other party to a case is considered „strong“ in terms of
material wealth, „connections“, position. It is generally believed that choice of lawyer determines the
course and outcome of the process to a great extent, and choice of lawyer depends on available
finances. Expensive lawyer does not only mean great knowledge and professional skills, “but the price
also includes acquaintance with the judge“.


          „Cases end quickly and efficiently only if you are a big shot and if you are rich. We are all allegedly
          equal, only that some are „more equal,“ so justice is a lot more accessible to them.“ Focus group with
          general population

Most citizens who live out of urban areas, 53%, think that they would have problems with accessing
information (8% more than population average); 40% think they would have problems finding their way
in the courthouse (13% more than average), while 43% consider distance of a courthouse a problem
(16% more than population average). (Figure 3.1)

4. Citizens’ awareness of the organizations providing legal assistance free of charge

Great majority of citizens of Serbia, 83%, are not aware of any organization or institution that provides
legal assistance free of charge. Only 8% of citizens say that legal assistance is available in municipalities,
and 4% mention the ombudsman; total of 1% mention NGOs, or civil associations, or consumer
associations. It is interesting that 1% mention even the Bar Association as an organization providing legal
assistance free of charge. Others (about 2%) mention unions, the Faculty of Law, media, insurance
companies and court. (Figure 4.1)

Finally, only 3% of citizens say they have used free legal assistance and great majority of these 3% (93%)
were satisfied with it.

Results from focus groups imply that engagement of legal assistants can empower citizens in their
decision to initiate court proceedings. Namely, while citizens who approached free aid in municipality
and didn’t get adequate assistance usually gave up on court process, experiences of LGBT population
were quite the opposite. Majority of court cases related to violation of LGBT rights have been started
with active participation of NGOs, while individuals start cases on their own very rarely.
Organizations provide legal and financial assistance, with active support and encouraging individuals
before and during the process.

 METHODOLOGY
 Objective of the survey that will be presented here is to analyze the position of women in
 judicial system, from perspective of service users and those who work in the system. It is based
 on qualitative methods of data collection. As quantitative study within the survey on judiciary
 has already been completed, qualitative methodology has been chosen to provide a deeper
 insight and context for interpretation of some of the obtained data which relate to gender
 topics. Two methods were used – discussion in focus groups and in-depth interviews.

 ABOUT FOCUS GROUPS DISCUSSION:

 Discussion in focus groups is one of the methods of qualitative research which makes
 possible deeper understanding of behavior, attitudes, motives, etc. The group discussion is
 facilitated by a trained moderator, and in this research the duration of focus group discussion
 was circa 90 minutes on average. There were 8 participants in each focus group discussion.
 This research concept makes possible collection of extensive information in a relatively short
 period of time, but the results can only be considered as opinions typical for particular
 segment of population.

 STRUCTURE OF THE GROUPS:

 A total of 6 focus group discussions were realized within this study, of which 3 were with the
 women who had some court case or dispute which could have been a subject of court
 proceedings, and 3 were with the women from legal profession: judges, lawyers and associates
 in Prosecutor’s Office. Structure of the groups was defined in such a way to reflect the type of
 cases for which women usually turn to court.

KEY FINDINGS


Introduction: Results from quantitative study

Follow up study of the research Perceptions of Judiciary Performance in Serbia (2010) was
conducted in 2013. This was a quantitative study covering representative samples of several
populations: general population, business sector, lawyers, judges, public prosecutors and
employees from administrative sector.

Differences between male and female court users
Similar to baseline survey the data obtained from the persons who participated in a court
case that was concluded in the past 3 years did not indicate significant differences between
the answers of female and male respondents. Just several significant differences were
observed when it comes to experience with judicial; system, but they mainly do not indicate
a different treatment by the court.
Difference between genders is primarily reflected in type of court cases and position in the
process that they are in. Majority of female respondents who participated in the survey had
a civil case (81%), in contrast to male respondents who participated in civil cases to a much
lesser extent (49%), but they participated in higher percentage in criminal (24%) and
Misdemeanor (26%) cases. Female respondents were mainly in position of plaintiff/ accuser
(44%) or party in the proceedings (37%), while male respondents were the defendants in as
much as one half of the cases. Both female and male respondents had a lawsuit against other
physical persons in majority of cases, although female respondents did it in higher
percentage (77%) than male respondents (62%). On the other hand, higher percentage of
male respondents had a process in which the other party was a state institution (21% against
7% in case of women).


                                           61
On indicators of efficiency of court processes, accessibility, quality and integrity no gender-
related differences were found between men and women who participated in the court
proceedings. The only significant difference indicates that smaller percentage of women
were pronounced guilty in criminal cases (53%) in comparison with men (75%), but this data
should be analyzed taking into account the subject of the case, which this size of sample
doesn’t allow.



Differences in perception of judiciary between men and women in general
population
If we observe the entire sample of general population which also includes the citizens who
did not have contact with judicial system, the differences in perception between men and
women can be detected. The differences in perception among general population show
that female citizens have a more positive perception of judiciary than male citizens.
Statistically significant differences between male and female citizens can be noticed if we
observe the efficiency of judicial system. Female citizens generally have a somewhat more
positive perception of the efficiency of judicial system in Serbia, although negative
perception is prevalent both among men and women (17% of women have positive opinion
and 12% of men). Similarly, higher percentage of female respondents (43%) than male
respondents (32%) think that court system is fair, unbiased and nor corrupted.
Men are more critical regarding quality of work of judiciary. Men are more likely to evaluate
quality of judiciary in the past few years negatively (46%). Also one third of women evaluate
quality of work of judiciary negatively (33%).
Evaluation of fairness of judiciary has the same trend, or we can notice more positive
attitude of women, and more critical attitude of men: women perceive fairness of judiciary
more positively (58%) than men do (46%). On the other hand, when assessing fairness of
judiciary through evaluation of equal treatment of citizens in terms of their gender, age,
place of residence, education, socio-economic status, disability and nationality, there are no
statistically significant differences between men and women. Although there are no
differences, almost a third of men and women believe that the judicial system doesn’t treat
men and women equally.
More positive attitude of women towards judiciary is also visible when assessing trust in the
judicial system in general. Women have more trust (30%) than men do (22%), but women
also have more trust in other state institutions as well.
What’s interesting though is that these differences are smaller or don’t exist among
respondents with experience with the judicial system.

Findings from Focus Groups: Disputes Women Are Often Facing

Selection of participants in focus group discussion who had court case or some dispute, coincides with
assessment of professionals regarding the cases in which women turn to court more frequently than
men. These are mainly the disputes from the area of family law: custody, child support, paternity suit,
deprivation of parental rights. Another situation related to the violation of labor rights is the fact that
women often happen to be sacked after maternity leave, but these cases are not brought before the
court. All mentioned cases will be presented in this section from perspective of users of court services
and female professionals (judges, associates in Prosecutor’s Office, lawyers).



Family Law: Disputes with Ex Partner / Father of a Child
After the breakup of marriage or common-law marriage, women who have a child with ex-partner are
often faced with some of the following problems:
          Inappropriate amount of child support and irregular payment
          Inequitable division of joint property
          Custody over children

In some cases women are also faced with utter disinterest of other parent to perform his or her parental
duties:
          When there is a need to deprive a parent from his or her parental rights
          Negation of paternity in common-law marriages

In such cases women try to exercise their own and their children’s rights before the court, but, due to
general distrust of judicial system they often give it up. This part of the research presents the biggest
problems that participants in FGDs were faced with trying to exercise their rights.

Problem of child support
It is estimated that one out of three or even one out of two parents in Serbia doesn’t pay child support
for own child. As in great majority of the cases mothers have custody over children, they have to take
care about all costs related to upbringing of children due to non-payment of child support.
Participants in focus groups pointed several problems in the process of determining the child support
and then the sticking point in the process of collection of the unpaid child support. Professionals also
mentioned the same situations, but they arbitrate responsibility somewhat differently.


1. During the official process of divorce or when the child is born out of wedlock, and the common-law
marriage breaks down, the court decides on the amount of child support which the other parent who
has custody over the child has to pay. The money is intended for child support, and the amount of
child support is determined based on child’s needs and income of the parent who pays child support.
Participants in focus groups almost unanimously agree that the determined amount of child support is

                                                    63
not sufficient for basic needs of the child (cost of education, excursions, clothes, toys). Majority of
mothers receive between 8 and 10 thousand dinars for one child, which according to them, is just a
small portion of other parent’s income. They believe that, due to inability to ascertain the real
incomes, the court determines such trifle amounts of child care.
In such cases the other parent conceals income in order to pull down the child care amount to the
lowest possible level. Incomes are reduced in several ways:
         By illegal work (on black market): The person receives salary in cash, while officially
            registered as unemployed, or is registered with a minimum wage while the rest of salary is
            received in cash. Such system of salary is possible only in private enterprises, and such
            cases are not rare. In majority of cases this is the decision of the employer, but in some
            cases the employee himself asks to be removed from the records in order to pay as small
            as possible child support.
         Change of property owner: It often happens in Serbia that households are
            multigenerational, and in these cases the official owner of real estate is mainly someone
            from the oldest generation, and not the person involved in dispute over child support.
            Nevertheless, in some cases, when they have an immovable property, the persons
            involved in a dispute transfers the ownership to his parents.

Participants in focus groups who had a problem with child support are dissatisfied with the mechanism
available to the court to ascertain the amount of child support. On one hand they hold the state
responsible for allowing so many people work in the gray zone, but also the courts which are incapable
of ascertaining the real income, or in some cases underestimates the needs pf the children.


            Snežana is unemployed. She has a child from common -law marriage. The determined amount of
            child care is not proportional to real income of the father.

            „He acknowledged the child, and the child support was determined. He is a rich man and we are
            at the edge of poverty. I am very dissatisfied. Sometimes I think that we are in “Candid Camera”
            show. When all of us were in the courtroom the judge told us that the child support is
            determined to be between 5 000 dinars and 8 000 dinars, but since he was an entrepreneur, she
            fixed it at 8 000 dinars. I was only crying because I was left alone with the child. I asked the
            court to ascertain his life style to prove how comfortably he lives. But no one did the fieldwork.
            He is now registered as being on a sick leave. According to official report of Tax Office the
            revenue of his company in 2013 was 0 million dinars. The judge’s explanation is that this
            amount is sufficient for a child. Even social assistance is bigger than that, and I am not
            employed, I don’t have parents, I am completely alone.“



Both the lawyers representing women in such situations and the judges who make the decisions are
aware of various manipulations with the amount of income, but they think that the court is doing
everything possible so that the children would get the appropriate support. In their opinion, the cause of
problems is widespread gray economy and the fact that the state doesn’t have adequate mechanisms to
eliminate gray economy and illegal work in it.

                                                      64
                Lawyer: If they have a child, it’s a tragedy. Fathers do not pay child support because they
                believe that the money is going to mother, not to the child. In such cases the court is not
                responsible but the state. In fact he earns 2 000 Euros and officially he receives a minimal
                wage.

                Judge: Everyone who is registered receives a minimal wage. They have a minimal wage and
                a villa in Dedinje. This is the problem of the state. Courts cannot do anything about that.



2. Despite the fact that the court has determined the amount of regular monthly child support, it
often happens that child support is not paid. Almost all participants who are single mothers have
been faced with that problem. When judge’s decision on child support is not respected, mother who
represents the child can initiate enforcement proceedings by submitting an application for
enforcement, and she could also start criminal proceedings against the father for not paying the child
support.

Forced execution is carried out by confiscation and sale of the debtor's assets, by deducting the amount
of child support from the wages paid by the employer to the account, or otherwise. Due to the
mentioned formal absence of any property, and the fact that salaries are received in cash, possibilities of
the court are very limited. Deducting the amount of child support from the salary is possible only if the
person is employed in state-owned enterprise or public institution.


                     Judge’s associate who works with enforcements states that it is very difficult to get
                     hold of the data about the debtor’s property: If I ask from the Credit Bureau to see in
                     which banks the debtor has accounts, they simply state that this is not in their
                     competence. This means that I have to go to all banks individually. This is a
                     harassment of the court. That is, the court is very humiliated by the available
                     mechanisms. I almost have to make my own investigation.



If they decide at all to claim the unpaid child support women mainly initiate criminal proceedings.
Representatives of Prosecutor’s Office state that that this is one of the proceedings which is considered
to be urgent, and mainly efficient. The judges share the same opinion, but the problem of enforcement
remains. The process is mainly conducted through the following steps:

                   Opportunism: the debtor is given a deadline (mainly from 3-6 months) to pay the
                    overdue child supports amounts, and if he does that within the defined deadline,
                    the criminal proceedings will not be initiated. According to professionals, great
                    majority of fathers do not pay the debt, but prolong the beginning of process in
                    this way.

                        Associate in Prosecutor’s Office: „I finished only one case based on opportunism.“




                                                     65
                    Criminal proceedings with the most probable suspended sentence: The debtor is
                     given a deadline to pay the remaining child support amounts, but if he doesn’t do
                     it the suspended sentence is revoked (and prison sentence is pronounced instead
                     of suspended one). Nevertheless, this type of sentence is not frequently passed in
                     cases of criminal proceedings because of unpaid child care.


                     Associate in Prosecutor’s Office: It I the best if the sentence is conditioned, so there are
                     no double standards.



3. Representatives of judicial system think that these proceedings are initiated as urgent ones, and that
the system functions well. However, they mentioned the problem of inconsistent judicial practice
regarding statute of limitations and problem of length of proceedings due to inability to deliver the
subpoena and court decisions. They think that the women themselves make a mistake because they
avoid lawsuit for years, so the debt becomes so big that it is impossible to pay it at once.

On the other hand, users of court services think that the proceedings are not efficient and they last too
long. They also mention failure to appear in court and unfounded appeals of the other party as the
factors which influence the efficiency of court proceedings.


When one is given a term until which the child care must be paid (opportunism), and the money is not paid
until that date, the court should react ex officio, instead of me sending the letters afterwards. The court
doesn’t work at all. Since September I don’t have a Public Prosecutor. He hasn’t been assigned for nine
months. I went there to inquire. And the judge also hasn’t been assigned.



Nevertheless, the judgment isn’t a guarantee either that the debt will be paid. According to one of
the judges who participated in FGD, the state must secure a mechanism, not the judiciary: «We don’t
have a mechanism to withdraw the money by default. There should be some sanctions on the level of
state to ensure the payment of child support. This issue must be solved by the state, not by the court
and judiciary.»

Women who do not receive the child support initiate the proceedings several times. They think that,
being single mothers, they aren’t protected either by the state or the judiciary.

I sued him four times. The first sentence was to pay 200 000 dinars within 6 months . He didn’t pay anything.
He should have gone to jail for such thing, and pay the money for humanitarian purposes. Then I went to
another court, and filed a request for enforcement which couldn’t be collected. After ten months the judge
received some slips proving that he made the payment, so I received a reply form her that he was paying
everything in time. I didn’t receive any money whatsoever, and he showed her the slips.



For mothers who are not employed and they take care about the children, child support is sometimes
the only income. On the other hand, when they have a court decision about the amount of child

                                                        66
support, they do not have the right to social assistance even when father doesn’t pay the child care. In
such cases they have the money only on paper.
Representatives of Prosecutor’s Office also report of occasional abuse of the process, that is, women
who turn to court because of unpaid child support, while in reality they regularly receive it. This is
possible in situations when father pays child support in cash, but without a receipt, so there is no
material proof that the money was actually given to mother. Nevertheless, such malversations are
revealed soon and mothers risk being accused for false reporting.



Division of common property
According to representatives of judicial system and lawyers, all property acquired during marriage is
mainly divided evenly between the former spouses. The problems occur in cases when immovable
property acquired before the marriage is owned by parents of one of the partners, and both partners
invested in this property during marriage. As in majority of cases in Serbia the property is mainly owned
by male partners, female partners usually try to realize their right to division of property within divorce
proceedings, although they are not the official owners of these immovables.
The experts estimate that it is necessary to possess material proof about joint investment or have a
witness to prove it, to ensure that the party in proceedings who is not an owner proves her or his right
to division of immovable property. They also think that it is difficult to make generalized conclusions,
because each lawsuit has its specificities, but women are generally thought to be unprepared for such
situations. Namely, majority of them do not think in advance about the possibility of divorce, so they do
not keep the bills or receipts.
Due to the perceived long duration of proceedings and high costs, plus fear that they will lose, a number
of women give up the lawsuit for division of property.
   Jelena is a divorced mother of a nine-year old son. Before the divorce, she lived with her husband in
   an apartment his parents gave him, and invested money in its renovation. After her husband told her
   he had no love for her any more, Jelena and her son moved in with her parents. There was no
   reconciliation and her ex-husband started a new relationship. She gave up the lawsuit for division of
   assets thinking that it would last too long, cost too much and be too difficult to prove.

   My lawyer told me that I made a mistake because I left the apartment. He told me that I should have
   stayed there in order to get something. Women suffer beating and things just to get something for
   their children, since judiciary is the way it is. I gave up the lawsuit for division of assets because it
   would last too long and I would have to pay the judge and lawyer at each hearing. One hearing with a
   lawyer costs 100 Euros. Writing a pleading for divorce costs 150 Euros. I can’t stay in the same
   apartment with a man who tells me that he doesn’t want me anymore.




                                                    67
However, lawyers state that some women who turn to them for help just give up the divorce in order
not to lose „roof over their heads.“ These are mainly unemployed women, and there are a lot of them in
Serbia, they have children and they can’t return to their parents’ home out of some reason.


Lawyer: „A woman comes with a formed notion about how much she should take. But such calculation is
often mistaken. Women give up sometimes when they see they won’t get much. Women who live in the
West don’t have to suffer a bad marriage because of poor financial situation, as women here do, because the
state is supporting them.“



Court disputes over child custody
Representatives of the judicial system as well as professionals from private practice assess the Family
Law positively in general. They believe that women are in a good position, especially in child custody
cases. They state that mothers usually get the children after divorce and that these processes are rather
efficient.


Lawyer: As for family issues, it’s quite fine, since women are usually given custody over children unless they
are alcoholics, drug addicts and the like. I think that judiciary is favoring women a bit there, but there is a
problem with proving child support and the social system is to blame there. I have no other objections.



However, when father won’t give up the fight for guardianship, processes can last for several years
even, which is a complex stress for the family and children in particular.


Judge: Each process is sad and terrible if the court is to decide who will take the child. And if they don’t
adhere to that decision, then you are in a situation that can make you crazy. Child is screaming and Social
Welfare Center gave it to the mother and you know that Center is to solve it, it’s huge stress for me. I had a
case once that Social Welfare Center suggested imprisonment of a parent. Just imagine the stress for that
child. We don’t have a team that cures, we just have a team that intervenes.



Both representatives of the judicial system and women who took part in a court proceeding of setting
custody, underline importance of Social Welfare Center in that process. Team of experts in Social
Welfare Center (psychologist, pedagogue, social worker) is in charge of divorce process and suggests the
court which parent to give the child to. Court doesn’t have to accept this suggestion, but it mainly does.
Users of court services describe the employed in Social Welfare Center as indifferent, incompetent,
inefficient and even corrupt in some cases: These services are in charge of everything and court decisions
depend on them. The court is not thinking about you. It just accepts Center’s suggestion. Judges are not
as harsh towards the employed in SWC, but they consider inefficient and not skilled enough staff one
of the main reasons for long procedures.




                                                       68
Judge: The main problem is that Social Welfare Centers are underperforming and they are not enabled to do
something like that, so you are in a situation that things are agonizing and too long. It’s a major trigger for
such long processes. Performance of Social Welfare Centers is scandalous.



Another common reason for inefficiency of court proceedings is deliberate stalling of the other party to
a proceeding in terms of not appearing at hearings, avoiding to receive subpoenas and complaining on
issued decisions.
Although court decision is usually made in favor of mother, some fathers do not adhere to court
decisions. It happens that some of them avoid giving children to their mother who is a legal guardian or
they take children by force. Another criminal proceeding is initiated then for non-compliance with
decisions and child abduction. These processes can also last long and they depend a lot on the Police
(for example locating a father who keeps changing addresses). In addition, it is not possible to unite all
proceedings, given that they have different grounds (civil proceeding, different crimes).
We shall here present a case of one single mother and her extensive process regarding child custody.
Experts state that this case is kind of extreme and rare in practice, but we shall present it here as an
example of the extent to which inefficiency of the court system and different factors can affect a family.
We underline that the case is described based on mother’s testimonial during a focus group discussion,
and that it doesn’t include document analysis or formal court decisions.


  Dušica, 36 years old, is a graduate economist from Belgrade, currently unemployed. More than 6 years
  ago (2009.) she initiated divorce proceedings, but she withdrew the charges before going to court,
  thinking that it would be too stressful for children at the moment when starting school and
  kindergarten. As a reaction to Dušica’s withdrawal of charges and after she becomes unemployed, her
  husband files a complaint for divorce. „He told me that he would take the children and that I should
  leave. I went to my mother’s and informed the Social Welfare Center that children were with me. They
  asked me where I got the courage to do that. My husband told them I was crazy and unstable. The
  woman from the Social Welfare Center threatened me that they would deprive me of my parental right
  if I didn’t return the children. Then I found out that she was bribed by my ex-husband.“
  Frightened by the Center threats, Dušica returns her children to the apartment where she used to live
  with her husband and goes to the Social Welfare Center to the appointment. During that visit, her
  husband calls her on the phone and tells her that the door lock is replaced. „He told me that I didn’t
  live there any longer. He said «Children are safe, and you do whatever you like». The employed in SWC
  heard it, but they didn’t react. They told me he was a teacher.“
  Dušica filed a report to the police because of the changed door lock. At the next appointment in SWC,
  in the presence of her husband, the social worker handed her a piece of paper with handwritten
  instruction on her access to children with the comment „either this way or no way“. From the moment
  the door lock was changed (in the summer), Dušica couldn’t get in touch with her children, and she
  didn’t know where they were.
  At the first hearing, a temporary measure was adopted that father was the guardian, while mother
  had the right to see her children by the already issued model. Temporary measure is in effect until
  expert analysis. „He went to the judge and told her that I had left the community and she believed him
  because he brought a false statement of a false witness.“ Dušica files a complaint, but nothing

                                                       69
happens for months. The model of access is not implemented at first, and when she finally starts to
see her children at the order of the Center, it is always with the father present, in an apartment where
children don’t actually live, but are registered at that address. Dušica claims that the conditions in this
apartment are extremely poor: heating is off, and all furniture is gradually thrown out with continuous
molesting by the ex-husband.
She made recordings of the apartment and she took the recordings to the SWC, but there was no
reaction. Dušica also initiated a criminal proceeding together with a civil proceeding. A year passed,
but there was still no expert analysis. „He refused to pay for expert analysis, so I paid 70 000 dinars in
2011. We had five expert sessions, and he brought the children only twice. Court expert’s analysis says
that he is not fit to be a parent.“

Expert report arrives after one year, early in 2012. Thereunder shall be issued a temporary solution
outside the hearing, and mother becomes the guardian and father gets to see the children by the
model previously made for the mother. Father won’t give the children up and Dušica initiates
enforcement proceedings. „ I was forced to initiate enforcement proceeding in March. He got the fine
of 150 000 dinars, and then of a million dinars. He took the children to Montenegro twice without my
consent. He changed nine addresses and I reported all that. I reported him for not adhering to court
decision and for illegal keeping of underage children. The police tell me they can’t find him, and he is a
teacher and he goes to school every day to work. The Police came to his address three times and they
didn’t find him. His brothers work in the police force and when he was in custody twice, he was
released because his children had no one to live with. He has never appeared before the investigating
judge and I have never seen a document saying that he was released from custody. “
Also in 2013. Dušica is trying to track the address where her children live. She only sees them in school
at school breaks, but she can’t take them from school because it would be considered hijacking, and
her divorce proceeding was still not complete. She claims that her children are neglected in terms of
hygiene, but no one reacts to the recordings she takes to the Social Welfare Center.
Dušica’s parents who haven’t seen their grandparents since 2009. filed charges against their father.
After a long proceeding, the Appellate court confirms the decision in 2013. that grandparents can see
the children in the Social Welfare Center, for an hour on the first Wednesday each month. Father
doesn’t adhere to this decision, but he takes the children to the Center in August. Dušica was in the
Center then and she took the children with the approval of the employed. Father tried to take them
away. „Children rushed to me when they saw me and I said ‘This is the enforcement’. I wanted to do
that before many witnesses. I asked whether I had the right to take my children, and they told me in
the Center – ‘’Yes, of course’’. As soon as they told me that, I ran down the stairs where Andrija was
trying to take them away. He grabbed them both and started to run to the other side of the street that
was not under the jurisdiction of the Social Welfare Center. If he only succeeded to cross the street,
everything would have failed because he was preparing papers to flee abroad. I myself stop him
without anyone interfering or reacting, not even the security guards. I call the Police and they ask me
why the Social Welfare Center didn’t call. I finally take my children and enter a taxi. That was the first
time I was alone with my children. I inform the police and all other services that I took the children and
they tell me ‘Relax madam.’
One day after she took the children, her ex-husband tries to take them away from the house in Surčin.
Attempted kidnapping and life in constant fear last for the next few months. „I was stretching laundry
out to dry. I enter the house and see my child’s legs hanging over the balcony and Andrija pulling him,
trying to kidnap him, while the child is screaming. I call the Police and they ask me whether there is any
physical contact. I save the child, take him inside, and I am under siege for two hours while he is
banging on the door and climbing the balcony. I call the police again, and they tell me to come to them
and report what’s happening. Then he was always around waiting, following us and waiting for an

                                                   70
  opportunity to take the children. I complained and they told me to submit a motion to the court. Even
  my neighbors reported him for disturbing public peace and order. He dared to do that because the
  judiciary did nothing.“

  In October 2013, the Social Welfare Center makes a motion for restraining order, but the decision was
  never issued. The first new hearing was held in December. Father didn’t appear. The case was
  prolonged because of the reform of judiciary. Dušica is officially still married, with temporary decision
  on guardianship. One hearing was held in in 2014. Father didn’t appear again, because he refused to
  receive the subpoena even though he was informed by phone. Four judges have already worked on
  the case because of the judiciary reform. „Each new judge asks for a lot of time to get familiar with the
  case because it is very complex “.
  At the end of 2013, Dušica receives a temporary decision that children should spend their winter
  holidays with their father. She consults the Social Welfare Center. „They tell me that I let him take the
  children to their friends’ birthday parties, and if he returns the children then it would be a signal that
  he would also return them from their winter holiday. He did return them from a birthday party and I
  gave him the children in order to adhere to the court decision, since otherwise it would just be in his
  favor in our divorce proceedings.“ Although he is to leave children at home with their grandfather,
  father takes children to Dušica’s workplace and she gets fired. While daughter is approaching her
  mother, he takes the son away.
  The son is still with his father, in spite of the temporary decision on guardianship. He enrolled him in
  another school. According to Dušica, he showed the school director the first temporary measure that
  was no longer in effect. After talking to the director, and after some time, Dušica takes her son from
  school and takes him home. Eight days after that his father takes him away again from his school in
  Surčin and Dušica hasn’t seen him since and child hasn’t come to school. Dušica urges the Ministry,
  the ombudsman, the media and all relevant institutions and files charges against the Social Welfare
  Center. The proceeding is still underway.
  „My son is not going to school. Misdemeanor proceeding is initiated against Andrija because my child
  went to school for only 8 days since the beginning of this semester. Andrija is still coming to school
  because he wants to kidnap Milica. Children are hiding her in school. I haven’t worked ever since
  because I am her guardian now and I am trying to protect her. Criminal proceeding is already
  underway. Andrija appeared in only one hearing when he gave a document from a Primary Healthcare
  Unit saying that my son was grabbed from his mother’s hands and that he is coming accompanied by
  his father. My son was not with his father that day, but with me. I have it in writing. I will press
  criminal charges for that as well. All I have is a restraint order for him. I went to the SWC the other day
  and they told me that the judge asked for reports from both SWC and both police units and that I was
  to go to the Institute for Mental Illnesses to check whether I was mentally ill. They are doing this just to
  prolong the proceeding. They won’t find anything. What has the system done to protect me? Nothing.
  What has the system done to protect my children? Nothing. A disaster.“




Establishing paternal affiliation
Focus group participants, whose children were not acknowledged by their biological fathers voluntarily,
were primarily faced with some personal barriers when deciding whether to establish paternal
affiliation in court. Impression is that these women consider the decision to give birth to their children
their own decision, denying any responsibility of the partner, unless he wants to play his role of a

                                                     71
parent. This is the reason why they mainly don’t perceive court establishing of paternal affiliation as a
formal way to exercise their child’s rights, which this process actually is, in the opinion of professionals.
On the contrary, these mothers perceive court proceeding as a pressure put on father to accept the
child emotionally, which they consider impossible. „I can’t force him to accept the child if he doesn’t
want to. I decided to have this child, it has nothing to do with him.“
Women who are willing, though, to judicially establish the rights of their children consider this process
financially unattainable. Price of expert DNA analysis is about 250 Euros, and it was a lot more
expensive in the past. Respondents, mainly unemployed, don’t have this money. They are aware that
their costs would be reimbursed after issuing of court decision, but they don’t have the initial money for
the lawyer and fees. They also give the proceeding up if they see that they won’t be able to charge the
late alimonies (father works in illegal market, he owns no real estate).



   Marija has a nine-year old daughter with her former friend. The pregnancy was not planned, since
   the relationship was not emotional, but friendship. Soon after the child was born, he moved to the
   UA. He didn’t acknowledge the child and he sees her occasionally. Marija is thinking about initiating a
   paternity suit, primarily in order to define child support, and about filing charges retroactively for not
   paying child support in the past. Money is the major barrier here and the fact that child’s father lives
   abroad.
   When my daughter’s father left for America in 2005, I needed 800 Euros to establish paternal filiation.
   I didn’t have that money. I don’t have it now either because I am unemployed. Plus I couldn’t catch
   him because he was leaving. Where was I to get so much money? I was cornered. I will sue him as
   soon as I collect some money, but this is not a guarantee that I will get alimony for all these years.
   Court will decide, but it can’t pay instead of him, unfortunately. He doesn’t own any real estate, he
   doesn’t live here. Who knows how long it will all last. He won’t even appear in court. And when I get
   the court decision, it will just remain a dead letter.

Given that several factors, both personal and associated with court proceedings, take part in making the
decision on initiating a proceeding, it happens sometimes that women have to wait for several years. As
for those who decide to file charges after 10 years of waiting, they have a problem because these cases
are subject to a statute of limitations. When a child turns 10 years of age, mother can no longer file
charges, but only the child can. Such a proceeding, while the child is still underage, is unacceptable for
mothers, because they believe that it would be too much of a stress for the child.


I didn’t know that I was to sue him because he was financially stronger than me and I didn’t think I would
succeed. I was afraid he would take my child away. I was only 22 and I didn’t know anything. When I decided
to do it, it was subject to a statute of limitations. I was making a mistake by not submitting documents on
time. That’s why the complaint was withdrawn. They told me that Ivana had to file charges, and I couldn’t
watch my child being represented in court by someone else. I didn’t want to put her in that kind of situation.



Termination of father’s parental rights

                                                       72
Focus group participants whose spouses or partners did not adequately perform their parental role
during marriage or a relationship, state that these fathers usually lose interest to remain an active part
of their children’s life after break-up. Most of them never see their children, so there is no need that
they are formally deprived of their parental rights. As they say, this is a „relief“ for them because it
would be very difficult for them to opt for this step even when necessary. They primarily fear
condemnation of their children - „I don’t want her to tell me one day You wouldn’t let me see my father,
you drove him away. I let her see on her own what her father is like, that he doesn’t call, that he doesn’t
come when he promises... She has stopped asking about him now.“
When fathers leave their children, the only barrier that single mothers are faced with is administration
related to children in cases when signatures of both parents are necessary. As they say, they can
complete most things on their own, such as obtaining a passport, but traveling abroad is the most
difficult problem to solve.
The only way to travel with children, if father refuses to give consent, is to file a complaint for partial
deprivation of parental right related to travels. In case representatives of Social Welfare Center want to
help, they can issue a certificate that mother can travel with children even if the process is still
underway. However, some focus group participants who don’t have good communication with the other
parent didn’t know how the system functioned and which steps they should have taken in order to
travel with children.


„He was given a model of access that he didn’t adhere to. When the child was to travel to Rhodes,
he didn’t want to sign the papers. I was very persistent because the trip was for free, so I asked the
Social Welfare Center for the permit. First I had to initiate a court proceeding for partial
deprivation of parental right regarding making decisions on travels. I begged them. My child was
allowed to travel. When she turned 18, I didn’t need the permit anymore, so I withdrew the
charges.

Violation of Labor Law
Violation of labor law in Serbia is considered as very frequent. However, participants in focus
groups which were faced with such situations at workplace believe that this is not a gender-
related topic, because it hits equally both women and men, while the judicial system is equally
accessible or inaccessible to both women and men when it comes to labor disputes. The only
situation which is considered as a „typical female problem at work “ is when a women is fired
after maternity leave.



Fired after maternity leave
Several participants in focus group discussions were faced with such situation, when after the
maternity leave they could no longer count with their job. The employers in questions provided
to them quite decent working conditions and had a very good relationship with them prior to
pregnancy. Respondents believe that their rights are violated in this way, that women,
particularly mothers are utterly unprotected, but they also think that the employers take
advantage of „loopholes“. Namely, in each of such cases the employers justified the dismissal
by reduced workload or elimination of their job position, which the law treats as a legitimate
reason for dismissal. Due to such situation the women do not opt for court proceedings
primarily because they have doubts about positive outcome, and they also think that they don’t
have time and money needed for that.



   Jasmina worked in a bakery and had an indefinite term employment contract. Working
   conditions were very good. The problem arises when she opens a maternity leave and the
   employer refuses to pay her for that period. She turns to inspectorate for help.
   On 9th August I was supposed to return to work, but on 8th August the bookkeeper called me
   to come and sign the dismissal document although I had a permanent job. I was told that
   they didn’t need the worker any more. I considered bringing them to court. The bakery is still
   working, and there are two workers in it. But my child was small and I didn’t have money for a
   court process. My line of thinking was that it was costly, long, and that I wouldn’t be able to
   do anything because of corruption, plus they had money and I didn’t.




Female judges who participated in FGD have never had an opportunity to try the cases related
to dismissal after maternity leave. They think that such cases are not brought before the court,
because this is the practice in Serbia to fire the worker after maternity leave, particularly if they
have a fixed-term employment contract. „Our associates in the court also have fixed-term
employment contracts. This happens in the court as well.“


Other violations of labor law
                                            74
Frequent violation of labor rights is considered to be a consequence of several factors. The
first reason is widespread gray economy which remains almost totally beyond control of the
state. The second reason is a huge unemployment rate due to which the workers agree to
work under the worst possible conditions, and the employers are allowed to violate the labor
law massively under the logic „if you don’t want to work, there are others who will“. The third
reason comes from the fact that the laws, which are generally good, simply aren’t
implemented because inspection services are corrupt, while the work of judiciary is
inadequate because they do not process these cases efficiently enough.


        The workers are supposed to be protected by the law. But this is just a dead letter. Such things
        don’t exist here because all of us are frightened for our existence. If my superior is nervous
        and if he shouts at me, I am already used to it, because this is an everyday practice. At any
        moment I can be fired. And I can’t afford to be fired.


In this section we will present some of the cases with violation of workers’ rights that FGD
participants were faced with. They mainly decided to avoid the court dispute.
1. According to the same model as getting fired after maternity leave, the workers receive
   unjustified dismissals on the grounds of reduced workload or they are offered a position
   which they can’t accept. Participants in FGD think that private employers can fire the
   workers at any moment, although that worker performs his or her tasks correctly. They
   give up the court proceedings because they are convinced that it would be very difficult to
   win against the employer with a big capital. On the other hand, when it comes to work in
   small private enterprises, they think that eventual court decision to return to work is not
   sustainable in the long run because „how can I work with them when I brought them to
   court”.


   Maja has worked for four years at the famous café chain. Several weeks after the sick leave
   from which she returned earlier under the pressure of her superiors she gets an offer to
   accept a new position in Obrenovac or she will be fired. As due to child’s school and work in
   shifts she couldn’t accept traveling from Belgrade to Obrenovac, Maja refuses the offer. After
   two months she receives a decision on dismissal, which she doesn’t want to sign.
   „I turned to legal adviser of Čukarica municipality, but she sent me to labor inspectorate. I
   showed my papers to the inspector. He told me to find a good lawyer, and since my employer
   was a very rich and influential man, he was sure that I wouldn’t win the case. He told me
   openly that I didn’t have any chance. “Corruption. I didn’t have any money and they did have
   it.“



2. The workers who have gone through such situations not only believe that the dismissals
   were unfounded, but they were forced to give up the severance pay which they are
   entitled to after dismissal according to law.




                                               75
            After maternity leave it was decided that I wasn’t needed any more in photo shop in which I
            had been working for years, and I was told to sign the paper where I waived severance pay.
            We called the inspection and they told us that, if they were going to fire me, they should fire
            me as a redundant worker. I went to the bookkeeper and she gave me the decision that I was
            a redundant worker. I didn’t want to sign that I waived the severance pay, but she told me
            that they could fire me because of several other reasons after which I was not eligible for
            severance pay and I wouldn’t have 6 months of paid contributions in National Em ployment
            Service. I accepted it because of this. The amount of severance pay would be around 30 000
            dinars and I didn’t want to sue them for such a small amount. Maybe I should have done that,
            but I am not vindictive.


3. Very frequent cases are those when overdue wages which haven’t been paid are not paid at
   all after the dismissal. Participants in FGD mainly tried to make a kind of pressure on
   employers in order to avoid a long and too expensive process. The respondents who had a
   court case describe it as inefficient. Since the companies in question were mainly the ones in
   bankruptcy, the money has never been paid to them despite the court decision.



            I left the company as redundant. I was given severance pay, but I was not paid for the last two
            months at work when I was on my vacation. I sued them for 78 000 dinars of unpaid income.
            The proceeding was really tormenting. I felt stupid and miserable when they refused it for the
            first time, and without any grounds. How could the court deny it when I had it all in writing
            about my vacation and everything? It was not paid. Why is the judge postponing this? New
            fee paid each time and another lawyer’s wage. It all cost 37000 dinars and lasted a year. I
            came to the court to prove it. What am I to prove when it is all written down? They tell me
            that there are many others like me. A complaint was filed for something absolutely clear. It is
            still in court now. I received judgment in my favor and I thought it was the end. I haven’t
            received any money, and I am to get 78 000 and perhaps interest on it. It is just a dead letter
            for the time being. I feel humiliated because I have to chase something that belongs to me
            and that I have earned. I will never think of suing anyone ever again.


4. Sexual harassment at work is almost not considered violating their rights among focus group
   participants. Almost all of them were subject of interest of their superiors or their colleagues
   were. Although they didn’t like being in such a position, they didn’t think it was something to be
   reported. Responsibility for this is simply transferred from employer to woman. Woman is the
   one to set the limit. „The director tried to come on to me once, but I refused. He tried, I refused it
   and that was it. It works with some and doesn’t work with others. It all depends on what a
   woman wants.“

    What bothers them is their colleagues’ inappropriate vocabulary and jokes with sexual
    connotations, but they don’t consider this harassment, and they don’t consider it important. In
    their opinion, this should not be a subject to a court proceeding because „Even rape is difficult
    to prove, let alone this.”

5. Awareness of mobbing, as a situation that can be a subject of a court proceeding, is somewhat
   better developed among them. However, although they are faced with outpouring of
   employers’ fury, inappropriate requirements and harassment, they are trying to defend


                                                  76
themselves from that on their own. They believe that no employee could prove mobbing in
court because there is no proof of it.


        „They all see it, but they are afraid for their job. No one will testify for you. I wouldn’t testify
       for others. I can’t afford to lose my job.“




                                                77
Problems Present in all Mentioned Court Cases

In all the discussed court proceedings, either civil or criminal, women, as a party to a case, were
faced with similar problems. Professionals also confirm that these really are barriers for efficient
processes.
No matter if they had a dispute with an ex-partner or company, women were faced with
deliberate stalling of proceeding by the other party to the case/legal entity. Almost as a rule,
the other party didn’t appear at hearings and used all legal possibilities to avoid appearance in
court. Given that court system is faced with case overload, periods in between hearings are
long.



        He can fail to appear several times, the law allows it, but the next hearing is not in three days
        but in three months.


In order to prolong the proceeding, the other party avoids receiving a subpoena for hearing.
This not only obstructs the court proceeding, but also disables enforcement of judgment.
Judges, lawyers and prosecutors complain about the postal service and they consider delivery a
systemic problem, but a problem not under the jurisdiction of the judicial system.


        Judge: The problem of delivery is serious because we need the address, we can’t deliver
        subpoenas without it.

        Lawyer: These issues are not solved systemically. What do the postmen do? They are corrupt.
        Even a judge can’t do anything about it. A subpoena is left at the door and it is considered
        orderly delivery. It’s ridiculous.


One of the ways to avoid taking a subpoena is to change address and be registered at a „false
address“, an address where person doesn’t live actually.


        I couldn’t submit divorce papers because I didn’t know his address. He wouldn’t tell me. He
        kept saying that he was going to tell me in five days and he never did. I was told in court that I
        was to find the address. Then he made some criminal offences and fled to Montenegro. I know
        that he lives in Podgorica, but he is not registered there. He is registered at a false address in
        Novi Sad. I had to pull some strings to find his address. Just imagine that neither the Police nor
        the court can find someone who is socially fully active. They say that personal identification
        number is not enough.


Both users of court services and judges believe that this is primarily the result of the Police
underperformance, who are not doing enough to locate the person who doesn’t appear at
hearings or stalls enforcement.

                                                78
        The Police should look for him and catch him, it’s an arrest warrant, and not let him run away.
        If they don’t find him three times at one address, they give up, they are so casual and flexible.
        They let him go, they say they have nothing to do with it. They should wait for him in the
        street and stop each car that passes.




        Judge: There are people who have a false address abroad and they actually live here. You
        have a problem with delivering decisions and you waste five months. They have some false
        address, and you have to check that. Police officers even say: ‘’Let the man be, his wife is
        molesting him for alimony’’. I had cases when I found out where a person was through an
        electoral list before the Police found him.


Users of court services who had cases during one or two of the latest judiciary reforms, believe
that this additionally extended the already not efficient enough proceedings. Due to
reorganization of courts and change of the number of judges, most of them had several
different judges, and one respondent even had her case file lost.


        My file was lost in the reform process. I went to the archives to look for it myself and when I
        found it they told me that there was a conflict between courts and that it was unclear which
        court was competent for it. What does it have to do with me?



PERCEPTION OF GENDER EQUALITY WITHIN THE JUDICIARY AND
IN PRIVATE LAW PRACTICE


Quantitative study results point out that professionals within the judicial system, or judges and
prosecutors, notice gender differences in their profession to a lot lesser extent than
representatives of private law practice do. Namely, most judges (73% of men and 68% of
women), as well as most prosecutors (63% of men and 64% of women) believe that men and
women in their profession have equal opportunities to progress. Those who do notice
differences, mainly believe that the other gender is favored: 18% of men judges and same
percentage of men prosecutors believe that their female colleagues have better opportunities
to be promoted, while 19% of women judges and even 31% of women prosecutors believe the
opposite.

Results are similar also regarding the opportunity to earn money within the profession: 89% of
men judges and 81% of women judges, as well as 83% of men prosecutors and 84% women
prosecutors agree that men and women have equal opportunities. Some women who report
that inequality does exist, believe that men are in a better position (4% of women judges and

                                               79
15% of women prosecutors think that men earn more), while men who think that inequality
exists don’t share a uniform opinion (equal shares believe that men stand better chances and
that women stand better chances).

On the other hand, lawyers’ responses point to great gender differences within this
profession, or significantly better position of men. Even 47% of women lawyers believe that
their male colleagues stand better chances to be promoted, and 20% of men lawyers agree. As
for income in private practice, differences are even more visible: 52% or women and 29% of
men lawyers claim that men are in a better position in this profession.



Responsibilities of women in the legal profession and the justice system
Focus group discussions confirmed quantitative results. Women who have private practice and
who work in the justice system agree that „being a lawyer is not very convenient for a woman “.
Lawyers, judges and prosecution associates primarily notice unequal presence in private
practice and in the justice system: there are a lot more men lawyers, while there are more
women in courts and in prosecution.

The primary reasons are working time and workload, or reduced possibility of balancing
professional and personal responsibilities of women who have private practice. All respondents
agree that women lawyers have bigger load.


        Lawyer: It is very hard to be a woman lawyer because you have to work all day long. In the
        morning, you are in court, you write lawsuits at night, we work 24h almost. It is very hard if
        you have small children.


In addition, private practice is considered a lot more insecure regarding income, although
income is a lot higher than in judiciary. Better income is the reason why more men choose to be
lawyers, while job security and regular income are benefits of working in the judicial system in
case of women.


        Prosecution associate: A job in judiciary is a state job and you have limited working hours.
        Your employer can’t just fire you and women want to exercise their rights by the Labor Law.
        When you are a lawyer, you have no working hours, you work on weekends, you work in the
        afternoon and you don’t have time for your family or private life, and men won’t do with just a
        salary in a state institution.



Opportunities for promotion in the judicial system
Regardless of whether they work within the judicial system or out of it, focus group participants
– women practicing law, absolutely deny presence of different opportunities for women and

                                              80
for men within the system. Insensitivity for gender issues in their profession is present among
older respondents especially, mainly judges.
Judges deny presence of different opportunities for promotion in their profession, although
they notice that there are equal numbers of men and women at the position of president of
court, while there are a lot more women at lower positions. They consider this just a
coincidence. They admit that quality and hard work are not the only criteria for promotion, but
men and women have informal ways and informal support networks that facilitate promotion
equally at their disposal. As for their colleagues who took part in the quantitative study and
stated that their male colleagues had better opportunities than they did, they think it’s just
rationalization of their own failure and unaccomplished ambitions.




        Judge: „It depends on how skilled you are, it has nothing to do with gender. I really think that
        gender is not relevant at all. “


Prosecution associates who are a lot younger and with less work experience, still notice the
difference regarding the position of men and women within their institutions. They assess that
mainly men take the positions of public prosecutors, while women are usually at lower
positions. In their opinion, this is a consequence of women’s decision to commit to their family,
and they usually stay off work for several years due to taking a maternity leave. To confirm their
hypothesis, they state that men get promoted a lot earlier, while women tend to do that at their
more mature age, when their children grow up.


        Prosecution associate: Women at high positions are already accomplished and their children
        are independent, and men break through while they are younger. Women can’t do it because
        they have to run home whenever children are sick. Mother is primary and most important and
        it’s the greatest sacrifice in a woman’s life. Men have these three years that we take for
        children.


Woman’s load of family and household responsibilities is usually not considered a consequence
of unfair and unjust division of responsibilities between spouses, but is rather attributed to
woman’s biological predisposition to take care of her family «No one can replace mother». Just a
few focus group participants relate women’s poorer position at work with home responsibilities
that might be shared by spouses, but it is again attributed to cultural heritage and patriarchal
environment.



        Judge: „This is expected of a woman. A man is not expected to iron when he comes home
        from work. Expectations of women are greater in general. It is terrible that there is still no
        balance there.“


                                               81
Given that public institutions have clearly defined system for wage determination (depending on
position, years of work experience...), focus group participants believe that there are no
differences between incomes of men and women working at same positions within judicial
institutions.




                                          82
CONCLUSIONS


General assessment of accessibility
Both the female users of judicial system and women who work within this system agree that
judicial system in Serbia is equally accessible to men and women, so they do not distinguish
court users on the basis of gender. These data are corroborated by findings of quantitative
study, where no gender-related differences were observed among court users. But general
assessment of accessibility differs significantly between the court users and providers of court
services. Judges and associates in Public Prosecutor’s Office think that judicial system is
accessible to everyone, even too accessible, which results in excessive caseload in the courts
which are not basic courts („For just 980 dinars you can sue anyone you want, and all that
comes to us“). On the other hand, female participants in focus groups who had a court case or
gave it up, think that the system is not accessible enough to either gender, primarily in financial
sense. They think that expenses for the court and lawyers are too high because of inefficient
processes and unfeasible due to poor enforcement of judgments.
Court cases typical for women
Participants in focus group discussions notice the gender-related differences only in the
existence of court cases which are more frequently initiated by women. Since after the divorce
or termination of common-law marriage custody over children is usually given to women, «court
cases typical for women» are the ones through which the women try to exercise the rights of
their children: payment of child care, division of common property, deprivation of parental
rights. As regards all other cases, including violation of labor law, the professionals estimate
that they are equally frequent among women and men, and that both genders have equal
treatment by judicial system.
All participants single out inadequate alimony and inefficient implementation of the decision on
payment of alimony as the major problems in family law cases. However, while users are
dissatisfied with performance of the judicial system because it has no mechanisms to set real
father’s income and real sum of alimony, and secure regular payment, judges and prosecution
associates consider this a state issue and consider the state responsible for providing these
mechanisms. Similar barriers for efficient court proceedings were observed in all discussed
cases: the other party to a case failing to appear in court, undelivered subpoenas, unfounded
complaints, but professionals agree that these are again state issues and not judicial system
issues.
Position of women in judiciary
As being generally not sensitive to gender issues when it comes to court cases, women in the
justice system do not perceive a difference in the position of women and men within the system
they work in. The only difference they notice is different share of men and women lawyers and

                                            83
those working in judiciary, and also bigger share of men in private and women in public practice.
This difference is attributed to woman’s decision to commit to her family, which implies
choosing a public institution, and man’s ambition for financial achievement provided by private
practice. And that small number of respondents who notice too large number of men at high
positions in judiciary, disproportional with total number of employed men and women, consider
this a „normal consequence“ of woman’s biological predisposition to be a mother. While
women stay off work for several years because of maternity leave, men of their age are
promoted. However, discussion participants don’t perceive unequal distribution of family
responsibilities as a barrier for woman’s promotion, but as an inevitable consequence of her
decision to have a family.

METHODOLOGY
ABOUT FOCUS GROUPS:

Discussion in focus groups is one of the methods of qualitative research which makes possible deeper
understanding of behaviour, attitudes, motives, etc. The group discussion is facilitated by a trained
moderator, and in this research the duration of focus group discussion was circa 90 minutes on
average. There were 8 participants in each focus group discussion. This research concept makes
possible collection of extensive information in a relatively short period of time, but the results can
only be considered as opinions typical for particular segment of population.

STRUCTURE OF THE GROUPS:

Participants in focus groups were the representatives of various populations:

                Mainstream population: citizens of Belgrade, economically active, aged 25 to 66
                 years
                Farmers: citizens of village Klenak who generate earnings from agriculture activities
                Owners of small enterprises: entrepreneurs and owners of enterprises with
                 maximum 5 employees who are registered in Belgrade
                Members of LGBT populations, activists: NGO activists who deal with the rights of
                 LGBT population (Gej strejt alijansa (GSA), Kvirija centar, Labris, Inicijativa mladih za
                 ljudska prava)

In each group, except the one with LGBT activists, majority of respondents had some dispute which
had a good ground for being brought to court, but they gave up the court process. Smaller number of
respondents (2 or 3) has a dispute in the same period, but they are not satisfied with the work of
judiciary, and they wouldn’t go to court again in similar situation. In case of mainstream population
the respondents had civil and criminal cases, while the farmers and owners of enterprises had
business related disputes.

KEY FINDINGS


MAINSTREAM POPULATION
Judiciary system in Serbia is evaluated as inefficient, low quality, and most of all,
inaccessible to „ordinary citizens“. As a result of such situation, the court proceedings
are not even instigated every time when there is ground for it.
The reasons why the citizens who had a dispute which could be resolved in court didn’t instigate
the proceedings after all highly coincide with experiences of those who participated in some
court proceedings. Court proceedings are avoided due to unfavourable accessibility of the
judiciary:
   Basic access to judiciary: affordability of court costs, access to necessary information,
    geographical distance of the court
   Access to justice: duration of the proceedings, personal time spent (days off at work),
    willingness of witnesses to testify, personal health (loosing nerves), prosecution field the
    case, fair judgment, trust in judiciary (corruption), enforcement of court decision, work of
    judge, efficient mechanism for complaining about the inadequate operation of the court and
    judge

Basic access to judiciary
Costs of court proceedings are considered as one of the biggest obstacles when it comes to
access to judicial system. Court processes, particularly litigations, are considered too expensive,
even by economically active citizens, such as participants in our focus groups. Even in case when
they have the necessary money, participants in focus group discussions think that such civil
cases are not worth the money.
   The opinion is that the largest share of costs goes to lawyers as the lawyer’s fee, because
    this fee is considered as too high (every appearance in front of the court is charged from 50
    Euros on). At the same time it is believed that majority of the lawyers prolong the already
    sluggish court process in order to earn as much money as possible from it (the bigger
    number of hearings, the more money for the lawyers).
   In civil cases it is often necessary to have expert opinion (for example, surveying the land,
    etc.).
   This adds to the already high costs (e.g. 200 Euros for land surveyor) of court office fees,
    and travel expenses if the court proceedings are held in the court located in some other
    town.


          „The problem here is money, and the fact that the whole process would unnecessarily be
          stretched to a very long period of time. The hearing is postponed because one of the parties
          doesn’t appear, and I have to pay the lawyer for every appearance in court, and so it goes
          on for years. Plus I have to have money to go there. I can not instigate the proceedings here,
          because the woods is not here. I have neither money nor time for that, because the courts
          function the way they function, and I would have to take days off work to finish it, and I
          would have to pay for all that. It isn’t worth the money.“ Litigation about ungrounded use of
          inherited woods which was not instigated

                                               87
If the citizens decide to reduce the costs though own engagement in court process, they are
faced with inaccessibility of information. The sources of information available for them are very
limited.
               Free legal assistance in municipality was not helpful at all, since majority of
                respondents were advised to approach the lawyer

          „One has no place to collect information from, all information are inaccessible, so the only
          solution is to browse Internet and eventually come to some trivial and ordinary information.
          This free legal assistance in municipality is good for nothing, because one can get no
          information there. This is a tragedy. When I went there the crowd was very big, and the
          lawyers did not have time to devote to everyone, just several minutes. Plus they were very
          impertinent and unpleasant.“


               Internet provides the opportunity to find out information about the laws and
                rights of the citizens, but this is very complicated and time consuming for the
                amateurs, and, on the other hand, the practice often differs from theory and
                laws.


          „You read that such case can be concluded in particular period of time, you read about your
          rights, the duration of particular processes, but when you get involved in this story it’s
          something utterly different, it is much longer and more complicated.“


               Information about the process itself are often unavailable for the citizens, as
                the case was with participant whose case was from the domain of criminal law
                (physical assault). Prosecutor’s office still hasn’t instigated the proceedings, or it
                wasn’t explained to them where and how they could get the information (for
                example, why they haven’t received the decision from probate proceedings for
                months).


  Nikola P, employed, 35 years old, after probate proceedings he hasn’t received any
  information for months about his case from the court although he believed that the case was
  concluded.

    Probate proceedings was held in September, the situation was clear as water from the
    mountain spring, I had a life care contract with my late father, my brothers signed the
    consent that everything should be left to me. January came and I still didn’t receive any
    decision from the court. I asked my neighbour who was employed in the court what I should
    do, and she told me to write a letter to President of court with all information about the
    hearing, attached documents, etc. I would never believe that I would have to write to
    President of court for such an ordinary thing, but I did this and submitted it to court registry
    on 27.1. After that I received a letter from the judge where she summoned me to come to
    her office on 15. 3. On that meeting she asked me to tell her some details from with my
    father ... because, when you go out of court office judicial assistants continue working on the
    case, not the judges. Until the next hearing the judge has practically nothing to do with our

                                              88
    case, only the assistants. Her assistants were not able to interpret my case although they
    had all documents, so I had to explain everything to the judge. I received the decision on 20.
    4. And I had to pay 11. 000 dinars as court fee. When I sold some of my inherited property
    after that (a scooter), no one told me that the probate decision becomes final after a month
    if no one files a complaint, and only after that period you must go to court to get a court seal
    on the final decision. I found out about that only because I was selling that scooter, although
    several months have passed since I received the decision in three copies. So we had to
    backdate the decision and seal, and I could sell the scooter. Until that moment I wasn’t even
    aware that my court decision was not final.




Access to justice
Another important reason for giving up the potential dispute solution in court is excessive
duration of proceedings. Experiences of participants in focus groups who had some court case
coincide with expectations of participants who gave up looking for solution in court: The
processes last for years, there are too many hearings, and time intervals between two hearings
are too long (assumably, if there are 3 hearings a year, this means that the litigation would last
for 5-10 years). Long intervals between the hearings are considered to be the result of inefficient
judiciary, overburdened judges, and frequent change of judges during the process.

          „A judge in Pančevo was on my case for one year. We had a hearing every month, and only
          after a year he told me that he wasn’t competent for my case, so I had to go to other judge.
          And what about my costs for coming to the court, ab sence from work, what about that ...“
          Litigation over custody


On the other hand, it is believed that excessive number of hearings is often the result of
deliberate obstruction of the proceedings by one party on lawyer’s advice (failing to come to the
hearing, request for postponement, etc.).

          „Lawyers advise their accused clients not to come to the court, because they have the right
          not to appear up to 3 times. And the lawyers earn more money. „


Long processes with big number of hearings require significant personal involvement of parties
in the process and are extremely time consuming. Citizens who work in private companies are
faced with serious problem of absence from work. Namely, the courts wok only on weekdays,
so although they have the right to be absent from work if they have a court hearing, the
employed citizens are forced to ask for a day off (from annual holiday). At the same time,
owners of private companies do not look favourably on frequent absenteeism.


          „Not to mention our costs, our time, and all other things, this is terrible. It really makes me
          feel horrible when I am not guilty and I have to goo through all that.“




                                               89
                In addition to financial costs and time, the citizens are even more concerned
                 about the stress that they are exposed to due to long and inefficient processes
                 which they expect. Each new hearing, particularly those where other party is
                 absent, represents an extraordinary nuisance.

          „I can only say that no one would be able to compensate me for my nerves..“


                Stress was particularly accentuated by female participants who had long
                 litigations over custody, whose children were exposed to repeated psychological
                 testing due to repeated hearings


          „As a result of inefficient court, my children were forced to go through 5 mental institutions
          where they were tested, from Palmotićeva (Institute for Mental Health) on...“


One of the reasons for not initiating the court proceedings is also fear that case will not be
proven in court, usually because the witnesses deny to testify in favour of plaintiff. This is
particularly so in cases of violation of labour rights (illegal work and unpaid salaries), when
testimony of other employees is often the only way to prove that the persons whose rights were
violated actually worked in particular company. Although they believe in good faith of their
colleagues who are often in the same position on their jobs, they are aware that likelihood of
their testimony is very small because of fear from losing their job, so they usually give up
initiating a court procedure.


  Ivan, 35 years old, worked for 6 months illegally, as unregistered worker, and didn’t receive a
  single salary. Owner of private company constantly prolonged payment of salary, and his
  excuse was that he could not collect the money from his debtors. With the help of his friend
  who is a lawyer he wrote a complaint thereby threatened his employer. The situation was
  settled outside of court when the employer paid a part of overdue salaries.

I could go to court, but the biggest problem was the fact that my employer could deny that I was
working for him because I didn’t have a single document, I have 2 witnesses, that is, the two
workers who were working with me. The question is whether they would testify in my favour
because their work would also be jeopardised. I could have finished this in some two or three
years, and I could have received some judgment, but until that time I would have lost all my
nerves, and I would have lost my job even before, and these two co-workers could have lost their
jobs as well. I couldn’t expect them to do something for me if they didn’t have any benefit from
it. They could have only been harmed by that.




Experience of participants in focus groups also points to the problem of selective initiation of
the proceedings by the prosecutors in case of some criminal acts. In this case it is believed that
Prosecutor’s Office protects the attacker because he belongs to Police.


                                               90
 Milan N, 61 years old pensioner from Belgrade was attacked in the yard of his Vracar home during the
 New Years Eve (2011./2012) by an un known individual who broke into his property. Milan suffered
 head and body injuries. The Police reacted, apprehended the attacker, but today, 2 years after the
 attack, the Prosecution still hasn’t initiated the process. Milan himself, with the help of his lawyer,
 gathered information in order to file a private complaint, but he didn’t manage to get the information
 about the attacker formally. By informal means he found out that the attacker was a police officer.

At 2 o’clock in the morning a group of palls stormed into my yard coming from the nearby pub. One of
them attacked me, and he virtually intended to kill me. I somehow managed to rescue myself, the police
came, arrested him, took me to Emergency unit in hospital. And even today I can’t get the name of this
man from Police in order to lodge a private complaint. Their excuse is that they kept him for 48 h, and
that the Public Prosecutor was then supposed to press charges against him. But I am asking you, when
will this happen? Two years have passed since that, and until this day they neither called me nor the
witnesses. And the case becomes cold after five years. Later on I found out through some private
acquaintances that this individual was a policeman, that he was drunk, so there is no use in suing him
because he was their man. I could have succeeded with this case if we were in some other country, with
normal judiciary. As the things look now, I don’t expect them to ever press charges against him.




       The citizens know that they have the right to represent themselves in the court, but they believe
       that, even when they have a well grounded case, they can never win if the other party is
       represented by a lawyer. It is generally believed that choice of the lawyer determines the course
       and outcome of the process to a great extent, and choice of the lawyer depends on available
       finances. Expensive lawyer does not only mean great knowledge and professional skills, “but the
       price also includes acquaintance with the judge“. Corruption in judicial system is considered
       extremely widespread, so according to respondents, besides acquaintance with the judge it is
       also reflected in direct bribing of the judge through the lawyer.



                  „My lawyer advised me to press charges a gainst this individual, and he told me that I would
                 eventually win. But our judiciary is such that I can not be sure at all whether I will actually
                 win him, because the whole thing boils down to amount of money that will be given in order
                 to win the case eventually, and which party has a stronger string to pull in the court. So this
                 can linger in the court for years until the case becomes statute-barred, so I will not get
                 anything in the end.“ Potential dispute about unpaid wages

                 „All these lawyers can be equally professional and knowledgeable, but the most important
                 thing is which of them has the best connections.“


       Giving up potential court case due to estimation that outcome won’t be positive even though it
       should be, according to the law, is particularly present if the other party to a case is considered
       „strong“ in terms of material wealth, „connections“, position. Focus group participants
       unanimously claim that the judicial system is not equally accessible to all citizens, but that
       accessibility depends on socio-economic position.


                                                      91
          „Cases end quickly and efficiently only if you are a big shot and if you are rich. We are all
          allegedly equal, only that some are „more equal,“ so justice is a lot more accessible to
          them.“


Citizens who took part in a court case were not satisfied with judges’ performance, and judges
were considered one of the main factors promoting inefficient processes. Inadequate work of
judges is considered more a consequence of indifference and insufficient knowledge about the
subject, than of work overload. Also citizens who did not take part in a court case perceived
judges in a similar way.


          „You can’t imagine the way judges look at you in Serbia. As if you were a marble, a little ball
          they can kick any way they want.“ Court case over custody


Besides all factors they believe contribute to poor efficacy and low quality of court cases,
citizens avoid to settle their problems before court also because they believe there is no
mechanism to control the work of courts. Such mechanism is expected to supervise court
performance and react adequately in case of dissatisfactory activities.



FARMERS
Farmers also think that judicial system in Serbia is not efficient enough, but in terms of
accessibility, their major problem is inability to implement the judgment, or collect
damages.
Farmers refer to same weaknesses of the judicial system as mainstream population does, as the
reasons why they avoid instigating court proceedings. However, there are also some activity-
specific factors, which imply that the judicial system is not accessible enough to this part of the
population. Farmers are mainly faced with problems of late payment of products purchased by
the state, inability to collect damages and errors in calculating interest rates on subsidies. They
don’t instigate court proceedings in most cases, believing that they will just end up with even
more resources lost.



Basic access to judiciary
Unavailability of agriculture-specific information actually refers to frequent changes of decrees
regulating this field (for example conditions and processes for obtaining subsidies) and their
insufficient clarity for „common peasant“. Farmers also believe that these regulations „have
gaps“, which would make them lose potential lawsuit against the state.

          „Provisions should stay the same for a longer period of time, so that peasants get in formed
          about them and that they know what to do if they have a problem, how to react. The way


                                               92
          things are now, they start doing something, and after 5 or 10 days provisions are changed
          and they have to do everything all over again...“



Access to justice
Procedure for starting a case being complicated and not clear enough is one of the main
reasons for not starting any for damage inflicted on property, plants etc. According to
respondents, the law stipulates that if damage is inflicted to a plant, it is necessary that
inspector investigates the site and that witnesses are questioned, and they often fear they will
lack some procedure or document.


  Olivera, 45 years old farmer from Klenak grows fruit. Two years ago, her neighbour was
  burning waste on the field next to hers; the fire spread and burnt her raspberry plant of 60
  acres. The estimated damage was 10 000 Euros. The firemen extinguished the fire and made
  record of it only after Olivera visited the fire brigade station for four times. In her words, the
  Police didn’t want to investigate the site although they were invited. Olivera asked her lawyer
  friend for advice, and she decided not to press charges, being afraid that she didn’t adhere to
  all procedures (presence of Police on the site, inspector), and that she wouldn’t be able to
  prove who the perpetrator was. Also, she is afraid that if she got the judgment not in her
  favour, the other party would sue her for slander.

  „You have to prove the other party guilty and you have to have all the witnesses, estimates
  and everything, to bring with you millions of papers, to protect yourself and prove you are
  right. Given that no one saw this and that I didn’t catch him do this, I would simply lose the
  case. So it’s fine to pay your own costs, but having the other party sue you for slander, you will
  pay that as well.”




For the inspector to conduct expert assessment, it is necessary to pay the fee first, which is an
extra cost. At the same time, procedure lasts and in case it rains in the meantime, it reduces the
possibility of proving the damage.



          You have to pay an expert witness, a professional in agriculture, and his visit costs 15000 to
          25000 RSD. If it rains in the meantime, it will reduce the possibility of assessment.


Besides lawyers’ costs, farmers have extra travel expenses because court is located in another
town, and in case they have witnesses, they also have to pay witnesses’ travel costs and per
diems. However, their most burdening cost is the time consumed, given that agriculture
requires daily and all-day engagement.




                                               93
One of the major farmers’ complaints about the judicial system is inability to institute court
proceedings for minor damages, or damage inflicted by theft of value lower than 15 000 RSD.
In their words, thefts in the fields are very frequent, and they have mechanism neither to
protect themselves nor to collect damages. It is estimated that each household loses about 500
EUR a year in this way.



         „They can take whatever they want if it is worth less than 15000 RSD and not be criminally
         prosecuted for that, being protected by the law. They come, they take and you can’t do a
         thing about it. And 15000 RSD every time. Then you call the Police, and you pray to God that
         they come. So when my friend Miša the police officer picks up the receiver, the first thing he
         asks is whether damage is more than 15000. And I say that it is. And he tells me that he will
         call the general crime department, in Ruma, and that their inspectors will come, and do the
         assessment and then we’ll instigate a proceeding if due. And if damage is less than 15 000
         RSD, they won’t come at all.“


Potential court proceedings would mainly be conducted against the state, which majority avoids
because they don’t believe that positive outcome is possible.


 Željko, 36 years old, from Klenak, engaged in crop growing and animal husbandry. Last year,
 wild boars from the nearby hunting grounds inflicted damage to his corn crops. The damage
 estimated is 1000 EUR, and Željko is just one of the local farmers in such a situation, which
 had already happened in the past. Lawsuits used to be filed against Srbija šume before, and
 they compensated damages in wood, but it is now necessary to instigate a civil lawsuit against
 the state. Željko believes that he can hardly win this lawsuit, and that court expenses would
 be extensive, given that lawsuits usually last for several years.
 „This means that three members of the Commission from the village have to come and assess
 the damage and then we go to court. You, as a citizen, can never win against the state in the
 court. They will ask me why I haven’t fenced my property. And I have a piece here, a piece
 there, so I can’t fence them all. It wouldn’t be worthwhile if I calculated all the costs. And, in
 addition, civil proceedings last forever.”




In cases when it is necessary to instigate private lawsuit against another physical entity who
inflicted some damage, legal proceeding is given up even when guilt is proven, because of
impossibility to implement a judgment or collect damages.


 Dušan, 46 year-old farmer from Klenak, is primarily engaged in crop production and vegetable
 growing. Six months ago, his property was trespassed on, when 1000 Euros worth greenhouse
 construction was stolen and damage inflicted to his tomato crops. The Police conducted on-
 site investigation, and Dušan found the perpetrator on his own (he recognized the
 construction at the local junk yard). The Prosecution has not initiated criminal proceedings
 yet, but when they do, Dušan won’t file a private lawsuit to collect damages. The reason for

                                              94
 this is the perpetrator’s poor socio-economic status (MA beneficiary), so Dušan estimates that
 he won’t be able to collect damages although the judgment will most probably be in his
 favour. At the same time, legal proceeding costs, primarily lawyer’s fee, will additionally affect
 his budget.
 „I can also file a private lawsuit, but I won’t collect damages and it will affect me even more.
 This legal proceeding would cost me at least 1000 Euros, which would make the total sum lost
 2 000 Euros, while now I lose only 1 000 Euros. Plus, if I do this all and he goes to prison, they
 will reduce his sentence from 6 years to 3 months because of good conduct, so when he leaves
 the prison he will cut all my greenhouses... I should pray to God that this man doesn’t come
 again and do this again, because I will kill him then and I will go to prison, because I have no
 other way of protecting myself.“



Another barrier for going to court is perception of judges as insufficiently expert for
agriculture, besides being perceived as generally inefficient and indifferent.



         „That judge has never been to a field. How can he understand what happened there and
         what kind of damage was inflicted?“




                                           95
SMALL BUSINESS

Entrepreneurs and micro company owners, as well as farmers, are faced with insufficient
availability of the judicial system, which affects their business operations. This primarily refers
to resolving disputes over collection of other legal entities’ debts.


Basic access to judiciary

Same as farmers, small business representatives complain about frequent change of
legislative and regulations, which is accompanied by insufficient availability of information.
Having no legal department, they are forced to keep informed about regulations, their rights
and possibilities on their own in case of legal proceedings. Another option is to engage a
lawyer. They have very high costs in both cases, even when they decide not to instigate a
legal proceeding.


          „Most severe problem in small companies is lack of information, since we are simply not
          able to deal with these things, with different new regulations popping out every day, we are
          simply stunned. We don’t have legal departments, so that we can tell them – here are these
          invoices, do collect this money or sue them. We have to do it on our own, and I can’t do my
          job and do this at the same time, so I lose money. That’s why it’s very expensive, really time
          consuming and burdening. And lawyers also charge a lot for it, with fees and everything.“
          Company selling office supplies



Access to justice

Small company representatives believe that the state and the judicial system are not
protecting them enough in cases of damage inflicted by theft. Focus group participants say
that, according to their experience, in cases when perpetrators are not found, companies do
not file a private lawsuit because they believe they won’t be able to compensate the damage
in court.

  Nada, 52 year-old owner of a boutique in Belgrade had merchandise stolen from her boutique
  last January. The Police conducted on-site investigation, but they advised her not to institute a
  lawsuit since it was estimated that the goods had already been sold, thus impossible to be
  traced.
  „I wanted to file a lawsuit. But when the police officers told me that I was not the only one,
  that this merchandise was probably already sold in some market and that it was seldom
  compensated or traced, I gave it up. The officers told me this in a friendly tone so I gave it up
  knowing that it would be in vain.”


                                               96
The most common basis for initiating judicial proceedings is the inability to collect receivables. Small
enterprises rarely decide to initiate a lawsuit, and when they make a decision to do it, they are faced
with the problem of liquidation of the enterprise which owes them the money, that is, they stumble
upon impossibility of enforcement of court decision.

                       In some cases liquidation of other enterprise takes place before initiation of
                        a lawsuit, so the harmed enterprise decides to give up the process in order
                        to avoid at least additional costs of lawyers and court fees.

Zeljko, 44 years old owner of the enterprise which sells office supplies had several cases where he was
unable to collect debt from another legal entity. One of such companies that has not paid the debt was
liquidated in the meantime. Željko decided not to enter into the judicial process because he believes
that, despite the fact that the verdict would probably be in his favour, he would not be able to recover
the damages.
"The buyer does not pay for the delivered goods, and when you decide to press charges you realize that
they are bankrupt, that there isn’t anyone around, that the company doesn’t exist anymore, and the
only people which can be found in the premises are bookkeepers and bankruptcy trustees who do not
decide about anything. So, in last such case we heard that someone has already sued them, so we were
not the only ones, but there was a long cue of creditors waiting before us. We realized that, if we sued
that company for the debt which was not so big, we would lose more money than we would get,
because all costs were on us, so we gave it up."



                       In order to avoid suing the enterprise under liquidation, participants in focus
                        groups who pressed charges checked the status of such enterprise before
                        initiating the procedure. Nevertheless, there were cases when enterprises
                        were liquidated after the court decision, so the debts could not be collected
                        again.

Sneža, 40 year old owner of company for the production of socks had several disputes about debt
collection. All experiences with the judiciary in these cases were negative. Basically she was unable to
collect the debt, although the judgments were in her favour. The biggest problem is that the sued
companies were liquidated either during the process or after the court decision.

“Two years ago, a company owed me circa one million dinars. We checked whether they were solvent,
and when we found out that they were solvent we pressed charges. We won the case, I paid court fees
before and after the court decision, I paid the lawyer, and the owner of that company avoided receiving
the court decision. And I cannot collect the debt until he receives the court decision. These companies
which owe money engage a lawyer who instructs them how to avoid the receipt of the court decision.
When the decision has not been delivered after I do not know how many attempts, it is hung in the
Commercial court notice board. But six months have passed in the meantime, and finally their lawyer
came and informed us that the company had been liquidated.“




                                                    97
Regardless of whether the debt is collected or not, the companies which initiate court proceedings
have to pay high court fees, VAT on goods that are not paid and tax on profit. Court fees are payable
in two parts, the first part is paid after the filing of the complaint and the second part is paid upon
receipt of court decision, as tax on enforcement. However, in case when the company which lost the
case has been liquidated in the meantime, and the possibility of collection does not exist, it is not
possible to recover the court fee or part of the VAT.


                  „I went to the court to ask them why they didn’t return to me the money for court fees since
                  the company which we sued was liquidated, or at least the tax on enforcement which is paid
                  before the actual enforcement, and they told me that it was on me and my manager to
                  consider whether we would or would not enter into this risk with the court.“ Enterprise for
                  production of socks


Owners of enterprises blame the state for these problems in functioning of private sector and
inefficient judiciary in terms of inability to enforce court decisions, since the state allowed the
citizens to start up limited liability companies with small starting capital and inadequate penal
politics for corporate offenses.


                  When they allowed the citizens to start up a limited liability company with 250 Euros of
                  initial capital, they legalized massive theft. This means that someone can pick up the goods
                  with bill of exchange, which is no guarantee whatsoever, never pay for the goods and close
                  down the company after all. Something like that was allowed by the state itself, or by
                  judiciary, or Business Register Agency, or whoever else’s mistake it might be. In this way
                  they can close down the company and disappear into the thin air.“


In such system owners of small enterprises feel completely unprotected in cases when their rights
are jeopardized. At the same time they are forced to sell their goods and services only upon advance
payment, because this is the only way to protect themselves. Such way of business operation
considerably reduced turnover and profit.


                  „One is completely alone here, and one feels like giving up the whole business, both because
                  of money and nerves. It hurts me most of all to know that I am right, and I still receive that
                  miserable court envelope where they inform me that enforcement decision was rejected
                  because of other party’s plea or closure of company. I considered this as my debacle
                  because I trusted that man and I gave him the goods, and then I trusted the state that it will
                  quickly and honestly do its job, and I finally realised that all that was in vain. In this entire
                  circle everyone earned money except me: the court collected the taxes, the other party took
                  the goods and used my money, the state took VAT, and I was the only one who financed all
                  that.“




                                                        98
LGBT POPULATION

Rights of LGBT population are often violated and they are often exposed to different forms
of discrimination, including physical violence. Nevertheless, although the members of this
vulnerable group and NGO activists evaluate legal framework as good, they still think that
judicial system is not accessible enough to them.


Basic access to judiciary

According to NGO activists who participated in focus group discussion, big number of cases
when rights of LGBT population are violated are not reported. One of the most important
reasons for such situation is lack of information among LGBT population about
antidiscrimination legal framework and their rights. Due to this reason a big number of
discrimination cases are not recognized, that is, the victims themselves and not aware that
what happened to them is subject to criminal prosecution. They usually react in case of
physical violence, while other forms of discrimination are less recognized and accepted as
inevitable.



         “I think that we are getting used to different kinds of discrimination and violence. I know
         many people who were brutally attacked physically even, and who will tell that to absolutely
         no one. And all this because they consider it a legitimate part of their life. They think it has
         to be like that.”



Insufficient availability of information on starting a court procedure is also a barrier for
starting a court case. This problem is considered to be more present in small communities
where there are no NGOs that would provide free legal help and support to victims.

Most court cases related to violation of LGBT rights have been started with active
participation of NGO, while individuals start cases on their own very rarely. Organizations
provide legal and financial assistance, with active support and encouraging individuals before
and during the process.



         “Majority doesn’t know what to do in such a situation, so organization is there to help. First
         of all medical documents necessary for the court, because you have nothing in court without
         medical files, and this requires urgent reaction because injuries heal quickly and can’t be
         proved in court. That calls for action as well. But there is also encouragement, then financial
         support, as we all know how pricey court processes in Serbia are. And how long t hey take.”



                                               99
Access to justice

However, one of the most common reasons why even cases of severe physical attacks are
not reported to the Police and the judiciary is insufficiently developed mechanism for
protection of anonymity of LGBT persons in court cases. Many LGBT persons, especially
residents of small places, decide not to report their case because it would mean exposing
themselves to the public, which they are not prepared to do.



         “It is not such a huge problem in Belgrade, because Belgrade is big and it doesn’t necessarily
         have to happen in your municipality, so that it is visible to your family or something like
         that. But it is really a problem in smaller places, because their aunts, uncles or neighbours
         work in the Police, or someone else they know, so it will become known that they have
         something to do with discrimination of LGBT persons. There is the law of 3P in force in small
         places – policeman, postman and priest, they are the ones to pull all strings, and if one of
         them knows something, everyone knows that.

Members of LGBT population, especially activists, do not perceive court cases merely as a
mechanism for protecting their personal rights, but primarily as a form of struggle for the
rights of the entire LGBT community. They expect the judicial system and the state to send
the message to broader public with adequate penal policy and adequate judgments in cases
of discrimination, and educate the public in that way. Efficient court processes and fair
judgments would, on one hand, send a message to members of LGBT population to actively
protect their rights and report cases of abuse because they will be protected, and on the
other, a message to perpetrators that discrimination is punished in Serbia. The legal frame
provides good foundation, but implementation and interpretation of laws are inadequate, so
the message actually sent is likely to be just the opposite.



         “On one hand, I feel this inner anger, because we have laws and the laws have their say, and
         we can see that it is not observed at all. The state and the judiciary have to take a clear
         stand and send the message that violence and discrimination are not allowed. You must not
         harm a gay or a lesbian. My life is not worth any less.”



         “My house was broken into 4 months ago, and not for theft. I didn’t even think of starting a
         court case, but I decided to make the case public. I am kind of aware now, it came to me
         after 4 months, that this case is simply important and that it should be noted somewhere,
         since I consider it extreme. I suppose that I wouldn’t be sitting here with you now if I were in
         there that night.”

Penal policy in the finished court trials, according to members of LGBT population, is not
satisfactory, given that perpetrators get minimum punishment. The processes covered most
by the media, mainly those associated with threatening the organizers of Pride, were

                                              100
completed with judgments of probation for perpetrators, and most sentences were even
mitigated at retrial.



          “We have Miša Vacić who is accused of discrimination on b illboards round town as head of
          one electoral list. What can I say? That’s the end of it. That’s the end of our story of court
          cases. He was threatening publicly and he was accused of 3 criminal acts and he got a
          conditional sentence of one year in prison for all 3. This is not just about discrimination, but
          he had weapons and he obstructed an official.

Experiences of activists who have followed court proceedings in cases of LGBT persons and
have attended the hearings do differ, but they all are mainly negative. They believe that
judges are neither familiar enough with problems of LGBT population, nor sufficiently
conscious and without prejudice. However, according to activists, judges have different
attitude and they behave differently if activists are present in the audience - their attitude is
a lot more correct, even though they are perhaps not aware of it.



          “It is sometimes possible to recognise which party the judge generally favours from the tone
          of his or her voice at the first hearing, and this real ly happens sometimes. The judge doesn’t
          have to say anything, but can miss to warn someone for inappropriate heckling, and that’s
          already a hint.”

                One of the major complaints against judges is interpretation of statements
                 of the accused. Many statements tend to be discriminating, but when
                 interpreted by judges they become soothed or omitted completely, so court
                 records and statements may be interpreted as a sign of penitence of the
                 perpetrator for the offense committed.




          “Hearings are not taped, and court records are interpreted by judges, which is usually
          absolutely different from what was really said in the courtroom. For example, the accused
          for threatening the organisers of Pride said that if people like them ruled, thinking of LGBT
          population, it would be tantamount to an atomic bomb, and that he didn’t want his
          daughter to grow in such an environment. This was not part of the court records and he got
          just 2 month probation because he repented sincerely. Also Mladen Obradović kept saying
          „faggots“ and similar insults at the hearing, and the judge recorded it as LGBT persons, so at
          the end you could read how he sincerely repented.”

The very trial is an additional stress for victims and fear of facing the perpetrators is also one
of the reasons for giving up a court case.




                                               101
          “Marija Savić for example, she was one of the organizers back in 2009. She was the witness
          at Mladen Obradović and Miša Vacić trials, the accused had the right to question her, and
          this was terribly aggravating, I was preparing her for that, and she had a psychological
          problem to talk to them and to look at them, because she was simply afraid of them.”

Given that some perpetrators are free during trial, and that they are often members of
organized groups (for example sports fans), plaintiffs do not feel safe even during the
process, and they give the charges up for fear of revenge.


          “The accused do not necessarily have to be in jail during trial. So I, as a victim, am thinking
          how he must hate me even more now, he attacked me first, and n ow I’m suing him, and he
          will have to pay or go to jail, and he hates me even more now and he will beat me up again.
          You are protected while in courtroom, but as soon as you go out, you are not safe, you have
          no bodyguards, and if you are alone in the street and there is no one with you, you must
          fear that someone will attack you.”

Members of LGBT population perceive insufficient cooperation between courts,
prosecutor’s office and the Police as one of the major problems in judiciary regarding cases
of discrimination, including also likely shifting of responsibilities of these institutions to the
other two.



          “It is the Holy Trinity: Police, Judiciary, Court and Prosecution. They will always bat you back
          and forth like a hot potato, for example they will say the Police didn’t do a good job, while
          the court and the prosecution did great, so they keep doing this among these three pillars
          that keep the entire system together.”

CONCLUSIONS

The judiciary in Serbia is inefficient and not accessible enough to citizens. This is what
members of all tested groups agree on: mainstream population, LGBT population,
farmers and small company owners. This is the reason why solutions of disputes are
sought out of court or not sought at all. LGBT population is affected in particular,
given that they are likely not to report their problems at all, even severe cases of
inflicting bodily injuries.

They all agree that processes in Serbia last too long, that they require engagement of
a lawyer and that this implies too high costs for them as initiators of court processes.

Court trials are exhausting, and, besides material resources, they also require time
and are a source of stress. In case of LGBT population, process may be a repeated
traumatization of victim due to encountering perpetrators and fear of retaliation.

It is believed that the very course of court trial and final outcome depend on „who you
are, who represents you and who you are pressing charges against“. While members
of mainstream population think that the party with a better lawyer who is „on better
terms with judges“ stands better chances in civil cases, farmers and company owners
believe that it is not possible to win a lawsuit against the state, as well as that it is
not possible to collect damages from a legal entity or a natural person. Members of
LGBT population are faced with situations when the judicial system does not
adequately prosecute perpetrators of crimes against LGBT persons and thus does not
contribute to reducing discrimination.
