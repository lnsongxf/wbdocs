The Justice, Security and Development Series
This research report is part of a series on Justice, Security and Development, produced with the generous support of the Bank-
Netherlands Partnership Program (BNPP). The series presents the findings and critical reflections of a three-year work program
aimed at improving development approaches to justice and security stresses in fragile and conflict-affected settings. Drawing from
reviews of current scholarship, in-depth field research, and engagement with development programs, the papers in the series
seek to identify the key challenges and obstacles to effective development, and propose ways to re-frame the challenges and
solutions as a basis for more effective development programs. The framing paper for this series, Justice and Institutional Change
in Fragile and Conflict-Affected Settings: Re-Framing the Challenges and Solutions, presents the rationale, organizing logic and
conclusions of this work.

     human development trends, and so on (see World Bank 2014). The fact remains that unemployment is massively underestimated, while the
     aggregate picture of income and human development indices of poverty during the period of oil-led development has been disastrous.
     The total poverty headcount rose from 27.2 percent in 1980 to 65.6 percent in 1996, and recent figures from the Central Bank of Nigeria
     (CBN) show that between 1980 and 2000, the share of the population subsisting on less than US$1 per day grew from 36 percent to more
     than 70 percent (from 19 million to a staggering 90 million people). In half of Nigeria’s 36 states, the estimated poverty headcount (and
     indices of multi-dimensional poverty) increased between 2004 and 2010; in some northern states, the figure is close to 80 percent.
