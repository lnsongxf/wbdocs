EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

OVERVIEW AND PURPOSE
Economic growth provides countries with important development benefits, including reduced poverty
and improved livelihoods. But some economic activity – particularly development and exploitation of
natural resources can also bring adverse impacts if the trade-offs are not adequately considered and
balanced against the environmental and social costs. In the Congo Basin, home to the world’s second
largest tropical forest area, these trade-offs often concern impacts on forests, as well as the livelihoods of
rural people who depend on them.

In addition to globally important forest resources, the Congo Basin also contains rich mineral resources,
including gold and iron. The drive to exploit these resources to finance further development could lead
to negative environmental and social impacts, if implemented with incomplete consideration of the
consequences. Increasing agricultural productivity is also seen as a means for addressing rural poverty,
but will require balancing the demands of household subsistence and energy needs and large scale
commercial agriculture and plantations. The associated infrastructure—roads, railroads, and energy
supplies—needed to extract, process, and market mineral resources and agricultural production is a
particular concern, because of the wider impact on communities and forested landscapes beyond
individual investment sites.

Rapid and unplanned deforestation can lead to considerable economic costs for countries and social
hardship for users of forest resources and the environmental services they provide: food, clean water,
energy, materials for construction and shelter. Forest degradation can also cause irreversible
environmental problems such as biodiversity loss and downstream changes in water regimes. In the
Congo Basin, deforestation is now low, but is expected to increase significantly as investments in
transportation, agriculture, energy infrastructure, and mineral development increase. While some
deforestation will be inevitable as part of the development process, Congo Basin countries have an
opportunity now to ensure that forest land development is planned and implemented in an integrated
manner that avoids, minimizes, and/or offsets (following the mitigation hierarchy) unnecessary economic
losses and social hardship. Early, integrated, planning for the development of mineral resources, forest
and agriculture investments may help to reduce future impacts, create local development benefits, and
enhance the sustainability of development.

This technical assistance activity on balancing mining and forest conservation grew out of an earlier
regional study on Deforestation Trends in the Congo Basin – Reconciling Economic Growth and Forest
Protection by the World Bank and PROFOR (2012, www.profor.org/). Through scenario analysis and
modeling, that effort showed that significant deforestation is caused by economic forces outside the
forest sector–including conversion for agriculture and resource extraction, such as mining and logging and
the associated development of roads and other infrastructure. Improved and more integrated spatial
planning was recommended as a way to anticipate and manage the emerging drivers of deforestation in
the Congo Basin forests.

Building on that recommendation, this activity was launched to identify, by means of a concrete case
study, entry points and provide technical information to support country-led efforts toward more
balanced planning and management of natural resources for sustainable development in the Congo Basin.
The aim was to develop analytical tools for assessing and developing different land use scenarios, and
their associated economic, social, and environmental impacts. The approach was to engage with a


                                                      iv
national process led by champions; support the process with maps, information, and technical analysis;
propose ways to engage affected communities and stakeholders; and to promote a longer term vision or
roadmap toward balanced spatial planning. In response to a request from the government to provide
assistance in designing a practical and inclusive land use planning process the focus of the activities were
adjusted to accompany the government in this process.

Scope and objectives of the activity. This report describes activities and results of a technical assistance
activity, Balancing Mining and Conservation in Congo Basin with Strategic Land Use Planning (P146347),
implemented jointly by the World Bank’s Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice and the
Energy and Extractives Global Practice, with funding from the Program on Forests (PROFOR, TF015224)
and from the Mining Technical Assistance Project (P133063). The World Resources Institute (WRI)
implemented the main technical activities under a competitively awarded contract. Recognizing time and
budget constraints, the effort initially focused on a specific forested landscape with an immediate need
to balance competing land uses. The TRIDOM area1 was seen as a relevant case study to begin learning
how forest and mineral extraction and associated infrastructure can be planned to optimize production
while minimizing or preventing environmental and social costs. In early discussions, the Republic of Congo
(ROC) was receptive to the technical assistance activity and a focus on one country was an opportunity to
concentrate technical resources on a single national planning process, rules and institutions.

Country engagement and opportunities. Due to the constructive engagement of the ROC’s key agency
for national planning, the Ministère de l'Aménagement du Territoire et de la Délégation Générale aux
Grands Travaux (MAT-DGGT) 2 and the opportunity provided by a new spatial planning law (loi no 43-2014
d’orientation pour l’aménagement et le développement du territoire3), this activity was able to go beyond
providing technical tools in a limited case study, to create dynamic engagement and a road map toward
improving spatial planning processes in the country. This engagement has helped to open the door to
higher level dialogue on strategic issues involving use of the country’s land and resources in support of its
overall development objectives. With the technical support of WRI, MAT-DGGT has convened a wide
range of stakeholders inside and outside of government in a series of consultative workshops to review
technical and mapping analyses of national and sectoral spatial planning efforts and advise on ways to
improve inter-sectoral coordination and integrated planning for sustainable development. Stakeholder
recommendations and technical analyses were consolidated into a “roadmap” for strengthening land use
planning in ROC, which is the main topic of this report.

Beyond the roadmap, this process has started to define and unlock the resources needed to begin
implementation and scale-up of capacity building and analytical activities to support a national spatial
planning effort. Building on Congo’s expanding national program for Reduced Emissions from
Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD+), there are opportunities to direct resources toward spatial
planning as an important element of the National REDD+ Strategy and efforts to address drivers of
deforestation. The Forest Investment Program (FIP) and the Central African Forest Initiative (CAFI) are

(TRIDOM) area is the largest block of intact forest in the Congo Basin. It is home to communities of indigenous
peoples and significant biodiversity – elephants, gorillas and chimpanzees – and protected areas. The area is also
rich in mineral resources, exploration licenses and potential for plantation agriculture development.

forestry, agriculture, mining, infrastructure and conservation interests.

This activity included a desk study of international experience and good practices for strategic land use
planning, a case study of land use in the TRIDOM area that identified competition and overlaps, technical
mapping studies at the national level, and stakeholder consultation workshops on how to strengthen
ROC’s national spatial planning efforts in light of the new law. These steps lead to more strategic support
for land use planning nationally and an effort to outline feasible, actionable steps toward more integrated
multi-sectoral planning processes and more systematic and harmonized sectoral planning processes. This
report focuses primarily on the latter development, consolidating recommended actions into a roadmap
for a robust national planning process in the ROC.

Objectives of the report. This report aims to: (i) share findings from stakeholder engagement in
developing a roadmap to strengthen ROC’s land use planning; (ii) summarize existing and proposed spatial
planning efforts and associated capacity; (iii) outline the main components of a national spatial planning
roadmap including major activities and outputs of a proposed implementation plan. This executive
summary highlights the analyses and technical inputs that supported the engagement process, the results
of the road map development and key findings and recommendations.

ASSESSMENT OF EXISTING NATIONAL SPATIAL PLANNING EFFORTS IN ROC
The effectiveness of the current framework, institutions and processes for spatial planning in ROC were
assessed as part of the dialogue on future planning needs. A brief summary of key findings follows.

    National legal framework for land use planning provides a starting point. In 2014, ROC passed the
    new orientation law for land use planning (Law No. 43-2014). This provides a decent framework and
    starting point for an improved national process. However, the law envisions some additional
    regulations, application texts, institutions and implementation structures that remain to be
    developed. The law is also complex in its requirements while capacity and resources for
    implementation are under-developed. The law requires preparation of a new national multi-sectoral
    spatial planning document (last prepared in 2005), but does not designate a time frame or require
    harmonization with sectoral plans.

    The current national land use plan dates from over a decade ago. The multi-sectoral Schéma
    National d’Aménagement du Territoire (SNAT) was prepared in 2005 and aimed to balance economic
    and environmental interests and safeguard sensitive areas. It provides a long term development
    vision and high level designation of regions and land use management zones, each with sectoral
    priorities identified. The SNAT is not aligned with sub-national department or district boundaries and
    does not designate areas to a specific level of single uses. The A SNAT does not necessarily have to
    designate single uses or align with department or district boundaries but there are also no indications
    of the links between the SNAT and more detailed plans. There are not strong incentives for
    implementation, monitoring or evaluation and does not explicitly cover biodiversity and climate
    benefits (e.g., carbon storage potential). Finally, the SNAT does not seem to have achieved the status
    of a primary reference document for later national strategies and sectoral plans (e.g., National
    Development Plan of 2012).

    Current land allocation practices could be better harmonized. ROC has a National Development Plan
    2012-2016 (Plan National de Développement - PND), the multi-sectoral Schéma National


                                                    vi
    d’Aménagement du Territoire – SNAT for 2005-2025, and sectoral strategies (e.g., Plan de
    Développement du Secteur Agricole - PDSA for 2012-2035). However, a review of current land
    allocation practices found that land allocations and use permits in different sectors are generally
    issued without reference to a previous spatial planning document. More specifically, the Ministry of
    Agriculture provides permission for agricultural land use (under law n° 25-2008) and the Ministry of
    Agriculture and partner ministries have issued Express Occupation Permits for oil palm plantations
    (outlined in decree n° 2005-515); the Ministry of Forest Economy issues Forest Concession Permits
    (under law n° 16-2000); and the Ministry of Mines issues prospecting licenses and concessions (under
    law n° 4-2005). To promote more coordinated planning and development, procedures will be needed
    to ensure that future sectoral land allocations are more thoroughly linked to national spatial
    development priorities and associated zoning, as envisioned by the orientation law for land use
    planning (law no 43-2014).

    Evidence base for integrated spatial planning needs improvement. The spatial and tabular data in
    the SNAT are based on remote sensing, maps, censuses, and technical information on soils, etc., from
    before 2002 and sometimes even from the 1980s. There is not yet a single inventory and repository
    of key spatial data, although MAT-DGGT and other ministries are working to build the fundamental
    data sets and map layers (e.g., satellite images, cadastral plans, socio-economic surveys, maps of
    transportation infrastructure, hydrography, etc.) needed to support sound spatial planning. More
    efforts to obtain digitized boundaries of lower level administrative units, population distribution, and
    locations and land uses associated with forest dependent communities and indigenous peoples would
    be useful for more robust and informed planning. Institutional systems and capacity are also needed
    to build, analyze and maintain an improved national geospatial evidence base and apply it to forward
    planning efforts.

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR STRENGTHENING MULTI-SECTOR PLANNING
Multi-sector land use planning can be strengthened by investing in strengthening institutions, spatial data
and analytical maps, improving the legal framework, and completion of national level multi-sector plans,
particularly the SNAT. Strengthening ROC’s spatial planning processes and institutions would result in
tangible benefits, including: (i) contribute to a better understanding of the land use potential of each
geographic area; (ii) indicate clearer boundaries for where and what types of investments should and
should not be considered; (iii) reduce conflict between sectors or between national priorities, national
government actors and local community needs; and (iv) encourage wider agreement in the context of
national development planning (and related budgeting), including the relative priority of key investments
and the need to allocate space for them to be implemented. The recommendations that result from the
multi-stakeholder workshops and the roadmap development process include:

    Establish a center for land use and spatial development planning. Such a center would provide an
    efficient, one-stop repository for all needed reference maps and online atlases related to land use
    planning. It could supply analytical and mapping services for sectoral and subnational planning,
    especially where capacity is under development and centralized services would be faster and more
    cost effective. Such a center could be linked to one institution or shared among several agencies, but
    in practice should likely be aligned with plans for a National Geomatics Center and a land use planning
    unit within MAT-DGGT.

    Set up key national coordinating units, as envisioned under the orientation law for land use planning
    (law no 43-2014). These include the Conseil National d’Aménagement du Territoire and the Comité


                                                    vii
Interministériel d’Aménagement du Territoire. These institutions will need clear mandates and
appropriate human and technical capacity and financial resources to engage in coordinating and
servicing an improved national spatial planning process.

Invest in baseline data and analytical mapping capacity. A systematic update of spatial baseline data
is needed to support analytical reference and zoning maps. This effort could begin with a thorough
assessment of ongoing investments in spatial data by key sectors and raising awareness about the
benefits of new types of macro-zones for the SNAT.

Align legal codes for land use and spatial development planning at sectoral level . Legal codes for
land allocation and zoning in key sectors such as agriculture, forestry, and mining need to be reviewed
and harmonized with the new national framework. These issues could be taken up in the process of
developing the Code d’Aménagement du Territoire, which the Government proposes to be developed.

Broaden consultation, participation, and partnerships in the planning process. Many plans have
difficulties in their implementation if stakeholders within and outside government are not engaged in
the planning process. The planning process suggests three key points when rounds of consultation
would provide valuable feedback and build buy-in: (i) after data collection and during the analysis
stage when trends and issues are identified; (ii) when determining the preferred scenarios and options
for development; and (iii) when considering the draft final plan.

Harmonize multi-sectoral land use planning efforts in an improved and updated SNAT. An improved
and updated SNAT would provide the basis for realizing many of the objectives of the national spatial
planning law. The SNAT can be strengthened by advancing sustainability, more explicitly linking to
sector plans and priorities, identifying community and indigenous lands, and relying on
comprehensive analysis and stakeholder engagement.

The following actions would result in a more robust and broadly supported national plan:
   Make sustainability more explicit in developing the revised SNAT . The process of revising the
    SNAT could take into account more fully the sustainability principles in the land use planning law
    and apply these in the delineation of macro-zones. For example, the country’s National
    Agriculture Development Plan (PDSA) proposed no expansion of new agricultural land into
    primary forest, protection of riparian buffers, and other criteria to ensure more sustainable
    agricultural production. Similar approaches and criteria could be applied in the analysis and
    recommendations contributing to the revision of the SNAT. For example, sustainability criteria
    for infrastructure development could be proposed that seek to balance increased accessibility,
    greater territorial integration, reduction in transport costs, and minimized negative
    environmental impacts such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss.
   Integrate more environmental and social issues into the SNAT revision process. The analysis,
    scenarios, and macro-zoning developed as inputs to the SNAT could be used to consider sectoral
    issues and trade-offs. For example, mapping and macro-zoning efforts could include additional
    specific land uses that are important for economic development and environmental sustainability,
    such as areas important for: (i) wildlife corridors (between protected areas, even in forest and
    mining concessions); (ii) supply of ecosystem services (e.g., carbon storage/REDD+, safeguarding
    of drinking water supplies, shore line protection/ mangroves); (iii) cultural services (e.g., spiritual,
    religious, and aesthetic values) and ; (iv) tourism development.


                                                  viii
       Make the SNAT more coherent with sector plans. Since the publication of the SNAT in 2005, new
        sector plans have been published. Zoning in sector planning has to be aligned and reflected in the
        revised SNAT macro-zoning and include: (i) macro-zoning from the National Agricultural
        Development Plan (PDSA); and (ii) zoning proposed in forest areas from forest concession
        planning (e.g., local development areas, riparian areas, hunting areas), as well as similar plans
        from other sectors.
       Encourage and build on sector plans or analyses that take sustainability into account. The SNAT
        revision can take advantage of advanced spatial mapping tools and ways to define suitable areas
        for specific land uses in these sectors, for example mapping of palm oil potential using multiple
        economic, social, and environmental criteria.
       Reflect community and indigenous lands in macro-zoning. A revised SNAT that delineates land
        important for local development or local cultural use would signal strongly that community and
        indigenous lands are important for the country’s economic and spatial development. The SNAT
        2005 did not include specific zones for local development or community and indigenous lands.
        Forest concession maps combined with other mapping efforts can be the foundation for
        delineating lands used by forest-dependent communities for cropping, fuelwood, hunting, fishing,
        and other uses.
       Consider analyzing different spatial development scenarios. The SNAT 2005 presented a single
        final macro-zoning for the country. However, for many areas of the country, multiple land use
        options exist, some creating complementary benefits and some creating negative trade-offs
        between different land uses. An analytical process could examine the implications of alternative
        land use scenarios for the whole country or important sub-regions. This analytical step could then
        be combined with a revised consultation process to allow stakeholders within and outside
        government to understand the consequences and identify a preferred scenario.
       Develop innovative spatial initiatives. Spatial development initiatives such as green
        infrastructure networks, urban food sheds, and agricultural growth corridors are examples that
        have been developed in other countries. The SNAT revision process could explore similar
        initiatives, for example a region that prioritizes mining, wildlife conservation and carbon storage
        (REDD+) or regions suitable for sustainable oil palm production.

RECOMMENDATIONS TO STRENGTHEN SECTORAL LEVEL PLANNING
Planning efforts at the sectoral level – forest and biodiversity management, agriculture, and mineral
development – were assessed for the following reasons: (i) proposed activities in these areas affect most
of the country’s land area; (ii) they are a high priority in the Plan National de Développement 2012-2016;
and (iii) there are many areas of overlapping interest and better spatial planning in these sectors and
alignment of their plans with multi-sector land use plans are essential for sustainable land management
in the country.

The assessment covered the sector’s relevance to multi-sectoral land use planning, leading institutions or
focal points for capacity building, past planning efforts, and data and map availability to support important
planning and information needs. Evidence-based land use planning combines information on the
ecological and economic potential of forests and other ecosystems, agricultural potential, mining
potential, and other land use options, which requires data and maps, analytical efforts, and zoning efforts.
Suggestions to fill identified needs in three key sectors are summarized in Table ES1 below in three broad
areas: (i) spatial data and baseline maps, (ii) analytical tools and studies to support land allocation
decisions; and (iii) zoning maps and efforts to define boundaries for a land use classification system.

PROPOSED ROADMAP TO STRENGTHEN LAND USE PLANNING IN ROC
As a result of the consultative process and the technical inputs and stakeholder suggestions, the ROC
government requested that the technical considerations and recommendations be consolidated into a
step-wise roadmap to guide implementation of an improved national spatial planning program. The
roadmap strives to suggest and organize priority activities and interventions over a five-year horizon. Of
course, proper planning requires periodic assessment and revision, so the expectation is that the national
spatial planning process would be continuous, with major milestones when updated national plans are
published (e.g., on a five-year cycle).

The framework for organizing activities and interventions is based on an idealized spatial planning process
that includes six aspects or components: (i) completion of baseline data and information, (ii)
comprehensive indicative planning, (iii) strong affirmative planning, (iv) coherent legal framework, (v)
effective stakeholder engagement and communication, and (vi) effective systems to implement, monitor
enforce and adjudicate the plan. The roadmap process focused on advancing to a stage of better
developed national spatial land use plans and did not fully cover the aspect of implementation and
enforcement of these plans. More effort on this aspect is needed in future assistance projects and would
have to reach to the sub-national level.

These components would not necessarily be implemented sequentially, but provide a logical framework
for discussing needs and priorities. The workshop and consultation process resulted in detailed activities
that could be carried out for each stage of the process and for each of the key sectors examined. The
following Figure ES1 illustrates this organizing framework of components and the key sectors examined.
The figure illustrates the level of effort and interventions expected to be needed for each sector and
planning component to operationalize the road map to the planning stage.

Broad intervention areas selected for the roadmap. The specific interventions included in the proposed
roadmap were prioritized based on the following principles, criteria and assumptions:
    - Invest in data and information first.
    - Apply analytical tools to develop land use options and to facilitate understanding.
    - Invest in a few strategic planning processes and move toward implementation.
    - Focus institutional changes and legal revisions on a limited set of strategic areas.
    - Encourage systematic information sharing and stakeholder engagement.
    - Designate a group of government conveners.

SEQUENCING OF KEY ACTIONS
The roadmap assumes a five-year time frame to launch the national spatial planning process at sectoral
and multi-sectoral level and to achieve an improved and useful national planning product. This allows
sufficient time for multiple planning outputs with stakeholder contributions to be prepared, assuming
that each output stays within a recommended 12 to 18 month limit. Planning outputs that require a
longer preparation time carry a greater risk of becoming too complex and delaying or avoiding
implementation. After the first comprehensive product, iteration through another cycle of planning or
two will be needed to allow for complete alignment of sectoral and multi-sectoral planning processes.

IMPLEMENTING THE ROADMAP: MULTI-SECTORAL LEVEL
The proposed implementation plan for a national spatial planning process includes prioritized and
sequenced activities at both national/multi-sectoral level and sectoral level. The draft implementation


                                                                      xii
plan seeks to build planning capacity and provide key technical outputs that will contribute to
improvement of the national level planning program and system. The implementation plan builds on the
key components of the orientation law for land use planning.

Institutionally, MAT-DGGT has the strategic mandate for multi-sectoral planning and is envisioned as the
overall coordinating agency for the roadmap process, and co-lead for proposed sectoral activities.
Sectoral agencies are proposed as focal points for the preparation of technical products at sectoral level,
which will then feed into the national, multi-sectoral process – eventually leading to an improved and
strengthened SNAT. In addition, other stakeholders and private sector interests have an important role
in providing technical inputs and feedback in the planning implementation process.

Figure ES2 summarizes the sequencing of major packages of activities and outputs to strengthen multi-
sectoral planning. The main report provides a more detailed summary of all outputs and a preliminary
work plan.

IMPLEMENTING THE ROAD MAP: SECTORAL FOCUS
It is important that the sequencing of major packages of activities and outputs to strengthen sectoral
planning are seen as useful by the stakeholders for enhanced performance within the sector itself, in
addition to informing the national planning process. Figure ES3 summarizes sector specific actions.

      Forest sector. To build land use planning capacity, it is proposed to start with the sector that covers
      the largest land area and already has spatial planning experience based on its coordination of forest
      management plans. In addition, there is much at stake in finding the right balance between
      safeguarding the country’s forest capital and obtaining large economic returns from forest lands.
      The multi-resources forest inventory (IFN) project underway will help to fill an important gap by
      providing information on land cover and land use based on extrapolated sample plot data. In
      addition, establishing official forest boundaries and land use zoning within forest lands, especially
      in the savannah region, would create greater certainty and fewer conflicts for agricultural and other
      land investments. If the national SNAT updating process moves faster than the availability of key
      forest sector outputs, it may be necessary to update land use and cover maps as an interim exercise.
      In the longer term, there will be a need for regular updates and long-term support for these types

                                                    xiii
      of maps (perhaps as part of building a National Geomatics Centre). Ministère de l'Economie
      Forestière et du Développement Durable (MEFDD) and Centre National d'Inventaire et
      d'Aménagement des Ressources Forestières et Fauniques (CNIAF) would be the expected focal
      agencies for this effort.

      Agriculture sector. Agriculture is a critical land use in the country in terms of both area and the
      number of people involved; it can also be an important driver of forest loss and other ecosystem
      change. Strengthening land use planning capacity for the agriculture sector can build on the PDSA
      experience of delineating macro-zones and applying criteria to avoid forest loss. The roadmap
      envisions emulating these criteria in other sectors. The process going forward can introduce both
      sustainability considerations and the perspective of multiple land uses in a specific area. Planning
      activities around oil palm and other commercial plantation crops can help to avoid a boom-and-
      bust cycle. The roadmap also suggests systematic spatial planning of small-scale agriculture
      intensification with associated infrastructure investments (e.g., roads, markets).              With
      comprehensive stakeholder participation, such activities could help to boost livelihood
      opportunities and land security for local people. Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage (MAE)
      and Centre National des Etudes des Sol (CNES) would be the expected focal agencies for this effort.

      Mining sector. Through spatial planning, the mining sector has an opportunity to move toward a
      more strategic and comprehensive planning perspective. Rather than planning for individual mining
      sites, this approach would consider multiple potential mining sites and their associated
      infrastructure routing, energy needs and biodiversity conservation priorities. The roadmap
      proposes sectoral activities that can support the national multi-sector process leading to an
      improved and updated SNAT. Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie (MMG) and Centre de
      Recherches Géologiques et Minières (CRGM) would be the expected focal agencies for this effort.

Planning for conservation, tourism, and infrastructure are additional sectoral planning priorities that are
essential to an integrated, strategic national spatial planning process. The suggested activities for these
sectors remain to be discussed and detailed in consultation with key government agencies and are not
shown in Figure ES3.

      Conservation areas and biodiversity. Systematic land use planning for biodiversity and
      conservation priorities needs to be added to ROC’s strategic national planning efforts. Such
      planning could include gradation of protections, from strict protection (e.g., national parks) to
      multiple use areas where land use changes are permitted (but certain management rules apply).
      The national spatial plan (revised SNAT) should include delineation of land supplying different
      ecosystem services, such as areas that supply clean drinking water, deliver shoreline and flood
      protection, provide opportunities for recreation and spiritual enrichment, are important habitat for
      wildlife, native trees and other species, and store carbon.

      Tourism sector. Planning for ROC’s tourism sector could easily build on the first round of sectoral
      efforts. This planning process would examine how different natural assets are providing benefits
      for tourism, recreation, and spiritual enrichment and identify new areas with tourism potential. This
      effort would strengthen the analytical foundation for planning in the tourism sector and could help
      to achieve the objectives of the country’s national strategy for sustainable tourism (in progress) –
      and contribute to a revised SNAT by adding tourism development into the macro-zoning. Some
      existing studies on tourism development, mostly focused on tourism infrastructure and local level


                                                    xiv
      planning for ecotourism (e.g., zones linked to protected areas), provide a base to build toward a
      more comprehensive and strategic national level.

      Infrastructure. Spatial data and information on transport and energy infrastructure is an essential
      layer for land use planning in the sectors mentioned above and for multi-sectoral plans such as the
      SNAT. At a minimum, investments need to be made to have up-to-date spatial data and maps of
      current and planned infrastructure. There is an opportunity to introduce a broader strategic
      perspective into the planning of infrastructure and go beyond the routing criteria typically applied
      such as travel distance, travel time, travel volume, engineering costs, and number of people served.
      Additional criteria could include, for example, avoiding high biodiversity areas, minimizing habitat
      fragmentation, or reducing the indirect and cumulative impacts of transport infrastructure such as
      increased logging, unplanned agricultural development, and wildlife poaching.

NEXT STEPS AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT
The proposed roadmap prioritizes key activities that are important to launch a national spatial planning
program and to produce sound technical products that can support ROC’s government in revising and
improving the national multi-sectoral plan, or SNAT. However, the roadmap also postpones action on a
number of broad intervention areas. These areas can be addressed in a follow-up program that also aims
to support and ensure successful roll out and implementation of the revised plans as part of the country’s
development process. The framework in Figure ES1 provides a strategic tool that MAT-DGGT and its
collaborating agencies can use to identify areas that may require strengthening in the future. This section
summarizes some key intervention areas that could be undertaken with more time and resources.

    Implementation of the plans after preparation. As noted, the roadmap process has not addressed
    in detail the activities and investments that will be needed to implement, monitor, enforce, and
    adjudicate national spatial plans, or address grievances once they are improved. Priority was placed
    on the need to get foundational data, maps and systems in place to support the emerging national
    spatial planning process. An effort was also made to link proposed activities to ongoing projects, build
    on existing planning capacity, and focus on what can be delivered in a reasonable time frame. More
    detailed consideration of implementation needs (institutions, mandates, capacity) should be
    undertaken as part of the proposed five-year roadmap period.

    Subnational roles and capacity in the spatial planning process. The roadmap process focused on the
    national level institutions that have the mandate for spatial planning and has not addressed potential

                                                    xv
    activities and priorities at sub-national level. Provincial and district level governments will also need
    institutions, mandates and capacity to contribute to the national spatial planning program. An
    assessment of sub-national planning roles and associated needs could be undertaken as part of the
    national effort proposed in the roadmap.

Beyond the technical, institutional and capacity needs built into the roadmap, the following additional
areas could be considered relevant for developing a comprehensive program of support to strengthen
ROC’s national efforts to improve spatial planning for sustainable development:
    - Government capacity to organize and manage a multi-sectoral national planning process;
    - Incentives and regulatory changes needed to ensure smooth planning across sectors;
    - Stakeholder capacity to participate in planning process;
    - Resource estimates for implementation of the roadmap;
    - Funding plan to implement roadmap.

Caveat. The selection of interventions and specific activities in the proposed implementation plan is based
on the earlier assessment of needs and gaps. It should be noted that not all planning components were
assessed at the same depths, based on the technical expertise and resources available to the team. For
example, the recommendations for component 1 (data and mapping) are more specific than for
component 4 (legal framework). The final road map and implementation plan will require further
validation discussions with MAT-DGGT and the sectoral ministries. This is necessary, for example, to
ensure that all relevant ongoing projects are considered and that the interpretation of the orientation law
is properly aligned. In addition, government partners may have alternate suggestions on the scope,
frequency, and timing of participation and consultation for the sectoral and multi-sectoral plans.

CHAPTER 1 INTRODUCTION


1.1 Background

The Congo Basin countries foresee major growth in transport infrastructure, and in the mining, and
agriculture sectors. Newspaper accounts, political statements, and long-term development strategies
confirm the ambitious visions for economic development in the region.

A wide range of investment and infrastructure projects are expected to catalyze this growth. For
example, Pointe Noire aims to become the largest container terminal of Central Africa (Caslin, 2015). An
improved road system from Pointe Noire north to Ouesso in the Republic of Congo (RoC) could transport
a greater share of goods from this region to the country’s coast instead of Douala in Cameroon. Likewise,
a proposed bridge across the Congo River would link the commerce of Brazzaville and Kinshasa and their
surrounding areas (NEPAD, 2016).

Most countries in Sub-Saharan Africa are heavily dependent on natural resource extraction, but these
resources are highly depleted in most cases. Figure A to the right (using data from the World
Development       Indicators                Comparing Gross & Net Saving by Types of Natural Resource Depletion

pattern.

The scale and scope of such significant investments will likely accelerate the scope and rate of land use
change. Rich iron ore deposits are expected to drive new mining exploitation in the tri-country region of
northwest Congo, southeast Cameroon, and northeast Gabon. Although the pace of financing and project
implementation has somewhat slowed as a result of depressed iron ore demand and lower commodity
prices, the region remains a potentially lucrative source of mining revenue should commodity prices
rebound. Forest lands and savannah ecosystems are also targeted for expansion of palm oil and other
agricultural crops at large industrial scale. Agricultural concessions, for example the Atama plantation in
the Republic of Congo, are under consideration, or already awarded (Hance, 2016).

Yet, land use planning and strategic zoning that would balance uses of land in line with the priorities of
multiple stakeholders are under-developed. Strategic development and land use plans are generally not
up to date, rely on a weak evidence base and rely on governance processes that are not inclusive enough
to address potential trade-offs and conflicts. Sectoral level plans are useful, – for example, concession-
level planning in the Republic of Congo’s forestry sector – but not well integrated or harmonized with

                                                                                     1
competing sectors and demands on land. Up to now, planning and zoning have had limited impact on the
wider policy decision making at national scale.

Fortunately, there are opportunities for improvement at this early stage where investments are still at
the planning stage. Most efforts to develop and exploit resources beyond timber are just getting off the
ground. There is still time to develop plans and reap the benefits from sound planning that aims to balance
economic, environmental, and social needs and reflects the contributions from a broad range of
stakeholders. National level REDD+ and climate change dialogues, for example, are creating some
momentum for considering cross-sectoral impacts of development on forests, which have value as stocks
of carbon. In addition, the Republic of Congo has passed a new orientation law on land use planning (Law
no43-2014) that awaits implementation (RoC, 2014). It reflects the country’s commitment to take
advantage of all available technical tools that strengthen the foundation for growth, boost the
competitiveness of the productive system, and protect and improve the living environment.

1.2 Motivation and Objectives

The Congo basin has vast forest resources, considerable mineral wealth, and enormous development
needs. How to balance natural resource use for sustainable development is a major challenge for national
and local government actors. A recent World Bank and PROFOR analysis found that most drivers of
deforestation in the Congo basin come from activities outside of its forestry sector (World Bank and
PROFOR, 2012). They include global demand for raw materials (e.g., timber, agricultural commodities,
minerals), new mining operations, and investments in energy and transport infrastructure.

This technical assistance activity (implemented with PROFOR funding) was motivated by the question of
how to help the Congo basin countries address these drivers of forest change and find a balance
between mineral resource development needs, biodiversity conservation, and other land uses. The
technical assistance activity aimed at developing analytical tools to support the Republic of Congo with
national land use planning processes and stakeholder engagement toward more sustainable and
balanced development.

The objectives of this activity were to develop analytical tools and knowledge products to assist the RoC
government to carry out more informed land use planning. During this process, opportunities arose to
engage in broader consultation processes with key land use planning stakeholders, provide technical
support to selected government partners, and ultimately develop ideas for a strategy to improve land use
planning. The lead government agency for carrying out this project in the Republic of Congo was the
Ministère de l'Aménagement du Territoire et de la Délégation Générale aux Grands Travaux (MAT-DGGT),
the lead agency for land use planning.

PROFOR’s and the Word Bank’s rationale for seeking opportunities to strengthen analytical tools and land
use planning processes came from the insights of an international study of land use planning experiences
(World Bank, 2014). The study identified the following lessons learned:
    -   Investing in strategic planning pays off. It requires systematic stakeholder involvement which can
        help reduce future land use conflicts and increases the long-term prospects of investments.
    -   Analyze tradeoffs of land use options and associated political economy early. Understanding of
        these issue can highlight potential areas of common interests among stakeholders, but also risks,
        pressure points, and vested interests.



                                                    2
   -   Analytical tools facilitate understanding. Spatial tools can help visualize development scenarios,
       land use impacts, and tradeoffs between different land use options. They are most effective when
       combined with stakeholder engagement.
   -   A government convener is the key for a successful planning process. A convening institution within
       government that has a broader perspective and a strategic mandate to develop and implement
       the plan can bring people together and balance the interests of multiple stakeholders.
   -   Planning in stages allows for learning. No plan is perfect, and it is the plan’s implementation that
       matters. The objectives of a plan must be realistic and the time-horizon for plan development
       and implementation must allow for opportunities to adapt, learn, and adjust to avoid costly
       mistakes.
   -   Systematic information sharing helps in plan development and implementation. The case studies
       demonstrated that information sharing helps build cooperation, buy-in, and shared
       understanding.


1.3 Approach used and partnerships developed

The World Bank competitively awarded the implementation of this work to the World Resources Institute
(WRI). WRI has had a presence in Brazzaville for almost a decade and long-standing working relationships
with government and non-government actors in the country since 2002. With its support to WRI, PROFOR
leveraged the ongoing work of WRI and its partners under the multi-year USAID CARPE-funded
Strengthening Central Africa Environmental Management and Policy Support (SCAEMPS) program.
SCAEMPS aims to build in-country capacity to more effectively develop, implement, and monitor natural
resource management policies in the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, including
ensuring that land use planning efforts at multiple scales prioritize biodiversity conservation, forest
protection, and customary claims to land and resources. The PROFOR funded convening process to
engage key stakeholders for improved land use planning complemented the development of a land use
planning atlas, an envisioned information and planning platform under SCAEMPS.

The approach to this work had three main aspects. The key components were:
    - Process: WRI conducted a series of multi-stakeholder and individual discussions to raise
       awareness of the new law, share information on planning processes, gather feedback from
       stakeholders, make proposals and generate support for a draft roadmap.
    - Technical: WRI compiled data, produced maps and analyzed data availability, needs, and capacity.
    - Policy: WRI carried out an initial review of the legal and policy framework for land use planning
       including the new orientation law on land use planning and relevant planning documents such as
       the National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma National d'Aménagement du Territoire – SNAT)
       published in 2005 (MdP, 2005).

The activity benefited from close collaboration with a wide range of partners. Their engagement helped
to reach beyond the original contribution of technical products and contribute to a road map for
improving spatial planning in the country. The following partners each made unique contributions to the
process:




                                                    3
    -   MAT-DGGT: lead convener with a focus on practical efforts to implement the new orientation law
        on land use planning and the development of a roadmap.
    -   MEFDD: key sectoral land user, contributor of map and technical information, and supporter of
        future funding to build land use planning in support of forestry and biodiversity and SNAT process.
    -   MAE, MMG, and MID: shared background information on sectoral planning efforts and
        contributed in stakeholder workshops.
    -   Republic of Congo media: covered workshop events in print and on the Internet and brought
        public attention beyond technocratic inputs (see Box 2).
    -   WRI: delivered analytical inputs, technical assistance, and facilitation to the engagement process
        that developed the draft roadmap and implementation plan.
    -   WWF, WCS, and Congo NGO partners: provided data and maps, shared planning experiences, and
        “ground-truthed” analysis and ideas introduced during stakeholder workshops.
    -   USAID: through its Central Africa Regional Program for the Environment (CARPE), the Agency
        provided indirect technical and policy analysis support via implementing partners WRI, WCS and
        USFS.
    -   World Bank: engaged in dialogue on follow on needs for supporting spatial land use planning,
        mobilized future resources through PFDE, FIP and CAFI, and provided logistical, technical, and
        process facilitation inputs.
    -   PROFOR: provided flexible funding and supported continuation and deepening of the work.

1.4 Engagement process and outputs

The project consisted of two phases. The first phase (October 2014 – June 2015) gathered information
on different planning efforts and underlying policies in the Congo and highlighted areas where sectoral
planning and land use planning could be improved.

The engagement process created strong interest among participating stakeholders to improve planning
processes and embark on developing a roadmap to strengthen land use planning. MAT-DGGT convinced
representatives from sector ministries to participate and actively engage in the workshops and in the
analysis of the current planning capacity. MAT-DGGT also expressed the official support to further develop
such a roadmap and signed a memorandum of understanding with WRI that outlined a set of activities for
long-term collaboration.

During the second phase (August 2015 – June 2016), the engagement shifted from the initial focus on a
case study and technical inputs to a broadening of the scope based on the relevance of the process to
national planning. The objectives of this phase were to further analyze key documents and planning
processes, engage with selected sectoral ministries (agriculture, forests, and mining), provide technical
support to MAT-DGGT, and to determine the scope of major elements of a roadmap to strengthen land
use planning. Additionally, in light of funding from the World Bank, specific support was requested to
include capacity building for land use planning for forestry and biodiversity as inputs into the SNAT
process. Box 2 summarizes main activities and outputs from the two phases.

The following activities and outputs are expected to be completed in the remaining months:
    - Finalize summary document with assessment, proposed roadmap, and draft implementation plan
        in English (May 2016).
    - Produce French version of summary document and associated documents for consultation
        workshop in Brazzaville (May 2016).
    - Conduct consultation workshop in Brazzaville (June 2016).

                                                    4
Media coverage helped to shine light on land use planning processes and gaps. Both print and Internet
media covered the two stakeholder workshops and the signing of a MoU between MAT-DGGT and WRI in
2015, demonstrating the level of attention this activity received in terms of responsiveness to key
government officials and agencies. Land use planning can benefit greatly from communication support
that makes use of radio, TV, print, Internet, and mobile phone messages to raise awareness about existing
land use laws and planning processes or to share information about draft plans and land use options under
consideration in a specific geographic area. See Box 2 for examples from this process.



 Box 1 Activities and outputs

 Phase 1

1.5 Insights from the engagement process

The following are the main opportunities and stakes for land use planning in the country:
    - Growing political will for comprehensive, participatory land use planning in Congo as evidenced
        by the passing of the orientation law on land use planning and emphasis on principles of
        participation within the law.
    - MAT-DGGT is strongly interested to strengthen land use planning, and Law no43-2014 gives the
        ministry the mandate to lead an aligned effort that fosters greater collaboration between MAT-
        DGGT and sector ministries and agencies.
    - The stakes for the future of forests, biodiversity, people and economic development are high.
    - The foundation of a REDD+ process with proposed links to improving land use planning is being
        established.
    - With mining prices being low, there is a window of opportunity.
    - The Ministry of Forests (MEFDD) has allocated much of Congo’s forest areas. Effective land use
        planning process would lead to some rebalancing of major land use categories and identification
        of priority uses for different sectors.

The road map is a good start, but many challenges remain. The main challenges identified through
workshops and engagement with experts that need to be addressed to strengthen land use planning in
the country include:
    - Support is needed to develop multi-sectoral plans and sectoral plans at macro and micro levels.
    - Resources are required to conduct consultations with and participation of relevant stakeholders
       at national and departmental levels.
    - Capacity building of stakeholders is necessary so that they can meaningfully engage, at central,
       regionally and locally.
    - Sustained long-term support needed for an iterative and inclusive process that allows for inputs
       and improvements across sectors.

1.6 Objectives and Structure of the Report

This activity was launched to identify entry points and provide technical information to support country-
led efforts toward more balanced planning and management of natural resources for sustainable
development in the Congo Basin. The aim was to develop analytical tools for assessing and developing
different land use scenarios, and their associated economic, social, and environmental impacts. The
approach was to engage with a national process led by champions; support the process with maps,
information, and technical analysis; propose ways to engage affected communities and stakeholders; and
to promote a longer term vision or roadmap toward balanced spatial planning.

This report describes activities and results of a technical assistance activity, Balancing Mining and
Conservation in Congo Basin with Strategic Land Use Planning (P146347), implemented jointly by the
World Bank’s Environment and Natural Resources Global Practice and the Energy and Extractives Global
Practice, with funding from the Program on Forests (PROFOR, TF015224) and from the Mining Technical
Assistance Project (P133063). In early discussions, the Republic of Congo (ROC) was receptive to the
technical assistance activity and a focus on one country was an opportunity to concentrate technical
resources on a single national planning process, rules and institutions.

This report presents the main outputs of the technical assistance activity, specifically a technical
assessment of the current situation, an explanation of the process of engagement and the technical
analyses, a draft roadmap, and proposed options for an implementation plan. The rationale for land use
planning is covered in Chapter 2, including discussion of the relevance of integrated spatial planning,
demonstrating the benefits of spatial analysis with national and regional examples, and introducing the
new orientation law on land use planning. Chapter 3 provides an assessment of multi-sectoral and sectoral
planning efforts. The proposed roadmap is described in Chapter 4. This will the main topic of discussion
at a workshop with stakeholders in Brazzaville in June.

CHAPTER 2 RATIONALE FOR IMPROVED LAND USE PLANNING


2.1 Strategic relevance and advantages of engaging in integrated spatial planning

Strategic Relevance. Integrated spatial planning calls for multiple sectoral ministries, businesses,
communities, traditional leaders, and local authorities to come together in a coordinated process that
may be time consuming and expensive, well before the promised or proposed benefits of investment and
development materialize. So, why should they do it? What’s in it for them?

Stakeholders and communities in the planned space. Communities and people living and working in the
planned space constitute a wider set of beneficiaries of integrated spatial planning. Through the planning
and consultative process, communities can provide information on their development and investment
needs, as well as constraints they face in terms of financing, skills, technology and access to markets – or
threats that they may perceive from some kinds of investments. They can also help to define and
demarcate the ways that they are currently using specific areas and resources, to document these existing
economic, historic, traditional or spiritual uses of space relative to other plans and proposals. Thus, by
participating, communities and stakeholders can advocate for their real needs to be addressed and that
their real interests are protected by the planning process. People can also benefit from the planning
process by better understanding the wider economic development issues, the direction of planned
development, including future employment, schooling or housing opportunities. On the other hand,
communities may suffer from uncoordinated planning or poor implementation. For example, if an
infrastructure project cuts off access to, or leads to deterioration of, traditional resource use areas, or
brings in new people who compete for limited resources, local communities would be negatively affected.
An open and participatory planning process, with checks, balances and feedback opportunities, would
provide communities with a legitimate course of action to seek consultation or redress in cases where
implementation does not respect the agreed plans, or where unanticipated negative effects arise.

National-level convening institutions with a mandate for economic development and spatial planning.
These institutions benefit by using the spatial planning process as a key tool to advance ROC’s economic
development. Having a more clearly planned development path, with wide societal buy-in, can contribute
to a country’s (or project’s) longer-term investment prospects. The process of planning builds consensus
among stakeholders on the way forward, which is likely to reduce conflicts and costs over time. Sound
governance and solid planning provide a reputational signal to international markets, investors and
financiers. The planning process also helps to clarify potential gainers and losers under different scenarios,
which provides a basis for defining and discussing appropriate compensation or redress, rather than
protracted controversy.

Sectoral ministries and agencies. These institutions can benefit in the planning process by raising the
visibility of their specific sectoral needs and issues within the larger development context. The process
provides a national or regional context for specific sectoral projects, showing how the proposed sectoral
investments contribute to wider economic development priorities. This can help to enlist political,
institutional and budgetary support for key sectoral priorities and investments, as well as increased
cooperation, broader buy-in and shared understanding. The planning process also provides a broader
context and mandate for identifying competing and overlapping plans or proposed land uses that may
need to be discussed, assessed, and adjudicated. The planning process can help to describe and quantify
trade-offs or compromise solutions, rather than determine outcomes from strictly sectoral perspectives.
This makes these scenarios, impacts, and trade-offs more concrete for decision-makers. Integrated spatial

                                                      8
planning recognizes that activities and sectors interact in a defined geographic space – and that each
sector depends on and is impacted by others, as well as the overall enabling environment for investment,
financing, and good governance. The planning process can also help to identify incentives or institutional
issues that need to be taken up and resolved at a higher policy making level. This type of high level reform
or the investment climate or the governance rules would be difficult to achieve from the perspective of a
single sectoral ministry.

Investors and financiers (including the World Bank). For these actors a rigorous spatial planning process
can help to anticipate, manage, and mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts that may come
up in specific projects or investments. Feedback from intended beneficiaries, local authorities and
representatives of other sectors can reveal areas of potential conflict and build in the dialogue steps and
design improvements that can make a project sounder and accepted. Awareness and information
dissemination around the planning process can also provide a common base, greater predictability, and
technical understanding that allows different types of investors to come together, thus making project
financing more feasible.


2.2 The benefits of spatial analysis of land use patterns: national and regional examples

Phase one of the project demonstrated how the land demand for mining, agriculture, forest production,
and the environment (e.g., biodiversity conservation, wildlife management, ecosystem services such as
carbon storage) could benefit from more harmonized sectoral planning. Spatial analysis that supports
land use planning – within each sector and across multiple sectors – can help to:
    - optimize sector investments and safeguard the country’s natural capital;
    - address the current lack of coordination between sector planning; and
    - support a strategic approach to infrastructure planning and reduce possible negative impacts.

The selected maps below, presented at project workshops in 2015, demonstrate such spatial analyses and
some of the major challenges and opportunities related to land use planning in the Republic of Congo and
in the forest landscapes of the interzone between Gabon, Cameroon, and the Congo.

2.2.1 Optimize sector investments and safeguard the country’s natural capital

Land use planning is needed to identify suitable areas for agriculture, mining, and forest production and
balance them with efforts to safeguard biodiversity, carbon stocks, and ecosystems services. Forest
ecosystems still cover the majority of the country (Figure 1). They represent ROC’s natural capital from
which the forest, agriculture, tourism, and low-carbon economy can derive economic returns.

The country is committed to safeguard wildlife, biodiversity, and ecosystem services provided by forests
and savannah ecosystems, which is reflected in the distribution of national parks and other protected
areas (Figure 2). This is also echoed in the way sectoral planning is being carried out. For example, the
macro-zoning applied in a long-term plan for the agriculture sector (Plan de Développement du Secteur
Agricole - PDSA) tried to avoid closed forests for future expansion. Similarly, allocation of forest
concessions and management plan requirements seek to protect environmentally sensitive areas such as
riparian buffers or zones prohibiting community hunting.




                                                     9
Figure 1 Forest cover, 2012




Forest ecosystems cover about 70 percent of the country (23.9 million hectares). Agro-ecosystems, savannah and grassland ecosystems, coastal
ecosystems, and urban ecosystems are concentrated on the remaining 30 percent. All these ecosystems contribute to livelihoods and economic
development. While non-forest ecosystems are important for food production, energy supply, and housing, they are also essential for
biodiversity conservation and the supply of ecosystem services such as clean drinking water, recreation, and carbon storage.


                                                                    10

                                                                                                     Aire protégée




The country has established national parks and other protected areas for the preservation of wildlife, biodiversity, and ecosystem services. The
majority of these areas are in the forest zone. In addition to the areas shown on the map, environmental sensitive areas are being set aside
within forest concessions, and new ecological reserves are being proposed. A national systematic assessment of priority areas for biodiversity
conservation and ecosystem services outside of the protected area network would strengthen biodiversity and ecosystem management
planning and establish a foundation for better macro-zoning in national land use planning.

                                                                      11
2.2.2 Overcome the current lack of coordination between sector planning

A quick comparison of the concessions for forest production (Figure 3) and mining (Figure 4) and the land
envisioned for agricultural expansion (Figure 5) shows close proximity of the respective land demand, and
in some cases overlapping demand for the same land (Figure 6).

In addition, growth in these sectors will require new transport infrastructure, not shown on these maps.
This infrastructure will connect producers to markets, allow for easier access to tourist sites, and reduce
transport costs, but can also result in unplanned demographic shifts and settlement expansions with
negative impacts on habitat and wildlife use.

Close spatial proximity of potentially conflicting land use, as shown in Figure 6, need to be carefully
planned and managed to ensure efficient use of targeted resources and reduce future conflicts. These
conflicts can create costs for other land users and increase operational and reputational risks for land
managers and investors. For example, palm oil plantations or mine production bordering protected areas
could block wildlife corridors between protected areas or have negative effects on downstream
watersheds. Harmonization of sector plans is therefore required to reduce conflicts between competing
land uses and increase benefits from more compatible land use types (e.g., new palm oil plantations on
degraded savannah that is not in an important biological corridor and also close to existing road network).

2.2.3 Provide a strategic perspective to infrastructure planning and reduce negative impacts

More coordinated planning of infrastructure—roads, railroads, electric powerlines, new reservoirs—can
avoid or help mitigate negative impacts. A land use plan at regional scale (see Box 3) can provide a useful
perspective as the following map of northwest Congo and bordering countries shows (Figure 7). The map
presents the location of potential future iron ore mines and the associated energy and transport
infrastructure needed in the region.

Figure 8 highlights how roads and railroad tracks to ship iron ore and access mining sites may conflict with
forest areas that have been proposed as conservation and wildlife corridors or potential biodiversity

area. Figure 10 shows potential conflicts with envisioned powerlines.

Most forests in the country (outside the swamp forests) have been allocated as logging concessions. They are part of the Permanent Forest
Estate (PFE). Concession areas require a 25-year management plan with associated land use planning and zoning. In 2011, 72 percent of the
forest estate belonging to the state was allocated to the PFE, and the remainder was Non-permanent Forest Estate (NPFE). Strategic planning
of these different forest classes and the official zoning of PFE and NPFE areas are needed to provide a common reference that can greatly aide
forest management and multi-sectoral planning.

                                                                     13

Mining licenses (operating, research, and prospecting) cover about 15 percent of the territory. The majority is in forests, and a number of
potential new mining areas are in close proximity to international borders. The Republic of Congo has a great opportunity to apply a
comprehensive planning perspective for mining that moves away from planning of individual sites, takes multiple potential mining sites into
consideration, and strategically plans infrastructure routing and biodiversity conservation areas (potential offsets areas) in support of future
mining sites.

Other sectors have plans for forest lands. The Ministry of Agriculture completed the Plan de Développement du Secteur Agricole (PDSA),
covering 2012-2035. It proposed new macro-zones for forest plantations, agroforestry, agropastoral expansion, and industrial crops. Some of
these zones are in dense forest, but most of them are in the savannah. The PDSA envisioned to refine its plan and finalize micro-zoning of
expansion areas by 2025. This effort can be aligned with implementing the new orientation law for land use planning. Industrial agriculture
expansion and small-scale agriculture intensification can still be planned in a sustainable way taking multiple sectors into account.

An uncoordinated sector plan can result in competing claims for the same land and have negative economic and ecological impacts on other
sectors and land users. To reduce conflicts and ensure long-term sustainability, plans for agricultural expansion, forest production, biodiversity
conservation, new mining areas and associated transport and energy infrastructure, REDD+ areas, and other land uses need to be harmonized.
This can be done by exploring land use options for an area with the help of stakeholder engagement and analytical tools examining the
ecological and economic potential of forests, croplands, and other land uses.

                                                                       16
Box 3 The Tri-National Dja-Odzala-Minkebe (TRIDOM) interzone: an opportunity for regional land use
planning

In 1999, the governments of Gabon, Cameroon, and the Republic of Congo committed to conserving the
largest block of intact forest in the Congo Basin. Known as the Tri-National Dja-Odzala-Minkebe
(TRIDOM), this region encompasses 7.5 percent of Central Africa’s forests and is home to the largest
populations of large mammals – such as elephants, gorilla’s and chimpanzees - in the Congo Basin. The
forest has remained intact because of low road density and low population density (typically one
inhabitant per square kilometer). In addition to the Bantu groups, the area is also home to indigenous
people such as the Baka and Bakola “pygmies”.

The area is also rich in iron ore, cobalt, and – to a lesser extent—gold. At the height of the recent resource
commodity boom, the zone was dubbed ‘an emerging iron ore province’ by mining operators interested
in the area. The region is covered in exploration licenses, some of which are in fairly advanced stages of
development. Many of these licenses overlap with either forest concessions or protected areas (or both).
There is also an increased interest in growing palm oil. As a result of low iron ore prices, most large scale
mining activities have come to a halt for now, but this can change once prices rise again. Although mining
operations offer development opportunities for this poor region, there are also risks of negative
environmental and social consequences.

Mining operations will contribute to population influx, which can exacerbate social issues and contribute
to forest loss, degradation, and fragmentation. The infrastructure associated with mineral extraction and
transport – moving ore out of the TRIDOM area will require the construction of a dedicated railway line
to the coast – would lead to cumulative impacts such as increased logging, agricultural development as
well as increased wildlife poaching and bush meat trade. As the mines, once operational, will require a
high and steady energy supply, there is discussion about constructing a hydro power dam in the Dja River
(Chollet reservoir), impacting both the surrounding forest and the region’s watershed. Fragmentation of
TRIDOM’s forests would contribute to loss of intact ecosystems, which are now producing a range of
environmental services that benefit both local and global populations. Loss and degradation of forest will
threaten the forest based livelihoods of the Baka indigenous people and increase their marginalization.
Fragmentation would also make existing protected areas more vulnerable to encroachment and
degradation and contribute to the loss of unique and threatened wildlife populations that need large areas
of remote forest to survive in significant populations.

The TRIDOM area could be a useful case study where the interests of different stakeholders overlap, and
where strategic planning processes could be used to consider the different tradeoffs to come to
development options and scenarios. Collaboration on integrated land use planning would be a way to
explore approaches to improve the potential for positive outcomes and mitigate negative outcomes

Figure 7 Envisioned mining sites for iron ore and other metals and anticipated infrastructure in the TRIDOM interzone, 2014




With the right economic conditions, iron and other metals can be mined profitably at multiple sites in the TRIDOM interzone. Infrastructure
supporting these mines—railroads, roads, a hydropower reservoir, and electric power lines —will affect a larger land area than the ore
extraction sites. Applying a cumulative impact methodology to assess future mining and infrastructure projects and planning forest
management, biodiversity conservation, and other land uses with a regional perspective are essential for sustainable land management.



                                                                     18

Planning of transport infrastructure for mining has to be aligned with planning in other sectors to avoid or mitigate land use conflicts. For
example, the area close to the Avima, Badondo, Nabeba, and Letikoubala mining sites has been proposed as an ecological corridor connecting
Minkébé National Park and Odzala Kokoua National Park. In 2014, a large part of the corridor was proposed as a forest concession. However,
the associated logging roads would create greater pressure on wildlife and make the proposed ecological corridor unsuitable as biodiversity
offsets for mining. Land expansion plans in a third sector–agriculture –could further contribute to cumulative impacts: industrial agriculture
has been proposed on the northwestern border of the Odzala Kokoua National Park, potentially severing the corridor.

                                                                     19
Figure 9 A new reservoir in close proximity to existing and proposed protected areas in the TRIDOM interzone




The Chollet dam has been proposed on the Dja River between Cameroon and the Republic of Congo. The reservoir, spatially extrapolated based
on dam height, is expected to flood forests and affect surrounding protected areas and ecological corridors. Sectoral plans also require
harmonization in this location: a new Messock-Dja protected area has been proposed, and the PDSA 2012-2035 proposed to expand agriculture
areas. The SNAT 2005 did not include macro-zones for wildlife corridors, biodiversity, ecosystem services, and agricultural expansion for this
region of the country. A revised SNAT could anticipate competing land uses and address them in its macro-zoning.

                                                                     20

The SNAT 2005 envisioned the hydropower site at Cholet and power lines transporting energy from the reservoir to major population centers
such as Ouesso and Makqua. For most parts, the routing of the transmission lines followed major roads. However, the power line from the
dam and to the mining sites areas will traverse possible conservation corridors and the proposed Messock-Dja protected area. Care must be
taken to identify routing alternatives that minimize forest loss and do not create new access corridors into wildlife areas.


                                                                     21
2.3 Current land allocation practices

A detailed review of current practices of land allocation and the associated legal framework in the
Republic of Congo found that land allocation and permits of use in different sectors are generally issued
without a reference to a previous planning document (ClientEarth, 2015). Multiple factors have
contributed to this:
    - Challenges within sector administrations to fully and effectively implement existing policies and
        laws.
    - Missing map that clearly defines and officially classifies Forest Land (and associated Permanent
        Forest Estate and Non-permanent Forest Estate) and Non-forest Land such as Other Rural Land
        (covering savannah ecosystems, agricultural land, and other land cover types), Peri-urban Land,
        and Urban Land.
    - Lack of harmonization of sectoral policies (e.g., forest, agricultural, mining, infrastructure) and
        lack of defined procedures concerning overlapping use.
    - Absence of a national land use plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres). The only existing
        document is a multi-sectoral National Spatial Development Plan with macro-zoning, the Schéma
        National d’Aménagement du Territoire (SNAT). The SNAT, published in 2005, however, does not
        have the precision that would allow the development of a land-use allocation document that
        determines the use of specific lands (e.g., for forest and agriculture production) in the country.

Figure 11 summarizes examples of current practices of land allocation in the three sectors. It shows that
for most parts there are no linkages to spatial prioritization in existing plans such as the National
Development Plan 2012-2016 (Plan National de Développement - PND), sectoral strategic plans, and the
multi-sectoral SNAT 2005. To promote more coordinated planning and development, future land
allocations in these sectors will need to be linked to spatial prioritization (and associated zoning)
established in sectoral and in multi-sectoral plans.

2.4 The new orientation law on land use planning

The new orientation law on land use planning, Law no43-20144, was passed in October 2014. The law
establishes the main objectives and principles for sustainable land use in the country and outlines the
main building blocks to strengthen sectoral planning and harmonize them with land use planning
processes at national and subnational levels.

Understanding these blocks will help to provide more granularity in identifying key intervention areas and
activities for the roadmap. The building blocks are as follows:
    - Schéma National d’Aménagement du Territoire (SNAT).
    - Planning and guidance for major parts of the territory, which include master plans for Congo’s
         important resources (schémas directeurs des parties du territoire) and associated guidance
         documents (orientation).
    - Sectoral plans providing public services (schémas sectoriels).
    - Subnational planning including departmental and town planning.

Notes: SNAT = Schéma National d’Aménagement du Territoire, a 20-year land use planning document published in 2005.
       However, the document was never really grounded in a broader stakeholder process or policy. The new land use
       planning orientation law, with specific reference to such a national plan, was only established nine years later.
       PND = National Development Plan 2012-2016 (Plan National de Développement - PND).
       Long-term sector plan = The Plan de Développement du Secteur Agricole (PDSA) was completed in 2012 under the
       leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and has a 2012-2035 time horizon.
       * This example refers to land allocation for large industrial agriculture development, which is one type of land allocation
       for agricultural purposes. It also refers to the specific allocation of land for the Atama palm oil plantation, as
       summarized in the Faure and Henriot (2015) review. There are other procedures for allocating land for agriculture
       purpose, for example for subsistence use. The lead institutions and underlying legal framework will vary depending
       whether this land is within or outside forest land and within or outside of a forest concession.
       ** The Faure and Henriot (2015) review of the legal framework of land allocation found that the role of different
       ministries in issuing express occupation permits is not clearly established. In the case of the Atama planation, the
       Ministry of Land Affairs and the Ministry of Agriculture had greater involvement than the Ministry of Finance. An
       agreement authorizing the occupation of a land reserve belonging to the state was signed between the initiator of the
       agricultural project and the Ministers of Agriculture, Livestock, Land Affairs, and Public Property. A presidential decree
       issued by the Council of Ministers approved that agreement, upon the report of the Minister of Land Affairs.
       *** The express authorization process has been complex and the conditions have changed over time (IM-FLEG, 2013):
       On December 17, 2010, the Ministers of Agriculture and Livestock and Land Affairs and Public Domain signed on behalf
       of the Congolese government an express authorization contract with the Atama Plantation Company to occupy a state
       land reserve of 470,000 hectares. This contract was to develop an agro-industrial complex for palm oil production and
       covered a 30-year renewable concession. In August 2011, Presidential Decree No. 2011-552 was signed, which
       establishes the express permission to occupy a reduced the area of 180,000 ha with 25-year renewable concession.
       These new provisions overrode the scope of the original contract. The Atama Plantation Company has requested and
       obtained from the Ministry of Forests, a deforestation license covering an area of 5,000 hectares to launch production.



2.4.1 Schéma National d’Aménagement du Territoire (SNAT)

The SNAT is a spatial framework that guides all land use actions by state and non-state actors. It includes
the major requirements that need to be put in place to achieve more coherent sectoral policies with the
aim to achieve more attractive urban and rural areas, greater employment, sustainable use of above and
below-ground resources, and higher private investment. MAT-DGGT has the technical lead to develop



                                                               23
the SNAT though a participatory process. The law proposes that the SNAT is a 20-year plan that will be
evaluated and reviewed every five years

The SNAT is thus the capstone of all land use planning in the country. The law does not specify the
technical approach to develop the plan and makes no reference to Congo’s first Schéma National
d’Aménagement du Territoire, which was published nine years before Law no43-2014 was passed. This
means that future revisions of the SNAT would have the legal space for modifications, for example in the
technical approach or in way stakeholder processes are conducted.

Law no43-2014 stipulates that Congo’s territory should be divided into different planning units:
   - land use management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire),
   - transboundary basin development zones (bassins transfrontaliers de développement),
   - special economic zones (zones économiques spéciales), and
   - industrial zones (zones industrielles).

Both the number and extent of land use management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire) and
transboundary development zones are expected to be defined during the preparation of the SNAT.

According to Law no43-2014, a land use management zone (zone d’aménagement du territoire) is the first
fundamental planning unit for planning in the country. The delineation of each zone does not need to
follow administrative boundaries and seeks to realize the economic potential of a unique combination of
natural, human, and physical capital in a geographic area. Each zone would then be supported by
investments in strategically placed education facilities, research and technology centers, transport, water
and energy infrastructure, and other public services. In the SNAT 2005, for example, eleven different
zones covering the whole country were defined (see more detailed description of the content and process
of the SNAT 2005 in section 3.1.2). Law no43-2014 states that each land use management zone (zone
d’aménagement du territoire) must prepare an economic development strategy (stratégie de
développement économique) and a land use plan (plan d’aménagement). Figure 12 summarizes the
strategies (stratégie de développement économique) and plans (plan d’aménagement) expected from the
SNAT.

         ** The Figure assumes that a future revision of the SNAT will build on the eleven non-overlapping land use
              management zones (shown as white boxes with black writing) outlined originally in 2005.
         *** The SNAT includes other spatial units for planning such as protected areas and transboundary zones. In the SNAT
              2005, Congo’s protected areas fell outside of the non-overlapping eleven land use management zones. In the
              orientation law for land use planning, the issue of protected areas is expected to be addressed with the help of
              plans and guidance developed for major parts of the territory (Les schémas directeurs de les parties du territoire).
         **** The content and technical approach of the SNAT is not prescribed in the law, but has been put into effect
               through existing practice. In 2005, it included a diagnostic of the current situation and a vision for 2025. There
               is no published reference that mentions scenarios of different land use options – as indicated in this Figure.
               Although other countries have them successfully applied in their planning.

2.4.2 Planning and guidance for major parts of the territory (schémas directeurs des parties du
      territoire)

Law no43-2014 classifies the country into ten major parts of the territory (parties du territoire),
representing key resources. They include both below and above-ground resources (e.g., mining, forests,
wetlands, protected areas). Some of the categories overlap, for example protected areas can include
most of the other types of ecosystems, and mining and economic zones could cover any type of
ecosystem. Interestingly, savannah ecosystems and agricultural lands are not considered a major part of
the territory. For each of these major parts, the law requires a master plan (schéma directeur) and a
guidance document (orientations spécifiques). This will be the responsibility of the State, and the aim of
these documents is to prepare national rules that balance development and the protection of the
territory. Figure 13 lists the ten major parts and the number of required plans and guidance documents.

Figure 13 Planning and guidance for major resource sectors (parties du territoire)




2.4.3 The sectoral plans providing public services (schémas sectoriels)

Law no43-2014 envisions a set of sectoral plans (schémas sectoriels) that translate the strategic ideas put
forward in the SNAT into basic choices related to the development of priority public services. Law no43-
2014 lists 14 types of services including education, research science, culture, sport, transport, health,
postal services, telecommunication services, energy, water, tourism and environment, construction,
social housing, and urban development (see Figure 14). Sectoral plans are adopted by regulatory action.

Two types of envisioned guidelines for sectorial services (schémas sectoriels) are of particular interest
from an environmental sustainability perspective. They include the transport sector (schéma des



                                                              25
transports) and the tourism and environment sector (schéma du tourisme et de l’environnement). The
articles describing the content of the schéma des transports state that a master plan and an
implementation plan needs to be prepared for each mode of transport. The articles describing the
content of the tourism and environment guidelines reference environmental impact assessments. Law
no43-2014 states the requirement to carry out environmental impact assessments prior to launching
major infrastructure work and the installation of industrial, agricultural or commercial units.




Figure 14 Sectoral plans providing public services




2.4.4 Sub-national planning including departmental planning and town planning

Sub-national planning, as specified in Law no43-2014, will occur at two important scales (Figure 15). These
plans are expected to be inspired by the SNAT. Likewise, other national planning documents discussed
above will guide sub-national planning at these two scales.

Each of Congo’s departments is required to prepare a long-term departmental spatial development plan
(schéma départemental d’aménagement du territoire) that establishes priorities for the location of
infrastructure, equipment, and services. The long-term plan (schéma) is valid for 20 years. Law no43-2014
stipulates that a more specific short-term land management plan (plan départemental d’aménagement
du territoire) is prepared every five years to implement the schéma départemental.

A similar town planning process is envisioned for all capitals of departments and districts in the country,
following the priorities established in the SNAT. Each town is required to prepare a long-term master plan
(schéma directeur) and short-term urban plan (plan d’urbanisme) for implementation.

Law no43-2014 also stipulates that a new land use planning code (code d’amenagement du territoire) and
a new town planning code (code d’urbanisme) need to be written. The former code is expected to address
all land use planning issues, and the latter code aims at planning tools and processes within municipalities.
These new codes are meant to put the legal framework and associated instruments in place so that the
different building blocks envisioned in Law no43-2014 operate smoothly.

In addition, Law no43-2014 defines the general roles of new lead institutions for the law’s implementation.
They are responsible for coordinating land use planning at national and local levels.

Figure 16 summarizes the planning framework and the building blocks discussed above. The Figure covers
most but not all the ideas put forward in Law no43-2014. It is clear that implementation of the law will be
a complex undertaking.

2.5 Opportunities and challenges of the new spatial land use planning framework

The new orientation law on land use planning, Law no43-2014, was passed in October 2014. The law,
introduced in more detail in section 2.3, establishes the main objectives and principles for sustainable
land use in the country and outlines the main building blocks to strengthen sectoral planning and
harmonize land use planning processes at national and subnational levels. Law no43-2014 creates the
following opportunities:
     - Defines a clear mandate for MAT-DGGT to undertake comprehensive spatial planning.
     - Aims to enhance coordination across sectors and administration scales.
     - Identifies principles of participation and consultation as critical to the planning process.
     - Has a vision to integrate development and spatial planning.

Implementing the law, however, is going to be a complex undertaking that requires overcoming the
following challenges:
     - Move beyond the primary focus on development (e.g., unification of the territory, public service
        delivery) and sufficiently address environmental and social sustainability.
     - Address the proliferation of documents and plans (e.g., SNAT, schémas départementaux, schémas
        sectoriels), which need to be prioritized, sequenced, and implemented.
     - Establish a high-quality, coordinated information base to develop sectoral and multi-sectoral
        plans.
     - Develop clear mechanisms to address issues of harmonization between existing sector laws and
        policies.

Coordinating the steps that need to be taken to implement the orientation law and the country’s REDD+
priorities could result in considerable synergies:
    - It would be consistent with component 1 of Congo’s draft National REDD+ strategy, which
         includes developing a national land use plan and strengthening the network of protected areas.
    - New land use planning coordinating institutions could enhance links between planning and
         REDD+ agendas.
    - Coordinated information systems could serve both land use planning as well as REDD+ planning
         and monitoring (e.g., carbon storage, safeguards).

Despite these opportunities aligning these two processes is facing considerable challenges:
   - Law no43-2014 places limited emphasis on conservation, REDD+, or natural resource
        management objectives.
   - There is insufficient attention to land use or zoning issues in the proposed Carbon Fund project
        in Northern Congo as presented in the Emission Reduction Program Idea Notes (ER-PIN)
   - The role of REDD+ institutions and envisioned new coordination entities outlined in Law no43-
        2014 is not clearly defined.
   - Long-term planning cycles envisioned in Law no43-2014 and decision-making cycles linked to
        government programs are poorly aligned.

CHAPTER 3 ASSESSMENT OF MULTI-SECTORAL AND SECTORAL PLANNING

The objective of this chapter is to provide a summary of existing planning efforts and associated capacity
to support land use planning. Some of the background information underlying this summary is not widely
available (e.g., SNAT 2005, spatial data holdings) beyond a small group of planning experts. Highlighting
this information will be useful to develop ideas for activities and outputs for the envisioned roadmap to
strengthen land use planning in Congo. In addition, sections of this chapter will be introduced and
discussed at a workshop in Brazzaville in May 2016.

The chapter consists of four sections. The first section assesses multi-sectoral planning efforts identifying
lead institutions, existing plans, and data availability. This is followed by a review of the planning efforts
in three sectors—agriculture, forest, and mining. The three sectors were examined for the following
reasons:
    - Proposed activities in these sectors affect most of Congo’s land area.
    - These sectors are a high priority in the National Development Plan 2012-2016 (Plan National de
        Développement - PND 2012-2016).
    - Better spatial planning in these sectors and alignment of these plans with multi-sector land use
        planning will be essential to achieve more sustainable land management in the country.


3.1 Multi-sector planning

This section discusses first the institutional underpinning for multi-sectoral planning by highlighting the
spatial planning capacity of MAT-DGGT and associated institutions. A review of multi-sectoral plans and
how spatial plans have been carried out follows. Next is an examination of the use of spatial data and
maps in these plans and other ongoing projects, to learn more about areas where possible investment in
data and analytical capacity could be made. The final section includes a set of promising areas to develop
specific outputs and activities that will be considered when developing a roadmap and implementation
plan.

3.1.1 Institutional setup for multi-sectoral spatial planning

The 2014 orientation law on land use planning makes MAT-DGGT the lead ministry for multi-sectoral plans
and the coordinator of spatial plans by sectoral ministries. Presently, there is no specialized technical unit
within government focusing on multi-sectoral land use planning, especially one that can deliver
consolidated spatial databases, produce new analytical maps, perform spatial land use analyses, and
develop options of different land use scenarios that take the interests of all economic sectors into account.

MAT-DGGT, however, is in the process of obtaining the political clearance for a land use planning
(Direction de la Géomatique). The terms of reference outlining its specific objectives and envisioned scope
of technical and human resources were not yet available for preparing this report.

In addition, MAT-DGGT is currently carrying out a project to establish a National Cadaster (starting with
urban areas) and a National Geomatics Center (Projet Etablissement du Cadastre National / Centre
National Géomatique). The Ministry is receiving technical support from two research firms (AFECI and
AECOM). In support of this project, MAT-DGGT employs 3 coordinators and 4 additional staff (EO
International, 2014).



                                                     30
MAT-DGGT has the hard and software to produce maps and analyze spatial data (e.g., a 2014 review
identified 6 ArcGIS licenses, 6 computers, and 1 plotter). This equipment supports the ministry’s other
projects such as developing master plans for cities experiencing rapid urbanization, determining
compensation for citizens affected by the arms depot explosion of 2012, and mapping areas to be
expropriated for public works (EO international, 2014).

MAT-DGGT’s GIS equipment and map making skills can support land use planning. MAT-DGGT would
benefit from greater technical skills related to land use planning, for example on carrying out spatial land
use analysis. Some of these skills may be obtained by hiring new staff for the envisioned land use planning
unit. Or they could be obtained with the help of additional training on remote sensing analysis, land use
planning, economic modeling, and land use scenario development.

Since the orientation law on land use planning has been passed so recently, there has been no practical
experience yet with conducting multi-sectoral land use planning that follow the law’s objectives and
principles. MAT-DGGT skills to organize and manage a multi-sectoral planning process can be
strengthened, for example by learning about efficient and effective approaches to involve stakeholders
within and outside of government that balance a sufficient level of participation, high planning speed, and
acceptable costs.

3.1.2 Existence and scope of current multi-sectoral spatial plans

MAT-DGGT is in charge of two multi-sectoral plans: the National Land Use Plan (Plan National
d’Affectation des Terres - PNAT) and the National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma National
d’Aménagement du Territoire - SNAT). The underlying technical work for the PNAT, originally conceived
as an output of the National Forest Inventory (Inventaire Forestier National – IFN; see section 3.2.4), has
been carried out by CNIAF (MEFDD). However, multiple factors have delayed the PNAT. In July 2015, the
lead assignment for the PNAT was officially transferred from MEFDD to MAT-DGGT, which then took the
first steps to set up an inter-ministerial working group to advance the PNAT. MAT-DGGT’s mandate for
the SNAT comes from the orientation law on land use planning.

The objectives of and relationship between these two plans will be discussed first. A more detailed
description of the process and content of the SNAT 2005 follows.

PNAT and SNAT objectives and interlinkages
A PNAT concerns itself with land allocation and land use options. Its objective is to achieve a balance
between different uses of land and avoid conflicts resulting from multiple assignments of the same land
for incompatible uses. A PNAT typically seeks to create synergies between broad type of land uses, for
example between biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, safeguarding drinking water supplies, and
eco-tourism. In cases where one land use results in negative impacts (e.g., cropland expansion in natural
habitats), different strategies are applied to either avoid an impact on most sensitive areas (e.g., no large-
scale expansion into intact, carbon-rich forests) or mitigate the impacts (e.g., encourage only small-scale
cropping combined with agro-forestry in certain areas). A robust PNAT would explore different land use
scenarios for certain locations, solicit stakeholder input, and balance economic, environmental, and social
criteria to prioritize specific land use options.

A SNAT addresses spatial development and land management more broadly (i.e., it covers more than land
use and land allocation issues). A SNAT is a long-term plan that seeks to ensure a balanced distribution of
people, activities, equipment, and infrastructure throughout the territory. A SNAT focuses on reducing


                                                     31
spatial disparities across the country by investing in major infrastructure and government services that
could help achieve sustainable use of above and below ground resources and diversify and grow the
economy. Depending on the respective objectives and the scale of a country’s SNAT, its supporting maps
may provide general long-term strategic guidance to prioritize infrastructure and land use for macro-
zones, but be not precise enough to support routing of infrastructure or serve as a reference to allocate
land for concessions. A robust SNAT would explore various development scenarios that take different
demographic, labor, investment, and land use options into account. Comprehensive stakeholder
engagement and spatial prioritization of investments that balance economic, environmental, and social
criteria, all contribute to a stronger SNAT.

The technical work supporting a PNAT and SNAT is interlinked. Both start out with maps of current land
cover and use. Subsequent analyses for a PNAT typically examine how current and future land allocation
for different sectors result in overlapping land use claims (e.g., République Gabonaise, Le Plan National
d’Affectation du Territoire) and then seek to develop maps showing options of future land use and
associated zoning. Likewise, a SNAT would rely on maps of current land cover and use to define land use
management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire) and associated macro-zoning within each
management zone. The process and criteria applied in determining future land use options for a PNAT
overlap considerably with those applied in delineating the type and location of macro-zones for a SNAT.

The orientation law on land use planning does not stipulate the technical method for the SNAT and does
not reference a PNAT and its specific technical approach. The law only mentions that policies on land use
and land allocation need to balance the interests of multiple sectors (« L’Etat met en œuvre une politique
d’affectation des terres qui garantit le développement concomitant des différents secteurs d’activités et
respecte les différentes formes de propriétés foncières »).

It is not clear at this point in time how MAT-DGGT intends to prioritize and harmonize the work on the
PNAT and the SNAT. The maps supporting the planned PNAT resulting from the IFN project (see 3.2.3)
have not been completed yet. The SNAT 2005 was published before the orientation law on land use
planning was passed in 2014. A revision of the SNAT following the new law can be aligned with efforts to
complete the PNAT. If the maps supporting the PNAT are of high quality and progress quickly, they can
become an important foundation to define land management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire)
and associated macro-zoning in Congo’s revised SNAT.

SNAT 2005: process and content
In August 2005, the Ministère du Plan, de l’Aménagement du Territoire, de l’Intégration Economique et du
NEPAD released the National Spatial Development Plan or Schéma National d'Aménagement du Territoire
(SNAT). The SNAT is a 20-year plan that determines spatial priorities for the country. This section
summarizes the process of preparing the SNAT 2005, highlights some of its content, and describes the
zoning approaches used. The analysis will help to identify lessons learned and identify opportunities for
improvements that can inform the outputs and activities in the envisioned roadmap to strengthen land
use planning.

Process
Technical work: A consultant carried out the technical work under the leadership of the Ministry.

Participation and consultation: From the published document, it is not clear how different sectoral
agencies and actors outside of government contributed to this process technically. There is no reference
that would indicate widespread consultation, participation of government and non-government actors,


                                                   32
or dissemination of the report, findings, and the maps (and underlying spatial data). Based on the
available information, it is assumed that there was no clear participatory process to consult on or validate
the final product. The new orientation law on land use planning requires MAT-DGGT to use a participatory
approach (however, without specifying which state or non-state actors should participate).

Principles of sustainability: The SNAT 2005 refers to balancing economic and environmental criteria. The
document makes reference to the importance of safeguarding protected areas and ecologically sensitive
areas.

Implementation: The review of long-term planning documents and discussion with sector experts could
not find an example of use of the SNAT 2005:
    - It was not referred to in the long-term agriculture sector plan (PDSA) or mentioned by experts in
        the sector ministries as a reference for mid- or short-term planning.
    - It was not referred to in the PND 2012-2016.
The SNAT 2005 was completed before the release of the new orientation law. The SNAT 2005 lacked a
strong incentive for implementation, monitoring, and evaluation. This should change with the new
orientation law on land use planning, which has made the preparation of the SNAT an essential building
block of spatial planning. With this new legal and institutional legitimacy, a strong foundation is in place
to implement the SNAT in Congo’s planning processes.

Diagnostic of the current and the future situation
The SNAT 2005 diagnosed the country’s current economic and spatial development situation. Different
sections examined the economy, natural resources endowment, population growth, urban and rural
settlement patterns, and existing infrastructure. The SNAT 2005 envisioned a future Congo in 2025
assuming harmonious development that would derive economic returns from the country’s natural,
human, and physical capital. The document emphasized the need for large investments, because of the
country’s high transport and communications costs and energy challenges. Low population density in
parts of the country were seen as an opportunity to safeguard rich ecosystems and obtain economic
returns, for example through tourism development.

To accelerate economic growth, the SNAT 2005 previews the main pillars emphasized years later in the
PND 2012-2016 including food production, forest production, development of mining resources, and the
tourism sector. The document also made clear that the state has to augment human capital, especially
with investments in health, education, and professional training. There was no reference in the document
that discussed different land use scenarios and associated economic development pathways for the
country as a whole or for a sub-region.

Zoning of the country
An important section in the SNAT 2005 is the proposed zoning of the country. To identify priorities for
economic development, carry out the analysis of resource endowments and future infrastructure
investments, and to produce maps, the document relied on the following spatial units:
- Five large non-overlapping regions covering the whole country.
- Eleven, smaller non-overlapping land use management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire)
    covering the whole country.
- Within each land use management zone, macro-zoning that specified land use priorities for
    agriculture, forestry, and mining.




                                                    33
Some of these approaches used could be instructive, when revising a future SNAT, but also could be
applied and modified when discussing ways to delineate permanent and non-permanent forest estate,
define rural areas, or determine different categories of agriculture use specified in the existing legal
framework (e.g., Law no 25-2008 - agro-land regime law).

Non-overlapping regions covering the whole country
For planning purposes, the country is grouped in five non-overlapping land use regions (grandes
ensembles naturels) that include: parks and ecological reserves; forest area; agriculture area; livestock
area; and coastal area. The SNAT also groups the country in twelve zones with eleven of them being new
land use management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire) and the twelfth zone being land
reserved for protected areas and ecological reserves (Figure 21). These zones were delineated on a
national map at 1:4,400,000 scale and are also grouped into three larger economic production zones:
integrated (multiple use) zone, zones intended for food production, and zones intended for forest
production.

Land use in the large zones is not exclusively earmarked for single use, for example the SNAT 2005
envisions multiple land uses, for example forestry and mining in the Zone d’Aménagement Forestier et
Minier du Nord Ouest, forestry and agriculture in the Zone d’Aménagement Forestier et Agricole de la
Motaba, and aquaculture and other agricultural production in the forests of the Zone d’Aménagement de
la Cuvette Inondée. All of these areas provide also biodiversity benefits and other ecosystem services such
as carbon storage. However, these benefits were not explicitly mentioned in the SNAT document.

Land use management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire)
The land use management zones are not delineated by department or district boundaries. Figure 17
shows the map with the location of the eleven land use management zones and the land area dedicated
for protected areas and ecological reserves.

                                              35
Specific macro-zoning of land use options for agriculture, forestry, and mining within each land use
management zone
Figure 18, summarizing the type of land use options within in each land use management zone, can help
to identify missing land use classifications to strengthen future macro-zoning. For each land use
management zone, the SNAT 2005 presented a map at 1:1,500,000 scale. Each map delineates specific
types of land uses for important economic sectors agriculture (eight different types of cropping systems),
livestock (three different types of livestock systems), and forestry (which includes plantations,
reforestation areas and forests with agricultural potential and forests with mining potential). Mining
activities (prospecting and exploitation) are indicated on some maps. In addition, each land use
management zone displays promising areas for industrial zones nearby urban centers. Likewise, energy
infrastructure (e.g., sites with hydroelectric potential, potential wind power sites, high energy
transmission routes) and transport infrastructure (ports, railroads, roads, and navigable rivers) are shown
within each land use management zone.

The text describing each land use management zone first discusses current land use and then outlines
major land use options shown on the maps such as forestry, agriculture, mining, tourism, and other uses.
In addition, the SNAT includes a chapter on the potential of Congo’s major sectors such as forest and
agriculture. This chapter provides area estimates of land available for timber production and the potential
area available for future agricultural expansion (in hectares). The latter estimates are based on an analysis
carried out for Congo’s first five-year plan and a soil map from the 1980s. However, a spatial delineation
of these potential forest and agricultural areas, for example with more detailed macro-zoning, was not
shown on the published maps.

3.1.3 Data and analysis used in multi-sectoral spatial planning
Up-to-date maps and associated spatial data are essential for good land use planning. To determine the
need for such data, their use in existing planning efforts and mapping platforms were analyzed. This
section looks first at the use of spatial data in the SNAT 2005 and the envisioned layers of the PNAT. The
next section reviews spatial baseline data available on the Congo Forest Atlas platform, which are relevant
for multi-sectoral plans such as the PNAT and the SNAT. The section concludes with a discussion of
ongoing efforts to build new data sets and suggestions for additional data and maps to strengthen land
use planning.




                                                     36
Spatial data used in the SNAT 2005 and possibly available from the PNAT
The SNAT 2005 was published more than a decade ago. The underlying spatial and socio-economic data
are quite dated. For example, the maps and associated tabular data relied on Landsat imagery from 2002,
a soil map from 1982 at 1:500,000 scale, a 2002 administrative census, and the 1984 population census.
More recent spatial data for multi-sectoral land use planning are available now, for example a 2007
population census and the spatial data layers on the Congo forest atlas platform (see next section).

The maps supporting the PNAT have not been published yet. Some of the potential data and map layers
that could be obtained from the IFN project are discussed in the data review for the forest and agriculture
sector (see 3.2.4 and 3.3.4). Ultimately, a comprehensive inventory and gap analysis is needed to create
a stronger spatial data foundation for a SNAT revision.

Baseline layers available for sectoral and multi-sectoral planning
Over the past ten years, MEFDD and WRI collaborated to compile and create spatial data supporting three
versions of the Congo Forest Atlas made available online for public use. Selected layers from the
underlying spatial data base have been applied in planning or land allocation decisions in the forest,
agriculture, and mining sector. Table 1 highlights the layers most relevant for land use planning.

Ongoing national efforts to build fundamental spatial data sets that can support land use planning
As part of the National Cadaster project, MAT-DGGT is working with consultants (Maps Geosystems and
E.O International) to inventory its data holdings. They include photogrammetry and ortho-photos for
large urban areas, satellite images, cadastral plans, address registry, socio-economic surveys, property
archives, administrative boundaries, and maps of MAT-DGGT infrastructure projects.

Congo has no national repository yet that compiles all sector and multi-sector land use plans (and
associated maps). Such a repository ideally would be in the form of an online platform that can be
continually updated and accessed by analysts and decision makers within and outside government. The
platform could be supported by the envisioned National Geomatics Center (Centre National Géomatique)
or the land use planning unit within MAT-DGGT.

A review of a spatial data inventory prepared in support of Congo’s process to establish a National
Geomatics Center (Centre National Géomatique) and a National Cadaster (E.O International, 2014) did not
mention any ongoing large effort to build new baseline data sets for the country. Additional research,



                                                                      37
however, is required to ensure that no other large project investment is being made to expand geospatial
data relevant for improved land use planning. These include an improved geodetic control network, new
rectified aerial and satellite imagery for parts or the whole country, reference layers covering hypsography
and hydrography, digitized boundaries of administrative units, delineated land management units at
various scales, and updated maps of transport infrastructure and utilities.

Additional baseline layers that would strengthen land use planning
Spatial planning in the Congo is currently relying on baseline layers that combine topographic maps,
regional land cover maps, and recent remote sensing products (see Table 1). Ultimately it will be
necessary to harmonize these existing and any proposed new layers to create complete consistent
geospatial data sets for the country at the appropriate level of disaggregation. It will also be necessary to
support institutions, tools, and mechanisms to make these data available for planning and other purposes
(e.g., by establishing and providing long-term budget support for a National Geomatics Center or a land
use planning unit within MAT-DGGT). Making progress in building such a national spatial data
infrastructure is essential for better land management.

The following baseline layers would be useful for both sectoral and multi-sectoral land use planning:
    - Boundaries of lower-level administrative units and of land use planning zones as shown in the
        SNAT and sector plans.
    - Lands occupied and claimed by forest-dependent communities including indigenous peoples.
    - Data layers showing population distribution by administrative area, urban and rural settlement
        types, and land use planning zones. This will require aligning boundaries for the enumeration
        areas of the national population census with these base maps.

To strengthen multi-sectoral land use planning, building spatial baseline layers will not suffice. Earmarking
resources to produce analytical maps that rely on multiple spatial data sets (often from multiple sectors)
are needed to support land allocation and land use zoning decisions.

Potential zoning maps may be required as a common reference to implement a law, define macro-zoning
for the SNAT, guide agricultural investments, or strengthen biodiversity and ecosystem management. An
evidence-based land use planning would take advantage of analytical maps combining the potential of
forests and other ecosystems, agricultural potential, mining potential, and other land use options.

Analytical maps can support sectoral plans (see sections 3.2.4, 3.3.4 and 3.4.4) and multi-sectoral plans.
For the latter, they can be helpful to implement key legislation related to land use planning or develop
macro-zoning for a revised SNAT.

For example, Law no 10-2004 (outlining general principles to be applied to the state and land regimes)
indicates that land use planning must take into account allocation of land into three main areas: urban
areas (allocated for housing, commercial and industrial activities; peri-urban areas (allocated for various
crops) and rural areas (with three categories agriculture, forests/forestry, or mining). A national map of
major land use zones that clearly defines categories outlined in this law would facilitate land use planning
processes and multi-sectoral coordination.

Likewise, it is worthwhile to consider preparing analytical maps that explore new ways of macro-zoning
for the SNAT and go beyond the land use categories applied in the Republic of Congo’s first SNAT (it
included categories for eight land use classes for agriculture production, three land use classes for
livestock production, and seven forest-related land uses under the forest production domain). This could


                                                     38
raise the awareness of decision-makers that new types of investments and government services are
needed to support these zones, for example to support land managers in areas important for wildlife
corridors, the supply of ecosystem services, and tourism development (all of them outside of national
parks and other highly protected areas).

For example, much can be learned from Brazil’s zoning approach at state level, which has evolved over
many years. It combines both ecological and economic criteria, and takes land for indigenous peoples
into considerations. This has resulted in macro-zoning that clearly identifies possible agricultural
expansion zones, areas of agricultural intensification and consolidation of crop and pasture lands, buffer
zones for rural settlements, areas for sustainable natural resource management (both in forest and
savannah ecosystems), space for potential future conservation areas and protected areas, and fragile
ecosystems that are outside of the protected area system.

Such a new type of zoning could then influence, for example the routing of the transport network to
service new iron mining sites. Or it could provide guidance on the type of desired mining operation
encouraged in close proximity to high conservation areas and wildlife corridors, for example an “offshore
approach” of housing staff that discourages establishing new permanent settlements and driving
unplanned land use changes nearby the mining concession.

3.1.4 Suggestions for strengthening multi-sector spatial planning

The following suggestions are intended to build on efforts to strengthen sectoral planning (see sections
3.2, 3.3 and 3.4). This section discusses first ideas to strengthen a future SNAT. The suggestions are
detailed, since the SNAT is a key component of the orientation law on land use planning, and activities in
this area are a high priority for MAT-DGGT. This section concludes with a set of bullets summarizing other
possible efforts to strengthen multi-sectoral planning.

Suggestions for strengthening a future SNAT
A review of the SNAT 2005 and examples from other spatial planning documents (e.g., Ghana, Morocco,
Algeria) are the foundation for the following suggestions. A revision of the SNAT in the next few years, as
envisioned under the orientation law on land use planning, could result in a more environmentally robust
and more broadly supported national plan, if it would address the following four points:

    1. Advance sustainability
        Make sustainability more explicit in developing the revised SNAT
          - Use similar language on sustainability in a revised document as was used in the Republic
              of Congo’s orientation law for land use planning.
          - Refer to specific principles that support sustainability and include them when delineating
              areas for macro-zoning. For example, the country’s National Agriculture Development
              Plan (PDSA) proposed no expansion of new agricultural land into primary forest,
              protection of riparian buffer, and other criteria ensuring more sustainable agricultural
              production. Explore whether these principles can be applied in the analysis and maps for
              the revised SNAT. Explore whether new criteria for zoning can be proposed: for example,
              new road infrastructure that seeks to balance increased accessibility, greater territorial
              integration, reduction in transport costs, and minimized negative environmental impacts
              such as habitat fragmentation and biodiversity loss.
          - Have a specific objective in the revised SNAT that commits the country to a “sustainable
              territory”, which was proposed for example in the Algeria SNAT. Such a specific objective


                                                    39
            could be supported by actions that promote new innovative spatial initiatives such as
            building “green infrastructure” outside of protected areas that support wildlife
            conservation, ecotourism, and supply of ecosystem services.

2. Integrate more environmental and social issues into the SNAT revision process
    Add important sectoral issues in the SNAT analysis, scenario development, and macro-zoning
       The SNAT 2005 delineated areas for specific land use such as cropping, livestock,
       reforestation, and plantations. The following land uses are important for economic
       development and environmental sustainability and could be considered in any mapping and
       macro-zoning:
       - Areas important for wildlife corridors (these are areas outside of protected areas, for
             example in forest and mining concessions).
       - Areas important for the supply of ecosystem services such as carbon storage (REDD+),
             safeguarding of drinking water supplies, shore line protection (e.g., mangroves), and
             cultural ecosystem services (e.g., areas important for spiritual, religious, and aesthetic
             values).
       - Areas important for tourism development.
    Make the SNAT more coherent with sector plans
       Since the publication of the SNAT 2005, new sector plans have been published. Zoning efforts
       in sector planning has to be aligned and reflected in the revised SNAT macro-zoning and
       include:
       - Macro-zoning from National Agricultural Development Plan (PDSA).
       - Zoning proposed in forest areas from forest concession planning (e.g., local development
             areas, riparian areas, hunting areas).
    Encourage and build on sector plans or new studies that take sustainability into account
       It is not clear from the published SNAT 2005 how some macro-zones for agriculture (e.g., palm
       oil plantations) or the forest sector (e.g., restoration/reforestation, wood plantation for
       energy supply) have been delineated. The SNAT revision could take advantage of more
       advanced spatial mapping tools and ways to define suitable areas for specific land uses in
       these sectors (e.g., as was done in the recent study by CIRAD (2015) on palm oil potential).

3. Reflect community and indigenous lands in macro-zoning
   The maps showing macro-zoning in the SNAT 2005 did not include specific areas earmarked for
   local development or community and indigenous lands. It may be possible to explicitly delineate
   lands used by forest-dependent communities such as cropping, fuelwood production, hunting,
   and fishing areas. A revised SNAT that delineates land important for local development would
   send a strong message that community and indigenous lands are an important building block of
   the country’s economic and spatial development strategy. For example, Cameroon’s land cove r
   map shows a clear spatial setback of forest concessions from major roads. This creates a zone in
   which more detailed land use plans for local communities can be developed. Similarly, the macro-
   zoning for the PDSA created buffers around villages that reflected average spatial use patterns
   expected to be occupied by farmers in the future.

4. Modify the SNAT process to strengthen analysis and stakeholder engagement
    Consider analyzing different spatial development scenarios
      The SNAT 2005 presented a single final macro-zoning for the country. However, for many
      areas in the country often multiple land use options exist, some of them creating
      complementary benefits and some of them creating negative trade-offs between different


                                                40
            land use options. The analytical process for the revised SNAT could be modified and allow for
            the preparation of alternative land use scenarios for the whole country or important sub-
            regions. This revised analytical step could then be combined with a revised consultation
            process that would allow both stakeholders within and outside government to identify a
            preferred scenario. For example, Algeria’s SNAT proposed four scenarios. Similarly, the
            process for the Ghana National Spatial Development Framework required the preparation of
            land use scenarios in the process to develop this framework. The country also reserved time
            to engage stakeholders to identify alternative scenarios for development and establish a
            preferred option for the future.
           Develop innovative spatial initiatives
            The Ghana National Spatial Development Framework proposed specific spatial development
            initiatives such as a green infrastructure network, urban food sheds, and an agricultural
            growth corridor. The Republic of Congo could discuss similar initiatives, for example a mining
            region that prioritizes mining, wildlife conservation, and carbon storage (REDD+) or areas
            suitable for sustainable oil palm production.
           Develop consultation, participation, and partnerships when preparing the SNAT
            Many plans have difficulties in their implementation if key stakeholders within and outside
            government are not part of the process in developing the plan. For example, the Ghana
            National Spatial Development Framework required a minimum of three rounds of
            consultation: (1) after data collection and during analysis stage when trends and issues are
            identified; (2) when determining the preferred scenario option for development; and (3)
            when considering the draft final plan.

Other suggestions for strengthening multi-sector spatial planning
In addition to revising the SNAT, multi-sectoral land use planning can be strengthened by investing in new
institutions, spatial data and analytical maps, completion of multi-sectoral plans, and revisions of the legal
framework. The following are five promising areas:
        Establish a center for land use and spatial development planning. This effort needs to be aligned
           with plans for a National Geomatics Center and a land use planning unit within MAT-DGGT. A
           land use planning center could be linked to a single institution or serve as a shared center among
           multiple agencies. Over the long-term, such a center would be in charge of the Republic of
           Congo’s reference maps and online atlases related to land use and spatial development
           planning. Such a center could also supply analytical and mapping services for subnational
           planning, especially in the case where such capacity has not been established yet locally or
           where such centralization can be more cost effective and faster in product delivery.
        Set up key national coordinating units, as envisioned under the orientation law for land use
           planning. This includes the Conseil National d’Aménagement du Territoire and the Comité
           Interministériel d’Aménagement du Territoire.
        Invest in baseline data and analytical mapping capacity. This will require a systematic
           assessment of ongoing spatial data investments in key sectors and raising awareness about the
           benefits of new types of macro-zones.
        Harmonize multi-sectoral land use planning efforts and complete PNAT and SNAT. Align work
           on the PNAT with plans to revise the SNAT (taking some of the suggestions discussed above on
           board).
        Align legal codes for land use and spatial development planning. This includes reviewing and
           harmonizing legal codes for land allocation and zoning in key sectors such as agriculture, forest,




                                                     41
          and mining and developing a new spatial development code (Code d’Aménagement du
          Territoire).
3.2 Forest sector

This section first identifies the drivers of deforestation and the link to land use planning, then moves to
an overview of the leading forest institutions and programs, a summary of planning efforts, and an
assessment of data and map availability to determine important planning and information needs. The
forest section concludes with suggestions to fill some of these needs.

3.2.1 Forest resources and drivers of deforestation

The Republic of Congo is home to a globally important level of forest cover, estimated at 23.9 million
hectares, about seventy percent of the national territory (MEFDD/CNIAF, 2015). Almost all (97 percent)
is humid tropical forests, and more than 80 percent is state forest. Forest cover is not uniform across the
country: the departments of Likouala, Sangha, and Lékoumou are dominated by dense forests, while the
departments of Pool, Bouenza, and Plateaux are dominated by savannah. The departments of Cuvette,
Cuvette-Ouest, Niari, and Kouilou are characterized by scattered forests. Brazzaville and Pointe-Noire are
mainly urbanized with little dense forest.

The country is now developing a national program for Reduced Emissions from Deforestation and Forest
Degradation (REDD+) to address major drivers of deforestation. REDD+ is a global initiative that aims to
provide economic incentives that encourage changing practices and reducing pressure on forests.

Though the deforestation rate is now low (less than 0.1 percent per year), it is likely to accelerate without
proper planning and control. Deforestation in Congo is driven directly by shifting agriculture (slash and
burn), production and consumption of wood energy, unsustainable or illegal logging, mining
development, the development of infrastructure in urban areas, and the construction of roads. Indirect
drivers such as global demand for timber and other commodities reinforce these direct drivers.5 Pressure
on forests and the ecosystem services they provide is expected to remain significant at the national level
due to the combination of large infrastructure development in previously remote areas, a lack of oversight
capacity and enforcement of environmental laws, a lack of land use planning, and overall weaknesses in
policy coordination. Rural poverty, inefficient production and use of charcoal, and a lack of alternative
energy supplies also contribute to local deforestation and degradation.

The Republic of Congo has set up institutions and programs to manage its forest resources, which in turn
have invested in mapping and spatial planning. If spatial planning for the forest sector is further
strengthened and becomes well embedded in multi-sectoral land use planning, it carries the promise that
some of these pressures on forest resources can be avoided or reduced.

3.2.2 Institutional setup for spatial planning in the forest sector

In the forest sector, the technical capacity to support land use planning can be found in the National
Centre for Forest Resources and Fauna Inventory (Centre National d'Inventaire et d'Aménagement des
Ressources Forestières et Fauniques - CNIAF), the Service for Forest Inventories and Management (Service
des Inventaires et Aménagement Forestier - SIAF), and the Directorate of Studies and Planning (Directions

des Etudes et de la Planification - DEP). These institutions or units are associated with the Ministry of
Forest Economy and Sustainable Development (Ministère de l'Economie Forestière et du Développement
Durable - MEFDD).

The CNIAF, a public institution with financial autonomy, is under the direct authority of the Cabinet of the
MEFDD. CNIAF was established in 2000 to support sustainable resources management by filling data gaps
on forest resources, updating national forest maps, and managing other forest related projects (e.g., the
country’s multi-resources inventory - IFN). SIAF is responsible for processing information related to the
creation and modification of forest concessions. The Service archives all relevant information related to
forest concessions. The Directorate of Studies and Planning (Directions des Etudes et de la Planification -
DEP) within MEFDD has a planning mandate with a Statistical Service and a Planning Service. The
Statistical Service compiles and analyzes statistical data for the forest sector. The Planning Service
develops and coordinates MEFDD development plans and programs within the country’s medium-term
public expenditure framework.

In addition, other government efforts in the forest sector are relevant to land use planning. These include
the Information System for Forest Management and Sustainable Development (Système d’Information
pour la Gestion Forestière et de la Développement Durable - SIFODD) and the National Program on
Afforestation and Reforestation (Programme National d'Afforestation et de Reboisement - PRONAR).

SIFODD was launched in February 2014, a joint project by MEFDD and the United Nations Development
Programme—UNDP (FAOLEX, 2014). SIFODD is a national register of projects implementing the REDD+
process. SIFODD is receiving technical and financial support to strengthen database management and
computer systems in the forest sector, create online platforms, and boost map making (Panapress, 2015).

PRONAR, launched in 2011, seeks to establish a million hectares of forest and agroforestry plantations
during 2011-2020 relying on restoration of dense forests and planting of fast-growing exotic and local tree
species. The program engages private, public, and local partners (pronarcongo.org, 2016) and aims to
achieve its objectives with the help of industrial plantations (about 700,000 hectares led by the private
sector), state plantations (about 200,000 hectares led by Congo’s National Reforestation Service), and
village or community plantations (about 100,000 hectares). About half of the plantations planned are in
the center of the country in the departments of Pool and Plateaux (Oyono et al., 2014). The overall budget
is about 1.1 billion CFAs (Agence d’Information d’Afrique Centrale, 2015).

Both SIFODD and PRONAR have received government and donor-funded support including vehicles,
computers, and office equipment. These two projects have compiled and analyzed resource information,
for example maps showing GPS points and boundaries of afforestation blocks and reports synthesizing
socio-economic and forest information for selected regions.

Ideally, the establishment of new plantations would be aligned with multi-sectoral land use planning and
associated macro-zoning. Vice versa the area targets of the strategy document behind the PRONAR
program can be incorporated in the development of Congo’s National Land Use Plan (Plan National
d’Affectations des Terres) and a revision of the SNAT.

Project-financed support for CNIAF, which had a technical unit of 15 forestry and water engineers in 2011
(BAD/CBFF, 2011), has built capacity of the staff and the institution over the past years. This includes, for
example strengthening of digital mapping skills, acquiring remote sensing and GIS tools, procuring



                                                     43
technical data collection and processing equipment for field surveys, and gaining experience with the
multi-resources forest inventory.

Of the examined forest sector institutions, CNIAF has the strongest cartographic and GIS skills. All forest
sector institutions would benefit from greater experience related to applying analytical tools to determine
priorities for the forest sector, delineate priorities for different types of forest use, and apply these skills
in multi-sectoral land use planning.

3.2.3 Existence and scope of current spatial plans in the forest sector

This review of spatial planning efforts in the forest sector is asking the following questions:
    - Is there long-term (more than ten years) sectoral planning at national level that provides a vision
        for the sector? If yes, to what degree does that planning process establish spatial priorities (e.g.,
        macro-zones on maps, quantitative area targets)?
    - Is there similar long-term sectoral planning at subnational level and to what degree does that
        planning process establish spatial priorities?
    - Does the National Development Plan 2012-2016 (PND 2012-2016), a macro-economic, medium
        term plan, have any spatial prioritization for the forest sector and how is this linked to long-term
        spatial plans?

Existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization in the forest sector
The forest sector does not have a long-term strategic spatial plan at national scale that defines land use,
macro-zoning, and other spatial priorities. The sector, however, has established long-term spatial
planning at the sub-national level (see Figure 19).

Figure 19 Existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization in the forest sector




    Notes: MEFDD = Ministère de l'Economie Forestière et du Développement Durable
           See Figure 20, which shows the extent of these concessions and the associated forest management units.

Sub-national spatial planning in the forest sector is linked to the government process to attribute land for
forest production (in the Permanent Forest Domain) and allocate forest concessions to companies. For
each forest concession, companies are required to prepare a 25-year management plan. Each plan
includes maps that define different non-overlapping land use zones.

Not all forested areas in the country have been attributed for forest production yet. Similarly, most
allocated concessions do not yet have completed management plans with the associated land use zones
(see Figure 20), which are demanded by the forest law to operate legally. Those which have management
plans are mostly foreign owned with FSC certification. For example, the boundaries of forest concessions
for most of Likouala department are now known, and management plans have been prepared or are being

prepared. This is not the case for selected concessions in the central and southern part of the country
which are mostly owned by Chinese and national companies.

National Development Plan 2012-2016 and spatial prioritization for the forest sector
Interviews with sector experts pointed toward the National Development Plan (PND) as the most referred
to medium-term planning document. The PND is a multi-sector, economic development plan. The most
recent version covered 2012-2016, and the process to develop the next five-year plan is just being
launched.

The forest sector is an important priority for economic diversification in the PND 2012-2016. However,
spatial prioritization that establishes quantitative area targets for and highlights the location of new
investments is very limited within the PND for all sectors. For the forest sector, the PND 2012-2016 makes
spatial references when describing baseline conditions: 9.5 million hectares of production forest, the
share of fully (27 percent) and partially (47 percent) approved forest concessions, and the total area under
FSC certification. The PND mentions a target of 600,000 hectares for reforestation and regeneration of
forestry resources (PRONAR project) and a target of 3.7 million hectares of parks and protected areas, but
no spatial priorities are provided for these targets or for other new forest investments (see Figure 21).



                                                    45
In principle, the PND should be congruent with long-term spatial development plans in the forest sector
and the country’s multi-sectoral spatial development framework such as the SNAT. However, as Figure
21 indicates, such linkages between plans were not expressed in the PND 2012-2016. It does not
reference the SNAT 2005 for any sector-specific spatial priorities. Likewise, the PND could not refer to a
long-term national spatial plan for the forest sector, because it has not been prepared yet.

3.2.4 Data and analysis used in support of spatial planning in the forest sector

Up-to-date maps and associated spatial data are essential for good land use planning. To determine the
need for such data, existing planning efforts were analyzed and experts at government agencies were
interviewed. For the sectoral analysis, the approach to collect information has been organized in the
following categories:
     - Baseline layers available and used.
     - Documented maps and data layers used in sector-specific planning documents or land allocation
        decisions.
     - Ongoing efforts to build new spatial data sets, for example supported by international
        development cooperation projects or national budget allocation.
     - New data layers and maps needed as prioritized in selected strategies (e.g., PND), suggested in
        interviews with key experts in the ministry, or based on a gap analysis comparing the Republic of
        Congo’s available data with a list of spatial data used in land use planning in other countries.

Baseline layers available and used in the forest sector and other sectors
The forest sector is relying on a combination of historic topographic maps, regional land cover maps, and
recent remote sensing products (see discussion of baseline layers in section 3.1.3).

Sector-specific data used in spatial planning for the forest sector
By May 2016, no exhaustive forest resource inventory with spatial data that could support land use
planning had been published yet (see next section discussing ongoing work). The only spatial data and
maps used for planning are the management plans for concessions that have completed them, and each
plan includes maps that define different non-overlapping land use zones. The following types of land uses
have been delineated (and the underlying spatial data and maps are in principle available for land use
planning):




                                                          46
    -   forest production,
    -   forest areas dedicated to silvicultural research and biodiversity conservation,
    -   protection of environmentally sensitive areas (e.g., riparian buffers),
    -   and community use (e.g., agriculture and other livelihoods).

In addition, each plan delineates village hunting areas (including areas where hunting is prohibited) and
road infrastructure to extract timber resources.

These forest management and land use plans do not cover all forest lands in the country, because not all
forested areas have been attributed for forest production, and not all allocated concessions have
completed management plans (see Figure 20). There is no complete consolidated national database yet
that contains all the land use zoning from the forest concessions.

Ongoing national efforts to build spatial data sets for the forest sector
Between 2005 and 2010, CNIAF and FAO completed the pilot phase for a national forest resource
inventory (FAO, 2007). The effort relied on 42 topographic maps (ING; 1:200,000), collected 109
biophysical and socioeconomic indicators for 130 sample points, and developed an assessment manual.
This pilot was succeeded by the National Forest Inventory (Inventaire Forestier National - IFN).

The IFN project is a multi-resources inventory and covers the whole country and all ecosystems. The
project includes a component to develop a National Land Use Plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres
- PNAT). The National Center for Inventory and Planning of Forest and Wildlife (CNIAF) is carrying out the
IFN. The project, approved in 2010 and planned to be completed in 2.5 years, has been extended until
June 2016. The Congo Basin Forest Fund provided 2.5 million Euros, and CNIAF contributed 0.5 million
Euros. At the writing of this report, biophysical and socio-economic field data collection and data entry
have been completed. The analysis phase, including data base and map development, is currently
scheduled to end in June 2016.

The final outputs of this project are expected to boost the supply of data and maps needed for better
forest management and land use planning (BAD/CBFF, 2011) and include:
    - Database representing the national forest inventory including 459 data collection points of
        biophysical and socio-economic data.
    - Forest carbon stock database.
    - Map of forest potential by type of forest resource and map of resource potential by sector of
        activity.
    - Map showing National Land Use Plan (Plan d’Affectation des Terres – PNAT). (See more detailed
        discussion of the PNAT and its role in multi-sectoral planning in section 3.5)

These IFN outputs will help to map and define the Permanent Forest Estate and Non-permanent Forest
Estate. So far, there has been no “official” spatial delineation of the two forest estate classes that is
harmonized with land use in other sectors such as agriculture.

The IFN databases with biophysical (e.g., forest stocks, carbon stocks) and socio-economic indicators can
be used to build models of timber and non-timber-based forest products that can help to define economic
development and land use priorities. In addition, baseline levels for carbon stocks can be established and
an appropriate measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) system for planned REDD+ activities can
be set up.



                                                    47
The preparation of a PNAT envisioned for the IFN (and the associated establishment of a consultative
working group) should help improve managing land use conflicts. However, multiple factors have delayed
the delivery of IFN outputs including the PNAT. In July 2015, the lead assignment for the PNAT was
officially transferred from CNIAF (MEFDD) to MAT-DGGT, which then took the first steps to set up an inter-
ministerial working group to advance the PNAT. At the writing of this report, there was no detailed
information available yet as to what exactly would be required to complete the PNAT.

A second source of spatial data for further land use planning is the Project Appui à la Gestion Durable des
Forêts du Congo (PAGEF), which was completed in 2015 by CNIAF and partners. The five-year, 13.1 million
Euro project sought to improve management of forest concessions in southern Congo. The project
increased information for nearly 6 million hectares of forests by completing detailed forest inventories,
carrying out ecological and socio-economic studies, mapping forest stands and land use, and identifying
priority areas for wildlife and biodiversity conservation.

Additional data and maps needed to strengthen spatial planning in the forest sector
Data and maps required to strengthen spatial planning can be identified with the help of a checklist. The
checklist in Figure 22 compares available data and maps against a hierarchy of information products and
specific map examples within each information product.

At the bottom of the hierarchy are spatial data and baseline maps. Next are summary maps, which
combine sample data, remote sensing imagery, and other spatial data, for example a map in the Congo
forest atlas showing forest extent by different forest types. More complex analytical maps, the next level,
rely on different spatial data sets and summary maps (often from multiple sectors) to support land
allocation and land use zoning decisions. Such analytical maps answer questions important for decision
making, such as where the most promising areas for forest restoration might be. At the top of the
hierarchy are maps defining the boundaries for a land use classification or zoning system, which then can
be endorsed by national law or local ordinance. These maps include, for example, potential zoning maps
that may be required as a common reference to implement a law, define macro-zoning for the SNAT,
guide agricultural investments, or strengthen biodiversity and ecosystem management.

Information products at the top of this hierarchy require high accuracy and greater review and
stakeholder input from different government sectors and land users than products at the bottom.
Evidence-based land use planning takes advantage of analytical maps that combine information on the
ecological and economic potential of forests and other ecosystems, agricultural potential, mining
potential, and other land use options.

Figure 22 takes the previous review of spatial data and maps and groups them into three classes: available,
possibly available, and not available. The figure also gauges the depth of supply of analytical and land use
zoning maps. Unavailable maps represent an important information gap in the forest sector, which a
roadmap to strengthen land use planning can fill.

The following major pattern on data and map availability and additional information needs emerges from
Figure 22:

   -   Spatial data and summary maps are available, but much is expected from the IFN. It should be
       possible in principle to spatially extrapolate the sample data from the IFN multi-resources
       survey and create summary maps (e.g., standing timber stock, forest types). No information was
       available yet on how many of the proposed maps in Figure 22 the IFN will and can create.

   -   In principle, the IFN could be the source of information for non-forest ecosystems and other non-
       forest related land uses. The survey asks about land cover and use at each sample point. Since
       the sample grid covered the whole country (but not all sample points where accessible, for
       example in swamp forests), the IFN can provide information on other ecosystems (e.g., savannah
       and grassland ecosystems, agro-ecosystems) and non-forest related land uses. This will require
       spatial extrapolation techniques and use of other remote sensing products.

   -   There is a gap for analytical maps, especially on the potential of forest lands. The types of
       analytical maps proposed in the checklist include maps showing areas most suitable for forest
       restoration and for tourism development. Most importantly, they include maps of forest types
       and uses that have been mentioned in the existing forest law and draft forest policy. Such
       analytical maps would strengthen forest management and the REDD+ process.

   -   Officially designated reference maps on forests and other natural areas are missing. The proposed
       reference and zoning maps supporting forest, biodiversity, and ecosystem services management
       and macro-zoning in a revised SNAT are not available yet. The maps from a technical study
       identifying suitable areas for more sustainable palm oil production (CIRAD, 2015) are available,
       but have not been translated into officially designated zoning and reference maps.

3.2.5 Suggestions for strengthening spatial planning for forest and biodiversity management

The following suggestions are expected to strengthen spatial planning for forest and biodiversity
management and contribute to stronger multi-sectoral land use planning:

   -   Consolidate spatial data for the forest sector and create new summary maps from the IFN. It
       would be useful to combine the land use zoning and planned road infrastructure data from all
       allocated forest concessions. Such a consolidated national database of FMU zoning could support
       both national macro-zoning and sub-national planning at the department level.

       Carry out a systematic assessment at the end of the IFN project to gauge the scope and feasibility
       of summary maps discussed above. Take full advantage of the data collected in the IFN project
       to fill data and information gaps for land use planning. If needed, provide additional resources
       for modeling and remote sensing products to create maps showing land use patterns and the
       extent of forests and other ecosystems.

   -   Consolidate biodiversity and habitat data and create summary maps. CNIAF, companies preparing
       forest management plans, and international conservation organizations, all have compiled spatial
       data on habitats, wildlife, and legal and illegal use of natural resources. These spatial data can be
       consolidated to support analytical tools that can help to determine conservation priorities and
       delineate possible macro-zones for ecosystem services management and biodiversity offsets.


                                                   50
-   Over the long-term, formalize regular land cover and use mapping. The intent of the IFN project
    has been to establish a baseline of forest data and prepare maps supporting the PNAT. Over the
    long-term, a process needs to be in place for a country-wide land cover and use map that supports
    land use planning. Regular updates and long-term budget support for this map are needed
    (perhaps as part of building a National Geomatics Centre).

-   Prepare analytical studies on forest potential and spatial priorities of forest use. Analytical maps
    suggested in Figure 22 will be needed to support prospective zoning and classifications of the
    forest estate. The study and associated maps can help to develop a national strategy for all forest
    lands, support decision-making to allocate logging concessions and other land uses within forest
    lands, and create new information that can support national biodiversity and conservation
    planning and determine tourism potential.

-   Prepare analytical study of biodiversity conservation and conservation priorities. This study would
    have a country-wide perspective and identify possible conservation corridors and important
    ecosystem services supply areas, all outside of the exiting protected area network. The study
    would provide the analytical foundation to delineate biodiversity offsets for mining and other land
    use changes causing habitat and biodiversity loss.

-   Strengthen (official) zoning and classification of the forest estate and create reference map.
    Agreed upon zoning and official classification of the forest estate create greater certainty for land
    managers within government (e.g., other sectors) and outside government (e.g., private
    companies interested in investing in new type of land uses in the forest-savannah transition zone;
    local communities seeking to establish community forests or other natural-resource-based
    enterprises).

    In other tropical forest countries, planners of different agencies are often facing the challenge of
    relying on multiple forest maps, resulting in misaligned maps of land use priorities and land use
    concessions. This is the reason why Indonesia’s president launched the “One Map” project, a
    comprehensive effort to establish a standardized base map, create new thematic maps, build a
    national geo-portal, and other efforts to strengthen its geo-spatial data infrastructure. Investing
    upfront in a reference map of the country’s forest estate and current forest extent can avoid the
    costly mistake of multiple maps.

    The spatial delineation of permanent forest and non-permanent forest estate and creating a
    reference map are a technical and political process. It will require stakeholder engagement.

-   Propose new macro-zoning for biodiversity conservation, ecosystem services management, and
    biodiversity offsets areas and create reference map. Such macro-zoning would provide greater
    certainty for managing biodiversity and ecosystem services in the country and create an
    opportunity to introduce new types of zoning in the PNAT and the SNAT, for example priority
    areas for sustainable natural resources management, potential future conservation areas, and
    potential future areas for biodiversity offsets. Developing a proposal for new macro-zoning and
    creating a reference map will require stakeholder validation.

3.3 Agriculture sector

This section discusses first how livelihoods and economic development in the agriculture sector are linked
to forests, REDD+, and land use planning. Next are an overview of the leading agriculture institutions with
planning and mapping experience, a summary of spatial planning efforts in the sector, and an assessment
of data and map availability to determine important planning and information needs. The agriculture
section concludes with suggestions to fill some of these needs.

3.3.1   Agriculture: the livelihoods, forests, REDD+, and land use planning linkages

Agriculture and forest landscapes in the Republic of Congo are strongly linked through complex dynamics
involving subsistence livelihoods, household energy needs, industrial agriculture, and development of
plantation and tree crops. Each of these activities has effects on livelihoods and the wider economy, as
well as effects on forest loss and degradation.

Agriculture and livelihoods
In the Republic of Congo, the agricultural sector employs about 40 percent of the population and
contributes 6.8 percent to GDP and 1-2 percent to exports (2012). The sector is based on smallholder
agriculture (80 percent of cultivated land and 90 percent of output), as large commercial farms previously
owned by the state have disappeared. However, smallholder productivity is low compared to
international and even Sub-Saharan African standards.

More than a quarter of the population lives in households with the head working in agriculture, which is
the dominant activity in most villages. In general, households practice extensive agriculture with little use
of purchased inputs and are oriented toward subsistence needs. Despite good agricultural potential with
an estimated 10 million hectares of arable land, less than 10 percent is farmed. The most common crops
are cassava and some maize, though households also rely on forest foods. In the two northern, most
forested, departments of the country, household cultivation areas are very limited (less than 0.5 hectare
per family), which limits earnings.

The agriculture sector is unable to cover the country’s food needs making it increasingly dependent on
imports. Numerous farmer associations exist but they are only weakly organized and do not provide
processing and marketing services. Agricultural productivity increases and improved rural living
conditions are needed. Currently, outmigration from rural areas to urban centers contributes to the
further decline of the sector and continued import dependence.

Before the 1980s, agricultural production was able to cover 75 percent of the population's food needs.
During the period of 1990-2010, the state disengaged from the production and marketing functions, the
work force declined because of rural-urban migration, and private sector investments were insufficient to
replace public investments in the sector. As a consequence, agricultural production declined dramatically.
The main challenges for the sector are:
    - weak asset base of farm households and rural producers and low degree of mechanization;
    - inadequate market infrastructure and services;
    - inadequate rural road infrastructure;
    - ineffective sector policies and insufficient resources allocation to the agricultural sector (the
        budget for agriculture is less than 1 percent of the total government budget);
    - very weak supporting institutions for agriculture (research and extension); and
    - weak implementation capacity of public institutions.


                                                     52
The Republic of Congo is working with the World Bank and other partners on projects to improve the
livelihoods of communities and provide alternative sources of income through investing in tree crops,
promoting outgrower schemes, and introducing conservation agriculture (cassava, maize) to increase
agricultural productivity and crop diversification in degraded areas.

Agriculture, forests, REDD+, and land use planning
The Republic of Congo’s National Development Plan (PND) includes ambitious targets for promoting
agricultural commodities and plantation crops – coffee, cocoa, rubber and palm oil – that will need space
to expand. At the same time, the Government is using the REDD+ process to assist in identifying the right
trade-offs between development and forest conservation.

The REDD+ process is seen as a means to foster cross sectoral discussions toward more balanced land use
planning. The REDD+ process aims to address forest loss or degradation by:
    - engaging forest concessionaires in reduced impact logging and forest protection (set aside areas);
    - avoiding the conversion of forests with high conservation value in oil palm plantations (through
        contractual agreements and by promoting certification under the Roundtable for Sustainable
        Palm Oil standard); and
    - encouraging mining concessions to practice reduced impact planning of mine sites and supporting
        infrastructure.

The Government has initiated efforts to manage land resources more efficiently and reduce negative
impacts from unplanned agricultural intensification and expansion. These include:
   - Capacity building and value chain development for agroforestry products through public-private
       partnership agreements, for example to promote a more sustainable cocoa sector;
   - Discussions on a commitment to orient the industrial oil palm sector towards savannah areas;
   - Discussions on promoting land use planning at local and national levels within the context of
       implementing the REDD+ process and the new orientation law on land use planning.

Moreover, the agriculture sector has developed a long-term plan, the Plan de Développement du Secteur
Agricole (PDSA), which has proposed macro-zones for future expansion areas applying criteria to avoid
forest loss. The PDSA also envisioned a refinement of its spatial plan and develop micro-zoning of
expansion areas by 2025 that could be used for land allocations. This zoning can be aligned with
implementing the new orientation law for land use planning.

Industrial agriculture expansion and small-scale agriculture intensification can still be planned in a
sustainable way taking multiple sectors into account. If spatial planning for the agriculture sector is
further strengthened and becomes well embedded in multi-sectoral land use planning, and the plans are
implemented, they can avoid or reduce the pressures on forest resources.

3.3.2 Institutional setup for spatial planning in the agriculture sector

In the agriculture sector, the technical and analytical capacity to support land use planning resides in the
technical directorates of the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock. The Ministry also has a planning unit
that deals with budget planning and statistical services, the Directions des Etudes et de la Planification –
DEP.




                                                    53
The technical directorates in the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock have received training on database
management under the PDSA project. Its completion report indicates two new computerized databases
within these directorates. At the writing of this report, no detailed information was available on the
current status of these databases and how they could contribute best to spatial planning.

In regards to mapping and spatial analysis, the collected information for this report is patchy. For the
2012 PDSA, the Ministry of Agriculture and Livestock subcontracted the spatial database development
and map preparation. A 2014 spatial data inventory prepared in support of Congo’s process to establish
a National Geomatics Center (Centre National Géomatique) and a National Cadaster (E.O International,
2014) mentioned that the Ministry used base maps from the Centre de la Recherche Géographique et de
la Production Cartographique (CERGEC). The inventory also highlighted the work of the Centre National
des Etudes des Sols (CNES), which is associated with the Ministry. CNES had a 15-person team (mostly soil
specialists) and has produced maps of bio-climates and of soil provinces (cartes des bioclimats et des
provinces pédologiques). It was unclear what technologies were used for cartographic production (E.O
International, 2014).

Based on this partial information, it appears that cartographic and GIS skills in the agriculture sector are
more limited than in the forest sector. It is most likely that the agriculture sector would also benefit from
greater experience related to applying analytical tools to determine priorities for the agriculture sector
and apply these skills in multi-sectoral land use planning.

3.3.3 Existence and scope of current spatial plans in the agriculture sector

This review of spatial planning efforts in the agriculture sector is asking the same questions as for the
forest sector:
    - Is there long-term (more than ten years) sectoral planning at national level that provides a vision
        for the sector? If yes, to what degree does that planning process establish spatial priorities (e.g.,
        macro-zones on maps, quantitative area targets)?
    - Is there similar long-term sectoral planning at subnational level and to what degree does that
        planning process establish spatial priorities?
    - Does the National Development Plan 2012-2016 (PND 2012-2016), a macro-economic, medium
        term plan, have any spatial prioritization for the forest sector and how is this linked to long-term
        spatial plans?

Existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization: Plan de Développement du Secteur Agricole (PDSA)
The agricultural sector has published a long-term plan with spatial prioritization at national and sub-
national level. The Plan de Développement du Secteur Agricole (PDSA) was completed in 2012 under the
leadership of the Ministry of Agriculture and has a 2012-2035-time horizon. The project cost US$ 1.2
million and had a duration of 45 months.

For each of Congo’s twelve departments, the PDSA delineated large blocks of land that could be assigned
for future agricultural production. The maps show five different types of macro-zones including
agriculture, livestock, reforestation, agriculture/livestock, and agriculture/reforestation. In addition, the
PDSA delineates the potential expansion of village lands for subsistence agriculture and other local land
use. The plan assumes a 5-kilometer buffer surrounding each village (about 8,000 hectares per village).
All the PDSA maps were presented in stakeholder consultation workshops at national and department
level. Figure 23 summarizes the current status of existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization in the
agriculture sector.

National Development Plan 2012-2016 and spatial prioritization for agriculture
Interviews with agriculture sector experts pointed toward the National Development Plan (PND) as the
most referred to medium-term planning document. The PND is a multi-sector, economic development
plan. The agriculture, forest, and mining sectors are important priorities for economic diversification, as
are the tourism, hydro-carbon, and construction sectors. The PND’s most recent version covered 2012-
2016, and the process to develop the next five-year plan is just being launched.

The PND chapter on agriculture refers to more than 10 million hectares of potential arable land (of which
90 percent are available for farming). An important objective of the PND’s agriculture strategy is
regulating the access and development of land by developing a soil map, adopting an agricultural land
policy, and strengthening cadaster activities in rural areas. The chapter also provides information on the
extent and the general location of three large agro-industrial projects (470,000 hectares for palm oil,
80,000 ha for livestock/cash/fruit crops; 19,500 hectares for cassava and maize). For other PND priorities
such as local agriculture production, food production, and agro-pastoral production, no information is
provided on their extent and location.

In principle, the PND should be congruent with long-term spatial development plans in the agriculture
sector and the country’s multi-sectoral spatial development framework such as the SNAT. However, as
Figure 24 indicates, such linkages between plans were not expressed directly in the PND 2012-2016. It
does not reference the SNAT 2005 on spatial priorities related specifically to agriculture (although the
PND mentions four important special economic zones – Oyo-Ollombo, Ouesso, Pointe-Noire, and
Brazzaville – which overlap with some macro-zones in the SNAT 2005). Likewise, the PND only has a very
indirect link to the agriculture sector’s long-term plan, the PDSA.

3.3.4 Data and analysis used in support of spatial planning in the agriculture sector

Up-to-date maps and associated spatial data are essential for good land use planning. To determine the
need for such data, existing planning efforts were analyzed and experts at government agencies were
interviewed. For the sectoral analysis, the approach to collect information has been organized in the
following categories:
     - Baseline layers available and used;
     - Documented maps and data layers used in sector-specific planning documents or land allocation
        decisions;
     - Ongoing efforts to build new spatial data sets, for example supported by international
        development cooperation projects or national budget allocation.\;
     - New data layers and maps needed as prioritized in selected strategies (e.g., PND), suggested in
        interviews with key experts in the ministry, or based on a gap analysis comparing the Republic of
        Congo’s available data with a list of spatial data used in land use planning in other countries.

Baseline layers used in sectoral planning and land allocation efforts for the agriculture sector
The PDSA relied on baseline data (e.g., forest extent, settlements, and transport infrastructure) from the
Congo Forest Atlas (see detailed list in Table 1, section 3.1.3). During the preparation of this report, no
information was readily available on which maps and baselines layers have been used for the most recent
allocations of agricultural land.

Data used in spatial planning for the agriculture sector
The PDSA delineated five different types of macro-zones for each department, and boundary files for the
following macro-zones are available: agriculture, livestock, reforestation, agriculture / livestock, and
agriculture / reforestation. The maps also include potential expansion of village lands for subsistence
agriculture, a 5-kilometer buffer surrounding each village in the country.

In addition, the PDSA estimated the total length of constructing new agriculture roads and rehabilitating
existing rural roads for each department. The published maps and planning documents did not indicate
the specific location of these roads.

The PDSA also projected demand for 15 food commodities (crops, fish, and livestock) from 2010 to 2035
making certain assumptions on per capita demand and the level of expected imports and domestic
production. The projections for most commodities were in quantities (except for sugar cane, oil palm,
and maize, which provided both area and quantities). The PDSA document did not indicate whether it
crosschecked the land requirements for these projections with the land assigned for agriculture
production in the macro-zoning maps.

Ongoing national efforts to build spatial data sets for the agriculture sector
Readily available information about efforts to update and expand agricultural data was sparse during
preparation of this report. FAO, through its 2013-2016 Country Programming Framework, has provided
US$ 7.7 million to update the country’s national agricultural, livestock and fisheries statistics (FAO, 2015),
because no general agricultural and livestock census had been carried out for nearly three decades.
Additional inquiries are needed to determine the progress made on new soil information and a rural
cadaster, as suggested by the PND and PDSA, and on micro-zoning maps for agricultural expansion areas,
as envisioned under the PDSA.




                                                     56
Additional map data needed to strengthen spatial planning in the agriculture sector
As in the forest section, a checklist of information products and specific map examples can help identify
data and map needs to strengthen spatial planning. Figure 25 groups the previous review of spatial data
and maps into three classes: available, possibly available, and not available. Unavailable data and maps
represent an important information gap in the agriculture sector, which a roadmap to strengthen land
use planning can fill.

Figure 25 shows the following pattern on data and map availability and on information needs:

    -   Existing and ongoing mapping efforts can fill some gaps on agricultural land use information. The
        land use mapping for forest concessions in southern Congo (see section 3.24, PAGEF) and for
        forest concessions with completed management plans in the rest of the country hold useful
        information on local land use. Likewise, spatial extrapolation from the multi-resources inventory
        of the IFN is a possible source of agriculture land use information.

    -   Up-to-date, detailed soil maps for micro-zoning are unavailable, and cadaster activities in rural
        areas would increase precision of planning, especially at local level. The SNAT 2005 relied on a
        1981 soil map, and other analytical studies have used various soil maps from the 1970s and 1980s
        (ORSTOM) at 1:500,000 and 1:200,000 scale. An updated soil map can help delineate high
        potential areas for agricultural production and identify soil constraints that need to be overcome
        to boost yields. Both the PDSA and the PND 2012-2016 refer to a needed soil map.

        The PND 2012-2016 highlighted investing in cadaster activities in rural areas as a priority. Building
        a cadaster will call for considerable resources and time, because of two challenges: improving the
        geodetic control network and topographic base maps, so that they conform with international
        standards and GPS use, requires substantial investments over the short and medium-term
        (Ortega, 2014); and communal and individual land rights need to be documented and land tenure
        laws strengthened.

    -   There is a gap of analytical maps to determine agricultural potential of a geographic area. The
        checklist proposes maps of agricultural potential for selected crops (which would include land
        unsuitable for agricultural development). Such maps can combine a soil map with other
        biophysical data (e.g., rainfall, elevation, slope, soil drainage) and economic data (e.g., distance
        to markets and demand centers, transport costs).

        Maps of agricultural potential can cover a group of agricultural commodities or select high-value
        crops such as oil palm. For the latter, the analysis can be further advanced by combining
        biophysical suitability maps with maps of environmental and social criteria (for example those put
        forward by the Roundtable on Sustainable Palm Oil). Such an approach will reduce the total
        suitable area from the theoretically possible growing area, which is most of the country. CIRAD
        (2015) has demonstrated an approach that outlined areas that would avoid environmental harm
        (e.g., steep slopes, riparian areas, swamp forests), as well as areas that would match certain
        economic criteria, such as areas suitable for industrial production and for small-scale farm
        enterprises.

    -   Maps that guide agriculture use and allocation of land for sustainable industrial agriculture are
        not available. The maps from a technical study identifying suitable areas for more sustainable
        palm oil production (CIRAD, 2015) have been presented but have not been translated into
        country-wide maps and designated zoning. A reference map for major types of agriculture use
        (e.g., intensive cropping, subsistence farming, mixed production systems such as agroforestry and
        silvipastoral production) is unavailable. Such a map could guide the implementation of the agro-
        land regime law (law no 25-2008). New macro-zoning in a revised SNAT that intends to move
        beyond the crop and livestock production classes of the SNAT 2005 will require new information
        to define future agricultural expansion areas.

3.3.5 Suggestions for strengthening spatial planning in the agriculture sector

The following suggestions can strengthen spatial planning in the agriculture sector and contribute to
stronger multi-sectoral land use planning:

    -   Consolidate existing land use data. Existing data on agricultural land use and community lands
        (e.g., from the IFN, land use zoning in forest concessions) can be compiled and combined with
        other remote sensing information to create new baseline information of agricultural land use and
        community lands.

    -   Explore options to delineate community lands. Community lands for agriculture, forestry, and
        other natural resource use are essential for local livelihoods and a foundation for economic
        development. The importance of such lands in the country’s economic and spatial development
        strategy can be acknowledged in the macro-zoning of a PNAT and the SNAT. This will require an
        analytical study, maps, and engagement process to define community lands. The study could
        focus on crop, livestock, and agroforestry-related uses or it could be wider in scope and include
        community lands for indigenous peoples in forest and savannah ecosystems.

    -   Fill important soil information gaps. Future micro-zoning for agricultural land and agricultural
        support to strengthen soil and nutrient management requires updated soil information. (At the
        writing of this document, the information about ongoing spatial data investments in the
        agriculture sector was incomplete–it could be possible that such an update is already underway.)
        Two different products are conceivable:
        - One map, at coarser resolution and requiring less time to prepare, could link with Africa-wide
              efforts to update soil maps using a combination of remote sensing imagery and sampling sites.
              Such a map can improve country-wide agricultural priority setting and zoning.
        - A second, more detailed soil map would support micro-zoning and planning at more local
              scales, but require more time to prepare.

    -   Prepare analytical studies on agriculture potential. A soil map can be combined with other data
        layers to produce a more detailed map of agricultural potential, which could focus on specific
        crops or production systems. This information can then be applied for new macro-zoning in the
        PNAT and the SNAT, for example to delineate future agricultural expansion areas.

    -   Consolidate existing information to delineate the most suitable areas for sustainable palm oil
        production and prepare an investment guide. The palm oil suitability map would build on existing
        studies such as CIRAD’s and can incorporate lessons learned from other countries (e.g., mapping
        efforts to grow oil palm on degraded lands in Indonesia, maps of potential palm oil areas for


                                                    59
    Gabon’s Plan d’Affectation des Terres). The investment guide for palm oil production would
    include maps with zones highlighting the suitability of land for sustainable oil palm production,
    both for large-scale industrial and small-scale farm enterprises.

-   Create reference maps to prioritize agriculture use and guide allocation of land for sustainable
    industrial agriculture. Having reference maps that identify the most promising areas for certain
    agricultural production systems or guide investments towards lands with fewer negative
    environmental impacts would facilitate spatial planning across sectors and help to lower
    transaction costs to allocate land. The following types of zoning maps can help to create greater
    certainty about the status of the land and the associated rules of use:

        -   Clearly defined forest and agricultural production zones. To implement the PDSA, the
            plan envisions more harmonized forest and agriculture plans, especially in savannah
            systems, which are suitable for both agricultural purposes and forest restoration efforts.
            New maps and data layers will need to be created so that zoning for agricultural and forest
            purposes is clearly delineated and available for land-use allocations, both for industrial
            agriculture concessions and for village land use. The PDSA envisioned completion of
            agricultural macro-zoning by 2015 and of micro-zoning by 2025.

        -   National maps delineating major land use and agriculture use zones. Such maps can help
            to implement key legislation related to land use planning. For example, Law no 25-2008
            (agro-land regime) classifies agricultural land into three categories: 1st category land
            (subsistence farming; fallow land, grazing land and paths); 2nd category land (intended for
            intensive farming of food crops, farming, or livestock cooperatives; land for commercial
            or industrial use of perennial crop plantations); 3rd category land (land reserved
            specifically for forestry or mining). Similarly, Law no 10-2004 (outlining general principles
            to be applied to the state and land regimes) indicates that land use planning must take
            into account allocation of land into four main areas: urban areas (allocated for housing,
            commercial and industrial activities; peri-urban areas (allocated for various crops) and
            rural areas (with three categories agriculture, forests/forestry, or mining).

3.4 Mining sector

This section provides first an overview of the relationship between, mining, land use changes, and spatial
planning. This is followed by a summary of the key mining institutions with planning and mapping
experience, a summary of spatial planning efforts in the sector, and an assessment of data and map
availability to determine important planning and information needs. Suggestions to fill some of these
needs conclude this mining section.

3.4.1      Mining, land use change, and implications for spatial planning

Mining operations can have a range of effects on forests and other ecosystems, including direct, indirect,
induced, and cumulative impacts (see Box 5). These effects occur at each stage of the operations:
exploration, exploitation, and closure. Even where a mine site is relatively compact, associated
infrastructure developments – roads, railways, and dams for hydroelectric power – represent the greater
threat, through physical incursion into forests and disruption of ecosystems. In particular, roads can open
access to formerly remote forest areas, allowing further incursion for agriculture, hunting, artisanal and
small-scale mining and other activities that contribute to forest loss and degradation. Large-scale mines,
in particular of bulk-minerals like iron ore, also have considerable energy and water requirements, which
may result in the construction of dams, pipelines, and power lines. Reclamation after mine closure is an
opportunity to re-establish productive forests on otherwise unused and non-productive mined lands, to
generate economic value for landowners and communities, and to enhance environmental quality by
accelerating restoration of ecosystem services. During operations, mining companies can positively
impact forest by protecting certain areas as biodiversity offsets. Biodiversity offsets are “measurable
conservation outcomes of actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity
impacts arising from project development after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have
been taken. The goal of biodiversity offsets is: “to achieve no net loss and preferably a net gain of
biodiversity on the ground with respect to species composition, habitat structure, ecosystem function and
people’s use and cultural values associated with biodiversity"6. Several mining companies active in the
ROC have developed potential offsets projects; planning to protect significant forested areas.

The environmental, social, and economic impacts of mining are typically assessed in impact assessments
for new proposed mining projects. But existing and future mining projects and their potential offsets can
also be included in regular land use planning processes (euromines, 2011). In fact, effective land use
planning can create greater certainty for new mining investments and speed up environmental impact
assessments, if existing land use plans have already identified potential opportunities and threats
associated with specific types of mineral extractions. For example, an assessment of evidence and lessons
learned from Latin America found that Colombia with established land use planning systems witnessed
greater growth in foreign direct investments and speedier impact assessments for extractive industries
than other Latin American countries (GRADE and Practical Action Consulting, no year).

To include existing mining activities in a land use planning process is relatively straightforward and part of
identifying all current land users and involving mining interests in a comprehensive stakeholder
engagement process. However, this becomes more challenging when, as is the case in the ROC, limited
exploration has taken place, and the precise location or even existence of valuable minerals is unknown
and their value has not been determined yet. The latter information is especially important because it

                                                         61
determines the break-even point and economic viability of a new mining project and allows to compare
expected revenues from new mines with other land use options.

A map showing areas where certain minerals are present in sufficient quantities to show potential for
exploration and possible mineral extraction in the future is an important piece of information to anticipate
future land demand and associated transport and energy infrastructure needs. Creating such a map
requires considerable investments and expertise in geological data collection, modelling, and map
production. Generating and accessing such minerals information is often further complicated by the
proprietary nature of minerals data. Including future mining projects into land use planning therefore
requires strengthening the national geological service, building a minerals information system, and
providing access to minerals data and summary maps to land use planners. And even then, one needs to
remember that the presence of prospective geo-data does not necessarily mean that there will be mines
opening in an area. It only means that there is a large potential for exploration activities, of which only
very few will result in actual mines.

Geological data indicating the presence of mineral resources and actual mining operations can be included
in land use plans at two scales:

    -   Local land use planning. This planning mostly focuses on direct mining impacts and covers site
        planning with the help of detailed topographic maps and land use information. Such planning
        looks carefully at air, water and noise pollution, visual amenities, biodiversity conservation,
        settlements, areas of important cultural value, and other environmental and social impacts. The
        plans generally determine the best siting for required mine buildings, processing facilities, waste
        storage, management of overburden and mine tailings, water and energy supply facilities, and
        transport infrastructure.

    -   Landscape and regional-scale land use planning. Planning at this scale can try to capture indirect
        impacts related to infrastructure development (e.g., roads, railways, ports, dams), induced
        impacts (e.g., demographic shifts, agriculture expansion, bushmeat hunting, logging), and
        cumulative impacts. It can also consider possible offset sites. An integrated landscape-level
        planning approach is needed to consider the region-wide and long-term consequences of mining
        development on people, forests, and other ecosystems.

        Such regional-scale plans can take different forms. For example, it could be in the form of a
        strategic environmental assessment, as was done for a uranium mining region in Namibia
        (Ministry of Mines and Energy, Geological Survey of Namibia, 2011). Or it could be a strategic
        regional land use plan (see Box 4), as was done for the Upper Hunter region in the state of New
        South Wales in Australia, a region with competing land uses for coal mining, coal seam gas
        extraction, agricultural production, forest lands, and national parks (State of New South Wales,
        2012).

Since the expansion of the mining industry and value-added processing is an essential pillar in the Republic
of Congo’s vision of the future, it makes sense to create a supportive policy framework for long-term
sustainability. This framework would encourage transparent and evidence-based planning and decision
making in the mining sector, make sustainable mining and associated good industry practices a top
priority, and link to the country’s effort to advance multi-sectoral land use planning.




                                                    62
Box 4 The strategic regional land use plan in New South Wales
The strategic regional land use plan in New South Wales aimed a continuation of the mining industry and sought to safeguard
important areas for agriculture production and other land uses. The plan invested in compiling spatial data and maps to carry
out a strategic biodiversity assessment, identify strategically important agricultural land (e.g., critical agriculture industry clusters,
land with unique natural characteristics relevant for long-term sustainability of agriculture), and determine important landforms
representing Aboriginal heritage conservation areas. To prepare the land use plan and a subsequent action plan for
implementation, a cumulative impact methodology for mining and coal seam gas applications was developed (Franks et al. 2010).
Likewise, the plan looked at the regional and cumulative impacts of future mining projects on infrastructure and sought to protect
biodiversity with a regional perspective (which included developing a national database to delineate areas suitable for biodiversity
offsets). The plan also set up a panel of independent experts and a rigorous assessment process for future mining projects
requiring cost-benefit analysis and other assessment tools.


For the latter point, this will require a more comprehensive inclusion of possible future mining projects
and associated infrastructure and offsets sites in the PNAT and the SNAT. Such an approach would
greatly increase transparency about future mining areas, let local stakeholders articulate their interests,
and help to delineate nationally important areas for biodiversity and other land uses (which would
represent either no-go areas for mining or for which specific extraction and processing approaches would
be required).

3.4.2 Institutional setup for spatial planning in the mining sector

In the mining sector, different directorates in the Ministry of Mines and Geology (Ministère des Mines et
de la Géologie - MMG) and the Geological and Mining Research Center (Centre de Recherches Géologiques
et Minières - CRGM) can play a role as institutional focal points to support spatial planning in the mining
sector and land use planning more broadly.

The Directorate for Studies and Planning (Direction des Etudes et de la Planification - DEP), is responsible
for developing strategies, conducting economic and financial studies for mining projects, and compiling
and analyzing statistics for the sector. The DEP includes three services (Service des Etudes, Service
Statistique, Service de la Planification) that cover studies, statistical services, and planning, respectively
(Cole Baker Associates, 2013). An assessment of training needs (Cole Baker Associates, 2013) did not
identify any mapping and land use planning expertise within DEP. The assessment recommended filling
staffing gaps (e.g., engineers, economists, lawyers) to enhance project evaluation and management
capacity. It also encouraged participation in workshops on legislation, taxes, mining economics, mine
planning, environmental and social impacts, and artisanal mining.

The General Directorate of Geology (Direction Générale de la Géologie - DGG) includes four directorates
with broad mandates including geological research, mapping and prospecting, and exploration of geo-
materials. A number of these responsibilities have been transferred to the CRGM (Cole Baker Associates,
2013).

The Directorate for Geological Research (Direction de la Recherche Géologique - DRG) under the DGG,
takes care of mining permits. The DRG verifies the boundaries of mining concessions and manages mining
concession information. A 2014 diagnostic of mining concession permits found a functioning system in
place relying on basic mapping software (MapInfo). The system could not provide important contextual
information to visualize the polygon boundaries of the permit area such as current satellite imagery of
land cover or maps showing land use zones. The diagnostic recommended to strengthen DRG’s capacity
including a stronger GIS platform (e.g., ArcGIS), provision of contextual map information in the concession
GIS, and regular Internet access (Ortega, 2014). The diagnostic also identified fundamental challenges


                                                                   63
with the availability of topographic maps and the geodetic network making the use of GPS and existing
topographic maps impractical–the difference in accuracy between these two sources can be hundreds of
meters, which is too imprecise for a mining cadaster (but probably ok for regional land use planning).

A 2013 assessment of training needs for DRG (before some of MMG’s functions on exploration services,
mapping, and laboratory service were transferred to CRGM) mentioned the availability of two large
plotters to print maps. The assessment highlighted training needs in ArcGIS and MapInfo (Cole Baker
Associates, 2013).

The CGRM is an independent technical center (but associated with the MMG) to advance geological and
mining research and information. It was legally established in 2012 to increase the country’s competence
on geological mapping and mineral prospecting with specific focus on geological studies, mine engineering
information, environmental and natural hazards assessments, and other scientific and technical
Information related to mining. In 2014, the CRGM begun to work on inventorying and digitizing existing
map holdings in support of updating the country’s mineral and geologic maps. No detailed assessment of
CGRM’s mapping and planning capacity has been prepared as part of this report.

Box 5 Direct, indirect, induced, and cumulative impacts of mining

Mining operations can have a range of effects on forests and other ecosystems, including direct, indirect, induced and cumulative
impacts. These effects occur at each stage of the operations: exploration, exploitation, and closure.

Direct impacts at different stages of large-scale mining operations
Three major phases can be distinguished in the lifetime of a mining
project: (i) New Project Development, (ii) Operations and (iii) Closure.
Adverse impacts on the environment can occur at any of these phases.
While much of the attention has thus far been given to the second phase
“Operations”, it is clear that activities under the phase (i) and lack of
actions under the phase (iii) can also be very detrimental to the
environmental equilibrium and the forest ecosystems.

Exploration activities: Exploration, a high-risk, high-reward activity, has
the goal of discovery of economically viable mineral deposits; i.e. those
that can be mined at a profit. It takes time and great effort, often in remote
areas (to humans) and is seldom successful. The chances of bringing a raw
prospect into production have been estimated at 1 in 5,000-10,000
(Mining Journal, 2012). Furthermore, following a promising discovery it
can take up to 10 years to get to the production stage of starting a new
mine.

Exploration, or the search for viable ore bodies, can be broken down into greenfields and brownfields exploration. Greenfields,
as its name implies looks to find ore bodies in new areas, or areas that have historically shown good results. Brownfields on the
other hand typically refers to exploration activities on the existing ore body or mine complex or relatively close to it such that it
would be mined as part of the established infrastructure of the mine. The explorations process can broadly be broken down into
the following stages with the social and environmental impacts generally becoming more notable as the project continues to
progress:
-     Exploration initially involves aerial surveys and the use of satellite imagery and remote sensing to determine the potential
      for mineral deposits. If these initial activities prove promising, on-the-ground surveying and core testing are conducted to
      determine the presence and economic viability of the deposit. Although early exploration is relatively benign with respect
      to environmental impacts, later stages in the exploration process can cause significant disruption to terrestrial and aquatic
      ecosystems if exploration activities are executed without proper environmental safeguards.
-     The late exploration phase may include the use of drill rigs and construction of underground tunnels for detailed drilling and
      mapping. This stage can notably cause habitat fragmentation resulting from land clearing for roads, trenches, and other
      access routes used to transport heavy machinery. These access routes often serve as conduits for human immigration and
      new settlement and can lead to very significant disruption affecting large areas: agriculture, hunting/poaching over large
      distances and can have a permanent character (new settlements in previously uninhabited forest that become permanent).

Mine site construction: Construction typically includes the following activities (Government of Canada, 2006): site preparation;
clearing and initial preparation for mining (i.e., overburden removal); construction of accommodations; construction of process
and site facilities (i.e., mills, offices); and building roads and airstrips (installation of power lines and railway).

Ore extraction: At the site itself, the degree of disturbance is a function of both the ore grade, and the type of mine operation
(e.g. strip mine vs. underground). Typically, open-pit and strip mining operations create the greatest level of land disturbance,
especially in areas where the ores are deposited slightly deeper. Accordingly, from an intensity basis, diamonds and gold have
overburden and waste rock values that are orders of magnitude larger than other commodities, while base metals (copper, zinc,
lead, nickel) and aluminum account for the largest footprint on an absolute basis.

Mine site construction and ore extraction requires vegetation and topsoil removal. Land-clearing for site construction and
mineral excavation carries with it the potential for significant soil erosion and sedimentation. If topsoil is not set aside and
conserved for the reclamation phase, restoration of the forest ecosystem will be difficult, if not impossible to achieve. In addition,
soils that are not conserved can be washed away into nearby rivers and streams, causing sedimentation that may destroy aquatic
habitat and result in a decline in fish species.

[Box 5 continued from previous page]

Primary processing: Primary processing generally occurs at the mine site and consists of chemical, electric, or physical methods
to separate the mineral from the ore body. The main concern at this stage is chemical and waste management. Small-scale
operations often discharge processing waste directly onto the ground or in waterways. Large-scale operations process high
volumes of ore in a processing facility that may use significant quantities of water and energy. Effluents are typically discharged
into artificially created holding ponds (known as tailings impoundments). The effluent may contain trace amounts of mercury,
cyanide, the target mineral, and other processing reagents. Disruptions in water cycles and water quality can lead to forest
degradation with changes in species composition and structure and loss of biodiversity.

Closure and rehabilitation: Mine closure and site rehabilitation takes places when all economically viable minerals have been
extracted. In theory, planning for closure and rehabilitation needs to happen before or during the exploration phase. But this is
not always the case. Closure and site rehabilitation typically involve capping waste rock dumps to prevent acid mine drainage
and other toxic effluents, replacing topsoil, recontouring the landscape, and revegetation or reforestation. The site should be
returned to a state that is deemed useful for the region’s population, if not equivalent to the original landscape.

In less responsibly mined sites, closure and site rehabilitation may be given short-shrift and, if funds are not available, little to no
rehabilitation may be conducted. Funding for closure and rehabilitation is a key requirement, and not all companies set aside
sufficient funds for this stage of the process. Because the mine is no longer economically profitable and the closure process can
be costly, smaller companies and individual miners have less incentive to properly close the site and return it to valuable use for
local communities. The lack of capacity of governments of the Congo basin to manage post mining site rehabilitation will further
aggravate this situation.

In general, the most serious, direct environmental impacts resulting from large-scale mining are associated with decreased water
quality and potential loss of aquatic habitat and species. While loss of terrestrial habitat and species can be severe per unit area—
especially resulting from associated human activities, such as logging and hunting—mining typically contributes very little directly
to deforestation or forest degradation compared to other, more land-use intense activities, such as agriculture.

Poorly-run mines are likely to have a greater direct impact on forests than those that are operated according to international best
practices. This is one of the reasons why the impacts of, mainly non-regulated, artisanal mining can be so devastating. Best
practice environmental management that is implemented according to the mitigation hierarchy (avoid-minimize-mitigate-
compensate) requires companies to have set aside sufficient capital, a challenge for many of the junior companies.

Indirect impacts of mining related to associated infrastructure development
One of the biggest challenges for the development of the mineral extraction in most forest-dense developing countries is the lack
or poor quality of infrastructure. Early mining development in a region typically requires large physical infrastructure
investments. There will be a need to improve or develop roads or railroads in order to transport the minerals to the port or
neighboring countries. This increases the overall costs of production. With the improvement or introduction of new
infrastructure, a percentage of the mineral endowment economically translates into commercially viable mines. In short: the
availability, or potential to develop, infrastructure is a deciding factor for the development of a mine.

Infrastructure developments represent also the most important threat to ecosystems; through physical incursion into forests and
disruption of the ecosystems. Road and railway development could be particularly harmful. Building a new road drives direct
deforestation through tree cutting but this impact is generally limited. Most importantly, roads are the major vehicle for forest
degradation through further incursion into forest areas for agriculture, hunting, artisanal mining and other potentially harmful
activities. Road building can also affect local wildlife populations through habitat fragmentation. Roads can become a barrier
that some species are unable to cross, effectively reducing their available habitat. This barrier effect will become much more
severe when settlement occurs along these new roads and the forest effectively becomes fragmented.

Dams – hydropower plants. A large-scale mine has considerable energy requirements, especially during the processing phase.
Energy requirements are typically highest for bauxite and aluminum production, iron ore, copper, diamonds, and gold. In the
Congo Basin, these energy requirements will most likely be met via hydropower. Indeed, large-scale mining will not be possible
without significantly increasing the regional power grid.

Construction of new dams or increasing the capacity of existing ones will have a significant impact on aquatic species and, to a
lesser degree, on forests, depending upon the size of the reservoir built. Construction of power lines could also result in
fragmentation of forest habitat, especially if access roads accompany the construction of new power lines. On the other hand,
hydropower results in a lower greenhouse gas footprint than the usual energy sources (e.g., coal, natural gas). Potential dam

development around waterfalls and rapids in protected areas in Gabon and Congo Brazzaville have recently caused unrest with
conservationists.

Induced impacts
Mining operations are usually accompanied by a large influx of people looking for job opportunities. This induces additional
socio-economic activities, such as subsistence agriculture and poaching, with potentially significant harm to forests.

Agricultural expansion: An influx of workers to mining sites tends to directly increase pressures on natural forests through
clearing for agriculture uses (along with energy needs). In addition, new roads tend to drastically change the economic equation
in a specific area and can make unprofitable activities become profitable, through better access to markets as well as inputs (cf.
fertilizers).

Bushmeat hunting: Bushmeat hunting is a serious threat to wildlife and contributes to resource degradation in areas that have
been opened to extractive practices, oil and other mineral development, or logging. Roads associated with mining operations (as
well as logging operations) restrict wildlife movement and encourage the use of animals for consumption. Disruption in wildlife
can eventually lead to ecosystem disturbance. Road opening up remote areas makes commercial hunting (and fishing) in these
areas economically attractive and allows for the bushmeat to be transported to far away urban markets. Therefore, if mine
development leads to the opening of previously remote, difficult to access ecosystems, then very specific measures need to be
taken to avoid widespread degradation of these ecosystems.

Logging: To the extent that previously inaccessible high-value forests are opened up, poorly planned mining can induce illegal
logging. In this sense, roads (and potentially railway lines) are the primary driver linking mining and logging.

Cumulative impacts
Of greatest concern in most forest-rich countries is the lack of land-use planning and coordination in place to ensure sustainable
development in the region, especially with respect to the (often conflicting) allocation of logging and mining concessions, the
development of associated infrastructure, the potential for agricultural expansion, and the lack of control over the bushmeat
trade and human settlement. Numerous conflicts have been noted between and among conservation priorities, mining and
logging concessions, infrastructure development and livelihoods of the local populations.

These combined impacts of one or more activities on the environment, economy, and society are referred to as cumulative
impacts. These impacts may interact with each other, have positive and negative effects, and may vary across space and time.
Franks et al. (2020) highlight the following mining-specific aspects:
         “In the mining context, cumulative impacts can arise from compounding activities of a single operation or multiple mining
and processing operations, as well as the aggregation and interaction of mining impacts with other past, current and future
activities that may not be related to mining. The nature and scale of cumulative impacts can vary considerably depending on such
factors as the type of mining activity, the proximity of the mines to each other, the extent of other contributing activities, and the
characteristics of the surrounding natural, social, and economic environments. The compounding effects of multiple mine closures
(a kind of ‘reverse’ cumulative impact where impacts are generated by the cessation of activities) can be as challenging for regional
communities and economies.”


3.4.3 Existence and scope of current spatial plans in the mining sector

As for the forest and the agriculture sectors, this review of spatial planning efforts in the mining sector is
asking the following questions:
    - Is there long-term (more than ten years) sectoral planning at national level that provides a vision
         for the sector? If yes, to what degree does that planning process establish spatial priorities (e.g.,
         macro-zones on maps, quantitative area targets)?
    - Is there similar long-term sectoral planning at subnational level and to what degree does that
         planning process establish spatial priorities?
    - Does the National Development Plan 2012-2016 (PND 2012-2016), a macro-economic, medium
         term plan, have any spatial prioritization for the mining sector and how is this linked to long-term
         spatial plans?



                                                                 67
Existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization in the mining sector
At the completion of this draft report, there was no long-term strategy for the mining sector that reflected
important spatial planning aspects such as harmonized infrastructure development or regional planning
of biodiversity offsets.

Sub-national spatial planning in the mining sector is relying on companies, which are required to prepare
long-term mine management plans for all exploitation concessions. This includes delineating the location
of roads, excavation area, waste disposal and other land use zones within the concession area. At the
writing of this report, most mining permits in Congo were for prospecting and exploration. Only a few
mining sites are in or close to the exploitation stage. These sites close to exploitation have prepared
detailed plans (e.g., proposed Mbalam-Nabeba Iron Ore Project in Sangha department). Even these
projects are however currently frozen, due to the very low iron ore prices.

Figure 26 summarizes the current status of existing long-term plans with spatial prioritization.

National Development Plan 2012-2016 and spatial prioritization in the mining sector
The National Development Plan (PND) is the most referred to medium-term planning document, when
sector experts were queried about existing plans. The PND, a multi-sector, economic development plan,
covers 2012-2016. The process to develop the next five-year plan is just being launched.

The mining sector is highlighted as an important priority for economic diversification in the PND 2012-
2016. However, spatial prioritization that establishes quantitative area targets for and highlights the
location of new investments is very limited within the PND for all sectors. The PND 2012-2016’s discussion
on mining investments makes very generic references to mining—it mentions the names of large potential
mining areas or sites (see Figure 27).

In principle, the PND should be congruent with long-term spatial development plans in the mining sector
and the country’s multi-sectoral spatial development framework such as the SNAT. However, as Figure
27 indicates, such linkages between plans were not expressed in the PND 2012-2016. It does not
reference any spatial priorities identified in the SNAT 2005, which was difficult to make: the information
on mining in the SNAT was broad (it included a broad land use category called forest/mining zone) and
incomplete (the author did not have access to detailed mining maps and concession information).
Likewise, the PND could not refer to a long-term national spatial plan for the mining sector, because it has
not been prepared yet.

3.4.4 Data and analysis used in support of spatial planning in the mining sector

Up-to-date maps and associated spatial data are essential for good land use planning. To determine the
need for such data, existing planning efforts were analyzed and experts at government agencies were
interviewed. For the sectoral analysis, the approach to collect information has been organized in the
following categories:
     - Documented maps and data layers used in sector-specific planning documents or land allocation
        decisions.
     - Ongoing efforts to build new spatial data sets, for example supported by international
        development cooperation projects or national budget allocation.
     - New data layers and maps needed as prioritized in selected strategies (e.g., PND), suggested in
        interviews with key experts in the ministry, or based on a gap analysis comparing the Republic of
        Congo’s available data with a list of spatial data used in land use planning in other countries.

Baseline layers used in sectoral planning and land allocation efforts
During preparation of this report, no information was readily available on which maps and baselines layers
have been used for delineating mining concession areas. Although a 2014 diagnostic indicated limitations
in the contextual map information displayed in the database system used to manage concession
information (Ortega, 2014).

Sector-specific data used in spatial planning for the mining sector
The World Bank Mining Sector Review pointed out the limited knowledge about the country’s mineral
resources. The last national geologic map at 1:1,000,000 is from 1993, and a 1:500,000 version for the
southern part of the country was completed in 1969. The Review recommended to improve geological
cartography and invest in geo-scientific information management (see next section of ongoing work).

Technical work to develop a functioning mining cadaster has just started. There is no fully functioning GIS
database yet within the Ministry of Mines and Geology that combines mining permits with appropriate
baseline layers on geology and current land use (Ortega, 2014).

Mining companies with exploration permits are compiling new data and map layers as part of their
reporting to the Mining Research and Prospection Service of the Ministry of Mines and Geology. So far



                                                          69
the data and map layers with unconfidential geological and mining data have not been combined in a
national database and are not available for dissemination and land use planning purposes.

Ongoing national efforts to build spatial data sets for the mining sector
To close some of the data and mapping gaps in the mining sector, the Congo 2012 Budget Law earmarked
86 million CFCAs earmarked to carry out an airborne geophysics survey campaign, produce more detailed
geological maps, and strengthen geo-scientific information management. The airborne geophysics survey
was launched in August 2012 under the leadership of MAT-DGGT and in collaboration with MMG and
other agencies. A 2014 review on the status of geospatial data in the Republic of Congo mentioned that
new geologic maps were in the process of being created by ASPERBRAS in the north and by TOTAL in the
south of the country. TOTAL commissioned the study from the French Geological Survey ( BRGM), which
is expected to produce seven 1:200,000 geological maps and one 1:100,000 map over three years,
covering selected parts of the country.

Box 6 Coordinating mining conservation efforts in Liberia
Liberia emerged from the civil war in 2003 as one of the poorest countries in the world with unemployment estimated to be 86
percent. Although Liberia has made progress, access to basic services continues to be limited and almost two-thirds of Liberians
live below the poverty line. In addition to these challenging circumstances, the Liberian economy has been dealt a devastating
blow by the recent Ebola epidemic.

The Mining sector has the potential to become a significant engine for growth, reconstruction and broader-based development
in Liberia. Yet, in can also be a threat to the last extensive forest areas in West Africa. The Upper Guinean Forest that runs through
Liberia originally covered an estimated 1,265,000 square kilometers, but only one-tenth of the original vegetation remains.
Pervasive poverty and competition for commercial land contracts for palm oil, mining and forestry are a major threat. Protecting
the rich biodiversity that remains, while striking a balance between economic interests and respecting the legal and customary
rights of local people is a major challenge.

A World Bank Group study entitled “A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme: A Road Map for Liberia´s Mining Sector recommends
the application of a common methodology to be used by all mining companies to assure that the conservation offsets they are
implementing are mapped, planned and coordinated at the national level so their cumulative impact is greater and follows the
national interest, rather than being done disjointedly on an investment by investment basis.

Liberia is already legally requiring mining companies to implement biodiversity offsets to compensate for impacts arising from
project development. However, this approach could result in a number of small ad hoc offsets that do not necessarily respond
to the conservation priorities in Liberia and lack the necessary protection to ensure long term sustainability. In addition, the
capacity of mining companies to effectively implement offsets is often limited (Johnson, 2015).

Additional map data that would strengthen land use planning in the mining sector
As in the forest and agriculture sections, data and maps required to strengthen spatial planning can be
identified with the help of a checklist of information products and specific map examples within each
information product. Figure 28 groups spatial data and maps into three classes: available, possibly
available, and not available. Unavailable maps represent an important information gap in the mining
sector, which a roadmap to strengthen land use planning can fill.

The following major pattern on data and map availability and additional information needs emerges from
Figure 28:

     -    Mining concession data are the only spatial data available and much is expected from the new
          geologic maps. No detailed information was available yet on how many of the proposed maps in
          Figure 28 such as geo-hazards or environmental risks can be created from the MMG and CRGM
          mapping efforts.


                                                                 70

    -   No national map of conservation value of ecosystems and potential biodiversity offset areas for
        mining has been completed. Maps of biodiversity and conservation value of ecosystems could
        become the foundation for a national biodiversity offsets scheme for mining. Such a scheme
        based on solid data and zoning could make the Republic of Congo more interesting for mining
        companies that are committed to safeguard biodiversity in their operations.
    -   No national or regional study to explore available options to route infrastructure for mining has
        been completed.

3.4.5 Suggestions for strengthening spatial planning in the mining sector

The following suggestions are expected to strengthen spatial planning in the mining sector and contribute
to stronger multi-sectoral land use planning:

    -   Create consolidated mining concession database and associated GIS with contextual land use
        maps. An up-to-date, shareable database, ideally online, would greatly facilate planning in other
        sectors. MMG, CRGM, MAT-DGGT, and CNIAF can collaborate on a fully functioning land use GIS
        that combines mining permits with appropriate baseline layers on geology and current land use
        information from the multi-resource inventory (IFN). The GIS can also include other data and map
        compilations envisioned from the roadmap (e.g., infrastructure, biodiversity).

    -   Consolidate public use data from exploration concessions and makes them available for land use
        planning. Mining companies with exploration permits are compiling new data and map layers as
        part of their reporting to the Mining Research and Prospection Service of the Ministry of Mines
        and Geology. So far the data and map layers with unconfidential geological and mining data have
        not been combined in a national database and are not available for dissemination.

    -   Create online platform for geologic maps being updated and mining concession maps. The new ,
        regional geologic maps being created by ASPERBRAS and TOTAL (French Geological Survey -
        BRGM) combined with concession boundaries can fill important data gaps and provide a reference
        for spatial planning.

    -   Evaluate the final spatial data sets from the geological mapping effort and create relevant maps
        for land use planning. Selected geological map layers could be relevant for environmental
        planning, hazard risk mapping, and land use planning. In other countries, for example, national
        geological survey institutes have prepared important information products from geological
        surveys. These derived map products play an important role in land use planning at various scales.
        They include maps that support the siting of buildings and transport systems (based on detailed
        topographic and geological maps) , in particular railway lines and access of minerals to ports, or
        identify mineral resource potential (e.g., construction materials, metals, ground water), geo-
        hazards (e.g., flooding, landslides), and environmental risks (e.g., acid drainage, radionuclide
        potential).

    -   Prepare analytical study that identifies potential future mining areas and available options to
        route infrastructure and designate land for biodiversity offsets. Such an effort can contribute to
        the PNAT and the SNAT and strengthen long-term spatial planning for the mining sector. The
        analysis examining the feasibility of different transport options to reduce the direct and indirect
        footprint of mining could answer questions such as:



                                                    72
-   Where would it be possible to consolidate the routing of infrastructure and avoid negative
    impacts on habitat loss and biodiversity?
- Which areas would be most suitable for an “offshore” approach to mining and how would
    that affect the choice and location of transport and energy infrastructure?
- What options exist to obtain and secure land for biodiversity offsets?
The analytical study could be narrow in scope and examine a few minerals and one region, for
example iron ore mining in the TRIDOM interzone (see Box 3), or alternatively be more ambitious
covering multiple minerals and include a comprehensive strategic assessment for the mining
sector.

CHAPTER 4 PROPOSED ROADMAP AND DRAFT IMPLEMENTATION PLAN

4.1 Proposed roadmap to strengthen land use planning

4.1.1 Background on process

At a workshop in Brazzaville in June 2015, participants from MAT-DGGT, sectoral ministries, and civil
society developed a first sketch of a roadmap. It identified six areas requiring support to strengthen land
use planning in the Republic of Congo: (1) sectorial planning; (2) multi-sectorial planning (i.e., the SNAT);
(3) integration of planning from national to local levels and across sectors; (4) information and analyses;
(5) participation; and (6) legal framework. The roadmap suggested to assess the current planning situation
in more detail and identify more specific actions (see Box 7).

Some caveats in this roadmap, however, made it difficult to identify concrete activities and outputs that
could be used to develop a program to strengthen land use planning in the country:
    - Sectoral planning required an assessment to identify which actions and outputs could become a
        priority.
    - Multi-sectoral planning needed better understanding of the envisioned planning components of
        the orientation law for land use planning, insights on the progress of ongoing projects such as the
        PNAT, and lessons learned from the SNAT 2005.
    - Three areas – information and analyses, participation, and legal framework – applied to both
        sectoral and multi-sectoral planning, making it difficult to identify specific activities and outputs.
    - The approach was too general to determine how to prioritize sectoral planning vis-à-vis multi-
        sectoral planning efforts.

Between October 2015 and March 2016, WRI, with support from MAT-DGGT and sector ministries, carried
out some of the envisioned assessments of the current planning situation and identified gaps and
opportunities to strengthen land use planning. The following areas were covered:
    - Reviewed the orientation law and identified the multitude of plans and guideline documents
        needed in the future.
    - Inquired about the status of the PNAT, assessed ROC’s first SNAT, compared these plans to
        international practices, and checked on data and analytical needs.
    - Reviewed national plans and spatial data availability and capacity in the forest, agriculture, and
        the mining sector.
This work has been summarized in previous sections (see sections 3.1 to 3.4). Box 5 provides an overview
of the progress made on some of the action items of the June 2015 roadmap.

To develop a more granular roadmap and identify packages of activities and outputs that could eventually
be considered in the development (and costing) of a program to strengthen land use planning, a
framework that systematically defines broad intervention areas is required.

Such a framework can be created with the help of a matrix that juxtaposes a set of planning components
that are essential for effective land use planning with a set of sectoral and multi-sectoral planning efforts
that are essential for better land management in the country. Each cell in the matrix represents a broad
intervention area. A roadmap to strengthen land use planning would then select a subset of these
intervention areas as a priority for further implementation.

To create a roadmap of possible intervention areas and an associated draft implementation plan with
more detailed outputs and activities, the following next steps are proposed:
    - Develop first a systematic framework with broad intervention areas and produce a more granular
        roadmap that prioritizes among these intervention areas. Then discuss whether these priorities
        are strategic and fit with stakeholders’ preferences. Such a discussion with MAT-DGGT, sectoral
        ministries, and other stakeholders of land use planning is envisioned during a planned workshop
        in Brazzaville in June 2016.
    - As a second step, draft a proposed implementation plan for these broad intervention areas with
        more detailed outputs and activities. These are envisioned to be discussed as well at the June
        2016 workshop to illustrate possible choices to implement the roadmap.
    - Based on the feedback from the June 2016 workshop, make a final determination on the preferred
        broad intervention areas, outputs, and activities (and their scope, timing, and possible costs).

Section 4.1.2 will introduce the key planning components for effective land use planning, and section 4.1.3
will discuss a priority set of sectoral and multi-sectoral planning efforts. The resulting matrix of broad
intervention areas and the proposed roadmap to strengthen selected planning components at sectoral
and multi-sectoral level will be presented in section 4.1.4. The draft implementation plan for this roadmap
will be covered in section 4.2

4.1.2 Goals, objectives, and key planning components for effective land management

The goals of this roadmap are more effective land management in the Republic of Congo and
implementation of the land use orientation law (law n° 43-2014). The roadmap supports the more general
objectives of integrated land use planning:
    - Designate geographic areas to specific functions (e.g., farming, forestry, transport, housing,
        conservation) with the most sustainable uses and in line with national development priorities.
    - Avoid conflicts and create synergies between different types of land uses.
    - Establish a formal instrument of government to organize, regulate, and manage use of land.

Furthermore, major objectives of law n° 43-2014 underpin this roadmap:
    - Establish the legal framework for a spatial planning policy in compliance with the objectives and
       basic principles of sustainable development.
    - Provide the country with a balanced spatial organization, infrastructure networks, and structural
       facilities.
    - Promote synergies to strengthen the foundations for growth, strengthen the competitiveness of
       the productive system, and protect and improve the living environment.

To achieve these goals and objectives, the roadmap needs to buttress interconnected planning
components that have proven essential in practical experiences of developing and implementing
strategies for sustainable local land management (GIZ, 2011). Effective land management requires
information, analysis, planning, political decisions, legislation, administration, and control (GIZ, 2010).
Likewise, sustainable land management requires participation of key stakeholders.

To identify suitable intervention areas and outputs for the roadmap, six planning components,
representing the means for effective land use planning, have been considered. A subset of these planning
components were discussed at a June 2015 stakeholder workshop in Brazzaville and have been examined
in the assessment of sectoral and multi-sectoral planning in this document. The following is a description



                                                    76
of each planning component, the envisioned result from investing in it, and a summary from the
assessment of the current situation:
   -   Planning component 1: complete baseline data and information. Examples include biophysical
       and socioeconomic databases, GIS data, remote sensing products, maps, and environmental and
       economic studies of resources and baseline conditions. The envisioned result of this planning
       component is: data and information about the territory are comprehensive; and data and
       information management capacity is strong at all levels.

       The assessment of the current situation identified considerable data and information gaps, both
       at sectoral and at multi-sectoral level. Data and information management capacity needs to be
       strengthened.

   -   Planning component 2: comprehensive indicative planning. This planning step provides a
       prognosis of future land use. Planning relies on tools that project trends, develop scenarios of
       land use options, determine agricultural or biodiversity conservation potential, and examine the
       feasibility of investments, strategies or plans. The envisioned result of this planning component
       is: strategies and plans are based on analysis, are spatially explicit, and balance economic,
       environmental and social needs; resources are in place to support analysis.

       The assessment found that not all sectors had completed such long-term strategies, or plans were
       not specific enough in relation to their spatial priorities. In addition, no published references
       could be found that indicated that land use scenarios were discussed internally by technical teams
       or presented in stakeholder consultations.

   -   Planning component 3: strong affirmative planning. In this planning step, a final decision needs
       to be made on the appropriate land use options for a geographic area. This decision generally is
       based on a combination of technical criteria and stakeholder priorities. Typical outputs are maps
       with macro-zoning, a national planning framework such as the PNAT and a SNAT, regional and
       local land use plans with associated rules to access and use land, and investment guides that
       establish spatial priorities. The following result is envisioned for this planning component: plans
       and guidance have defined spatial priorities and zoning by major land use categories; the
       documents balance economic, environmental and social needs and reflect multiple sector
       priorities.

       The assessment found that macro-zoning had been completed at national level (e.g., SNAT 2005-
       2025, PDSA 2012-2035) and at sub-national level (e.g., zoning of land use by broad categories in
       forest concessions), or was done on an ad-hoc basis outside regular planning processes (e.g.,
       macro-zoning for conservation and mining in Sangha department). In addition, past planning
       efforts have lacked a supportive legal and policy framework for such zoning and associated
       participatory processes. No investment guides that incorporate land use zoning with a spatial
       prioritization balancing economic, environmental, and social criteria for large investment projects
       (e.g., biofuels, mining) have been published.

   -   Planning component 4: coherent legal framework. The land use orientation law (Law n° 43-2014)
       establishes the broad framework for spatial planning. Zoning (e.g., protected areas, conservation
       corridors), guidance (e.g., investment guide where and how to establish palm oil plantations), and
       land use plans require legal recognition to ensure their effective implementation. Law n° 43-2014



                                                   77
        needs to be harmonized with sectoral laws and rules affecting land allocation. The following result
        is envisioned for this planning component: the legal and institutional framework supporting
        integrated land use planning at all levels is complete and without ambiguities.

        The assessment identified the need to develop more specific legislative and administrative
        instruments to implement the land use orientation law.

    -   Planning component 5: effective systems to engage stakeholders, disseminate data, and
        communicate information about plans and rules. Lack of stakeholder input in developing land use
        plans undermines their effective implementation. This is why Law n° 43-2014 has made reference
        to the principles of coordination, consultation, and participation and emphasized the importance
        of participation when developing and reviewing the Republic of Congo’s SNAT. That is why other
        countries have mandated that national or subnational planning or zoning commissions rely on
        diverse stakeholder participation. This planning component aims for the following result:
        effective systems are in place that have resulted in meaningful participation in land use planning;
        there is high awareness about land use data, information, plans, and rules.

        The analysis of the current situation found a need for establishing the administrative capacity to
        define and implement a transparent and inclusive land use planning process. Institutions and
        resources need to be in place to support practices of coordination, consultation, and participation
        in land use planning.

    -   Planning component 6: effective administration to implement, monitor, enforce, and adjudicate.
        The greatest challenge for land use planning is the implementation and enforcement of plans. It
        requires effective administration to allocate land following planning and zoning regulations.
        Government agencies need to have systems in place to monitor and enforce land use (e.g.,
        through incentives and command and control measures). Mechanisms need to be in place to
        resolve land use conflicts quickly and fairly. This planning component aims for the following result:
        effective systems are in place to allocate land (e.g., issue concessions, licenses), monitor land use,
        enforce rules, and resolve conflicts.

        Of all the sectors analyzed in the assessment, the forest sector has the strongest systems in terms
        of oversight and enforcement at the concession level, but still needs to overcome considerable
        barriers to be more effective. Agriculture, mining, and multi-sector land use planning agencies
        are just at the early development stage to establish more formal land use planning processes or
        launch relevant administrative systems.

4.1.3 Prioritizing sectoral and multi-sectoral planning efforts

It is proposed to build planning capacity at sectoral and multi-sectoral level. The following are promising
areas to strengthen land use planning:
      (1) Forest (lead institution Ministère de l'Economie Forestière et du Développement Durable -
          MEFDD).
      (2) Agriculture (lead institution Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage - MAE).
      (3) Mining (lead institution Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie - MMG).
      (4) Other sectors including biodiversity conservation (lead institutions MEFDD), environment and
          tourism (lead institution Ministère du Tourisme et de l'Environnement- MTE) and infrastructure
          (lead institution transport: Ministère des Transports, de l’Aviation Civile et de la Marine


                                                     78
        Marchande - MTACMM; lead institution energy: Ministère de l’Energie et de l’Hydraulique - MEH
        / Société Nationale d’Electricité – SNE).
    (5) Multi-sectoral land use planning (lead institution Ministère de l'Aménagement du Territoire et de
        la Délégation Générale aux Grands Travaux - MAT-DGGT).

The rationale for this prioritization is as follows:
    -   Forest sector planning. To build land use planning capacity, it is proposed to start with the sector
        that covers the largest land area and that has already spatial planning experience based on its
        coordination of forest management plans. In addition, there is much at stake of finding the right
        balance between safeguarding the country’s forest capital and obtaining large economic returns
        from forest lands.

        The forest sector also has a key role to play in filling an important information gap. Once the IFN
        project is completed, it should be able to provide information on land cover and land use based
        on extrapolated sample plot data. In the case of these data and information being delayed or not
        covering the country comprehensively, it may be necessary to initiate a process that obtains an
        updated land cover and use map and ensures regular updates and long-term support for this map
        (perhaps as part of building a National Geomatics Centre).

        Finally, establishing official forest boundaries and land use zoning within forest lands, especially
        in the savannah region, would create greater certainty and fewer conflicts for agricultural and
        other land investments.

    -   Agriculture sector planning. From an area perspective and the number of people affected,
        agriculture is an important land use in the country. In addition, agricultural land use can be an
        important driver of forest loss and other ecosystem change.

        Better land use planning in the sector can introduce a long-term sustainability perspective that
        accounts for multiple types of land uses in a landscape or region. For example, the Republic of
        Congo has great potential for palm oil and other agricultural crops. Without good planning and
        strong monitoring, land could easily be allocated using a boom-and-bust approach. There is
        sufficient time and land to plan industrial agriculture in sustainable way. Likewise, systematic
        spatial planning of small-scale agriculture intensification with associated infrastructure
        investments (e.g., roads, markets) represents a great opportunity. If these plans are developed
        with comprehensive stakeholder participation and implemented successfully, they can boost
        livelihood opportunities and create greater land security for farmers and local land managers.

        In addition, strengthening land use planning capacity for the agriculture sector can build on the
        PDSA experience of delineating macro-zones and applying criteria to avoid forest loss. These
        criteria could be emulated in other sectors – some of these criteria could be further developed
        and applied in the new long-term master plans schémas directeurs des parties du territoire) and
        guidance (orientation) required under the orientation law for land use planning (e.g., for the
        mining sector).

        The final reason to encourage spatial planning and zoning of agricultural land with a sustainability
        perspective in mind is the lack of a requirement to prepare a long-term master plan (schémas
        directeurs des parties du territoire) and guidance (orientation) for agricultural land. In the



                                                       79
    orientation law for land use planning, agricultural land is not mentioned as an important part of
    the national territory (parties du territoire).

-   Planning for the mining sector. The Republic of Congo has a great opportunity to apply a
    comprehensive planning perspective for mining that moves away from planning of individual
    mining sites, takes multiple potential mining sites into consideration, and strategically plans
    infrastructure routing and biodiversity conservation areas (potential offsets areas) in support of
    these future mining sites (see TRIDOM interzone example, Box 4). Such strategic spatial planning
    can inform the country’s intended main plans covering multiple sectors: the SNAT and the
    associated PNAT.

-   Planning of conservation areas and biodiversity priorities. Systematic land use planning for
    biodiversity and conservation priorities is a missing piece in the country’s national strategies and
    spatial planning efforts. Such planning can take into account an approach that looks at a gradation
    of protections, from areas with very strict protection (e.g., national parks) to areas where different
    land use and land use changes are permitted (but certain management rules apply). A planning
    gap that needs to be closed for better land management (and for a revised SNAT) is the
    delineation of land supplying different ecosystem services, which are important for local
    communities and for the country as a whole. This includes areas that supply clean drinking water,
    deliver shoreline and flood protection, provide opportunities for recreation and spiritual
    enrichment, are important habitat for wildlife, native trees and other species, and store carbon.

-   Planning for the tourism sector. Once the data for the above sectors have been compiled and the
    associated analyses has been completed, it would require a modest effort to synthesize this
    information and carry out a strategic analysis for the country’s tourism sector. Such a study would
    examine how different natural assets are providing benefits for tourism, recreation, and spiritual
    enrichment and identify new areas with tourism potential. Completing such a national study
    would strengthen the analytical foundation for planning in the tourism sector and could help to
    grow the sector and help to achieve the objectives of the country’s national strategy for
    sustainable tourism (the results of that strategy were not yet available during preparation of this
    report). In addition, it would create an opportunity to introduce areas important for tourism
    development into the macro-zoning of a revised SNAT. Published spatial plans and studies on
    tourism development that have been available for the preparation of this report, have so far
    concentrated mostly on tourism infrastructure and on planning at very local scale for ecotourism
    (e.g., zones linked to protected areas).

-   Planning of infrastructure. Spatial data and information on transport and energy infrastructure is
    an essential layer for land use planning in the sectors mentioned above and for multi-sectoral
    plans such as the SNAT. At a minimum, investments need to be made to have up-to-date spatial
    data and maps of current and planned infrastructure. There is an opportunity to introduce a
    broader strategic perspective into the planning of infrastructure and go beyond the routing
    criteria typically applied such as travel distance, travel time, travel volume, engineering costs, and
    number of people served. Additional criteria could include, for example, avoiding high
    biodiversity areas, minimizing habitat fragmentation, or reducing the indirect and cumulative
    impacts of transport infrastructure such as increased logging, unplanned agricultural
    development, and wildlife poaching (see discussion for the mining sector above).

    -   Multi-sectoral planning. It is proposed to focus on the key components of the orientation law for
        land use planning and:
            o Revise the SNAT – including an alignment with the ongoing PNAT - and complete
                associated strategic plans and guidance for the land use management zones (zones
                d’aménagement du territoire) as generally described in the law.
            o Establish new proposed multi-sectoral planning institutions envisioned under the
                orientation law for land use planning.
            o Complete a new land use planning code (code d’aménagement du territoire) outlined in
                the orientation law for land use planning.
            o Strengthen technical planning skills and capacity for coordinating multi-sectoral planning
                processes within MAT-DGGT.

4.1.4 Roadmap with proposed intervention areas at sectoral and multi-sectoral level

Figure 29 shows a matrix that juxtaposes a set of essential planning components with a set of priority
planning areas. Each cell in the matrix represents a broad intervention area. The figure also highlights
certain intervention areas and associated levels of effort, which amounts to a roadmap of proposed
intervention areas to strengthen planning components for land use planning at sectoral and multi-sectoral
level. The underlying principles applied to prioritize certain intervention areas and the resulting roadmap
are discussed below.

Broad intervention areas selected for the roadmap
The selection of broad intervention areas was guided by a number of principles and observations from
international land use planning experiences (World Bank, 2014; GIZ, 2011; GIZ, 2010). Planning
components and intervention areas for the proposed roadmap were prioritized based on the following
criteria and assumptions:

    -   Invest in data and information first. Spatial data and map investments have to be made first to
        establish a sound footing for land use planning in the Republic of Congo (planning component 1:
        complete baseline data and information).

    -   Invest in a few strategic planning processes and move close to implementation. The idea is to
        identify strategic planning processes in key sectors, establish the data and analytical foundation
        for planning, and move as close as possible toward implementation of plans during the initial
        phase of the roadmap. The proposed sectoral planning efforts for forest, agriculture, and
        biodiversity conservation, and for multi-sectoral planning (i.e., the PNAT, SNAT, and associated
        strategic plans for land use management zones) are expected to do this by encouraging concrete
        land use zoning and establishing spatial priorities of use (planning component 3: strong
        affirmative planning). For this, systematic stakeholder involvement is strongly encouraged
        because it can help reduce future land use conflicts and increases the long-term prospects of land
        investments (planning component 5: effective systems to engage stakeholders, disseminate data,
        and communicate information about plans and rules).

    -   Apply analytical tools to develop land use options and to facilitate understanding. Maps and other
        spatial tools to visualize land use and development scenarios are being proposed for the sectoral
        and multi-sectoral tracts of activities (planning component 2: comprehensive indicative planning).

Notes:
● = The number of bullets indicate the relative level of effort envisioned in the draft implementation plan (see 4.2). Effort has been approximated by the number of envisioned activities and outputs.
1 = These are supporting studies to identify ambiguity and gaps in the legal code and associated instruments. The studies would propose draft language to rectify existing law, introduce new

instruments within sectors where needed, and propose a new Code d’Aménagement du Territoire as envisioned under law no 43-2014.
2 = Mostly focused on setting up new systems to share and access data, maps, plans, and other land use information.




                                                                                                  82
-   Designate a group of government conveners. Each priority planning area at sectoral and multi-
    sectoral level is envisioned to designate lead institutions working in partnership with other
    institutions that have technical planning expertise. Moreover, MAT-DGGT has the strategic
    mandate for multi-sectoral planning and is envisioned as the co-lead for the proposed sectoral
    outputs and activities. MAT-DGGT can bring a broader perspective to land use planning that
    moves beyond single sectoral priorities and balances multiple sectoral interests.

-   Encourage systematic information sharing. Both sectoral and multi-sectoral tracts seek to
    establish platforms to share spatial data and provide access to plans and reference maps (planning
    component 6: effective systems to engage stakeholders, disseminate data, and communicate
    information about plans and rules).

-   Focus institutional changes and legal revisions on a limited set of strategic areas. For this
    roadmap, it is proposed to prioritize new institutions envisioned for national-scale planning under
    the orientation law for land use planning and to strengthen technical planning and coordination
    capacity to prepare multi-sectoral land use plans. In regards to the legal framework (planning
    component 4: coherent legal framework), it is proposed to harmonize land use classifications,
    zoning and land allocation rules for the forest, agriculture, and mining sectors and to develop the
    new land use planning law (code d’aménagement du territoire).

-   Assume a five-year time horizon and limit the time to prepare respective planning outputs. This
    roadmap assumes a five-year time frame to launch spatial planning cycles at sectoral and multi-
    sectoral level. Within that period, multiple planning outputs with stakeholder contributions can
    be prepared, assuming that each output stays within a recommended 12 to 18-month limit.
    (Planning outputs requiring a very long preparation time carry a greater risk of becoming too
    complex and delaying or avoiding implementation.) Five years, however, will not be sufficient
    time to iterate through multiple spatial plans or allow for complete alignment of sectoral and
    multi-sectoral planning cycles.

-   Assume that progress for priority planning areas will proceed unevenly and launch parallel
    processes. The following challenges have to be addressed to strengthen spatial planning at
    sectoral and multi-sectoral level:
        o Spatial planning processes are not in place.
        o Existing sectoral plans have not been linked to multi-sectoral plans (i.e., SNAT).
        o Spatial planning processes have not been synchronized across sectors and between sector
            plans and multi-sector plans.
    Past country experiences with data inventories and map production also indicate a high risk of
    delays for such outputs.

    It is therefore proposed to launch sectoral and multi-sectoral processes simultaneously. The first
    12 to 18 months would focus on establishing the foundation as follows:
          o At sectoral level, it would be support for data compilation, analytical maps, and possible
              macro-zoning.
          o At multi-sectoral level, it would be support to continue the ongoing IFN project with the
              associated PNAT and to strengthen the technical and processing capacity of MAT-DGGT
              to coordinate multi-sectoral land use planning.



                                                83
        One critical junction is expected to be reached after 12 to 18 months when the envisioned
        analytical outputs from the sectors (e.g., proposed macro-zones for forests, agriculture and
        biodiversity) are intended to feed into the multi-sectoral plan, the SNAT revision. A possible
        program to strengthen land use planning in the Republic of Congo would need some flexibility at
        this point to assess sectoral progress and to adjust the scope and timing of the SNAT and other
        remaining outputs in the roadmap. It is possible that the delivery of sectoral data, maps, and
        macro-zoning may not be completely aligned with the timing envisioned for the SNAT revision. It
        may take two five-year cycles to completely align sectoral plans and revisions of the SNAT.

Broad intervention areas left out of this roadmap
The roadmap does not cover some broad intervention areas shown in Figure 29 (gray cells). These include
activities to support sub-national planning and to strengthen the administrative capacity to implement
sectoral and multi-sectoral plans (planning component 6: effective administration to implement, monitor,
enforce, and adjudicate).

The justification to delay these intervention areas is that investments need to be made first into data,
information, indicative and affirmative planning, and the legal framework starting at national level.
Furthermore, the chosen intervention areas link to ongoing projects and priorities, build on existing
planning capacity, and can be achieved within the five-year time frame.

What the roadmap does and doesn’t do
The proposed five-year roadmap prioritized planning components important to launch a national spatial
planning program in the Republic of Congo. For each planning component, concrete outputs will be
suggested that support a spatial planning process at sectoral and multi-sectoral level. The aim is to
produce sound technical products that can help support key sectors and, if coordinated well with MAT-
DGGT, contribute to new or revised multi-sectoral plans (i.e., the completion of the PNAT and a revision
of the SNAT).

The proposed roadmap postpones a number of broad intervention areas, which can be addressed in a
follow-up program and most likely will focus on ensuring successful implementation of the new and
revised plans. The framework in Figure 23 provides a strategic screening device for MAT-DGGT and its
collaborating lead agencies to identify additional planning components that may require strengthening in
the future.

The selection of intervention areas in this roadmap – and the selection of specific activities and outputs
in the implementation plan in section 4.2 – is based on the assessment of gaps identified in Chapter 3 of
this document. This assessment and the proposed intervention areas require further discussions with
technical staff at sectoral ministries and within MAT-DGGT. These discussions may reveal that the
assessment in this document may have missed an important ongoing project or may have interpreted the
language in the orientation law for land use planning differently than what government partners would
have done. In addition, government partners may have different preferences on the scope, frequency,
and timing of participation and consultation for the sectoral and multi-sectoral plans.

It is expected that the envisioned strengthening of sectoral and multi-sectoral planning in this roadmap
will provide the following benefits:
      - Contribute to better understanding of the land use potential of a geographic area.
      - With newly established zoning, create clearer boundaries on where investment should go and not
         go.

                                                   84
    -   Reduce conflict between sectors or between national government actors and local community
        needs.
    -   Encourage wider agreement in the context of national development planning (and related
        budgeting) on the relative priority of certain investments and the need to allocate space for that
        to happen.

Ways to expand and strengthen the roadmap
Providing more granularity in selected areas and exploring technical and financial support options for
planning processes more broadly could strengthen this roadmap. These limitations in emphasized
research areas are a result of the technical and topic expertise readily available to the research team
and the need to prioritize research tasks.

The first limitation is that not all planning components were assessed at the same depths. For example,
the assessment of spatial data and map needs was more comprehensive than the one of the legal
framework, which relied on the legal analysis of others. Hence the recommendations for planning
component 1 are more specific than for planning component 4 in the proposed implementation plan.

The second limitation is that the assessment and recommendations for effective plan development and
plan implementation can be further expanded. The following areas are especially relevant for developing
a comprehensive national program to strengthen land use planning in the country:
    -   Government capacity to organize and manage a multi-sectoral national planning process. This
        will require a more systematic assessment of the government’s capacity to organize and manage
        spatial planning processes in regular cycles (e.g., a five-year period suggested for the SNAT and
        other plans).

    -   Incentives and regulatory changes needed to ensure smooth planning across sectors. Delivery of
        coherent, consistent planning inputs from sector agencies, and eventually from sub-national
        units, will require a functioning planning system. An assessment of the current situation can
        prepare recommendation how to create a better system. It will require new incentives and
        regulatory changes to establish and institutionalize effective, responsive means to inform and
        solicit inputs to planning processes.

    -   Stakeholder capacity to participate in planning process. This can be determined with a more
        systematic assessment of the required information, tools, and other resources needed to ensure
        meaningful participation of people, communities, and stakeholders.

    -   Cost estimates for the activities and outputs listed in the implementation plan. This will require
        first agreement on the broad intervention areas and associated activities and outputs and then
        technical expertise to determine their costs to determine overall costs of a national
        implementation plan.

    -   Funding plan to implement roadmap. This can be determined with an assessment of current
        funding support for spatial planning in the Republic of Congo and recommendations to harmonize
        government and development cooperation partners’ support to implement a national roadmap.

4.2 Draft implementation plan

The following draft implementation plan is based on perceived gaps in planning and associated tools,
preliminary needs identified in stakeholder engagement at workshops and team meetings, and practical
experiences from other countries. The proposed activities will require further review from planning and
country experts. This section should be seen as a first step to encourage discussion at a workshop in
Brazzaville and generate a new and better implementation plan.

This section will present first suggested activities to strengthen sectoral land use planning in the forest
sector (4.2.1), agriculture sector (4.2.2), mining sector (4.2.3) and other sectors covering biodiversity
conservation, tourism, and infrastructure (4.2.4). Next will be a section describing proposed outputs and
activities to strengthen multi-sectoral land use planning (4.2.5). A final overview figure that shows the
sequencing of all major packages of activities and outputs at sectoral and multi-sectoral level will conclude
this section (4.2.6).

4.2.1 Forest sector

Rationale for proposed activities and outputs

Link to existing sector planning. The proposed activities take advantage of the forest sector’s capacity
with a national resource inventory and the sector’s experience with management plans for forest
management units. The work builds on the already established partnership between CNIAT (MEFDD) and
MAT-DGGT to produce a PNAT.

Objectives of the proposed work. The objectives are to make forest resource information more readily
available, strengthen spatial planning in the forest sector, and align this effort with implementing the
orientation law on land use planning. The final objective is to create stronger zoning and classification of
tree-covered land that can be used in future decision making on land allocations or establishing rules of
access and on use of forest lands.

Timing of the proposed work. This technical work in the forest sector does not have to wait for progress
at multi-sectoral level (e.g., revision of the SNAT; code d’aménagement du territoire). In fact, the
envisioned work will be an important input to complete the PNAT, revise the SNAT and associated macro-
zoning, and develop strategies and guidance documents required for important parts of the national
territory (parties du territoire) under the new orientation law for land use planning. If the technical work
in the forest sector proceeds swiftly – with the work ideally being completed within 12 to 18 months –
the new forest maps and analyses can make a meaningful contribution to the envisioned multi-sectoral
planning outputs.

Envisioned lead institutions. CNIAF, as the proposed lead institution, is envisioned to work closely with
other programs and units associated with MEFDD. The forest sector institutions are envisioned to work
closely with MAT-DGGT and also draw on mapping and planning expertise from the private sector (e.g.,
companies preparing forest management plans) and international NGOs involved in forest mapping (e.g.,
WRI, WCS, WWF).

Proposed packages of activities. The first proposed package of activities seeks to consolidate databases
and create new summary maps (ultimately resulting in a stronger online platform of forest information).


                                                     86
This is followed by a package of activities that includes analytical studies on forest potential and spatial
priorities of forest use.

These activities are justified because forest ecosystems cover the majority of the country. Up-to-date and
comprehensive data on forest cover and use are the foundation for better planning within the sector and
at multi-sectoral level. Likewise, improved baseline data are the foundation for any long-term forest and
land use monitoring systems.

The reason for the analytical work is to provide an evidence-based foundation that can help to develop a
national strategy for all forest lands, support decision-making to allocate logging concessions and other
land uses within forest lands, and create new information that can support national biodiversity and
conservation planning and determine tourism potential (see section 4.2.4). Most importantly, this type of
analysis will be needed to justify prospective zoning and classifications of the forest estate.

Moving beyond the data and analytical work and translating its findings into proposals to strengthen
(official) zoning and classification of the forest estate, represent the next package of activities. Agreed
upon zoning and official classification of the forest estate create greater certainty for land managers
within government (e.g., other sectors) and outside government (e.g., private companies interested in
investing in new type of land uses in the forest-savannah transition zone; local communities seeking to
establish community forests or other natural-resource-based enterprises). The ultimate output
envisioned for the forest sector work stream is a national reference map of the forest estate and forest
extent. Creating such a reference will require stakeholder validation.

Figure 30 shows the sequencing of these major packages of activities and outputs (green boxes) and how
they lead to a final reference map and contribute to multi-sectoral planning. A more detailed set of
proposed outputs and a preliminary work plan are shown in Table 2. These outputs, organized into four
broad packages, will be described in more detail in the next sections.

Package 1 of outputs: consolidated databases, maps, and online platform
It is assumed that the final databases and maps from the National Forest Inventory (IFN), as envisioned in
the project appraisal report to the Congo Basin Forest Fund, will be available by mid-2016. It is also
assumed that the proposed activities for this roadmap will align with the efforts of the inter-ministerial
working group to advance the National Land Use Allocation Plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres -
PNAT), which was initiated by MAT-DGGT and CNIAF (MEFDD) in July 2015 under the IFN project.

To build a foundation for the proposed work stream, the envisioned IFN databases and maps will require,
most likely, further refinement. In addition, planners and decision makers could benefit from a set of
additional maps summarizing the sample data from the IFN (e.g., maps that show extrapolated surfaces
of non-timber product use, tree and plant diversity, mammal diversity and distribution, level of human
disturbance). A consolidated IFN database and maps of forest resources and forest use for broad
dissemination are thus Output 1.

The second set of data and maps, whose consolidation and more widespread availability could be valuable
for forest sector and multi-sectoral land use planning at national level, are the data and zoning maps that
have been prepared for the Republic of Congo’s forest management units (FMUs). This consolidated
database and associated maps represent Output 2. Both consolidated databases and associated maps
will be made available on the Republic of Congo forest atlas platform (Output 3).

                                                                                      88
Differentiated access to this platform can be envisioned for users within government agencies (e.g., MAT-
DGGT, CNIAF, CGRM, DEPs in different sector ministries) and outside of government such as logging
companies, investors in the mining and agriculture sectors, national and international research institutes,
and civil society organizations.

The general idea is to produce high quality data and summary maps from existing inventories quickly
(within 12 months) and make them widely available and easily accessible. This would remove a major
constraint of past planning, both within the forest sector and at multi-sectoral level. These outputs would
also greatly facilitate future spatial planning in various sectors and at different scales.

When consolidating the databases, producing summary maps, and creating the online platform, it is
critical to engage capable and motivated government partners with the institutional mandates for
supplying and maintaining such data and maps. Moreover, resources need to be put in place to build
technical capacity within these partners, and a long-term plan needs to secure regular budget resources
to maintain core functions of the online platform. These efforts represent Output 4.

Package 2 of outputs: analytical study to determine forest potential and spatial priorities of use
The envisioned study will rely on the outputs listed above, but also incorporate relevant conservation
planning and community mapping by non-governmental organizations. The objective is to highlight the
multiple benefits provided by forest ecosystems and their contribution to livelihoods and economic
development. This can be done by identifying important supply areas for timber, non-timber products,
food crops and other agricultural commodities, habitat for wildlife and biodiversity conservation, carbon
storage, and other ecosystem services. These areas can be analyzed to show the most promising areas
for timber and non-timber forest production, agriculture, tourism, spiritual enrichment, carbon storage,
biodiversity offsets areas, and other uses. A final set of maps could suggest spatial priorities such as:
     - Areas with high timber potential (e.g., suitability for industrial, semi-industrial, and artisanal
        production; unsuitable areas).
     - Areas most suitable for crop and food production.
     - Areas with high potential for carbon storage and forest restoration.
     - Areas with high conservation values and potential biodiversity offsets areas.
     - Areas suitable for corridor creation to link areas with high biodiversity.
     - Areas most suitable for tourism development and recreation.
     - Potential “protection forest areas” (e.g., fragile soils, watershed services, sacred forests).
     - Potential “forest conservation areas” (e.g., intact natural areas, core refugia areas, high plant and
        fauna diversity areas).
     - Potential “community forest areas” showing lands occupied and claimed by local communities
        and indigenous peoples.

Within the forest sector, such spatial prioritization can be applied to propose a technically sound zoning
of Permanent Forest Estate and Non-permanent Forest Estate and help to create greater synergies among
plans prepared independently for the Republic of Congo’s FMUs. At multi-sectoral planning level, the
analytical maps can inform preparation of the PNAT and the SNAT, improve planning for each land use
management zone (zone d’aménagement du territoire) in the SNAT, and contribute to implementing the
orientation law for land use planning.

Output 5 described above will be accompanied by stakeholder engagement and communication support
(Output 6). It will seek comments to refine the approach for preparing the analytical maps, get feedback


                                                    89
on draft maps of spatial priorities, and prepare communication material that raise awareness about the
study and its findings.

Package 3 of outputs: proposals to strengthen zoning and classifications within the forest estate
Over the past years, the Republic of Congo’s forest management units (FMUs) have been delineated
without the in-depth multi-resources information expected from the IFN. Concession allocations have
not benefited yet from a national spatial strategy that prioritizes different types of forest use for specific
geographic areas.

A timber company that has been allocated a concession has to follow the Republic of Congo’s forest law,
which requires a socio-economic and biophysical inventory and a management plan. The plan must
include broad zoning such as logging units, road development, protected forest areas, experimental forest
areas, protection of riparian areas (buffer along permanent water bodies), community development areas
(e.g., for agriculture), and land designated for community hunting. Once a concession has been allocated,
the land (and associated zoning) becomes part of the permanent forest estate (PFE).

While all companies developing management plans and establishing land use zoning follow the same steps
outlined above, there is little coordination of plans, either across the boundaries of Forest Management
Units (FMUs) or with non-forest land bordering FMUs. Land use planning and zoning within a concession
therefore does not take advantage of a broader landscape perspective, for example by increasing
ecological connectivity and improving forest biodiversity values or by encouraging agricultural activities
in strategic locations (e.g., through buffer zone management, wildlife corridors between protected zones,
and inclusion of biodiversity aspects into production forests).

Output 7 addresses this issue of zoning within the PFE. It seeks to harmonize plans across FMUs with a
broader landscape and in some cases even a national perspective in mind. It envisions a proposal for
zoning revisions that are based on a national assessment of current zoning within all FMUs and new maps
suggesting shifts in zoning to create greater synergies across FMUs and with land use priorities in non-
forest land. The zoning revisions would be based on the analyses supporting Output 5. The final proposal
would also include suggestions on the most suitable incentives to encourage spatial shifts in zoning and
forest production patterns within existing FMUs.

A second entry point to strengthen land use planning for the Republic of Congo’s forest estate is focused
on the non-permanent forest estate (NPFE) and its official delineation. As discussed above, the practice
of awarding a concession for a FMU to a company defines the land as PFE. Areas that have been classified
or allocated for one of the land allocation types defined by the Republic of Congo’s forest law as being
PFE become PFE through the process of classification. The NPFE, however, is a residual: it has not been
delineated explicitly on a map.

Currently, the Republic of Congo’s NPFE is all remaining land outside of PFE defined as forest. In 2011,
the NPFE covered 7.8 million hectares, about 28 percent of the Republic of Congo’s forests (WRI, 2012).
For example, some of the largest blocks of NPFE are in Sangha department, with smaller blocks in almost
all forested departments.

The forest in NPFE land are considered to be part of the public domain of the state. The land hasn’t been
classified for a specific land use yet. NPFE land could be assigned for any land use including timber
production, agricultural crops, palm oil plantations, wildlife corridors, agro-forestry, and forest restoration
(ClientEarth 2015).

                                                      90
Output 8 seeks to take advantage of the IFN project and the analytical outputs described above and
develop a proposal to delineate NPFE land and possible land use options within this land. Delimiting the
boundary of NPFE land, for example within the forest-savannah transition zone, will help create greater
clarity in future land allocations for the agriculture, forest, and other sectors. The envisioned maps of
possible land use options within NPFE areas would take a broader landscape and in some cases a national
perspective into consideration. The maps would also incorporate ideas of past (and ongoing) regional
land use planning efforts, for example macro-zoning for mining and conservation in Sangha department
(WWF, 2015) and biodiversity offsets areas in Niari department (WCS, 2015).

Output 8 is expected to align with the work of the inter-ministerial working group to prepare a National
Land Allocation Map (Carte National d’Affectation des Terres) and associated plan (Plan National
d’Affectation des Terres). However, at this point in time, there is not sufficient information to determine
how much progress has been made to advance the PNAT since the group was established in July 2015. A
typical first step to develop a PNAT would be to determine current land allocation followed by a map and
description of future envisioned land allocation for different uses including PFE and NPFE.

A key principle underpinning Outputs 7 and 8 is to produce high quality maps and analysis quickly and
consider the outputs as a proposal. To ensure that both outputs are not an isolated technical exercise,
resources need to be earmarked for stakeholder engagement and communication support (Output 9).

Output 10 is the final output of the proposed work stream to strengthen zoning and classifications within
the forest estate. It would cover lessons learned from Outputs 7-9 and recommendations for future
revisions of the SNAT and other plans and guidance documents envisioned under the orientation law for
land use planning. Output 10 will be an important contribution to strengthen the Republic of Congo’s
multi-sectoral planning process.

Package 4 of outputs: draft reference map of forest estate and forest extent
In other tropical forest countries, planners of different agencies are often facing the challenge of relying
on multiple forest maps, resulting in misaligned maps of land use priorities and land use concessions. This
is the reason why Indonesia’s president launched the “One Map” project, a comprehensive effort to
establish a standardized base map, create new thematic maps, build a national geo-portal, and other
efforts to strengthen its geo-spatial data infrastructure.

Output 11 proposes to invest up front in efforts to create a reference map of the country’s forest estate
and forest extent, and thus avoid the costly mistake of multiple maps.

Such a reference would facilitate spatial planning across all sectors and help to lower transaction costs to
allocate land. Such a map would provide government agencies in various sectors with an agreed-upon
reference upon which to base their plans. Companies interested in investing in PFE and NPFE land would
have greater certainty in their operations about the status of the land and the associated rules. And most
likely, contestation in land allocations would be reduced.

Similarly, such a reference would help create greater certainty for establishing REDD+ projects. By clearly
delineating land falling under the PFE and NPFE category, a land area’s intended use is more clearly
defined, providing project proponents of REDD+ projects with greater certainty that there will be no other
unintended land use within the same forest area and that the Republic of Congo’s established rules under
the forest law (or future proposed drafts) would be followed (e.g., land use changes requiring a

                                                    91
deforestation permit; any declassification of forest in the PFE requiring prior classification of an equivalent
size area in another location).

Creating a reference map of the forest estate and forest extent for sectoral and multi-sectoral plans is
both a technical and political process (Output 10). It will require time and resources for stakeholder
engagement and communication support (Output 11). As mentioned for previous outputs – speed and
quality is going to be key. The orientation law for land use planning is expected to provide the necessary
impetus to advance such a map, especially if interest and resources from key ministries can be secured to
implement the law. However, there is not sufficient information yet to determine how quickly political
issues can be resolved to create a final officially approved reference map of the Republic of Congo’s forest
estate. It is therefore assumed that a final draft (Output 10) can be prepared with stakeholder
contributions within the planned time frame. It is also assumed that the new multi-sectoral planning
institutions (see 4.2.5), envisioned under the orientation law for land use planning, most likely will need
to be in place to help escape from any possible impasse brought on by incompatible sectoral and
institutional priorities for different versions of delineating the forest estate (PFE and NPFE).

4.2.2 Agriculture sector

Rationale for proposed activities and outputs

Link to existing sector planning. The proposed work rests upon the Plan de Développement du Secteur
Agricole (PDSA) and the expected agricultural land use information from the multi-resources inventory
(IFN). The latter information is required to establish baseline information on the current extent of
agricultural land use in the country.

Objectives of the proposed work. The objectives are to fill some of the important gaps in baseline data
and to create a stronger analytical foundation to permit more precise zoning and use of land for
agricultural purposes. These activities will strengthen decision making in the agriculture sector and
support preparation of the PNAT and the SNAT. As in the forest sector, the final objective is to create
stronger zoning and classification of agricultural land – building on the principles and macro-zoning
applied in the PDSA to delineate future agricultural expansion.

Timing of the proposed work. This technical work in the agriculture sector can be launched immediately.
This work for the agriculture sector will be an important input to complete the PNAT and revise the SNAT
and associated macro-zoning. Completion of this initial technical work in the agriculture sector within 12
to 18 months is required to make a meaningful contribution to multi-sectoral planning.

Envisioned lead institutions. The Ministère de l'Agriculture et de l'Elevage (MAE) is envisioned to lead this
effort and work closely with MAT-DGGT.

Proposed packages of activities. The first proposed package of activities seeks to consolidate existing data
on agricultural use and community lands (e.g., from the IFN, land use zoning in forest concessions, and
other remote sensing information). It also seeks to fill important soil information gaps, so that future
micro-zoning for agricultural land and agricultural support to strengthen soil and nutrient management
for agricultural production can be carried out more precisely. The next package of activities envisions
analytical studies that can help to delineate the potential for agriculture in general and for palm oil
specifically. Spatial analysis and maps of community lands round out this package of activities.


                                                      92
These activities are justified because agricultural growth and food security are a high priority in the
country’s national development strategy. Up-to-date and comprehensive spatial data on current
agricultural use are the foundation for better spatial planning within the sector and at multi-sectoral level
and can help to address a major driver of forest loss and ecosystem change. Likewise, improved baseline
data are the foundation for any long-term land use monitoring system.

The reason for the analytical work is to provide a more evidence-based foundation so that the agriculture
sector can proceed to the more precise micro-zoning of agricultural lands envisioned in the PDSA. In
addition, such analytical maps can be helpful to delineate more defensible boundaries between
agriculture and forest use, determine areas with high potential for agroforestry, and identify the most
promising areas for selected crops and livestock production. Most importantly, this type of analysis will
be needed to justify prospective zoning and classifications of agricultural lands.

As in the forest sector, the work stream for agriculture proceeds beyond the data and analytical work. It
seeks to develop more specific recommendations on the type of agriculture use in a geographic area.
Similarly, it seeks some type of zoning for one of the most profitable industrial crops – oil palm, a
significant driver of deforestation in other countries. Agreed upon zoning and official classification of
agricultural land, especially vis-à-vis the forest estate, can create greater certainty for land managers
within government and outside government. The ultimate output envisioned for the agriculture sector
work stream is a national reference map of agriculture and an investment guide for oil palm (with
associated zoning indicating the suitability of land for sustainable oil palm production).

Figure 31 shows the progression of these major packages of activities and outputs (orange boxes) and
how they would result in a reference map of agriculture and an investment guide for palm oil. A more
detailed set of proposed outputs and a preliminary work plan are shown in Table 3. These outputs,
grouped into four packages, will be described in more detail in the next sections.

Package 1 of outputs: consolidated databases and maps
Two outputs are envisioned for the first year. They focus on compiling existing information and
commissioning an updated soil map.

Output 1 covers consolidating databases and maps of agriculture use and community lands. This effort
combines information from the national multi-resources inventory (IFN), available remote sensing
products, agricultural and community land zoning from the management plans of forest concessions, and
other studies (e.g., SNAT 2005, Plan de Développement du Secteur Agricole).

A special emphasis of the data compilation will be extracting relevant information about community lands
used for agricultural purposes for a preliminary national map of such use. This map will then become the
foundation of a more comprehensive study to delineate potential community lands to encourage their
macro-zoning in future land use plans.

Output 2 is an updated soil map. A higher resolution soil map (not necessarily covering the whole country)
could help delineate high potential areas for agricultural production and identify soil constraints that need
to be overcome to boost yields. Both the PDSA and the PND 2016-2016 refer to

the need for such a map. In addition, the PDSA envisioned further micro-zoning to allocate agricultural
concessions, which will require more detailed soil information.

Preparing an updated soil map can be time consuming and costly. At the writing of this document, the
information about ongoing spatial data investments in the agriculture sector was still incomplete–it could
be possible that such an update is already underway. In addition, there could be linkages with Africa-wide
efforts to create more detailed soil maps using a combination of remote sensing and sampling sites. Once
this background information has been obtained, commissioning two different products could be
considered:
         - One map, at coarser resolution, that can be completed within a year and be used for better
             agricultural zoning for the respective country-wide outputs of the roadmap.
         - A second, much more detailed, soil map that would support micro-zoning and planning at
             more local scales. This map would be completed within the time horizon of the roadmap, but
             not incorporated in its multi-sectoral planning outputs.

Both maps should be completed in a format ready for online distribution and use.

Package 2 of outputs: analytical studies to determine agricultural potential and spatial priorities of use
A soil map combined with other data layers could be used to produce a more detailed map of agricultural
potential. This could be done for a group of agricultural commodities or for selected high-value crops
such as oil palm. Two supporting studies are proposed:
         - Output 4 would delineate agricultural potential in a more general way.
         - Output 5 would delineate the most suitable areas for palm oil production.
The first output would be used as an input in macro-zoning for the PNAT and the SNAT. The second output
would become the foundation to prepare an investment guide for palm oil production.

Both studies can be carried out by the same consultant. The palm oil suitability map would build on
existing studies such as CIRAD’s and incorporate lessons learned from Gabon’s national land use plan (Plan
d’Affectation des Terres) and its delineation of potential palm oil areas.

The third study (Output 6) will explore new ways to delineate community lands. Such information can
then become the foundation for their zoning, for example in the PNAT and the SNAT. This would send a
strong message that such lands are essential to the Republic of Congo’s economic and spatial
development strategy.

The study needs to decide how to define community lands: it can focus on crop, livestock, and
agroforestry related uses; or it could be wider in scope and include community lands for indigenous
peoples (both in forest and savannah ecosystems). Likewise, the study needs to determine the scale and
accuracy of its delineation, which depends on the overall purpose. A national effort that seeks to improve
upon the PDSA’s 5-kilometer buffer around villages would rely on a different method and require fewer
resources than a map for local planning or for legal purposes. Such local planning and zoning can
successfully rely on participatory mapping to delimit land for local use such as cropping, fuelwood
production, hunting, and fishing areas.

Outputs 4-6 will require resources for stakeholder engagement and communication products. Output 7
earmarks resources for that.

Package 3 of outputs: proposals to strengthen zoning and classifications

                                                   95
It is proposed to use the improved baseline data and analytical maps to support zoning and classifications
of agricultural lands. The rationale for this is as follows:
      - Improved classification of agricultural land for different purposes can support macro-zoning for
         the SNAT and the PNAT. In the orientation law for land use planning, agricultural land is not listed
         as one of the key parts of the national territory such as forests, wetlands, and mining areas. This
         means that the law provides no opportunity to guide agriculture land use to more suitable areas
         and sustainable use with the help of a legally required master plan (les schémas directeurs de les
         parties du territoire) and associated guidance (orientation). Agriculture use, however, has been
         addressed in the SNAT of 2005 with the help of macro-zoning for crop and livestock production in
         each land use management zone (zone d’aménagement du territoire).
      - The PDSA’s macro-zoning was preliminary and envisioned completion of agricultural macro-
         zoning by 2015 and of micro-zoning by 2025. The plan encouraged more harmonized forest and
         agriculture sector plans and zoning, especially in savannah ecosystems, which are suitable for
         both agricultural purposes and reforestation efforts. Zoning for agricultural and forest purposes
         that is clearly delineated can facilitate land-use allocations, both for industrial agriculture
         concessions and for village land use.
      - Identifying the most suitable areas for palm oil production and identifying zones of preferred
         investments would address an important component of future agricultural expansion. It would
         also address one of the key drivers of future forest loss.

Thus three outputs to guide agricultural land use are suggested:
   - Output 7 is a map of proposed national agriculture use zones. It supports implementing Law no.
        25-2008 (agro-land regime law). The law classifies agricultural land into three categories: 1st
        category land (subsistence farming; fallow land, grazing land and paths); 2nd category land
        (intended for intensive farming of food crops, farming, or livestock cooperatives; land for
        commercial or industrial use of perennial crop plantations); 3rd category land (land reserved
        specifically for forestry or mining).
   - Output 8 is a national map with proposed macro-zoning for agriculture and zoning for community
        lands.
   - Output 9 is a proposed map for zoning of palm oil production and associated investment guide.

Package 4 of outputs: draft reference map for agriculture and palm oil investment guide
Output 10 is a proposed agriculture reference map. The map would combine information from the various
zoning proposals explored above (Output 7-9). Such a reference would facilitate spatial planning across
all sectors and help to lower transaction costs to allocate land. Government agencies in various sectors
can base their plans on an agreed-upon reference. Companies would have greater certainty in their
operations about the status of the land and the associated rules.

Creating an agriculture reference map is both a technical and political process (Output 10). It will require
time and resources for stakeholder engagement and communication support (Output 11).

The orientation law for land use planning is expected to provide the necessary impetus to create such a
map, as will be MAT-DGGT’s effort to advance the PNAT and the SNAT. However, there is not sufficient
information to determine how quickly political issues can be addressed to create a final officially approved
reference map. It is therefore assumed that a final draft of Output 10 can be prepared with stakeholder
contributions within the planned time frame – this will be sufficient to support the PNAT and SNAT outputs
envisioned in this roadmap.


                                                     96
The final output of the validation process would be the administrative sign-off on the reference guide and
investment guide (Output 12 Reference map for agriculture; Output 13 Investment guide for palm oil).
This separate sign-off may not be required, if the agricultural zoning maps discussed above are
incorporated sufficiently in the PNAT and the SNAT, and if their technical and political processes advance
quickly.

4.2.3 Mining Sector

Rationale for proposed activities and outputs

Link to existing sector planning. Institutions in the mining sector are building their capacity on mining
concession data, geological maps, and geological information management. These efforts are the starting
point to strengthen spatial planning.

Objectives of the proposed work. The proposed activities to strengthen land use planning in the mining
sector are narrow in focus. They address mining as a driver of new infrastructure investments such as
roads and railroads, which in turn can affect indirectly land and resource use of large geographic areas.
The first objective is to make up-to-date and accurate mining concession data and geological survey
information available to all government sectors. The second objective is to prepare an analytical study
with associated maps on infrastructure options and areas for biodiversity offsets. These maps can inform
both the PNAT and the SNAT. Influencing the spatial priorities established in the SNAT is especially
important because of its emphasis on investments in transport and energy infrastructure and other
government services.

Timing of the proposed work. This technical work in the mining sector does not have to wait for progress
at multi-sectoral level (e.g., revision of the SNAT; code d’aménagement du territoire), but will require
information on infrastructure and biodiversity (see proposed activities in section 4.2.4). If the technical
study in the mining sector is completed within 12 to 18 months, it can contribute to the envisioned multi-
sectoral planning outputs.

Envisioned lead institutions. The proposed lead institutions are the Ministère des Mines et de la Géologie
– MMG and the Centre de Recherche Géologique et Minière – CRGM. They are envisioned to work closely
with MAT-DGGT. MMG, CRGM, MAT-DGGT, and most likely CNIAF, would collaborate on a joint set of
maps for a land use GIS and also establish partnerships with relevant institutions working on transport
and energy infrastructure and on biodiversity conservation.

Proposed packages of activities. Two major packages of activities are envisioned to strengthen mining
sector planning: the completion of consolidated databases and maps and the preparation of an analytical
study that identifies potential future mining areas and available options to route infrastructure and
designate land for biodiversity offsets areas. A map of potential mining areas and options for
infrastructure routing and biodiversity offsets are the ultimate outputs of the proposed work stream for
the mining sector. This map is envisioned to contribute to the SNAT and strengthen long-term spatial
planning for the mining sector.

Figure 32 gives an overview of the sequencing of major packages of activities and outputs (purple boxes).
Table 4 provides a summary of all outputs and a preliminary work plan. These outputs, organized into
two packages, are discussed in the next sections.

Package 1 of outputs: consolidated databases and maps
Three outputs will build better databases and maps that are expected to strengthen planning and
decision-making in the mining sector and support multi-sector land use planning. These outputs include
a mining concession database and associated land use GIS, public use data from exploration concessions,
and geologic maps and derived map products.

In addition, two more data and map outputs – updated information on energy and transport
infrastructure and areas for potential biodiversity offsets– will be relevant for the analytical study in the
mining sector. These activities are described in detail in section 4.2.4.

Output 1 is a consolidated mining concession database and associated maps. A 2014 review on the status
of geospatial data in the Republic of Congo indicated that the Ministry of Mines and Geology was
maintaining an internal database on mining concessions. An up-to-date, shareable database, ideally
online, would greatly facility planning in other sectors. In the past, both the PDSA and the SNAT from
2005 could not incorporate mining issues adequately because of a lack of up-to-date mining concession
information.

As part of this output, MMG, CRGM, MAT-DGGT, and most likely CNIAF, would collaborate on a joint set
of maps for land use planning. Their collaboration would result in a fully functioning land use GIS that
combines mining permits with appropriate baseline layers on geology and current land use information
from the multi-resources inventory (IFN). The GIS can also include data and map compilations envisioned
from the roadmap (e.g., infrastructure, biodiversity).

Output 2 consolidates public use data from exploration concessions and makes them available for land
use planning. Mining companies with exploration permits are compiling new data and map layers as part
of their reporting to the Mining Research and Prospection Service of the Ministry of Mines and Geology.
So far the data and map layers with unconfidential geological and mining data have not been combined
in a national database and are not available for dissemination.

Output 3 includes updated geologic maps. The 2014 review of geospatial data availability in the Republic
Congo mentioned that a new geological map was being created by ASPERBRAS in the north and by TOTAL
in the south of the country. TOTAL commissioned the French Geological Survey (BRGM) to produce seven
1/200 000 geological maps and one 1/100 000 map over three years, covering selected parts of the
country.

Output 3 also earmarks resources to evaluate the expected final spatial data sets from the geological
mapping effort and to create relevant maps for land use planning – selected geological map layers could
be relevant for environmental planning, hazard risk mapping, and land use planning. In other countries,
for example, national geological survey institutes have prepared important information products from
geological surveys. These derived map products play an important role in land use planning at various
scales. They include maps that support the siting of buildings and transport systems (based on detailed
topographic and geological maps) or identify mineral resource potential (e.g., construction materials,
metals, ground water), geo-hazards (e.g., flooding, landslides), and environmental risks (e.g., acid
drainage, radionuclide potential).

Package 2 of outputs: analytical study
Output 4 will use the data and maps from the previous outputs and combine them with information on
transport infrastructure (roads, rail, pipelines, and navigable rivers) and energy infrastructure and

                                                     99
information on areas for potential biodiversity offsets (see section 4.2.4). Combining these data will
support an analysis of mining areas and associated options for infrastructure routing and biodiversity
offsets.

The analysis examining the feasibility of different transport options to reduce the direct and indirect
footprint of mining could answer questions such as:
        - Where would it be possible to consolidate the routing of infrastructure and avoid negative
             impacts on habitat loss and biodiversity?
        - Which areas would be most suitable for an “offshore” approach to mining and how would
             that affect the choice and location of transport and energy infrastructure?
        - What options exist to obtain land for biodiversity offsets (this would be linked to the study
             assessing options for biodiversity and conservation areas – see section 4.2.4)?

The analytical study could be narrow in scope and examine one mineral and one region, for example iron
ore mining in the TRIDOM interzone (see Box 3). Alternatively, the scope of the study could be more
ambitious covering multiple minerals and include a comprehensive strategic assessment for the mining
sector (or an important mining region).

Such a strategic assessment would identify options to avoid or reduce cumulative mining impacts and
align planning for the mining sector with large infrastructure planning (e.g., road, ports, electricity).
Experience from the Strategic Environmental Assessment for the central Namib Uranium Rush region and
the Cameroon Strategic Environmental and Social Assessment (World Bank Mining Sector Capacity
Project) could be instructive when preparing the terms of reference for such a comprehensive assessment.

For this roadmap, it is proposed to carry out a technical study focusing on iron ore mining. It would include
some stakeholder consultation and be completed within 12 months.

4.2.4 Other sectors: biodiversity conservation, tourism, and infrastructure

Rationale for proposed activities and outputs

Link to existing sector planning. Increasing spatial planning capacity in support of biodiversity and
conservation objectives can build on data compilation and map production from the IFN and on local
conservation planning carried out by international conservation organizations and RoC partners. Mapping
of tourism potential can be linked to the efforts to develop a national strategy and master plan for
sustainable tourism (e.g., work by the comité du pilotage du projet de la strategie nationale et du
développement durable du tourisme). Linking transport and energy infrastructure planning to land use
planning and the SNAT is envisioned to build on national efforts such as the National Transport Plan (Plan
National des Transports – PNT).

Objectives of the proposed work. The proposed activities will strengthen biodiversity conservation,
tourism, and infrastructure planning at national scale. The objectives are to make these sectors’
information more readily available across government agencies and align the respective sector planning
efforts with the preparation of the PNAT and the revision of the SNAT. The outputs from each sector are
expected to strengthen the macro-zoning in the multi-sectoral plans.

Timing of the proposed work. All proposed activities for these sectors are envisioned contributions to the
PNAT and the SNAT and can start immediately. The initial compilation and map production for these

                                                    100
sectors can be completed quickly—ideally within a 12 to 18 months. Close coordination with the mining
sector is required to complete the proposed study on options for infrastructure routing and possible
biodiversity offsets areas.

Envisioned lead institutions. The lead institutions proposed for these sectors include: biodiversity
conservation (MEFDD); environment and tourism (Ministère du Tourisme et de l'Environnement- MTE);
transport infrastructure (Ministère des Transports, de l’Aviation Civile et de la Marine Marchande –
MTACMM); and energy infrastructure (Ministère de l’Energie et de l’Hydraulique - MEH / Société Nationale
d’Electricité – SNE). MAT-DGGT is envisioned to contribute in two roles to the proposed activities: as a
planner of infrastructure the ministry is directly involved in and as the overall coordinator of multi-sectoral
planning. In addition, international NGOs (e.g., WCS, WWF) planning conservation areas and companies
preparing forest management plans can provide relevant mapping and planning expertise.

Proposed packages of activities. The first proposed package of activities seeks to consolidate data and
create maps on biodiversity, habitats, tourism infrastructure, and transport and energy infrastructure.
Two analytical studies, a national assessment of biodiversity conservation and conservation priorities and
an assessment of new potential tourism areas based on available infrastructure and natural assets, make
up the second package. Package 3 seeks to translate the analytical work on biodiversity conservation and
develop a proposal for new macro-zoning for biodiversity conservation and biodiversity offsets areas. The
final, fourth package proposes activities to create a reference map of these macro-zones.

Figure 33 shows the sequencing of these major packages of activities and outputs (green boxes) and their
contributions to multi-sectoral planning. Table 5 lists all proposed outputs and a preliminary work plan.
These outputs, grouped into for broad packages, will be discussed below.

Package 1 of outputs: consolidated databases and maps
Three outputs are envisioned for the first year, covering the biodiversity conservation, tourism, and
infrastructure (energy and transport). These outputs focus on compiling existing data and information
and preparing summary maps for land use planning:
    - Output 1 consolidates habitat and biodiversity data and maps.
    - Output 2 consolidates existing tourism infrastructure data and invests in new data and maps to
         fill important information gaps to determine tourism potential.
    - Output 3 creates an updated infrastructure (transport and energy) database and maps.

Package 2 of outputs: analytical studies
Two analytical studies are being proposed. One advances macro-zoning for conservation and biodiversity
offsets areas, and the other creates more complete information on areas most suitable for tourism
development.

Output 4 takes the habitat and biodiversity data and maps from Output 1 to carry out a national study to
determine priority areas for safeguarding biodiversity and ecosystem services outside of the existing
protected area network. This would strengthen biodiversity and ecosystem management planning and
establish a foundation for better macro-zoning of biodiversity and ecosystem services in the PNAT and
the revised SNAT. The study would focus on key habitats, conservation corridors, protected areas, and

areas important for wildlife management and ecosystem services and cover all major ecosystems (e.g.,
forests, savannah, coastal ecosystems).

Output 5 is a study and associated maps of potential tourism areas. The maps would combine information
of current tourism and transport infrastructure with information showing the distribution of scenic
habitats, important wildlife areas, and other areas important for tourism-related activities.

Package 3 of outputs: proposals to strengthen zoning
The analytical maps from Output 4 can be used to propose a more formal zoning of land for biodiversity
and conservation purposes. Such zoning could include priority areas for sustainable natural resources
management (both in forest and savannah ecosystems), potential future conservation areas, and fragile
ecosystems.

Output 6 earmarks resources to develop such prospective macro-zoning for conservation and biodiversity
offsets areas. Output 7 covers stakeholder engagement and communication support to ensure the
validation of this macro-zoning.

Package 4 of outputs: draft reference map
Creating a reference map for macro-zoning of conversation and biodiversity offsets areas is both a
technical and political process. It was assumed that a final draft of Output 6 would be prepared with
stakeholder contributions within the planned time frame – a draft would be sufficient to contribute to the
PNAT and the SNAT envisioned in this roadmap.

The final output of the validation process would be the administrative sign-off on the reference map for
macro-zoning of conservation and biodiversity offsets areas (Output 8). This separate sign-off may not be
required, if the macro-zoning map is incorporated sufficiently in the PNAT and the SNAT, and if their
technical and political processes advance quickly.

4.2.5 Multi-sectoral planning

Rationale for proposed activities and outputs

Link to existing multi-sector planning. The proposed activities can draw from the experience with the
SNAT 2005 and the general outline for multi-sectoral plans sketched out by the orientation law for land
use planning.

Objectives of the proposed work. The objectives are to implement key components of the orientation law
for land use planning covering initially the national scale. This includes completing important multi-
sectoral spatial plans (e.g., PNAT, SNAT, plans for land use management zones) and putting in place
selected legal and institutional components envisioned under the orientation law on land use planning.
The final objective is to strengthen MAT-DGGT’s technical planning and process capacity to carry out and
coordinate multi-sectoral planning.

Timing of the proposed work. The proposed activities build on the sectoral planning efforts discussed in
the previous sections. Two assumptions on timing have been made: most of the data compilation, map
production, and analysis for key sectors can be completed within 12 to 18 months to support the multi-
sectoral planning process; the ongoing work on producing a PNAT, carried out under MAT-DGGT and
MEFDD leadership, will continue and segue into the SNAT revision.

                                                   103
Envisioned lead institutions. The lead institution for multi-sectoral land use planning is the Ministère de
l'Aménagement du Territoire et de la Délégation Générale aux Grands Travaux - MAT-DGGT.

Proposed packages of activities. The proposed activities seek to boost the government’s technical
capacity to produce maps and carry out spatial analyses, complete important multi-sectoral spatial plans,
and put in place selected legal and institutional components envisioned under the orientation law on land
use planning. The following five broad packages of outputs will be discussed in more detail:
    - Center for land use and spatial development planning.
    - National Land Use Plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres - PNAT).
    - National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma National d’Aménagement du Territoire – SNAT).
    - National institutions for multi-sectoral planning.
    - Aligned legal codes for land use and spatial development planning.

Figure 34 provides an overview of the sequencing of these five major packages of activities and outputs
(blue boxes). Table 6 lists the more detailed outputs and a preliminary work plan. The detailed outputs
for each of the five broad packages will be discussed in turn.

Package 1 of outputs: center for land use and spatial development planning
The orientation law for land use planning envisions a multitude of strategies and plans at national and
subnational scales. Good land use planning requires a comprehensive set of base maps at various scales,
analytical maps and online mapping tools for use within government agencies and public engagement,
and associated technical capacity to update such spatial data and apply them in land use planning.

Presently, there is no specialized technical unit within government focusing on multi-sectoral land use
planning, especially one that can deliver consolidated spatial databases, produce new analytical maps,
perform spatial land use analyses, and develop options of different land use scenarios taking the interests
of all economic sectors into account. Furthermore, there is no national repository that compiles all sector
and multi-sector plans (and associated maps), ideally in the form of an online platform that can be
continually updated and accessed by analysts and decision makers within and outside government.

It is therefore suggested to establish a land use planning center, either within a single Ministry or as a
shared center among multiple agencies. The exact terms of reference for such a center need to be aligned
or subsumed with two MAT-DGG efforts: the first is the ongoing process to obtain the political clearance
for a land use planning unit (Direction de la Géomatique) within the ministry, and the second is the effort
to establish a National Cadaster and a National Geomatics Center (Projet Etablissement du Cadastre
National / Centre National Géomatique). At the time of preparing this report, the terms of reference
outlining the objectives and envisioned scope of technical and human resources were not yet available
for this new unit and the center.

Over the long-term, such a unit would be in charge of the country’s reference maps and online atlases
related to land use and spatial development planning. Such a center could also supply analytical and
mapping services for subnational planning in the country, especially in the case where such capacity has
not been established yet locally or where such centralization can be more cost effective and faster in
product delivery.

                                                                                  106
Output 1 includes all efforts to set up such a center. This would cover activities such as securing political
buy in, establishing institutional, legal and financial support, seconding and hiring staff, and acquiring
computer hard and software.

The next two outputs build the foundation to create maps and carry out spatial analysis. Output 2 would
consolidate and set up all readily available spatial data and maps on the center’s system. This would
include data and maps from the national forest inventory (IFN) and other sector databases. In addition,
the center would commission a small set of missing baseline layers and maps for multi-sector planning.
They would focus on essential data and maps that can be obtained within 9-12 months (Output 3). In the
following year, center staff would closely collaborate with the already discussed analytical studies in the
forest, agriculture, mining, environment, tourism, and infrastructure sectors (Output 4). This
collaboration can be tailored to the specific circumstances in each sector and include:
     - Review of interim products prepared for the sector analytical studies.
     - Analytical contributions to support envisioned sector studies.
     - Final clean-up and consolidation of sector data and maps to be housed on the center’s computer
        system.

Output 5 and 6 would get the center involved in the work of finalizing a National Land Use Plan ( Plan
National d’Affectation des Terres – PNAT) and revising the National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma
National d’Aménagement du Territoire – SNAT). The scope of this involvement will depend on the skill set
and resources available at the center and the level of out-sourcing chosen for these two plans (e.g., with
the help of short-term consultants). A similar range of contributions for the center can be envisioned as
discussed above in its collaboration with the sectors (Output 4).

The final activities for the center would involve setting up an online platform for land use planning (Output
7) that can be used for data dissemination, communication of land use plans, and stakeholder
engagement. As soon as the final outputs from the sector studies, the PNAT, and the SNAT have been
completed, center staff would create an online atlas version of them. This work can be completed with
technical support from short-term consultants, but center staff would be responsible for long-term
maintenance of this platform.

Package 2 of outputs: National Land Use Plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres - PNAT)
The objective of the National Land Use Plan (Plan National d’Affectation des Terres - PNAT) is to achieve
a balance between different uses of land and avoid conflicts resulting from multiple assignments of the
same land for incompatible uses. A PNAT typically seeks to create synergies between broad type of land
uses, for example between biodiversity conservation, carbon storage, safeguarding drinking water
supplies, and eco-tourism. In cases where one land use results in negative impacts (e.g., cropland
expansion in natural habitats), different strategies are applied to either avoid an impact on most sensitive
areas (e.g., no large-scale expansion into intact, carbon-rich forests) or mitigate the impacts (e.g.,
encourage only small-scale cropping combined with agro-forestry in certain areas). A robust PNAT would
explore different land use scenarios for certain locations, solicit stakeholder input, and balance economic,
environmental, and social criteria to prioritize specific land use options.

The IFN project, as originally conceived, had a PNAT as a final output. However, multiple factors have
delayed its delivery. In July 2015, the lead assignment for the PNAT was officially transferred from CNIAF
(MEFDD) to MAT-DGGT.




                                                    107
Completing preparatory work, so that a successful PNAT can be achieved, is Output 8. This includes the
following general steps (some of which have been started, but detail on the process was not fully available
when drafting this report):
     - Set up an inter-ministerial committee. This committee would provide the political support to
        coordinate land use planning for all major administrative units and for the major sectors that are
        typical users of large land areas in the country. In July 2015, MAT-DGGT and MEFDD initiated an
        inter-ministerial working group advising on the PNAT. The role of this PNAT-specific working
        group is envisioned to be further aligned with broader efforts to set up new land use planning
        institutions under the orientation law for land use planning envisions (e.g., Comité Interministériel
        d’Aménagement et de Développement du Territoire, Conseil National d’Aménagement et de
        Développement du Territoire).
     - Set-up a technical working group that deals with the spatial and geographic analysis, spatial data
        compilation, and map production.
     - Set up a legal working group that covers the legal issues linked to land use and land allocation.
     - Determine the approach and method to carry out the PNAT.
     - Sign a memorandum that clarifies the respective roles of the PNAT and SNAT (see more detail on
        PNAT and SNAT objectives and interlinkages in 3.1.2). This was done, for example, in Gabon.

Output 9 covers the first half of the analysis envisioned for PNAT and is focused on current land use and
land allocations. This analysis would compile all the baseline information, use the data and the maps from
the IFN multi-resources inventory, and incorporate information from the analytical studies in the sectors
as they become available. An assessment of maps showing current land allocations (affectation des terres)
would follow and highlight some of the main challenges and inconsistencies of current land use and land
allocations. A final analytical step is the compilation of the legal information linked to these allocations
with an associated assessment.

The second half of the analysis is expected to look at future land use (based on various planning
documents and past land use trends). This is Output 10, which would develop case studies of different
land use scenarios for selected sectors and regions. These scenarios would seek to create greater
synergies between compatible land uses and avoid and mitigate incompatible land uses. Maps showing
different land use options (and ideally a description of their major associated costs and benefits) would
then become the basis for a comprehensive stakeholder engagement (Output 11) to determine preferred
land use options. Consultations may be required at multiple scales, for example at national and at various
subnational levels. The final step of the PNAT validation process would be the official administrative sign-
off on the plan.

Package 3 of outputs: National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma National d’Aménagement du
Territoire – SNAT)
The National Spatial Development Plan (Schéma National d’Aménagement du Territoire – SNAT) is a long-
term plan that seeks to ensure a balanced distribution of people, activities, equipment, and infrastructure
throughout the territory. It focuses on reducing spatial disparities across the country by investing in major
infrastructure and government services that could help achieve sustainable use of above and below
ground resources and diversify and grow the economy. A robust SNAT would explore various
development scenarios that take different demographic, labor, investment, and land use options into
account. Comprehensive stakeholder engagement and spatial prioritization of investments that balance
economic, environmental, and social criteria, all contribute to a stronger plan.




                                                    108
The orientation law on land use planning designates MAT-DGGT as the technical lead to develop the SNAT
through a participatory process. The SNAT is a 20-year plan that will be evaluated and reviewed every
five years. The law does not stipulate the specific technical approach and the scope of consultation
processes. The law does not refer to the Republic of Congo’s first SNAT from 2005, thus leaving
considerable discretion for MAT-DGGT to modify its approach for the SNAT revision.

It is assumed that revising the SNAT will commence once the sectoral studies are completed and the
validation process for the PNAT is underway. The maps from these efforts are an important foundation
to define land management zones (zones d’aménagement du territoire) and associated macro-zoning in
the SNAT. The general approach for the SNAT in this roadmap is similar to the sequencing of outputs for
the PNAT. Initial preparatory work is followed by analysis and scenarios (with stakeholder consultation),
then preparation of a revised SNAT and associated plans, and finally validation of the plans.

The preparatory work for the SNAT (Output 12) assumes that all required spatial planning institutions such
as the Conseil National d’Aménagement du Territoire and the Comité Interministériel d’Aménagement du
Territoire have been established (Outputs 16 and 17). Any other technical and legal working groups
required for the SNAT could build and expand upon the ones that were set up for the PNAT. Likewise,
most of the initial data and map compilation should be in place because of the PNAT.

When determining the approach and method for revising the SNAT, MAT-DGGT can use this preparatory
phase to learn from other countries’ planning experiences such as Gabon and Tunisia, Ghana and South
Africa, and Brazil. MAT-DGGT has multiple entry points to revise the SNAT process such as making
principles of sustainability more explicit, creating stronger links to sectoral plans, modifying the analytical
approach, and expanding the participation process (see more detailed suggestions in 3.1.4).

Output 13 includes analytical work and scenarios for the SNAT revision. They are discussed in turn.

The analytical work is envisioned to build on the PNAT maps. It is recommended to consider a case study
that explores new ways of macro-zoning going beyond the land use categories applied in the Republic of
Congo’s first SNAT. This could raise the awareness of decision-makers that new types of investments and
government services are needed, for example to support land managers in areas important for wildlife
corridors, the supply of ecosystem services, and tourism development (all of them outside of national
parks and other highly protected areas).

For example, much can be learned from Brazil’s zoning approach at state level, which has evolved over
many years. It combines both ecological and economic criteria, and takes land for indigenous peoples
into considerations. This has resulted in macro-zoning that clearly identifies possible agricultural
expansion zones, areas of agricultural intensification and consolidation of crop and pasture lands, buffer
zones for rural settlements, areas for sustainable natural resource management (both in forest and
savannah ecosystems), space for potential future conservation areas and protected areas, and fragile
ecosystems that are outside of the protected area system.

Such a new type of zoning could then influence, for example the routing of the transport network to
service new iron mining sites. Or it could provide guidance on the type of desired mining operation
encouraged in close proximity to high conservation areas and wildlife corridors, for example an offshore
approach of housing staff that discourages establishing new permanent settlements and land use change
within the mining concession.



                                                     109
The second half of the analytical work to produce Output 13 is the preparation of land use and spatial
development scenarios. In most cases and for many geographic locations, more than a single land use
option is possible. In addition, diverse stakeholders such as local communities or an agriculture investor
for biofuels prefer various types of land uses, infrastructure investments, and government services. This
is why countries often explore multiple socio-economic projections and different development scenarios
for a geographic area and then solicit stakeholders’ preferences for land use options and infrastructure
development in a SNAT. It is recommended that a similar approach is used for this roadmap.

Output 14 covers the preparation and completion of the SNAT, based on these scenarios. It includes
preparation of a Schéma d’Aménagement du Territoire and a Plan d’Aménagement du Territoire for each
land use planning zone (zone d’aménagement du territoire), as specified in the orientation law for land
use planning. In the SNAT from 2005, the Republic of Congo had eleven land use planning zones, but
modifying this number should be taken under consideration.

Output 15 earmarks resources for stakeholder engagement and communication support to validate the
revised SNAT and the associated Schémas and Plans. If the SNAT revisions includes eleven land use
management zones, region-specific consultations are most likely required.

Package 4 of outputs: national institutions for multi-sectoral planning
To implement the orientation law for land use planning, new institutions must be established. This
roadmap prioritizes the ones at national level. They can support the sectoral and multi-sectoral planning
efforts envisioned in this road map. Furthermore, they can be supportive with their endorsement of the
roadmap’s final outputs, which would facilitate a more successful implementation. Output 16 covers the
Conseil National d’Aménagement du Territoire, and Output 17 focuses on the Comité Interministériel
d’Aménagement du Territoire.

The main purpose of these institutions is sketched out in the orientation law for land use planning. As
part of this roadmap, detailed terms of references need to be developed.

Package 5 of outputs: aligned legal codes for land use and spatial development planning
The final set of outputs consists of assessments of the existing laws and rules for land use planning and
land allocation and seeks to put in place new codes and other guidance required under the orientation
law for land use planning. This includes:
    - Output 18, which is a supporting study to align legal codes to review the forest law, land laws and
         associated rules.
    - Output 19 covers the preparation of Schémas directeurs des parties du territoire. There are seven
         different types, which are most relevant for the sectors prioritized in this roadmap.
    - Output 20 and 21 covers the preparation of two Schémas sectoriels. The first is for tourism and
         environment and the second for transport (covering all modes of transport).
    - Output 22 is the preparation of the Code d’Aménagement du Territoire.
