    Box 1: Using GNI per capita for SDG Benchmarking


    GNI per capita plays a central role in the analysis. Its level is highly correlated with SDG indicators for several reasons, perhaps most impor-
    tantly due to the fact that GNI per capita is highly correlated with determinants of SDGs, including (i) per capita household incomes, parts of
    which is spent on items that contribute to SDGs (for example, on health, education, and electricity); and (ii) tax revenue, which contributes
    to the fiscal space for government spending in areas that, directly or indirectly, contribute to SDGs (most importantly, government services
    and infrastructure). Causality may also go in the opposite direction: the levels for different SDGs (for example, those related to health and
    education) may influence GNI per capita.
         Cross-country, constant-elasticity regressions are first used to benchmark current SDG outcomes—i.e., to assess whether a country is
    over- or under-performing for an SDG relative to its GNI per capita.a Hence, for individual countries, deviations from predicted SDG values
    may be viewed as an indication of how well a country does relative to its capacity to achieve outcomes and provide inputs (determinants).
    Instead of GDP per capita (a production measure), GNI per capita, an income measure, is used since it conceptually is more closely related
    to a country’s capacity to achieve SDGs.


    a   These simplified regressions are useful for current purposes (benchmarking and projections). However, they do not claim to sort out interactions between dif-

    ferent indicators, a difficult task given high degrees of correlation, lagged effects, complex time- and space-specific relationships, and data limitations. Tests of al-
    ternative functions indicated that the simplicity of the constant-elasticity function dominated any gains in fit for some SDG indicators with alternative functions.

    Box 2: Projecting GDP and GNI


    Aggregate growth projections covering most countries are produced by various international organizations, including the World Bank, IMF,
    CEPII, OECD, and IIASA, but also by most governments and other sources, such as Hausmann et al. (2011). From the projections, it is difficult
    to determine which source is most reliable. Moreover, given the fact that available sources only project GDP while this paper uses GNI data,
    we have to assume, for most countries quite reasonably, that projected GNI growth will not deviate substantially from projected GDP growth
    (both expressed in constant 2005 US dollars).a In any country case study, it is good practice to compare different projections and, if necessary,
    refine what is available.


    a   As indicated by the names of the terms, GDP is primarily a measure of production while GNI is an income measure, more specifically GNI = GDP plus net

    receipts from abroad of primary income (compensation of employees and property income). For most countries, the two measures are highly correlated; among
    low- and middle-income countries, they tend to diverge most strongly in countries where (net) FDI over time has represented a substantial share of total private
    investment, often in natural resource sectors, generating substantial profit remittances to the foreign investors. If additional information is available on how
    future GNI and GDP growth may differ for a country, then such information should be reflected in the GNI projections.

positive deviation reflects weaker performance for poverty but stronger performance for water access. The terms over-performance and under-performance are used
normatively; for example, with regards to the maternal mortality rate, a lower-than-expected rate is reflected as over-performance.
