    Executive Summary: A Road Map
    for Liberia
Introduction
Liberia had an estimated 4.3 million hectares of forests in 2011, comprising approximately
50 percent of Liberia’s landmass. These forests support very high levels of biodiversity,
provide a wide range of ecosystem services (for example, bushmeat, medicines,
construction materials, and charcoal), and generate employment and revenue from
commercial and chainsaw logging. Pervasive poverty and competition for commercial
land contracts for palm oil, mining, and forestry are threatening these last extensive
forest areas in West Africa. Encouraging inward investment while striking a sound balance
between different interests, respecting the legal and customary rights of local people, and
conserving biodiversity represents a major challenge.

This project focuses on the mining sector, which has the potential to become a significant
engine for growth and broader-based development. It explores the feasibility of
implementing a national biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia to help minimize adverse
impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services resulting from mining. This scheme
could overcome some of the limitations of project-specific biodiversity offsets and at the
same time provide an opportunity for the private sector to contribute to an underfunded
protected areas network. The project was funded by the World Bank’s Extractives for
Development Initiative (E4D) and Program for Forests (PROFOR).

Liberia is taking the progressive step of legally requiring mining companies to implement
biodiversity offsets1 to address the residual impacts of their activities on biodiversity after
the application of the mitigation hierarchy.2 This step includes current provisions contained
in some Mineral Development Agreements and the draft Mining Act (2014),3 which requires
compliance with the International Finance Corporation’s (IFC’s) Performance Standards.
However, this approach could result in a number of small ad hoc offsets that do not
necessarily respond to conservation priorities in Liberia and lack the necessary protection
to ensure their long-term sustainability. In addition, the capacity of resource developers to
effectively implement offsets is limited and constrained by numerous external factors.

A Liberian national offset scheme would entail the application of a common methodology
to ensure that conservation benefits are at least equivalent to biodiversity losses due
to mining investments. Mining company contributions would help secure biodiversity
assets in a nationally coherent manner, rather than on an investment-by-investment basis.
Responsibility for design, implementation, monitoring, and long-term management of
biodiversity offsets would be transferred from multiple developers to key government
agencies, with support from national and international conservation and development
partners.

The report is presented in seven chapters. Following the introductory chapter, chapter 2
discusses the conservation imperatives for Liberia and conveys a sense of the quality
and extent of biodiversity within Liberia. Chapter 3 describes the challenge of securing
conservation outcomes in Liberia as well as the prevalence of threats to biodiversity.
Chapter 4 discusses the potential for biodiversity offsets to help secure conservation
outcomes. Chapter 5 covers the legal, policy, and institutional framework in support of

     biodiversity offsets. Chapter 6 discusses the methodological aspects of implementing a
     national biodiversity offset scheme, together with the challenges of securing and effectively
     managing sources of funding. Chapter 7 summarizes the report’s suggested next steps to
     implement a road map for biodiversity offsets in Liberia. Details of additional information
     sources and reference materials are in the appendices.


     The Conservation Imperative for Liberia: Remarkable Biodiversity at Risk
     Liberia has a number of international and national designations relating to biodiversity. It
     is located within the Upper Guinean part of the Guinean Forest biodiversity hotspot, one
     of the most-threatened and least-protected forest ecosystems in the world. The Guinean
     Forest originally covered an estimated 1,265,000 square kilometers, but only one-tenth
     of the original vegetation remains (40 percent of this remaining forest is within Liberia).
     The Liberian forests are mainly within two large blocks, with evergreen lowland forests in
     the southeast, grading to semi-deciduous forests in the northwest. These forests contain
     exceptionally diverse ecological communities and distinctive flora and fauna.

     Liberia also lies within the Guinean moist forests global ecoregion. This is one of the Global
     200 ecoregions that harbor exceptional biodiversity and have been identified as global
     priority areas for conservation by the World Wide Fund for Nature. The whole of Liberia
     is included within the Upper Guinean forests Endemic Bird Area; Endemic Bird Areas are
     regions that harbor two or more bird species that have very restricted ranges and are
     identified as global priority regions for conservation by BirdLife International. Liberia also
     forms a key part of the Upper Guinean rivers and streams Global 200 freshwater ecoregion.

     Within Liberia, 25 Key Biodiversity Areas have been identified. These are places of
     international importance for conservation. The percentage of Key Biodiversity Areas
     in Liberia that are afforded protection is currently very low (8 percent), compared with
     neighboring countries in West Africa. Nine Important Bird Areas have been identified
     together with five Ramsar Sites, which are sites designated as Wetlands of International
     Importance. Two areas (the Nimba Mountains and the Cavalla Forest) have been designated
     as Alliance for Zero Extinction sites. The Nimba Mountains support the one remaining
     population of the endangered Liberian Nimba toad, and the Cavalla Forest has been
     designated because it is the only known site where the critically endangered Liberian
     greenbul has been found. However, it is not yet certain (pending DNA analysis) whether the
     Liberian greenbul is indeed a separate species.

     The importance of Liberia to the conservation of West African moist forest was highlighted
     as far back as 1975, and many surveys and workshops have been undertaken in the
     intervening years to identify a network of priority sites for conservation. In 1983 the first
     protected area, Sapo National Park, was designated. This was followed by the East Nimba
     Nature Reserve in 2003 and Lake Piso Multiple Sustainable Use Reserve in 2011. Collectively,
     these account for 3 percent of the landmass of Liberia.

     The Act for the Establishment of a Protected Forest Areas Network of 2003 committed
     the government to establishing a protected areas network covering at least 30 percent




x	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
of the existing forest area (about 1.5 million hectares). A Forest Management Suitability
Study conducted in 2007 identified 15 areas (including the existing protected areas) to
be included within the protected forest area network to ensure adequate representation
across species and ecosystems. The World Bank provided financial support for the
establishment of the network. The Consolidation of Liberia’s Protected Area Network
Project (COPAN), and the subsequent Biodiversity Conservation through Expanding the
Protected Area Network Project (EXPAN), aimed to assist in creating additional parks as
well as strengthening the capacity of the Forestry Development Authority (FDA), the agency
responsible for conservation.

Although progress has been made by increasing the presence of rangers and forest
guards in six areas, the gazettement of protected areas has been very slow as a result of
inadequate budget allocation, lack of alternatives for communities that depend on the
forests for their livelihoods, and other competing land uses. The FDA’s strategic plan
anticipates having six additional protected areas fully gazetted by 2017, and by 2020 the
plan envisages about 30 percent of forest land to be in protected area management. The
next park to be gazetted is Gola National Forest. The preparation of the gazettement
package for submission to the national legislature to enact a law establishing the new park
is in process as of 2014.

       Although no systematic surveys (with the exception of chimpanzees) have been undertaken
       throughout the country, data from recent and historic surveys suggest that many of the
       proposed protected areas (PPAs) that have been identified are still important areas for
       conservation, particularly given that a number of them (Gola National Forest, the
       Wonegizi Mountains, and Grebo National Forest) are transboundary habitats allowing
       migration of species such as the forest elephant. There is, however, a lack of rigorous and
       quantitative biological data sets for Liberia, outside of the protected and proposed protected
       areas (particularly with respect to flora), which are needed to inform conservation priorities.
       A national survey on chimpanzee abundance and large mammal diversity undertaken
       between 2010 and 2012 (Tweh et al. 2014), provides some insight into areas of importance
       for biodiversity outside of protected areas. An unpublished study (Junker et al., forthcoming)
       identified priority sites for conservation using data on chimp density, mammal diversity, and
       tree diversity. Some of these sites coincide with or overlap the PPAs but not all of them do,
       indicating that there are high biodiversity areas outside the PPA network.

       Extensive analysis of historical Landsat data at 20 meter resolution (Hansen et al. 2013)
       shows that deforestation of approximately 4 percent has occurred during the past decade.
       However, these data do not distinguish tree plantations from natural forest, so acquiring
       an up-to-date assessment of forest resources is important. Such an assessment is being
       undertaken using the new European Space Agency remote sensing data. With high-
       resolution imagery, the main types of forest (mono-dominant evergreen, swamp forest,
       semi-deciduous) should be easily distinguishable in a way that has not been achieved
       nationally in the past. This information could be supplemented by field surveys because
       existing sources of botanical information for Liberia are currently lacking.




         Summary and Recommendations

         The current proposed protected areas (PPAs) provide an excellent network of sites:  This
         network offers the potential for offsets spread around the country and includes a range of
         vegetation types and species. Such a network does not preclude the implementation of project-
         specific offsets outside of these areas if deemed more appropriate.

         High biodiversity outside of PPAs needs further consideration:  Areas outside of the PPAs also
         support very high biodiversity. Given that some of the original PPAs have been altered (Bong
         Mountain, West Nimba) or have been removed from the list (Wologizi), it would be valuable for
         the government of Liberia and civil society organizations to hold a workshop to consider what
         other areas might replace these lost sites.

         Updated assessment of forest resources is required:  Updated information on forest resources
         should be obtained using the new European Space Agency remote sensing data. This
         information should be supplemented by field surveys given that botanical surveys are lacking.

         Role for public-private partnerships in establishing protected areas:  Because of budget
         constraints, the establishment of a protected areas network has been very slow, and securing
         additional funds through a biodiversity offset scheme could speed up the process.




xii	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
The Challenge of Securing Lasting Conservation Outcomes in Liberia
Biodiversity conservation in Liberia is threatened by poverty, uncertainties over land
tenure, and competing land uses, particularly between commercial and community
forestry, mining, and agriculture. The PPAs are afforded very limited protection until they
are formally gazetted.

Liberia emerged from the civil war in 2003 as one of the poorest countries in the world,
with an annual GDP per capita of US$135 and a level of unemployment estimated to be
86 percent. Although Liberia has made progress, access to basic services continues to
be limited and almost two-thirds of Liberians live below the poverty line. The Liberian
economy has also been significantly affected by the Ebola epidemic. Poverty poses an
underlying threat to biodiversity because the livelihoods pursued by poor people frequently
degrade or destroy natural ecosystems. It is often difficult for people to transition to more
sustainable and biodiversity-friendly livelihoods. Bushmeat is an integral part of many
people’s diets, and one study estimates that the annual wildlife harvest in Liberia is one of
the highest per capita rates in Africa (Anstey and Dunn 1991).

Security of land tenure in Liberia is weak for many Liberians, and the civil war exacerbated
an already complex land situation. The administration of land in Liberia is hindered by the
absence of a national land registry and by unclear and outdated land laws. In addition, what
constitutes public land continues to be unclear. Historically all unregistered and untitled
land was considered “public land.” The Land Commission has been reviewing land rights
and laws, and in 2013 the Land Rights Policy was published. Implementation of the policy
could change the quantity and location of land owned by the government and therefore
available for allocation as concessions and possibly PPAs.

Accurate estimates of the amount of land currently deeded to communities do not exist.
Research by the Land Commission indicates that up to 30 percent of land is deeded
community land, although copies of original deeds are still being validated. Some deeds
originate with the issuance of aboriginal land grant deeds under the 1905 and 1929 laws.
However, 1956 also saw the passage of a Public Lands Law, reenacted in a revised form in
1973, which allowed the government to sell “government” land for US$0.50 per acre. In
exchange the purchaser acquired a public land sale deed. As with aboriginal land grant
deeds, public land sale deeds were not originally intended for communities to obtain fee
simple ownership of their lands. Nevertheless, some communities took advantage of this
law to obtain public land sale deeds for community lands.

Pilot work undertaken by the Land Commission suggests that at least one PPA is partially
covered by community deeded land (Cestos-Senkwehn). The Land Rights Policy suggests
that such areas could be called “Customary Protected Areas,” which are owned by the
community and must be conserved and managed by the community for the benefit of
the community and all Liberians. This may have implications for the current approach
to the establishment of the protected areas network. In 2013, the FDA requested all
parties holding forest land deeds to submit their documentation for legal consideration.
Land claims, some overlapping, for nearly 3.4 million hectares arrived at the FDA
for consideration. This represents almost 80 percent of the forested areas of Liberia.




	                                               Executive Summary: A Road Map for Liberia	      xiii
       This situation far outreaches the FDA’s mandate and capacity to address and is under
       consideration by the Governance Reform Committee.

       By 2012 more than 50 percent of Liberia’s total land area had been awarded for commercial
       land use contracts, largely dominated by transnational corporations. However, some of
       these concessions are not mutually exclusive and many mineral exploration licenses will
       never progress on to Mineral Development Agreements and result in the construction of
       mines. Nevertheless, concessions cover vast areas of land. The main concession-awarding
       entities are the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME), the Ministry of Agriculture,
       and the FDA. An interministerial concessions committee, which includes the National
       Investment Commission and the National Bureau of Concessions, has an oversight
       and coordination role. However, there is an absence of effective land use planning at
       the national or regional level and poor coordination between sectors, with the forestry,
       agricultural, and mining sectors largely operating independently of each other.

       Consequently, there are significant overlaps in the allocation of concessions. Numerous
       mineral exploration licenses, commercial agricultural concessions, Private Use Permits,
       and Community Forest Management Agreements (CFMAs) overlap the PPAs, and some
       commercial agricultural concessions appear to overlap each other. Procedural irregularities
       have also occurred relating to the allocation of CFMAs and Private Use Permits, which is
       addressed in other reports. The National Forestry Reform Law states that a Class A mineral
       right cannot be granted in a PPA unless there has been agreement with the FDA and FDA
       staff have written guidelines for maximum protection of the environment and sustainable
       management of the forest during exercise of the grant. It is unclear whether there has been
       any communication between the FDA and the MLME about these exploration licenses.
       There is no specific law that prescribes the procedures to be followed in the case of conflict
       between (or overlap of) concessions in different sectors of the economy. A conflict between
       concessions in the same sector is likely resolved by application of the common law rule of
       first in time, first in priority. The PPAs receive no recognition until they are formally gazetted.


       A Role for Biodiversity Offsets in Securing Conservation Outcomes
       Biodiversity offsets are defined as “measurable conservation outcomes resulting from
       actions designed to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising
       from project development after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been
       taken” (BBOP 2009, 4). The stated goal of biodiversity offsets is to “achieve no net loss and
       preferably a net gain of biodiversity on the ground with respect to species composition,
       habitat structure, ecosystem function and people’s use and cultural values associated with
       biodiversity” (BBOP 2009, 4).

       Biodiversity offsets are conceptually attractive, appearing to balance the needs of economic
       development with those of conservation. Despite theoretical and practical issues associated
       with offsets, they are becoming more widespread and in the context of Liberia offer an
       opportunity for the private sector to contribute to the PPA network, which is desperately
       underfunded.

       Various drivers have resulted in a number of mining companies in Liberia implementing
       or working toward the creation of project-specific offsets. These drivers include the



xiv	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
    Summary and Recommendations

    Greater clarity is required on potential overlaps between community deeded land and
    proposed protected areas (PPAs):  The implications of community deeded land being
    designated Customary Protected Areas under the Land Rights Policy should be clarified with
    regard to related rights and responsibilities.

    Implement a geographic information system (GIS) for allocating concessions:  A centralized
    GIS is urgently needed to support the accurate allocation and extension of forest, palm oil,
    mining, and other concessions. It is understood that the USAID Governance and Economic
    Management Support Program is supporting the management of concessions. The
    implementation of a GIS should be an urgent priority. Greater coordination between ministries
    is required until the GIS is implemented.

    Avoid further allocation of concessions in PPAs:  An immediate moratorium should be declared
    on the allocation of concessions within the PPAs until a land use plan has been developed.

    Avoid allocations of Community Forestry Management Agreements (CFMAs) in PPAs:  CFMAs
    in PPAs should be halted at least until the issue of land rights is clarified and a clear strategy
    with respect to community forests and protected areas has been developed and procedural
    irregularities are ironed out.

    Clarify the status of concessions affecting PPAs:  Although the Ministry of Lands, Mines
    and Energy has granted mineral rights that affect a number of PPAs, it is important to clarify
    whether the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) approved the granting of these mineral
    rights and issued appropriate guidelines. The National Forestry Reform Law states that a
    Class A mineral right cannot be granted in a PPA unless the FDA agrees and has written
    guidelines for maximum protection of the environment and sustainable management of the
    forest during exercise of the grant.

    Undertake integrated land use planning:  The lack of a comprehensive, integrated land use
    plan complicates the rational management of natural resources, while encouraging haphazard
    economic development.

    Undertake more work on alternative livelihoods and food security, particularly around new
    protected areas.

Development Agreements, and internal corporate policies.


A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme versus Other Mechanisms
The Ecosystem Marketplace released two reports outlining the range of biodiversity market
practices designed to reduce the adverse impacts of development on biodiversity, which
collectively can be referred to as compensatory mitigation measures (Madsen, Carroll,
and Moore Brands 2010; Madsen et al. 2011). Three broad categories of compensatory
mitigation programs were addressed: compensation funds, mitigation banking, and one-off
offsets. This section also considers aggregated offsets.

       Compensation funds are a mechanism whereby a third party (a government entity or potentially
       a not-for-profit) collects and administers fees from developers of projects that have detrimental
       impacts on biodiversity. The funds either go directly toward compensation for biodiversity
       losses or support more indirect biodiversity-related projects such as funding protected areas
       management or research. Compensation funds are fairly straightforward to implement.
       However, they are a blunt instrument: fees are often based on the amount of capital invested
       and take no account of the biodiversity value of the land affected. Given that most of the
       private sector investment in Liberia is foreign rather than domestic, this type of offset could be
       regarded as an additional tax and could have a chilling effect on inward investment.

       Mitigation banking and conservation banking emerged as a result of regulatory-drivers in
       the United States to mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts of development.
       Under the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act, anyone who destroys regulated
       wetlands, streams, or endangered species habitat in the United States must compensate for
       that destruction. They must either develop their own offset, pay in-lieu fees to a conservation
       organization to offset impacts, or buy credits from third parties that have already restored sites in
       the same region (for example, from a mitigation bank in the case of wetlands, or a conservation
       bank in the case of species). In general, they are complicated to implement (entailing significant
       costs), require a well-developed market infrastructure, and are dependent on a high level of
       capacity within regulatory and enforcement agencies. They have not been applied outside of a
       few developed countries and are not currently suitable for Liberia.

       One-off offsets (also known as project-specific offsets tend to involve developers (or
       their nongovernmental organization partners) setting aside and managing an area of
       land to compensate for loss of habitats or species to ensure “no net loss or a net gain in
       biodiversity.” Such offsets are becoming increasingly widespread worldwide, particularly in
       the mining industry. Although one-off offsets are an important tool for addressing significant
       residual adverse impacts of a project, they are not a panacea; nor are they necessarily the
       best tool for achieving conservation outcomes in Liberia. Because of the uncertainty around
       land tenure, competing land uses, and a rural population that is heavily dependent on
       forest resources, selecting offset sites that are politically, socially, and technically feasible
       to implement can be complex, costly, and time consuming. There are also high transaction
       costs that must be borne by each mining project developer.

       Aggregated offsets are offsets whereby a number of developers combine resources
       to compensate for the combined biodiversity impacts arising from more than one
       development project in a specific geographical area. Theoretically this could be excellent
       way to set aside larger areas. In practice however, individual projects are usually on different
       time scales making this problematic.


       Proposed Approach in Liberia
       For Liberia, a national scheme combining elements of conservation banking and
       aggregated offsetting is proposed. The advantage of this plan is that although Liberia is
       home to exceptional biodiversity, the range of ecosystems represented is relatively narrow.
       In practice, these two factors offer the potential to establish some form of biodiversity
       or conservation credits in advance of mining developments taking place, which resource




xvi	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
developers could then acquire to offset their activities if required to do so. The greatest
potential for establishing such areas lies within the PPAs that have already been through
a site-selection process based on their importance for biodiversity and other factors
important to their establishment. Many PPAs greatly exceed the potential area that could
be protected through a project-specific offset. Retaining large landscapes is of major
importance for certain key landscape species in Liberia, particularly forest elephants.

Having a national scheme provides an opportunity for the private sector to support the
protected areas network, reduce risks, and overcome the limitations faced by many current,
project-specific offset schemes, including the following:

◗	 Suboptimal selection of conservation offset areas is caused by uncoordinated, ad
   hoc approaches that are often dictated by proximity to or location within a mining
   concession.

◗	 Insufficient participation or ownership by governmental authorities occurs, especially
   where arrangements are negotiated primarily between large private firms and
   conservation nongovernmental organizations, but which may undermine the long-term
   viability of an offset area.

◗	 Costs of and delays in identifying offset locations: By linking to the PPAs network, these
   limitations can be overcome because the biodiversity and socioeconomic data will have
   already been collected.

◗	 Inability to address cumulative impacts: Linking to the PPAs network can potentially
   address the cumulative impact of multiple (including smaller-scale) projects.

◗	 Sustainability and longevity: Unlike potential project-specific offset locations, protected
   areas can only be converted to private land, customary land, or public land in accordance
   with a law passed by the legislature. In contrast, any other land that might be used for an
   offset has no certainty of long-term protection.

◗	 High transaction costs: Transaction costs can potentially be reduced, and outcomes
   improved, by using priority sites that are unprotected.


Addressing the Rights and Interests of Landowners and Local Communities
Much of Liberia’s rural population is heavily dependent on forests for their livelihoods and
ecosystem services. The establishment of protected areas could have adverse impacts on
local communities unless those communities who live in and around and are dependent
upon protected forests develop increased local capacity for sustainable livelihoods. The
gazetting process requires social impact assessments to be undertaken by the government
before an area becomes legally protected; such assessments have already been or are
being undertaken for the Gola, Grebo, and Wonegizi PPAs.

In general, the success of biodiversity conservation in protected areas is dependent on
and affected by a range of factors including location, how protected areas are created and

           Summary and Recommendations

           A national offset scheme that combines different elements is proposed:  Limiting the use
           of aggregated offsets to situations in which all biodiversity impacts must be established for a
           number of defined projects at the same time is impractical. For this reason, it will be combined
           with biodiversity or conservation credits.

           A national scheme offers certain advantages over alternatives:  Although project-specific
           offsets and compensation funds have merit, aggregated offsets combined with a simple form of
           biodiversity or conservation credit linked to the proposed protected areas network offers the
           greatest prospect for sustainable offsets that deliver conservation outcomes in the long term
           and help achieve conservation gains, presenting the potential for true additionality.

           In establishing a national scheme, careful attention needs to be paid to the human
           dimensions of biodiversity:  The emerging lessons of experience with establishing protected
           areas in Africa highlight the importance of the human dimension of biodiversity, and point to
           critical success factors that should feature in the choice and establishment of aggregated offsets
           and biodiversity and conservation credit areas.



         managed, the degree of local community involvement, the national policy governing the
         protected area, and the financial resource base of the protected area. An analysis of more
         than 100 case studies about conservation of biodiversity in national parks in Africa identified
         some of the key factors that underpin the success (or failure) of protected areas, including
         the following:

         ◗	 Effective consultation with and taking into account the needs of local people who
            depend on resources

         ◗	 Clear communication channels between park staff and local leaders, coupled with
            conflict- or grievance-resolution mechanisms and participatory monitoring

         ◗	 Density of guards (there is a strong correlation between conservation of biodiversity and
            density of, but not the capacity of, guards)

         ◗	 Security of land tenure and uncontested ownership of land in parks.


         Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework in Support of a National
         Biodiversity Offset Scheme
         As the sole agency with responsibility for managing the forest resources of Liberia, and
         given its mandate for establishing and maintaining a protected areas network, the key
         institution that would need to be involved in the creation of a biodiversity offset scheme in
         Liberia is the FDA. Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2003,
         attention turned to reform of the forestry sector. The aim of the reforms was to strengthen
         governance, accountability, and transparency, and to improve the sharing of benefits




xviii	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
from the forestry sector. Several development partners provided technical and financial
assistance to support the reform efforts; their assistance was coordinated through the
Liberia Forest Initiative.

The 2003 Act for the Establishment of a Protected Forest Areas Network required a
biologically representative network of protected areas to be established covering at
least 30 percent of the existing forest area, comprising about 1.5 million hectares. The
National Forestry Reform Law (2006) followed, providing the foundation for a revised
process for concession allocation and management, and the restructuring of the FDA. The
National Forestry Reform Law was supported by the National Forestry Policy, strategy, and
regulations. These supported a “3 Cs” approach, giving equal weight to the community,
commercial, and conservation aspects of forestry.

The Community Rights Law with Respect to Forest Lands (2009) aimed to empower
communities to engage fully in the sustainable management of forests in Liberia. The more
recent draft National Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management Act (2014)
includes a number of important provisions relating to biodiversity and protected areas.

Concern had arisen that the FDA’s progress on each “C” had been unequal, with significant
focus on commercial forestry. The alleged exploitation of both Private Use Permits and
CFMAs by commercial interests has fueled concerns that the FDA has a potential conflict
of interest in forest protection, given its role in facilitating commercial forestry and revenue
generation from forest resources. A commitment to change this focus appears to be
surfacing, with greater emphasis on community forestry and conservation, which will be
fundamental if the establishment of the protected areas network is to be realized and a
national biodiversity offset scheme is to work.

The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is responsible for coordinating, integrating,
and harmonizing the implementation of the Environmental Policy under the guidance of the
National Environmental Policy Council. The EPA would almost certainly have a significant role
in oversight of the scheme. In addition, the MLME would likely have a role in demarcating and
mapping any future offset areas that form part of the protected areas network.

No Liberian legislation specifically mentions biodiversity offsets; however, a range of
legal provisions help to underscore the conservation of biodiversity. For example, the
Environment Protection and Management Law (2002) requires the application of the
mitigation hierarchy as part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA)
process. The draft Mining Act states that all mining feasibility studies must comply with the
IFC Performance Standards. In addition, clauses relating to the IFC Performance Standards
are already being integrated into Mineral Development Agreements, which could provide
a legally enforceable anchor for mining companies to implement offsets. There is also an
opportunity to further clarify requirements for offsets under the regulations to be developed
by the FDA under the National Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management
Act (2014) (National Wildlife Law) for activities, including mining, that are either permitted
or prohibited in the various protected area designations. The legal framework and policy
environment support the establishment and sound management of a conservation trust
in Liberia.

      Despite having many committed staff, both the FDA and EPA are significantly constrained
      by the resources available to them, given that their respective mandates and legal
      provisions require them to fulfill a broad range of activities across the entire country. In
      addition, as a result of the emphasis on encouraging inward investment and avoiding
      barriers to development, agencies are sometimes hesitant to enforce existing laws.



        Summary and Recommendations

        Address capacity constraints within the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) and the
        Environmental Protection Agency (EPA):  Numerous studies and reviews have highlighted the
        capacity constraints within the FDA, as well as the tension between different elements of the
        3 Cs mandate. If a biodiversity offset scheme is to be successfully implemented in Liberia, this
        issue needs to be addressed.

        Specific capacity building around offsets:  Given that biodiversity offsets are a new concept in
        the context of Liberia and the approach under development is also new, capacity development
        will be required among the key line ministries and agencies, including the FDA, EPA, and to a
        lesser extent the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy.

        Review the status of community deeds and the establishment of protected areas:  If some of the
        PPAs are subject to community deeds and are not in fact public land, it is unclear whether the
        FDA can gazette them. If they were to be designated as Customary Protected Areas, it is unclear
        whether existing legislation would apply to them. These uncertainties need to be resolved.

        New legislation would be required if offsets were to be extended to other sectors:  Mineral
        Development Agreements and the draft Mining Act only cover the mining sector; the Environment
        Protection and Management Law would need to be amended for it to cover other sectors.

        The legal framework and policy environment support the establishment and sound
        management of a conservation trust fund in Liberia:  Liberian laws recognize trust as a
        contractual relationship enforceable when validly established; the country also has a dedicated
        statute on the creation and management of private foundations. There is a dedicated chapter
        of the Tax Code of Liberia on taxation of trusts. No Liberian law or policy precludes the
        government of Liberia or any of its agencies from establishing or contributing to a trust fund.

        Need to further clarify the implications of the proposed Conservation and Wildlife Fund:  The
        commitment in the draft National Wildlife Law (2014) to establish a Conservation and Wildlife
        Fund for the administration of protected areas, wildlife conservation and management
        activities, and enforcement of this Law is consistent with the proposed model for future
        funding of a biodiversity offsets scheme in Liberia. Because details of how the fund would
        operate are yet to be developed, it is unclear whether the proposed Conservation and Wildlife
        Fund could serve as the vehicle for funding the scheme.

        Need for honest reflection on the question of political will:  Given the past history of the
        establishment of a protected areas network in Liberia, the issue of political will is an important
        consideration that will require a level of introspection and honesty on the part of various line
        ministries and agencies.




xx	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Methodological Challenges and Approach to Implementing a National
Offset Scheme
The mining industry has spearheaded the development of project-specific biodiversity
offsets to reduce reputational risks or comply with international lenders such as the
IFC, the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD), and the African
Development Bank (AfDB), all of which have incorporated “no-net-loss” principles
for biodiversity into their investment safeguard policies. Measuring ecosystems and
species with a high degree of accuracy is extremely complex, especially within the given
time frame or budget of an ESIA. The methodology proposed here tries to balance
pragmatism against reluctance to create a one-dimensional metric that might not be
supported by stakeholders.

It is important that the ESIAs being prepared in Liberia include sufficient information
on biodiversity not only to assess risks and impacts, but also to determine the need
for an offset. IFC Performance Standard 6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable
Management of Living Natural Resources) requires companies to determine whether their
projects require offsets to address significant residual impacts on “natural habitats” and
“critical habitats.” It also requires companies to address ecosystem services as part of the
ESIA process. Ecosystem services cannot realistically be compensated for within a national
biodiversity offset scheme, particularly if the PPA is not within easy access of communities
whose access to ecosystem services has been adversely affected by projects. Instead,
the issue of loss of ecosystem services must be assessed as part of the project ESIA and
mitigated or compensated for locally.

The following offset methodology is proposed and will be developed further with
stakeholders in a workshop planned for 2015 in Liberia. (See figure 0.1.)

	 1.	 Prepare a habitat map of the project area identifying different vegetation types.

	 2.	 Determine the conservation significance of the site using the number of species
      of concern. The species could include those that are threatened (endangered and
      critically endangered and possibly vulnerable) and locally (and regionally) endemic.
      The conservation status of the ecosystem or habitat could also be included. For
      example, much of the unmodified habitat in Liberia might be considered critical
      habitat under IFC Performance Standard 6 criteria iv (highly threatened and/or
      unique ecosystems). Other criteria can be added but doing so inevitably adds to the
      complexity of the methodology.

	 3.	 Overlay a project infrastructure map to indicate the areas lost from direct impacts
      related to the mine footprint. The direct mine footprint represents the residual impact
      after incorporation of mitigation measures that influence direct impacts.

	 4.	 Determine the induced or indirect footprint of the project. A pragmatic approach
      would be to adopt a standard distance, which could be based on estimated
      “avoidance distances” for species of conservation concern. The determination of this
      distance should be scientifically based, taking into account stakeholder input.

        	 5.	 Calculate loss of habitat hectares based on the direct and induced footprint and
              conservation significance of the habitat affected. The conservation significance
              could be a multiplier depending on the value of habitat. These habitat hectares, or
              “multiplier hectares,” determine the number of conservation credits that a project
              developer must offset.

        	 6.	 To accommodate the “like-for-like or better” principle, a qualitative factor is designed
              to ensure that the types of habitats or species affected will also be represented at the
              offset sites. There would be a register of potential offset sites within the expanded
              protected areas network that describes all available information on the nature and extent
              of habitats and species represented. In addition to the list of species present, the register
              would also include information on population density estimates for charismatic species
              (if known). Ensuring that offset sites support the same types of habitats and species as
              those being lost is important, but some flexibility could be allowed.

        As stated above, this methodology and possible costs of conservation credits should
        be refined at an upcoming stakeholder workshop, planned for 2015. In general, the
        conservation credit cost would be based upon the investment and recurrent costs of
        properly protecting and managing an offset area.



xxii	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Institutional Roles and Responsibilities for Implementation
of a National Offset Scheme
As stated earlier, the FDA would play a central role in the creation and the day-to-day
management of an offset scheme in Liberia, with additional oversight from the EPA and
possibly the MLME.

The process of expanding the protected areas network will require in-depth engagement
with a wide range of interested stakeholders, including local communities. To overcome
the challenges relating to capacity constraints within the FDA and the inherent tension
between the agency’s twin roles of conservation and commercial exploitation of forests,
a project implementation unit could be established in the FDA with a mandate to work
solely on establishing an offset scheme or the scheme could be covered by the existing
REDD Implementation unit. In addition, an advisory committee could be established to
support such a scheme. It is extremely important that the arrangements for expanding and
managing the protected areas network embody the principles of good governance for
protected areas (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2013), which is detailed further in chapter 6, Legal
and Governance Aspects of Establishing a Biodiversity Offset Scheme.


Conservation Trust Funds
During the past two decades, conservation trust funds (CTFs) have been established in
more than 50 developing countries and transition economies. In most cases, CTFs are
nongovernmental, legally independent grant-making institutions whose primary aim is
to raise investment funds that enable them to grant financial resources for biodiversity
conservation. The type of expenditure supported by CTFs varies and includes covering part
of the recurring operational costs or capital investments to meet the objectives of individual
protected areas or the protected areas network as a whole.

CTFs can receive capital from multiple sources such as multilateral and bilateral donors,
governments, foundations, nongovernmental organizations, and individuals, as well as
from revenue-generating activities. Some CTFs have also benefited from the capital raised
through debt-for-nature swaps, in which a creditor country forgives part of the public
bilateral debt of a debtor nation in exchange for environmental commitments from that
country. The resources managed by CTFs are allocated through different types of financial
mechanisms.

One key advantage of establishing a CTF is that payments by mining companies in return
for biodiversity credits would go to an investment vehicle dedicated to the expansion
and support of the protected areas network, rather than to unconsolidated government
revenue. Another key advantage is that the revenue created from biodiversity credits
in isolation will likely be insufficient to support the expansion and maintenance of the
protected areas network. Although CTFs offer a number of potential advantages, they can
be administratively costly. As a first step, an initial review of other CTFs in Africa has been
undertaken (table 6.4). This review included a preliminary analysis of 12 CTFs established
in Africa listed in the 2012 Conservation Trust Fund Investment Survey, and the BIOFUND
in Mozambique, which is currently being established. The review showed that the principle
of establishing a CTF in support of an expanded protected areas network has a number of

          Summary and Recommendations

          Determining the need for a biodiversity offset:  It is important that the Environmental
          and Social Impact Assessments being prepared in Liberia include sufficient information on
          biodiversity not only to assess risks and impacts, but also to determine the need for an offset.

          A pragmatic methodology for calculating conservation credits is required:  A number of
          suboptions have also been presented (see chapter 6) that could be discussed at the next
          workshop.

          A project implementation unit could be established within the Forestry Development
          Authority (FDA) with a mandate to establish a biodiversity offsets scheme and related activities
          (such as gazetting of proposed protected areas). This could be separate from or included within
          the existing Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation unit.

          Establish advisory committee in support of aggregated offsets:  Although the FDA and
          Environmental Protection Agency must play central roles, there is merit in establishing an
          advisory committee representing organizations involved in conservation activities in Liberia.

          A Liberian conservation trust fund should be established:  This will enable revenues from
          mining companies and other sources to go to an investment vehicle dedicated to the expansion
          and support of the protected areas network, rather than to unconsolidated government
          revenue.

          Further work to understand costs to establish the national offset scheme and the scale of the
          fees that might be raised through the sale of biodiversity or conservation credits:  Further
          work is also needed to estimate the likely funds that could be obtained through the sale of
          biodiversity or conservation credits to resource developers in Liberia.

          The expansion of the protected areas network must embody the principles of good
          governance such as legitimacy and voice, accountability, fairness, and rights (Borrini-
          Feyerabend et al. 2013).



        precedents in Africa, which have attracted varying degrees of support. Further interviews
        with, and analysis of, the African CTFs with a significant focus on protected areas was
        also undertaken to supplement the limited public disclosure by many of these funds. The
        capitalization of the African CTFs ranges from US$4.4 million to US$57 million.


        Conclusion and Summary Road Map
        Implementing a national biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia will be challenging, and a
        number of different elements need to come together. However, some of those elements
        are already present. Liberia supports extraordinary biodiversity and has identified a
        representative network of PPAs over a period of many years. The challenges associated with
        establishing an offsets scheme would be greatly simplified by explicitly linking the offsets
        to expanding the protected areas network. Liberia also has a legislative framework that
        supports this process. The more significant challenges relate to the capacity of the FDA

and EPA to support such a scheme, the issue of land tenure, and the fact that alternative
livelihoods and food security issues are not easily solved and need to be addressed as part
of the process of gazetting new protected areas. The World Bank (or other development
partners) and civil society organizations can play a key supporting role in this process. The
next phase of this work will look into establishing a CTF and identifying potential pilot
sites. Figure 0.2 outlines the road map for a biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia. It groups
the various actions required to implement the road map into three interrelated categories:
(1) actions that generate information to enable the development of an offset scheme,
(2) actions that support the scheme through, for example, prohibiting certain activities or
enhancing rational allocation of concessions, and (3) actions that are central to establishing
the offset scheme.

xxvi	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
    1. Introduction
Project Background
The mining sector in Liberia has the potential to become a significant engine for growth
and broader-based development during the postconflict era. In recent years, the World
Bank and other development assistance agencies have invested considerable effort to
support the responsible management of the revenues that mining developments in Liberia
generate. However, recognition is growing that governance and institutional weaknesses
relating to the management of renewable natural resources may result in ineffective control
over potential adverse impacts of the mining industry on natural capital and ecosystem
services, and therefore on the livelihoods of dependent communities. Under these
circumstances, significant biodiversity loss is likely as a result of the cumulative impacts of
mining developments, even if the individual companies have the best intentions.


Project-Specific Offsets in Liberia
Liberia has taken the progressive step of establishing a regulatory requirement that
developers of mining projects implement biodiversity offsets1 to address their activities’
residual impacts on biodiversity after the application of the mitigation hierarchy.2 However,
individual developers negotiate offsets on an ad hoc basis, often without government input
or oversight, and the capacity of both resource developers and government agencies to
implement offsets effectively is often limited. This situation is exacerbated by the reality
that the quality of the biodiversity components of many Environmental and Social Impact
Assessments are poor, thus providing a weak starting point for designing offsets.

Over time, this approach is likely to result in a patchwork of uncoordinated offset areas and
practices across the country, and a lack of certainty for investors as well as for other affected
stakeholders, because the offset areas may lack the necessary protections to ensure their
long-term sustainability. As extractives and other projects are developed in a manner that
fails to compensate for irretrievable losses, biodiversity in Liberia will be progressively lost.
Given the extensive nature of the mineral, forestry, and agribusiness opportunities within
Liberia, the adverse consequences for nature conservation and communities with a high
dependence on biodiversity are likely to be significant.

Even where protection can be assured, the long-term benefits to biodiversity conservation
from a patchwork of efforts may be limited. This tactic also creates a recurring cost burden
for the government conservation agencies that will often be expected to manage offsets
that may not always align with national conservation strategies (for example, the National
Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan) over the long term.

Natural ecosystems in Liberia are under severe pressure from a variety of causes, including
shifting agriculture, bushmeat hunting, artisanal and commercial mining, commercial
agriculture, and forestry. Pervasive poverty in Liberia, along with the globalized demand for
commodities, are key underlying factors. The main challenge is to reconcile the different
visions for development, with community needs and conservation imperatives.

     A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
     This project was designed to explore the potential to implement a national biodiversity
     offsets scheme in Liberia to overcome some of the limitations described above and was
     funded by the World Bank’s Extractives for Development Initiative (E4D) and Program for
     Forests (PROFOR). A biodiversity offset scheme involves coordinated actions designed
     to compensate for the combined significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising
     from more than one development project in a country, after appropriate prevention and
     mitigation measures have been taken. The goal of such a scheme is to achieve no net loss
     (or a net gain) in biodiversity. Although this scheme focuses on mineral developments, it
     could provide a transparent mechanism for all private and public sector developments to
     offset adverse impacts on biodiversity in the context of an agreed upon, national, prioritized
     conservation and development plan.

     The biodiversity offset scheme would entail the application of a common, minimum, and
     transparent methodology for ensuring that conservation benefits secured are at least
     equivalent to biodiversity losses arising from a number of extractive investments. It would
     ensure that proceeds are applied to securing biodiversity assets in a nationally coherent
     manner, rather than on an ad hoc, investment-by-investment basis. It could transfer liability
     for design, implementation, monitoring, and long-term management of biodiversity offset
     assets from multiple developers to key government agencies (such as the Environmental
     Protection Agency [EPA], Forestry Development Authority [FDA], and Ministry of Lands,
     Mines and Energy [MLME]), with support from national or international conservation and
     development partners as appropriate. This approach would lead to improved transparency
     and economies of scale, while removing the developer’s obligation to engage in noncore
     activities. The availability of the scheme would also directly benefit private sector
     companies because the transaction costs for developing a well-designed offset capable of
     delivering biodiversity gains over the long term can be very high. The competitiveness of
     Liberia’s extractives sector would be enhanced, transaction costs for the public and private
     sectors would be reduced, and biodiversity offsets could be leveraged as an engine of
     inclusive green growth that supports explicit national strategies.


     Scope of the Report
     This report outlines a road map for the potential development of a national-level
     biodiversity offsets scheme in Liberia. It was prepared in close consultation with the
     relevant stakeholders, in particular the FDA, EPA, MLME, and other government agencies;
     mining companies; as well as local civil society. It was also informed by a multistakeholder
     workshop held in Monrovia in 2014, details of which are contained in appendix 2. The
     report explores the challenges of implementing an offset scheme in Liberia and provides a
     set of operational recommendations to address these challenges. The road map provides
     the analytical underpinnings and practical information that would facilitate the future
     development of such a scheme. The main focus is on mining because ore bodies are
     fixed in location and consequently mining projects have less flexibility when it comes to
     mitigating impacts on biodiversity, and an increasing number of mining companies are
     adopting “no-net-loss” biodiversity policies. However, the establishment of an offsets
     scheme would ideally be extended to large-scale commercial agriculture such as oil
     palm, as well as to public investments in dams, roads, and other infrastructure with major

impacts on natural habitats and biodiversity. The oil and gas sector is in its infancy, although
several companies are drilling offshore in a number of concessionary blocks. The road map
provides a set of operational recommendations to regularize the practice of biodiversity
offsets in the extractive industries sector in Liberia, but these recommendations are not
prescriptive in nature. Ultimately, the government of Liberia must exercise leadership and
decide how best to address some of the choices available, in concert with interested and
affected stakeholders and development partners.


Report Structure
Following this introductory chapter, chapter 2 discusses the conservation imperatives
for Liberia and conveys a sense of the quality and extent of biodiversity within Liberia.
Chapter 3 describes the challenge of securing conservation outcomes in Liberia and the
prevalence of threats to biodiversity. Chapter 4 discusses the potential for biodiversity
offsets to help secure conservation outcomes. Chapter 5 covers the legal, policy, and
institutional framework in support of biodiversity offsets. Chapter 6 discusses the
methodological aspects of implementing the scheme, together with the challenges of
securing and effectively managing sources of funding. Chapter 7 summarizes the report’s
main conclusions and suggested next steps to implement the road map for aggregated
biodiversity offsets in Liberia. Details of additional information sources and reference
materials are appended.

      2. The Conservation Imperative for
      Liberia: Remarkable Biodiversity at Risk
     Introduction
     Liberia is situated on the southwestern corner of the west coast of Africa, with a surface area
     of about 96,320 square kilometers (9,632,000 hectares) and a population of 4.294 million
     in 2013 (World Bank 2014). The country is bordered to the north by Guinea, on the south
     by the Atlantic Ocean, to the east by Côte d’Ivoire and to the west by Sierra Leone. It has
     four topographical regions at different altitudes, each with distinct physical features. Along
     the seacoast is the coastal plain, some 560 kilometers long. Inland from the coastal plain
     is a belt of inundated plateau followed by a belt of high land and rolling hills in the north
     and northwest, respectively. Most mountains are located in the northern part of Liberia
     and include the Bong, Nimba, Mano, Putu, Boni, and Wologizi ranges. Mount Wutivi
     (1,380 meters) in the northwest of Liberia is the highest peak.

     Liberia has an estimated 4.269 million hectares of forests,1 comprising approximately
     50 percent of Liberia’s landmass.2 These forests provide a wide range of benefits including
     ecosystem services (bushmeat, medicines, construction materials, charcoal), biodiversity
     conservation, and employment and revenue from commercial logging (some of which could
     be made sustainable).



     Overview of International Designations within Liberia
     A number of international designations that relate to biodiversity apply to all or parts of
     Liberia. These are summarized below.


     Biodiversity Hotspots
     Biodiversity hotspots are biogeographic regions with high levels of plant endemism
     (1,500 or more species as endemics) but that have lost much of their natural habitat
     (70 percent or more of natural habitat lost) (Myers et al. 2000). These areas have been
     identified by Conservation International as global priorities for biodiversity conservation.

     Liberia is located within the Guinean Forest of West Africa hotspot, which represents
     the West African (west of Benin) portion of the Guineo-Congolian forests and contains
     two main blocks that incorporate several major Pleistocene refugia. The Upper Guinea
     Forest Ecosystem extends from Guinea into eastern Sierra Leone, through Liberia, Côte
     d'Ivoire, and Ghana into western Togo. The Lower Guinea Forest Ecosystem extends
     from western Nigeria to the Sanaga River in southwestern Cameroon. The two major
     ecosystems are separated by the Dahomey Gap, a mixture of savanna and dry forest, in
     Togo and Benin.

     The Guinean Forest hotspot was originally covered in large part by tropical rainforest and
     extended an estimated 1,265,000 square kilometers. However, it has been dramatically
     reduced to a series of forest fragments. Overall, the region retains approximately
     126,500 square kilometers of closed canopy forest cover, approximately 10 percent of its




4	
original vegetation (Myers et al. 2000), and only a little more than 20,000 square kilometers
of the land area is found in protected areas (Critical Ecosystem Partnership Fund 2000).

The Liberian forests constitute approximately 40 percent of the total, approximately
141,000 square kilometers, of what remains of the Guinean Forest hotspot. The remaining
Liberian forests are mostly clumped within two large blocks, with evergreen lowland forests
in the southeast, grading to semi-deciduous forests in the northwest. These remaining
forest blocks contain exceptionally diverse ecological communities and distinctive flora
and fauna. Liberia is home to more than 2,000 flowering plants including about 240 timber
species, approximately 125 mammal species, 590 bird species, 850 butterfly species,
74 known reptiles and amphibians, and more than 1,000 described insects (World Bank
2010). The Guinean Forest hotspot is one of the most severely threatened forest ecosystems
in the world (and one of the least protected), with high levels of fragmentation and
degradation throughout most of the region. It falls within the globally richest 5 percent of
land area for threatened amphibians, birds, and mammals (Jenkins, Pimm, and Joppa 2013).


Global 200 WWF Ecoregion
Liberia also lies within the Guinean Moist Forests Global Ecoregion, which is one of the
Global 200 ecoregions that harbor exceptional biodiversity and have been identified as
global priority areas for conservation by the World Wide Fund for Nature (Olson et al. 2001).
This ecoregion comprises tropical moist broadleaf forests in a broad strip in West Africa
along the Atlantic coast from Guinea to Togo. It supports many threatened and endemic
species and is considered one of the world’s top priority regions for conservation because
of its high endemism of flora and fauna (Bakarr et al. 2004). Liberia is also a key part of the

Key Biodiversity Areas (KBAs) are places of international importance for conservation. They
are identified nationally using standard criteria based on their importance in maintaining
species populations. They are also large enough or sufficiently interconnected to support
populations of the species for which they are important. Liberia is home to 25 KBAs, as
illustrated in map 2.1 (Kouame et al. 2012). KBA identification in Liberia was built upon the
Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBAs) that had been previously identified, but was
supplemented using information on the presence of globally threatened species; restricted-
range species, using a threshold population of 5 percent or more of the population of
species with range sizes of 50,000 square kilometers or less; congregations of species that
concentrate at particular sites during some stage in their life cycles; and biome-restricted
species assemblages.

Even though these KBAs are of international importance for biodiversity, the number and
percentage of KBAs in Liberia that are afforded protection as part of Liberia’s system of
protected areas is currently very low (8 percent) compared with neighboring and other
countries in West Africa, which range between 22 percent and 88 percent protection
(table 2.1). However, the percentage of the land area of Liberia included within KBAs, at
54 percent, is high relative to other countries in the region.

     Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites
     Two areas in Liberia have been designated as Alliance for Zero Extinction sites (map 2.1).
     The Nimba Mountains in the far north of Liberia at the boundary with Guinea and Côte
     D’Ivoire have been designated an Alliance for Zero Extinction site because it includes one
     remaining population of the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) red-

listed critically endangered Liberian Nimba toad (Nimbaphrynoides liberiensis). The other
site, Cavalla Forest near Zwedru on the northern border between Liberia and Côte D’Ivoire,
has been designated because it is the only known site where the critically endangered
Liberian greenbul (Phyllastrephus leucolepis) has been found. However, it is not yet certain
(pending DNA analysis) whether the Liberian greenbul is indeed a separate species
(Phalan et al. 2013).


Centers of Plant Diversity (WWF and IUCN)
Centers of Plant Diversity (CPD) are sites selected by WWF and IUCN as global priorities
for plant conservation (WWF and IUCN 1994). They support high numbers of irreplaceable
or vulnerable plant species. Sapo National Park in Liberia is designated a Center of Plant
Diversity.


Endemic Bird Areas and Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas (IBA)
Endemic Bird Areas are regions that harbor two or more bird species that have very
restricted ranges (less than 50,000 square kilometers). These areas have been identified
as global priority regions for conservation by BirdLife International (Birdlife International
2004). The whole of Liberia is included within the Upper Guinea Forest Endemic Bird
Area, which covers 340,000 square kilometers of mainly lowland rainforest in Sierra Leone,
southeast Guinea, Liberia, southern Côte d’Ivoire, and southwest Ghana. This Endemic Bird
Area includes 16 restricted‐range bird species (BirdLife International 2015).

IBAs are identified on the basis of one or more of the following criteria: (1) holding
significant numbers of one or more globally threatened bird species; (2) being one of a
set of sites that together hold a range of restricted-range species or biome‐restricted bird
species; and (3) having exceptionally large numbers of migratory or congregating bird
species (Birdlife International 2013). Nine IBAs have been designated in Liberia, as outlined
in map 2.2.


Protected Areas and Proposed Protected Areas
History of Protected Areas in Liberia
The importance of Liberia to the conservation of the West African moist forest was
highlighted during a survey on the status of conservation of the biotic communities of West
and Central Africa, 1975–76, sponsored by the United Nations Environment Programme
and IUCN (Verschuren 1983). This was followed by more detailed surveys of the whole
country, between 1978 and 1979, by Jacques Verschuren (Verschuren 1983). At that stage
there were no formal protected areas in Liberia, although the National Forests were the
closest equivalent, despite being intended primarily for timber exploitation. Liberia’s
National Forests were established from 1953 onward by the Bureau of Forest Conservation
with technical assistance from the U.S. Agency for International Development. Ownership
and administration of National Forests lies with the government. They were designated
for permanent forest management and were largely uninhabited. Within National Forests,
agriculture is prohibited (especially shifting cultivation). The National Forest system currently
occupies an area of 15,107 square kilometers (map 2.3)

In 1976, the Liberian Forestry Development Authority (FDA) was created to manage and
preserve the country's forest resources. A year later, in 1977, the Division of Wildlife and
National Parks was formed. Based on the survey work from the mid to late 1970s, a series
of measures were recommended including, among others, upgrading areas of some
National Forests and some unclassified forests to National Park and Nature Reserve status.
An attempt was made to include as many different biomes as possible so as to ensure
adequate representation. By 1982, seven protected areas were proposed comprising three
National Parks (Sapo, Lofa-Mano, and Cestos-Senkwen) and four reserves, although these
were not intended to preclude future options for additional National Parks and reserves.
Of these, only Sapo National Park was formally designated, in 1983. It covered an area of
1,308 square kilometers east of the Sinoe River and south of the Putu Mountains.

A conservation priority-setting workshop convened by the Global Environment Facility
(GEF) and Conservation International in December 1999 brought together more than
140 expert conservationists, biologists, government officials, planners, and social scientists
from nearly 30 countries in a five-day workshop to reach consensus regarding the Upper
Guinea Forest Ecosystem. Liberia emerged as having five extremely high regional priority
sites, including prospective core areas such as Sapo National Park, Krahn-Bassa National
Forest, and the Grebo National Forest (map 2.4, shaded areas C1–C4). The Krahn-Bassa/
Sapo/Grebo/Taï complex was recognized as the largest tract of contiguous forest left in the
entire Upper Guinea Forest Ecosystem and represents the greatest opportunity to establish
and maintain protected areas containing large intact stands of forest. In addition, the Gola/
Lofa/Mano complex (map 2.4, A2) was also identified as extremely high priority for regional

      conservation. This complex represents a mix of lowland forests on the Sierra Leone and
      Liberia border and the westernmost extent of many plant and animal communities within
      the Upper Guinea Forest Ecosystem.

      A memorandum of understanding (MOU) was signed between the government of Liberia
      and Conservation International in January 2002. The MOU proposed seven conservation
      areas to form the basis of a Liberian protected areas network. In parallel, the Liberia
      Forest Re-assessment project began to assess forest cover and the protection, status, and
      management of key forest areas to develop recommendations to update Liberia’s legally
      protected forest areas.

      A number of field surveys were undertaken in 2002–03 (Waitkuwait, Sambola, and Samorgar
      2003), targeting the creation of four of the seven conservation areas proposed in the MOU.
      Much of that work was fauna related; however, two proxies for floral integrity were also
      chosen: intact forest cover across all major forest types (assessed from satellite images),
      and the existence of intact or virtually intact populations of faunal indicator species. These
      species were chosen to represent the complete range of undisturbed habitat types covering
      all major forest formations in the targeted areas (swamp forest, dry forest, forests at different
      altitudes, riparian zones, and gallery forest clearings).

      Further surveys were undertaken of seven areas of high conservation value between February
      and June 2005 (Sambolah 2005). This was a collaborative effort of Fauna and Flora International,
      the FDA, the Environmental Protection Agency of Liberia, and the Ministry of Planning and
      Economic Affairs. These areas included the forests between the Cestos River across to Sapo
      National Park, the West Nimba National Forest, the Northwest Zwedru (Cavalla) forest area,
      forests in Grand Kru County, the Lofa and Kpelle National Forests, the Wologizi forest block,
      and the Wonegizi forest block. The survey team concluded that as a result of the information
      obtained, the Gola/Lofa/Mano forest complex and Wonegizi and Wologizi forests should
      become National Parks. West Nimba Forest should be established as a Nature Reserve, and
      wildlife and protected areas corridors should be established for the Cestos-to-Sapo forests and
      the northwest Grand Kru forest. The Zwedru forest block should be established as a multiple
      sustainable use area. A rapid biological assessment was also undertaken of North Lorma, Gola,
      and Grebo National Forests in December 2005 (Hoke, Demey, and Peal 2007).


      Existing Protected Areas
      As noted above, the first protected area, Sapo National Park, was established in 1983. The
      approval of the Sapo National Park Act (An Act for the extension of the Sapo National Park)
      after the cessation of conflict in 2003 expanded the size of the park to 180,400 hectares
      (map 2.5), constituting an increase of more than 37 percent. The legislation recognized
      the park as being "at the core of an immense forests block of the Upper Guinea Forest
      Ecosystem that is important to the conservation of the biodiversity of Liberia and of West
      Africa as a whole" (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2003, 1). The East Nimba Nature Reserve,
      covering 13,500 hectares, was created at the same time (also by an act of parliament) to
      become Liberia's second protected area (map 2.5).

      The Lake Piso Multiple Sustainable Use Reserve was established in 2011, covering an area
      of 97,100 hectares. Lake Piso is an IBA and a Wetland of International Importance (Ramsar

MAP 2.5  Existing and Proposed Protected Areas in Liberia




	




Site). Collectively, the three protected areas account for 3 percent of the total land mass of
Liberia and 6 percent of the remaining forest area (map 2.5).

Proposed Protected Areas
A Forest Management Suitability Study conducted in 2007 identified 15 areas to be included
within the protected forest area network (table 2.2) to ensure adequate representation across
biological scales (species and ecosystems) and biological realms (terrestrial and freshwater
ecosystems). The total proposed network covered about 12,263 square kilometers of the
current forested area.

A prioritization process was undertaken at a Protected Areas Strategy Workshop convened
by the FDA in 2007. The numerous stakeholders present agreed on 12 criteria to select and
prioritize the different sites:

◗	 Species diversity, including normal biodiversity indices as well as economic and ethical
   values.

◗	 Threat level, including the main pressures, usually anthropogenic, that affect the area
   and number of threatened species and ecosystems.

◗	 Data availability, including biological and socioeconomic data.

      ◗	 Stakeholders’ involvement: Stakeholders’ participation and buy-in is crucial for the
         success of the protected areas network; level of support for the protected area from local
         authorities and communities.

      ◗	 Species vulnerability: Presence of threatened, endemic, or congregating species; of
         species with restricted ranges; of important species assemblages; of keystone and
         flagship species. Importance of the site for particular species.

      ◗	 Funding availability, will substantially increase the likelihood of achieving the objective of
         the protected areas network.

      ◗	 Connectivity potential: The effectiveness of the network in maintaining long-term viable
         populations of key species depends on maintaining natural processes such as migration,
         species movements, and genetic exchanges.

      ◗	 Population density: This criterion is directly linked to the level of threat to which the area
         is subjected.

      ◗	 Uniqueness3 or irreplaceability4: The protection of areas with unique or irreplaceable
         characteristics and values (biological, socioeconomic, and cultural) must be prioritized.



12	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
◗	 Land use potential: Because the protected areas network aims to reduce poverty and
   enhance people’s quality of life, areas with high potential to improve local livelihoods
   through the provision of goods and services should receive higher priority.

◗	 Security level: Liberia is emerging from many years of civil conflict, thus, security in and
   around the protected areas is an important criterion for prioritization. Security is an
   enabling condition for success.

◗	 Management capacity refers to the existing or potential capacity for implementing the
   protected area through active management.

In 2007 the government of Liberia requested the GEF through the World Bank to provide
financial support for the establishment of the protected areas network. The World Bank/GEF‘s
Consolidation of Liberia’s Protected Area Network Project (COPAN), and the subsequent
Expanding the Protected Area Network in Liberia Project (EXPAN), aimed to assist in
creating additional parks as well as strengthening the capacity of the FDA, specifically of the
Conservation Department, and the development of a Community Livelihood Program around
protected areas. Progress had been made on increasing the presence of rangers and forest
guards of the FDA in six areas as of November 2012, and the legal establishment of the Lake
Piso Multiple Sustainable Use Reserve in 2011 was a success.

However, the gazettement process has been very protracted owing to inadequate budget
allocation, lack of alternatives for communities who depend on the forests for their
livelihoods, and inadequate personnel. The next park scheduled to be gazetted is Gola
Forest, which extends into both Liberia and Sierra Leone. An MOU was signed with Sierra
Leone’s Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Food Security in 2011 to collaborate in the
joint management, research, and protection of the binational Gola Forest. The overall
objective of the MOU is to ensure the establishment of a Transboundary Peace Park
within the corridor of the Gola Forest in both countries to be managed by protected area
authorities and local communities. As part of the gazettement process to designate the
Gola Forest as a National Park in Liberia, stakeholder consultations were held in 2013 and
the preparation of the gazettement package for submission to the national legislature to
enact law establishing the new park is in process as of 2014. EXPAN has been extended
for another year, so it is hoped that the Wonegizi Range and Grebo Forest will also be
gazetted in 2015.

The EXPAN has experienced some challenges and constraints:

◗	 Encroachment on PPAs by other land use activities including alluvial mining and shifting
   agriculture has occurred. In addition, several mining licenses and concessions have
   been issued to individuals and concessionaires to prospect for or mine minerals and
   for commercial agriculture within PPAs (see chapter 3). West Nimba PPA has now been
   slightly affected by mining and has also been designated a Community Forest; Bong
   has been affected by a mining operation; and Wologizi appears to have been removed
   from the PPA network because it is important for iron ore. Taking into account the revised
   PPA network, the total area is in the region of 1,091,164 hectares (now 25.2 percent, not
   30 percent, of the total forested area in Liberia).

      ◗	 Inadequate budget allocation for forest conservation has hindered the completion of
         the establishment of the protected forest areas network. As a result of low budgetary
         allocation to the FDA, the recruitment and deployment of rangers and forest guards
         to protected areas has been delayed. Even in areas where the FDA’s presence is felt,
         personnel numbers, equipment, and budget for operating costs are inadequate to
         sustain operations.

      ◗	 Lack of economic alternatives for communities that depend on forest resources for
         livelihoods is an issue. Many communities around protected areas fear that they will be
         denied their existing livelihoods when the protected areas are established.

      ◗	 Inadequate personnel for forest conservation at the FDA undermines the establishment
         of PPAs.

      Appendix 1 provides a summary of the characteristics of each of the PPAs and the threats
      they face.


      Areas of High Biodiversity outside of Protected Areas
      Aside from a number of recent Environmental and Social Impact Assessments that have
      generated data on a piecemeal basis, there is a lack of rigorous and quantitative biological
      data sets for Liberia, outside of the protected and proposed protected areas, which are
      needed to inform conservation priorities. However, some survey work has been undertaken
      (for example, on iconic species) that provides some insight into areas of importance for
      biodiversity outside of protected areas.

      Between 2010 and 2012, the first nationwide survey across Liberia was undertaken to
      estimate chimpanzee abundance and large mammal diversity (Tweh et al. 2014). A
      team from the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany,
      systematically surveyed some 320 kilometers of transect lines. Their study demonstrated
      that Liberia harbors the second-largest population of West African chimpanzees (Pan
      troglodytes verus), and potentially one of the most viable. The study also showed that the
      many chimpanzees and some of the most species-diverse mammal communities in Liberia
      exist outside of protected areas and some of the proposed protected areas (map 2.6).

      Junker et al. (forthcoming) used Marxan, a spatial prioritization software, to identify suitable
      conservation areas using recent data from their research. Using information on chimp
      density, mammal diversity, and tree diversity, Junker and colleagues developed a list of
      priority sites for conservation. Some of these sites, but not all of them, coincide with or
      overlap with the PPAs, indicating that there are high biodiversity areas outside of the PPA
      network.

      Data from recent and historic surveys on the forest elephant (Blanc et al. 2007; Boafo and
      Massalatchi 2010; Anstey and Dunn 1991; Junker personal communication; Hillers et al.
      2013) suggest that the main concentrations are found in Gola (and possibly areas north of
      Gola), Wonegizi, Grebo, and Sapo. They are still present in the Cestos-Senkwehn PPA and
      possibly Grand Kru (map 2.7).

      Pygmy hippopotamus data (FFI and FDA 2013) suggest that the main concentrations
      are found in Grebo, forest areas to the west of Grebo, Gbi, Sapo, Putu Hills, Gola, and
      Wonegizi. It is also thought that pygmy hippopotamuses are present in the Cestos-
      Senkwehn PPA (map 2.8).

      Surveys undertaken in Cavalla Forest (no longer part of the PPA network) in 2013 noted
      11 species of birds that were of conservation concern (Phalan et al. 2013). Identified
      mammals and reptiles of conservation concern included the chimpanzee, western red
      colobus, and pygmy hippopotamus (endangered). It also included the sooty mangabey, the
      western black-and-white colobus, and Jentink’s duiker (vulnerable); and two near-threatened
      species (the leopard, which was last seen in 2008, and the bongo). The West African dwarf
      crocodile (vulnerable) was also present.


      Flora
      Liberia has a relatively homogeneous series of habitats, which is important with respect
      to offsetting into sites that are “like for like.” That is not to suggest that there is no
      zonation of vegetation types (along a precipitation gradient) or that there are no areas
      with higher levels of threatened species or endemism than other areas, particularly in a
      50–100 kilometer belt inland and in the montane areas of Mount Nimba and possibly Putu
      or Wologizi. In general, there is a north-south gradient in species richness, with the south
      being slightly higher in diversity (Poorter et al. 2004).




16	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Voorhoeve (1965) recognized evergreen forest types (mixed forest or mono-dominant) in
areas with rainfall greater than 2,000 millimeters per year; semi-deciduous forest (1,600–
2,000 millimeters per year); and an intermediate moist semi-deciduous type, straddling
these zones. Marshall and Hawthorne (2012, 2013) note the dominance of evergreen forest,
and a minor presence of moist semi-deciduous forest in both the Nimba area and the
Putu Hills. Other authors distinguish between hyper-wet evergreen, wet evergreen, moist
evergreen, and moist semi-deciduous and upper evergreen (above 500 meters) (Poorter
et al. 2004). The major environmental gradient underlying the vegetation types is rainfall.
Montane forests are rare and delimited at above 1,000 meters located in the west near
Mount Nimba. There is, of course, some differentiation within the forest where patches of
riparian and swamp vegetation occur as a mosaic within the area. Additional habitats, such
as mangrove swamps, occur in tidal and silty areas in lagoons and rivers. Littoral forest is
thought to still exist in some areas on the coast although they are extremely rare now, and
patches of edaphic savannah are also present, for example, in Wonegizi PPA. Hawthorne
and Jongkind (2006) use the limits of supposed indicators for forest types to propose the
limits of the various forest types (hyper-wet evergreen, evergreen, semi-deciduous) based
on herbarium collections (map 2.9).

Existing sources of botanical information for Liberia are lacking, and many recent
Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) are highly inadequate botanically.
The main data sets for Liberia were compiled for this study into a representative Liberian
plant record database, summarized in map 2.9 (Hawthorne 2014). Although not completed,

      this database indicates the trends of past data collection and the availability of these
      records to date. The data sets included Rapid Botanic Surveys by Marshall and Hawthorne
      (2012, 2013); the Wageningen database compiled from the university’s own collections
      (including those from recent ESIAs conducted by C. Jongkind); the database developed
      for the Ecosyn project, including records of Upper Guinea endemics from other herbaria;
      plus herbarium records from many herbaria compiled by taxonomists at Wageningen while
      preparing monographs since the 1970s; and records from Kew and the Global Biodiversity
      Information Facility and other ESIAs.

      This effort totaled 77,137 records of 3,906 plant species and shows that only about
      45 percent of all the grid cells in Liberia have ever been sampled. Of the cells that contain
      any records, 328 (about 88 percent) contain fewer than 100 species records. Only about
      1.5 percent of the cells have adequate botanical data for a proper assessment.

      Based on existing botanical data, conservation priorities include sections of Liberian coastline
      between the Cestos River and Côte d’Ivoire, connecting the very wet evergreen forests with
      the Krahn-Bassa forest and Sapo/Putu range more inland. Connecting Grebo with Taï National
      Park in Côte d’Ivoire was also seen as important. Special consideration should also be given
      to montane habitat Ziama/Wologizi range and Nimba (Poorter et al. 2004).


      Summary of Findings and Way Forward
      Liberia clearly supports very high levels of biodiversity, and a number of prioritization
      processes have been undertaken during the past 20 years to try to identify those areas that
      should be protected. Despite the slow progress of establishing a protected areas network,
      most of the PPAs still have integrity. There is still significant overlap between those areas
      that appear to be important for biodiversity and the PPAs. However, some of the data used
      has been spatially biased. The national chimp survey data has demonstrated that there is
      very high biodiversity value outside of existing and proposed protected areas (Tweh et al.
      2014), and it is worth maintaining some flexibility in establishing future protected area
      boundaries taking account of Junker’s (unpublished) prioritization process. However, many
      areas of high biodiversity value are allocated for commercial agriculture, logging, and
      mining (chapter 3), so the ideal range of flexibility may no longer exist.

      The implications for a constructive way forward arising from these findings are as follows:

      ◗	 Extensive data collected but botanical work limited: Many data have been collected
         on the PPAs from a biodiversity perspective, and in some cases from a socioeconomic
         perspective. The PPAs still represent some of most important sites in Liberia. It should
         be noted, however, that these sites are largely based on faunal data; very little botanical
         work has been undertaken. Ideally using both the new European Space Agency remote
         sensing data (available July 2014) and old data, forest types could be prestratified so
         that large blocks of apparently similar forest in similar landscapes would be grouped and
         prioritized based on levels of prior knowledge, with high priority cells being those with
         the highest likelihood of containing high-value vegetation or high uncertainty over what
         might be found. With high-resolution imagery, the main types of forest (mono-dominant
         evergreen, swamp forest, semi-deciduous) should be easily distinguishable in a way that
         has not been achieved nationally in the past. This imagery could be supplemented by


18	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
    field surveys. Patterns of and priorities for local plant use (nontimber forest products) are
    very important (Marshall and Hawthorne 2012, 2013) and should be addressed in support
    of any gazetting process.

◗	 High biodiversity outside of PPAs needs further consideration: Areas outside of the
   PPAs also support very high biodiversity. Given that some of the PPAs have now been
   altered (Bong Mountain is being affected by the China Union project, West Nimba
   is a Community Forest, Wologizi appears to have been removed as a PPA), it would
   be valuable for the government of Liberia and civil society organizations to hold a
   workshop to consider what other areas might replace these lost sites. As part of this
   process, opportunities to reinforce strategic wildlife corridors between protected
   areas could also be explored. This effort could incorporate the World Bank–funded
   remote sensing data from the European Space Agency that will provide more accurate
   information on the extent and broad status, type, or condition of vegetation cover.
   Other data sets could include information gleaned from the national chimpanzee survey
   and recent ESIAs.

◗	 Role for public-private partnership in establishing protected areas: Because of budget
   constraints, the establishment of a protected areas network has been very slow, and
   securing additional funds through a biodiversity offset scheme could speed up the
   process and minimize land use conflicts over the current sites.

◗	 Integrity of the current PPAs as basis for future offsets: The current PPAs provide
   an excellent network of sites that offer the potential for offsets spread around the
   country and include a range of vegetation types and species. This does not, however,
   preclude the setting up of project-specific offsets outside of these areas if deemed more
   appropriate.

          3. The Challenge of Securing Lasting
          Conservation Outcomes in Liberia
      Introduction
      Natural ecosystems in Liberia are under pressure from the livelihoods pursued by the rural
      poor, coupled with population growth and the globalized demand for commodities. Rural
      communities are directly dependent on forest resources for their livelihoods, particularly
      bushmeat, firewood, charcoal, medicinal plants, and subsistence agriculture. More recently,
      the natural resource base has come under increasing pressure as a result of commercial
      logging, plantation agriculture, and mining, with localized disturbances from alluvial gold
      mining. Striking a sound balance between different interests and encouraging inward
      investment into the country overall (as well as investment in rural areas) while respecting the
      legal and customary rights of local populations and conserving biodiversity will be a major
      challenge.

      Deforestation data over the past decade (Hansen et al. 2013) are illustrated in map 3.1.1
      Tree loss in Liberia since 2000 has been approximately 4 percent overall, clustered in a
      few places, such as in north Nimba County, at mines and other development areas, and
      along road and rail corridors. The key weakness with the data is that “tree cover” does not
      distinguish between natural forest and tree plantations, many of which were established
      before 2000 (the year the study began). The assessment is global in scope and focuses
      simply on tree cover, and does not attempt to consider conservation value. However, it does
      confirm the main, historically reported trends of forest cover (in National Parks and National


      MAP 3.1  Forest Losses and Gains (200012) and Current Extent of Forest Cover in Liberia

Forests on either side of a central Liberia “corridor”). It shows that even outside the main
National Forests, fragmented forest-like patches of tree cover exist widely across Liberia.


Key Threats to Biodiversity in Liberia
Prevalence of Poverty
Liberia emerged from the civil war in 2003 as one of the poorest countries in the world,
with an annual GDP per capita of US$135 and an estimated level of unemployment of
86 percent. Since then, Liberia has made some progress and was one of the 14 countries
that experienced the highest gains in the Human Development Index (HDI), now ranking
175 out of 187 countries. However, Liberia’s 2013 HDI of 0.412 is below the average of
0.493 for countries in the low human development group and below the average of
0.502 for countries in Sub-Saharan Africa (UNDP 2014). The government of Liberia has
embarked on a medium-term economic growth and development strategy, “The Agenda
for Transformation,” to guide development activities over the period 2012–17. It provides
the road map for Liberia’s transformation from postconflict recovery toward a long-term
vision of becoming an inclusive middle-income country by 2030. Achieving the Millennium
Development Goals, however, remains a daunting challenge for Liberia.

Poverty poses an underlying threat to biodiversity in Liberia because the livelihoods
pursued by poor people (agriculture, bushmeat hunting, charcoal-making, harvesting of
medicinal plants, and so on) frequently degrade or destroy natural ecosystems, and it is
often difficult for poor people to transition to more sustainable and biodiversity-friendly
livelihoods. Poverty in Liberia remains pervasive, particularly in rural areas. Despite the
intervention of donors and humanitarian organizations, access to basic services, although
improved, continues to be limited. Some 64 percent of Liberians live below the poverty
line (World Bank 2014); 68 percent of the rural population and 55 percent of the urban
population are extremely poor, with the highest incidence of poverty in the southeastern
counties of Grand Kru, Maryland, and River Gee, where the average is 77 percent. In
Grand Bassa, Margibi, and Rivercess, the average poverty rate is 59 percent. Households
countrywide spend 53 percent of their cash on food, primarily rice (World Food
Programme 2012).


Bushmeat Hunting
Bushmeat is an integral part of many people’s diets in Liberia. Livestock husbandry is
uncommon among households, who tend to rely on chickens and bushmeat for protein.
A number of studies have been undertaken on the extent of bushmeat harvest and
consumption in Liberia. Anstey (1991) estimates that the annual wildlife harvest in Liberia
was one of the highest per capita rates in Africa. The civil conflict from 1989 to 2003, and
the resulting collapse of the national economy, may have promoted the expansion of
the wildlife harvest. Other surveys estimate the total income generated from bushmeat
sales in Monrovia in one year to be US$8 million (CEEB 2003–2004). Hunting has been
reported as one of the main threats to wildlife, even near officially protected areas, and
in some regions, hunters may even specialize in killing chimpanzees. A bushmeat survey
reported 58 chimpanzee carcasses in a commercial hunting camp near Sapo National
Park (Greengrass 2011). Another study undertook surveys of and interviews with hunters


	          Chapter 3: The Challenge of Securing Lasting Conservation Outcomes in Liberia	      23
      in Nimba County, where 94 percent of the hunters agreed that animals are no longer
      abundant in the forest, with more than half of these hunters (56 percent) attributing this
      decline to intensive hunting (Bene, Gamys, and Dufour 2013).

      Some populations of forest-dependent animals have been reduced to such low levels that
      a number of them can no longer be considered viable. A study in one bushmeat market
      located in the Konobo District in northeast Liberia suggests that potentially unsustainable
      numbers of primates are currently extracted from Liberian forests to supply bushmeat
      demands in Côte d’Ivoire (Covey and McGraw 2014). Over a four-month period in 2009–10,
      the study’s authors counted 723 animals, including 264 primates. They estimated that a
      minimum of 9,500 primates are traded annually at this one location.

      A charitable foundation2 working in the Gola Forest proposed protected area (PPA) during
      265 days in 2013 confiscated 229 bushmeat bodies and found 233 spent cartridges. The
      Society for the Conservation of Nature in Liberia and the Liberia Self Reliance Initiative have
      done initial work on the feasibility of alternative livelihoods such as livestock rearing and
      fishpond development in four communities in the proposed park (Camp Alpha, Israel Town,
      Fula, and Gbanju). Although it is too early to say how successful the projects will be, early
      indications suggest that provision of alternative protein alone is an insufficient deterrent to
      bushmeat hunting. The livelihood options presented to communities by these programs
      cannot compete with incomes gained from illegal logging, the bushmeat trade, or diamond
      and gold mining in the parks and forest reserves.

      The UN Security Council (2013) states that the robust trade in weapons in Liberia is mainly
      driven by agricultural communities hunting for bushmeat in violation of the arms embargo.
      It also noted that international hunters are spending time particularly in the Gola Forest
      PPA. They were allowed to hunt any “bush deer”; this generic terms covers a number of
      endangered species, including several species of duiker.


      The Implications of Land Tenure for Establishing Protected Areas
      Tenure is a system of rights regulating the ownership or use of land. It can exist formally,
      inscribed in a legal document, or informally, as a result of orally established local property
      rights for which there is community-based consensus. Security of land tenure in Liberia is
      weak for many Liberians and the 14-year civil war exacerbated an already challenging and
      complex land situation. The administration of land in Liberia is hindered by the absence
      of a national land registry and by unclear and often outdated land laws. Many records
      were destroyed during the civil war, and numerous transactions have occurred with little
      reference to existing documents or previous transactions, leading to a situation of parcels
      of land being subdivided and sold with no accompanying adjustment to the original deed.
      In addition, there is a lack of clarity concerning what constituted public land. Historically, all
      unregistered and untitled land was considered public land. The result has been to weaken
      the government’s ability to effectively manage and use land as well as to create insecurity
      for customary and private land rights.

      The land law of Liberia consists of (1) a common law of land derived from U.S. common
      law and developed subsequently by judicial decision and statutes and (2) customary law




24	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
based on the practices of traditional communities and recognized by the Constitution
as governing land not governed by common law. Since its creation in 2009, the Land
Commission has been reviewing land rights and laws, and in 2011 the commission adopted
the World Bank–funded report “Reform of Liberia’s Civil Law Concerning Land” (Bruce and
Kanneh 2011). In 2013, the Land Rights Policy was published.

Implementation of the Land Rights Policy could change the quantity and location of
land owned by the government and therefore available for allocation as concessions and
possibly PPAs. This policy concerns four land rights categories (public land, government
land, customary land, and private land), and a cross-cutting subcategory called protected
areas. For public land and government land, the policy sets forth critical recommendations
regarding how the government transfers such land and how the government acquires
land, especially through the exercise of eminent domain (that is, forced acquisition). The
policy makes several significant recommendations with respect to the new category of
customary land: customary land and private land are equally protected; and communities
will self-define, be issued a deed, establish a legal entity, and strengthen their governance
arrangements to make them fully representative and accountable. This process will require
substantial changes to the existing legal framework.

Accurately estimating the amount of land currently deeded to communities, either as
fee simple ownership or as perpetual use rights, is challenging. Research by the Land
Commission indicates that as much as 30 percent of Liberia´s land area is deeded
community land, although copies of original deeds are still being validated by the
commission. Some of these deeds originate as far back as the issuance of aboriginal land
grant deeds under the 1905 and 1929 laws (De Wit 2012). Public land grant deeds were
also issued although they relate to use only, not to ownership. Subsequent regulations saw
community land rights changed from de facto ownership to formal use and possession
rights. The government continued this trend toward recognizing community use and
possession rights only with passage of the 1956 Aborigines Law. This law repealed previous
laws under which public land grant deeds and aboriginal land grant deeds were issued.
Those communities that did not already have deeds for their lands were reduced to Tribal
Reserves, granting them perpetual use and possession rights only.

However, 1956 also saw passage of a Public Lands Law, reenacted in a revised form in 1973,
which allowed the government to sell “government” land for US$0.50 per acre; in exchange
the purchaser acquired a public land sale deed. As with aboriginal land grant deeds, it
appears public land sale deeds were not originally intended to be used for communities
to obtain fee simple ownership of their lands. Nevertheless, some communities took
advantage of this law to obtain public land sale deeds for their community land.

As part of the Land Commission work, Sinoe County was used as a pilot to develop and
fine-tune the methodologies for land inventory and assessment to address a number of
challenges confronting the land sector (De Wit 2012). The results are presented in map 3.2.
It includes mainly (1) collective (or community) private ownership rights such as aborigine
land deeds, public land sale deeds, and public land grant deeds; and (2) enacted public
land such as existing and proposed protected areas. As can be seen, large sections of the
Cestos-Senkwehn PPA appears to be covered by community deeded land.

      The Land Rights Policy suggests that such areas would be called “Customary Protected
      Areas,” which are owned by the community and must be conserved and managed by
      the community for the benefit of the community and all Liberians. Customary Protected
      Areas may be established by the government upon request of the community or on the
      government’s initiative in collaboration with the community. Customary Protected Areas
      will not be sold, leased, or granted as a concession. Limited use rights may be granted in
      Customary Protected Areas to individuals, private entities, or the government only if the use
      is consistent with the land’s conservation and management for the benefit of the community
      and all Liberians. This policy may have implications for the current approach to the
      establishment of the protected areas network (see “Opportunity for a Biodiversity Offsets
      Scheme to Provide Support for PPAs”).

      Concessions can only be granted for public land, not private land. Hence, where a
      concession area encompasses private deeded land, such land is legally not part of the
      concession area. In such case, the concession holder has the option to either negotiate a
      private lease of the land or avoid use of the private land.

      In fact, nearly every concession agreement in Liberia contains a specific provision to the
      effect that if private land is within the area granted by a concession, the concessionaire
      is obliged to negotiate with the private land owner for lease of the land and that the
      government may assist the concessionaire if requested. If a private land owner refuses to
      lease or sell land needed to be allocated to a concessionaire for a public purpose (which


26	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
public purpose is easily satisfied just by fact of an investment on the land), the government
has a right to exercise eminent domain.

Recently, the FDA requested all parties holding forest land deeds to submit their
documentation for legal consideration. Nearly 3.4 million hectares of land claims arrived at
the FDA for consideration, some of it overlapping, representing almost 80 percent of the
forested areas of Liberia. This situation far outreaches the FDA’s mandate and capacity to
address and is under consideration by the government’s Governance Reform Committee.


Competition for Land and Overlapping Concessions
By 2012 more than 50 percent of Liberia’s total land area had been awarded for commercial
land use contracts (De Wit and Stevens 2014), largely dominated by transnational
corporations. It should be noted, however, that some of these concessions are not
mutually exclusive, and some of the mineral exploration licenses will never progress on
to Mineral Development Agreements and result in the construction of mines because
economically viable mineral reserves will not be identified. In addition, it appears that the
Private Use Permits3 that were so extensive until recently have now largely been rescinded.
Nevertheless, a large portion of Liberia is still allocated for some form of development.

The main concession-awarding entities are the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME),
the Ministry of Agriculture, and the FDA. An interministerial concessions committee, which
includes the National Investment Commission and the National Bureau of Concessions, has
an oversight and coordination role. Effective land use planning is absent at the national and
regional levels and poorly coordinated between sectors, with the forestry, agricultural, and
mining sectors largely operating independently of each other.

Consequently, there are overlaps in the allocation of concessions. Numerous mineral
exploration licenses, mining licenses, and commercial agricultural concessions overlap
each other and overlap with PPAs. Presently, much concession information is stored in
documents, and not on a regularly updated geographic information system (GIS) database,
making it very difficult for one concession-granting entity to know what the others are
doing. The lack of any real central repository makes it difficult to manage. Poor coordination
between different ministries that allocate concessions exacerbates this situation. In
addition, there is no public-land database that would allow the granters of concessions to
differentiate deeded land from public land.

No specific law prescribes the procedures to be followed in the case of conflict between (or
overlap of) concessions in different sectors of the economy. A conflict between concessions
in the same sector is likely resolved by application of the common law rule of first in time,
first in priority. The PPAs receive no recognition until they are formally gazetted.


Formal Mining
The MLME is responsible for administration of the mining sector. Early-stage exploration
requires a mineral reconnaissance license with a term of six months. Later-stage exploration
work during which significant drilling activities will be performed corresponds to a mineral
exploration license, with an initial term of three years and an optional renewal of two years.


	          Chapter 3: The Challenge of Securing Lasting Conservation Outcomes in Liberia	        27
      Mineral Development Agreements are long-term contracts assigning a company the right
      to develop a resource over a long period.

      Map 3.3 shows a mineral property map for Liberia. The total area under exploration licenses
      appears to be extensive and numerous mineral exploration licenses overlap the PPAs.
      However, as stated above, many of these licenses will not become operational mines.
      Desk-based research indicates that some concession holders have no online presence. It
      is possible that some companies purchased the rights to explore prospective areas, with
      no intention of exercising those rights but to later sell the rights to a particular area to
      organizations interested in undertaking exploration activities.

      Most of the mining companies that are currently active in Liberia typically have established
      some form of corporate environmental and social policy. These include ArcelorMittal’s
      Nimba iron ore project, Russia’s Severstal Resources (which has acquired rights to develop
      the Putu iron ore project), Vedanta Resources (developing the Western Cluster iron ore
      projects), China Union (developing the Bong project), Aureus Mining (constructing the New
      Liberty mine located within the Bea Mountain mining license), Hummingbird Resources
      (developing the Dugbe gold project), and Cavalla Resource Ltd (owned by Jonah Capital,
      developing the Buchanan iron ore project). Some of these companies are looking to
      implement offsets as a result of International Finance Corporation lending requirements,
      their own internal policies, or requirements specified in their Mineral Development
      Agreements. Several have expressed interest in the concept of a national offset scheme.

Alluvial Gold Sector
Government control over the alluvial gold sector remains very weak. Poor infrastructure,
the remote border locations of many mines, and the underfunding of MLME personnel
make monitoring of the sector extremely difficult. Consequently, the illegal mining of
and trafficking in gold continues almost entirely unhindered. Although most alluvial gold
production takes place in southeastern Liberia, particularly in Grand Gedeh, River Gee,
and Sinoe counties, there is also significant activity in the Gola PPA. The UN Security Panel
visited Kawelehun and Fornor, remote villages deep in the Gola Forest, in June 2013, and
found large numbers of young men (many of whom had been former combatants from
both Liberia and Sierra Leone) involved in illegal gold and diamond mining, as well as drug
trafficking and bushmeat hunting (UN Security Council 2013).


Forestry
Timber concessions in Liberia are divided into four categories, Forest Management
Contracts (FMC), Timber Sales Contracts (TSC), Private Use Permits (PUPs), and Community
Forests (map 3.4). A Forest Management Contract is a 25-year concession allowing access
to up to 400,000 hectares for commercial timber harvests. Timber Sales Contracts are valid
for less than three years and reserved for areas smaller than 5,000 hectares. FMCs and TSCs
can only be established, by law, on land that does not include private land. A third category,
Private Use Permits (PUP), was rescinded in 2013. The original intention was to allocate
concessions to communities or local groups to harvest timber, but PUPs were subject to
misuse for commercial logging purposes.

As of July 2012, there were 9 FMCs and 11 TSCs outstanding (map 3.4), comprising
1.05 million hectares of forest. However, most of this area is not yet in operation. TSCs
are intended for conversion of degraded forest (Class 3.1) to plantations or permanent
agriculture, and allow the exploitation of all commercial species exceeding 50 centimeters
in diameter within a three-year period. This amounts to destructive felling of land in which
up to 80 percent of biomass may be removed. At the time of writing, no new FMCs and
TSCs are being issued.

Chainsaw logging is informal, unregulated, and unlicensed, yet employs up to 4,000 people
and supplies all domestic timber in Liberia, estimated to be as much as 200,000 cubic
meters of sawn timber annually. In Community Forests, the Community Rights Law with
Respect to Forested Lands (2009) provides for Community Forest Management Bodies,
Community Assemblies, and Executive Committees. Their authority only extends over
Community Forests. There was an increase in the number of concession applications from
logging consortiums to obtain Community Forest Management Agreements (CFMAs)
in 2012. These were principally designed to be small-scale community managed forest
resource permits. However, the governance of these CFMAs has been called into question;
published reports indicate that several CFMA applications have been submitted as
an alternative means for logging companies to obtain access to forests for large-scale
deforestation (Global Witness 2013). It is not clear which communities have requested or
signed CFMAs and what the implications are for PPAs. In the case of one CFMA, out of
36 villages, only 5 have direct access to the Community Forest. The UN Security Panel of
Experts noted a series of procedural irregularities that appear to contravene the Community

      Rights Law and its attendant regulations regarding the application process and procedures
      for companies to conclude such agreements (UN Security Council 2012).


      Commercial Agriculture
      Agribusiness in Liberia is concentrated in oil palm, rubber, and rice production. Substantial
      investments in oil palm have been made with contracts being awarded to Equatorial
      Palm Oil (EPO), Maryland Oil Palm, Golden Veroleum, and Sime Darby. Map 3.5 is not an
      accurate map of all of the palm oil concessions because the location and boundaries of
      the concessions could not be verified. The concession maps included within some of the
      contract documents are extremely difficult to read or are missing, and shape files are not
      always available. This makes it difficult to accurately assess the extent of overlap between
      concessions and PPAs or areas with high biodiversity value. This difficulty is exacerbated
      somewhat by the concepts of “area of interest,” “gross areas,” and “possible extension
      areas,” because the eventual final boundaries of the concession areas are not clear. In
      addition, although concessions are negotiated directly with the Liberian government, it
      appears that companies can extend the area of the concession by negotiating separate
      deals with local communities. Map 3.5 highlights the issue of overlapping concessions—
      Golden Veroleum’s concessions appear to overlap with those of EPO. In addition EPO’s
      “extension area” overlaps with the Cestos-Senkwehn PPA. Increased transparency within
      this sector is important for natural resource management in Liberia.

Summary of Findings and Way Forward
Biodiversity conservation in Liberia is threatened by a range of factors, including poverty,
uncertainties about land tenure, and competing land uses, particularly between commercial
and community forestry, mining, and agriculture. The PPAs are afforded very limited
protection from development until they are formally gazetted.4 This is clearly illustrated by
the granting of licenses by the government in recent years for Private Use Permits, mineral
exploration licenses, and oil palm concessions that overlap certain PPAs. The very slow pace
of gazetting of PPAs, coupled with the current lack of recognition of PPA boundaries and
status by a number of government ministries, means that portions of PPAs are at great risk
of being lost before they can be legally protected and brought under active management.

The implications arising from these findings for a constructive way forward are as follows:

◗	 Community deeded land and PPAs: Greater clarity is needed on the potential overlaps
   between community deeded land and each of the PPAs and the implications of the Land
   Rights Policy that such areas would be designated Customary Protected Areas. Although
   such areas “must be conserved and managed by the community for the benefit of the
   community and all Liberians” under the Land Rights Policy, the extent to which this may
   adversely affect or impede the process of gazetting PPAs is unclear. The extent of valid
   community deeded land in PPAs is unclear, and further work is required to complete the
   inventory by the Liberian Land Commission.




	          Chapter 3: The Challenge of Securing Lasting Conservation Outcomes in Liberia	          31
      ◗ 	 Implement a GIS for allocating concessions: A centralized GIS is urgently needed
          to accurately support the allocation and extension of forestry, palm oil, mining, and
          other concessions. Currently, there are large areas of overlap between competing
          land allocations—some of which also overlap with PPAs. It is understood that the
          USAID Governance and Economic Management Support Program is supporting the
          management of concessions through Concessions Information Management System
          (CIMS), an information communications technology system that should assist those
          involved in granting and managing natural resource concessions. The implementation
          of CIMS should be an urgent priority, and ideally, the data would be readily and publicly
          accessible.

      ◗ 	 Avoid further allocation of concessions in PPAs: An immediate moratorium should be
          placed on the allocation of concessions within PPAs until effective land use planning is
          in place.

      ◗ 	 Avoid allocations of CFMAs in PPAs until the issue of land rights is clarified and there is
          a clear strategy with respect to Community Forests and protected areas, and procedural
          irregularities are ironed out.

      ◗ 	 Clarify the status of concessions affecting PPAs: The MLME has granted mineral rights
          that affect a number of PPAs, but it is important to clarify whether the FDA approved the
          granting of these mineral rights and issued appropriate guidelines. The National Forestry
          Reform Law (see “Forestry Development Authority and Related Legislation and Policy”
          in chapter 5) states that Class A mineral rights cannot be granted in PPAs unless there
          has been agreement with the FDA and FDA staff have developed and written guidelines
          for maximum protection of the environment and sustainable management of the forest
          during exercise of the grant.

      ◗ 	 Integrated land use planning: The lack of a comprehensive, integrated land use plan
          complicates the rational management of natural resources while encouraging haphazard
          economic development; it also encourages ad hoc decision making by various line
          ministries that are not integrated. In the ideal, such a land use plan would be created.

      	 4.	 One exception is that Class B or C Mineral Rights cannot be awarded in PPAs or protected areas.
            Class A Mineral Rights can only be awarded in PPAs if there has been an agreement from the FDA
            and FDA staff have developed and written guidelines for maximum protection of the environment
            and sustainable management of the forest during exercise of the grant. However, this has not
            prevented mining rights from having been assigned within some PPAs.

       4. A Role for Offsets in Securing
       Conservation Outcomes
      Emergence of and Drivers for Biodiversity Offsets
      Biodiversity offsets are conceptually attractive, appearing to balance the needs of
      economic development with those of conservation. Despite significant problems with
      both the theoretical and practical issues associated with offsets, they are becoming more
      widespread and in the context of Liberia offer an opportunity for the private sector to
      contribute to the protected areas network.

      The theory of biodiversity offsets has been supported and to some extent driven by
      the Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP), a multistakeholder initiative
      whose secretariat comprises Forest Trends and the Wildlife Conservation Society. BBOP
      defines offsets as “measurable conservation outcomes resulting from actions designed
      to compensate for significant residual adverse biodiversity impacts arising from project
      development after appropriate prevention and mitigation measures have been taken”
      (BBOP 2009, 6). The stated goal of biodiversity offsets is to “achieve no net loss and
      preferably a net gain of biodiversity on the ground with respect to species composition,
      habitat structure, ecosystem function and people’s use and cultural values associated with
      biodiversity” (BBOP 2009, 6).

      Various drivers have resulted in a number of mining companies in Liberia implementing
      or working toward creating project-specific offsets. These include the International
      Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards, conditions attached to government
      of Liberia Mineral Development Agreements, and internal company corporate policies.
      In addition, the African Development Bank’s Integrated Safeguards System (similar to the
      IFC Performance Standards) may be a stimulus for project-specific offsets in the future (see
      “African Development Bank” section in this chapter).


      IFC Performance Standards and the Equator Principles
      Although BBOP has led much of the theory and associated principles and guidance, it is
      the IFC Performance Standards (specifically Performance Standard 6 [PS6]: Biodiversity
      Conservation and Sustainable Management of Living Natural Resources) that have become
      the major driver of biodiversity offsets within industry for those seeking project finance
      or political risk insurance (IFC 2012). The application of PS6 is very site specific. However,
      “a biodiversity offset should be designed and implemented to achieve measurable
      conservation outcomes that can reasonably be expected to result in no net loss and
      preferably a net gain of biodiversity; however, a net gain is required in critical habitats”
      (IFC 2012, 42).

      In addition to the IFC, the Equator Principles Financial Institutions (78 institutions as of 2013
      [Equator Principles Association 2013]) have committed to follow PS6 for all relatively large
      projects in developing countries. Together with the IFC, they are responsible for some
      70 percent of project finance in developing countries.




34	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
In Liberia, one mining company is pursuing IFC financing and the IFC has an equity stake
in another company. Both companies are currently assessing whether they will need to
implement biodiversity offsets.


Government of Liberia and Its Ministry of Land, Mines and Energy
The Ministry of Land, Mines and Energy is increasingly attaching conditions relating to the
IFC Performance Standards and Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines to Mineral
Development Agreements. For example, Putu Iron Ore Mining’s Mineral Development
Agreement includes the following provision:

    [T]he Company shall conduct its Operations in accordance with Sections 8.1
    through 8.3 of the Mining Law, applicable law, the World Bank/IFC Environmental
    Health and Safety Guidelines for mining, the IFC Performance Standards on
    Environmental and Social Sustainability, the approved EMP and this Agreement.

A draft Mining Act1 (see “Do Legal or Policy Anchors Currently Exist?” in chapter 5)
proposes that all mining feasibility studies be required to comply with the IFC
Performance Standards, which could create a further driver for mining companies
to implement offsets.


African Development Bank (AfDB)
The AfDB adopted an Integrated Safeguards System in 2013. Operational Safeguard 3
(OS3)—Biodiversity, Renewable Resources and Ecosystem Services—adopts similar
language to that of IFC PS6. Specific objectives of OS3 are to “endeavour to reinstate or
restore biodiversity, including, where some impacts are unavoidable, through implementing
biodiversity offsets to achieve ‘not net loss but net gain’ of biodiversity” (AfDB 2013, 39).
In addition OS3 states that “for projects that are being developed in natural habitats,
modified habitats with significant conservation value, critical habitats or legally protected
areas, the borrower or client incorporates the best available science and engages
internationally recognised biodiversity experts in conducting the impact assessment and
in developing and implementing mitigation and management strategies” (AfDB 2013, 40).
Although no mining companies are looking to obtain AfDB financing at present, this may
become important in the future.


Corporate Policies
Individual companies within the mining sector are increasingly adopting “no net loss”
commitments in their internal policies and standards. A reported 15 companies from the
mining and aggregates sectors have adopted such a commitment and are implementing
offset-type measures (The Biodiversity Consultancy 2012), including Anglo American,
Barrick Gold, Hydro, Newmont Mining, and Rio Tinto. None of these companies are
currently active in Liberia.

      Potential for Offsets and Other Forms of Compensatory Mitigation
      to Address Conservation Challenges
      In 2010 and 2011, the Ecosystem Marketplace released two reports outlining the range of
      biodiversity market practices designed to reduce the adverse impacts of development on
      biodiversity, which collectively can be referred to as compensatory mitigation measures
      (Madsen, Carroll, and Moore Brands 2010; Madsen et al. 2011). Three broad categories of
      compensatory mitigation programs were outlined: one-off offsets, compensation funds,
      and mitigation banking. Some of the key features and characteristics of each are outlined in
      table 4.1 and briefly discussed below.

36	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
One-Off Offsets
One-off offsets or project-specific offsets tend to involve developers (or their
nongovernmental organization partners) setting aside and managing an area of land to
compensate for biodiversity losses resulting from a particular project to ensure “no net loss
or a net gain in biodiversity.” Such offsets are becoming increasingly widespread worldwide,
particularly in the mining industry.

Project-specific offsets are an important tool for offsetting significant residual adverse
impacts of a project, but they are not a panacea, nor are they necessarily the best tool
for achieving conservation outcomes in Liberia. Because of the uncertainty around land
tenure, competing land uses, and a rural population that is heavily dependent on forest
resources, selecting offset sites that are politically, socially, and technically feasible to
implement is a complex, costly, and time-consuming process unless there are available
sites within the concession. High transaction costs must also be borne by each mining
project developer, whereas there is scope for efficiencies and cost sharing among project
developers in a national offset scheme. Although a number of major mining companies are
either exploring or developing projects in Liberia (ArcelorMittal; Putu Iron Ore Mining, Inc.),
many mining companies in-country are junior companies (Aureus, Hummingbird). Typically
the larger companies only develop large-scale deposits, and these large-scale ventures
create a revenue stream that can support higher transaction costs. In contrast, many junior
companies may be jointly involved in developing projects with lower financial margins.


Aggregated Offsets
A number of developers may collectively set aside an area to compensate for the combined
biodiversity impacts arising from more than one project in a specific area; this effort is
known as aggregated offsets.

Although this approach has the advantage of creating a larger offset area, and retaining
large landscapes is of major importance for certain species, there are practical constraints
to establishing an aggregated offset if all biodiversity impacts must be established
for a number of defined projects at the same time. First, in practice, the timelines for
developments within the mining sector may differ markedly. The vagaries of the exploration
and development process are such that projects in a given region or country will typically be
on different timelines. So establishing precise impacts for a set of projects within a narrowly
defined time window is impractical. Second, if offsetting is a condition of either securing
project financing or environmental permitting, individual project developers will want to
proceed at a pace that meets their permitting, financing, and internal decision-making
processes. They will understandably be reluctant to be held hostage to a timeline that
accommodates several other resource developers.


Compensation Funds
A compensation fund is a mechanism whereby a third party (either a government entity or a
not-for-profit) collects and administers fees from developers of projects that have a detrimental
impact on biodiversity, to offset these adverse impacts. The funds can either go directly toward
compensation for biodiversity loss or be used to support more indirect biodiversity-related
projects such as funding protected areas management or funding research.


	                          Chapter 4: A Role for Offsets in Securing Conservation Outcomes	         37
      In Brazil, for example, Industrial Impact Compensation (or developers’ offsets) has been
      established under the National Protected Areas System Law (Federal Law 9,985/2000),
      which originally required project developers to pay 0.5 percent of the capital costs of
      projects to an environmental compensation fund to support the protected areas system.
      Following a Supreme Court ruling in 2009, the maximum amount payable is now set at
      0.5 percent, although regulations at the state level vary: in Rio de Janeiro, for example, the
      level of compensation ranges between 0.5 and 1.1 percent of capital costs (World Bank
      2012). In China, a Forest Vegetation Restoration Fee is payable by developers who affect
      lands zoned for forestry (required under the 1998 Forest Law of the People’s Republic of
      China). The funds raised in this manner are used by the government for tree planting and
      forest-restoration activities.

      In general, compensation funds are fairly straightforward to implement, and are not
      dependent on a well-developed market infrastructure. As a mechanism for raising fees that
      are based on the adverse impacts of development on biodiversity, the main advantage
      of compensation funds is one of potential universality (that is, they can apply to any form
      of development) and ease of administration. They can be structured as a mechanism for
      providing compensation for a range of different development impacts (not just mining)
      because fees could either be linked to the amount of capital invested or to the area of land
      being adversely affected. A further methodological refinement might take into account the
      quality of the affected ecosystems.

      However, a key weakness in the implementation of such funds is that they often lack a clear
      and transparent link between project impacts and biodiversity outcomes. For example,
      the Brazilian system takes no account of the biodiversity value of the land that is affected
      by development. Similarly, the scale of compensation in China’s system is dictated by the
      categorization of forested lands (for example, economic forest land), as opposed to the
      ecosystems affected.

      In many respects compensation funds are a blunt instrument. Fees based on the amount
      of capital invested are regarded as an additional tax. Given that most of the private sector
      investment in Liberia is foreign rather than domestic, this “tax” could have a chilling effect
      on inward investment. A further limitation of compensation funds is that they fail to create
      private sector enthusiasm for engagement in measures to address adverse impacts on
      biodiversity. They neither address nor could substitute for the basic requirements on some
      mining companies operating in Liberia to implement biodiversity offsets to rectify their
      project-specific impacts. Even if the responsible Liberian ministries were to agree that
      payments to compensation funds could be made in lieu of offsets, such a program may
      not satisfy lenders unless a clear link between project-specific impacts and conservation
      outcomes could be demonstrated.


      Mitigation Banking and Conservation Banking
      Mitigation banking and conservation banking emerged as a result of regulatory initiatives
      in the United States (respectively the Clean Water Act of 1972 and the Endangered Species
      Act of 1973) to mitigate and compensate for the adverse impacts of development. Under
      section 404 of the Clean Water Act and sections 7 and 10 of the Endangered Species Act,
      anyone who destroys regulated wetlands, streams, or endangered species habitat in the


38	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
United States must compensate for their destruction by either developing their own offset,
paying in-lieu fees to a conservation organization to offset impacts, or buying credits from
third parties who have already restored sites elsewhere in the same region (that is, from
a mitigation bank in the case of wetlands or a conservation bank in the case of species).
Mitigation banking has been an established practice since the 1980s; conservation banking
began in the early 1990s. Regulatory developments in 20082 created a preference for
third-party credits because of the economies of scale and ecological benefits that can
be achieved when large areas of habitat are restored in advance of impacts occurring
(Madsen et al. 2011).

In Australia, a number of state governments have instituted similar arrangements,
in part because there is no guarantee that project-specific offsets will be managed
for conservation or that there will not be pressure to develop the land in the future
(Department of Environment and Climate Change of New South Wales 2007). For example,
in New South Wales the BioBanking scheme addresses biodiversity values including
threatened species listed under the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995, and
provides for the establishment of BioBanks on private or public lands, including land to
which the Native Vegetation Act of 2003 applies (that is, where measures apply to ensure
the protection of native vegetation). Similar to the system in the United States, landowners
can sell the credits to provide income and fund future management of the site. Similar
arrangements for compensation for the loss of fish habitat have been instituted in Canada
under the 1986 Policy for the Management of Fish Habitat, which is an extension of the
Federal Fisheries Act. Although there is no provision for private habitat banks, a number of
provincial governments in Canada have created habitat banks as a form of compensation
for habitat loss.

Collectively, the various systems described above are categorized as “mitigation banking”
in the Ecosystem Marketplace reports from 2010 and 2011 (Madsen, Carroll, and Brands
2010; Madsen et al. 2011). A key weakness of these systems is that some of the schemes
have relied on inadequate metrics for biodiversity (for example, credits for habitats that
may or may not support target species), which results in a functioning market but delivers
questionable outcomes. In general, they are also highly complex to implement (which
entails significant costs), require a well-developed market infrastructure, and depend on
a high level of capacity within the regulatory and enforcement agencies that administer
and police such schemes. Outside of the developed countries where these systems have
been implemented (including Australia, Canada, Germany, and the United States), there
has been little uptake, although the South African National Biodiversity Institute is in the
process of piloting a wetland mitigation scheme as part of its Grasslands Programme
(SANBI 2013). On balance, therefore, they are not considered suitable for Liberia for the
foreseeable future.


Some Practical Challenges of Biodiversity Offsets in Liberia
Aggregated offsets are applied to compensate for known biodiversity impacts from a
number of already defined projects, whereas conservation banking establishes biodiversity
credits in advance, to offset losses arising from projects that may not yet be defined. In
searching for an approach that works in Liberia, it was felt that using elements of both
conservation banking and aggregated offsets was most appropriate.


	                        Chapter 4: A Role for Offsets in Securing Conservation Outcomes	      39
      One characteristic of most mining projects is that they take a relatively long time to advance
      from exploration to development, which allows some time to establish the nature of the
      biodiversity to be lost. The advantage of Liberia is that although it is home to exceptional
      biodiversity, the range of ecosystems represented is relatively narrow. In practice, these two
      factors offer the potential to establish some form of biodiversity or conservation credits
      in advance to support a national offsets scheme; resource developers could then acquire
      these credits. This plan overcomes some of the practical challenges outlined above. This
      approach would fall short of true market-based systems such as those in Australia and the
      United States, where the value of the biodiversity or mitigation credits may vary depending
      on the quality of the habitat protected as well as fluctuations in supply and demand.
      However, implementation of such systems is unrealistic in Liberia.

      Establishing areas in which biodiversity or conservation credits could be pursued, however,
      is complicated by the range of factors discussed in chapter 3. The greatest potential,
      therefore, for establishing such areas lies within proposed protected areas (PPAs). For the
      most part, PPAs have already been through some sort of site-selection process based
      on their importance for biodiversity and other factors necessary to their establishment.
      However, progress in establishing PPAs has been very slow. Linking a national offsets
      scheme to the PPAs could provide additional and important financial support to the
      establishment of PPAs in the long term. Further details on how such a scheme might be
      implemented are outlined in the following subsection (and explored further in chapters 5
      through 7).


      Opportunity for a Biodiversity Offset Scheme to Provide Support for PPAs
      Despite the enabling legal and policy framework for a protected areas network in Liberia
      and assistance from development agencies such as the Word Bank and conservation
      organizations over many years, there are currently only three protected areas in Liberia.
      These areas represent a very small percentage of the globally important forest habitat.
      Progress in gazetting the other proposed areas (table 2.2 and figure 2.5) has been slow for a
      variety of reasons. In the meantime, mineral, forest, and agricultural concessions are being
      allocated that encroach on these areas.

      Many of the PPAs greatly exceed the potential area that could be protected through
      a project-specific offset. Retaining large landscapes is of major importance for certain
      species, particularly forest elephants. Not surprisingly, numerous studies show that forest
      elephants move over large areas and are very sensitive to multiple access points into
      forested areas (Yackulic et al. 2011). The number of forest elephants throughout West Africa
      has declined dramatically overall, although there is very little quantitative data for Liberia
      outside of Sapo National Park.

      Having a biodiversity offset scheme would provide an opportunity for the private sector to
      support the protected areas network, reduce risks, and overcome the limitations faced by
      many current, project-specific offset schemes including the following:

      ◗	 Suboptimal selection of conservation offset areas: Because of uncoordinated, ad hoc
         approaches that are often dictated by proximity to a mining concession, project-specific
         offset areas are not necessarily optimal.


40	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
◗	 Insufficient participation or ownership by governmental authorities: Governmental
   authorities are not part of the process, especially where arrangements are negotiated
   primarily between large private firms and conservation nongovernmental organizations,
   potentially undermining the long-term viability of an offset area.

◗	 Costs of and delays in identifying offset locations: By linking to the PPAs network,
   limitations in identifying offset locations can be overcome because the biodiversity and
   socioeconomic data will have already been collected.

◗	 Inability to address cumulative impacts: Linking to the PPAs network has the potential to
   effectively address the cumulative impacts of multiple (including smaller-scale) projects.

◗	 Sustainability and longevity: Unlike potential project-specific offset locations, protected
   areas can only be converted to private land, customary land, or public land by a
   legislative act. In contrast, other land has no certainty of long-term protection.

◗	 High transaction costs: Transaction costs can potentially be reduced, and outcomes
   improved, by using priority sites that are currently unprotected.


Addressing the Rights and Interests of Landowners
and Local Communities
As discussed in chapter 3, much of Liberia’s rural population is heavily dependent on forests
for their livelihoods and ecosystem services. The level of bushmeat hunting is thought
to be one of the highest per capita in Africa (Anstey 1991). The gazetting of PPAs could
have adverse impacts on local communities, unless there is increased local capacity for
sustainable livelihoods of those communities who live in or around and are dependent upon
the forest. The gazetting process requires social impact assessments to be undertaken by
the government before an area becomes legally protected; such assessments have already
been or are being undertaken for the Gola, Grebo, and Wonegizi PPAs.

Where a community is likely to lose access to certain forest resources, best practice requires
appropriate consultation to determine the community’s point of view and to understand
how they might be adversely affected. In particular, it is important to ensure that vulnerable
or marginalized groups are adequately consulted and not disadvantaged as a result of
establishing a protected area. In addition, the Community Rights Law with Respect to
Forest Lands (2009) establishes that all Community Forests are owned by local communities,
and that any decision or activity affecting the status or use of Community Forest resources
cannot proceed without the free, prior, and informed consent of local communities (see
“Forestry Development Authority and Related Legislation and Policy” in chapter 5). This
law underscores the imperative of balancing the interests of land owners and users in the
process of establishing protected areas, and ensuring that their livelihoods are sustainably
maintained or improved.

In general, the success of biodiversity conservation in protected areas is dependent on
and affected by a range of factors, including how protected areas were created, how they
are managed, the degree of local community involvement, the location of the protected
area, the national policy governing the protected area, and the financial resource base of


	                         Chapter 4: A Role for Offsets in Securing Conservation Outcomes	       41
      the protected area. An analysis of 123 documents on case studies about conservation of
      biodiversity in national parks in Africa reviewed the factors responsible for both the success
      and failure of conservation (Muhumuza and Balkwill 2013). The results suggest that future
      conservation approaches in protected areas in Africa need to place more emphasis on the
      human dimension of biodiversity. Based on this work, some of the key factors that underpin
      the success (or failure) of protected areas include the following:

      ◗	 Effective consultation and taking into account the needs of local people who depend on
         resources or establishment of resource use agreements

      ◗	 Clear communication channels between park staff and local leaders, coupled with
         conflict- or grievance-resolution mechanisms and participatory monitoring

      ◗	 Strong correlation of conservation of biodiversity with density of guards (but not the
         capacity of guards)

      ◗	 Security of land tenure and uncontested ownership of the land in parks (although high
         population numbers and political instability correlate negatively with success).



      Summary of Findings and Way Forward
      Various drivers have resulted in a number of mining companies in Liberia implementing or
      working toward creating project-specific offsets. A range of biodiversity market practices
      have been developed internationally that collectively can be referred to as compensatory
      mitigation measures. Three broad categories of compensatory mitigation programs include
      one-off (or project-specific) offsets, compensation funds, and mitigation banking.

      Project-specific offsets are an important tool for offsetting residual adverse impacts of a
      project, but are not necessarily the best tool for achieving conservation outcomes in Liberia.
      Because of uncertainties around land tenure, competing land uses, and the dependence of
      rural populations on forest resources, selecting offset sites that are politically, socially, and
      technically feasible to implement is complex, costly, and time consuming. Compensation
      funds are simple to institute and implement, and can be structured as a mechanism for
      providing compensation for a range of different development impacts. However, in many
      respects compensation funds are a blunt instrument.

      A biodiversity offset scheme offers the prospect of achieving enhanced conservation
      outcomes, but there are a number of practical constraints that require creative solutions.
      The long-term nature of the planning process for mineral developments and the relatively
      narrow range of ecosystems found in Liberia create an opportunity to establish some
      form of biodiversity or conservation credits in advance, which resource developers could
      then acquire to offset significant residual impacts. This approach would fall short of a true
      market-based system, but such systems are unsuitable for Liberia at present. The greatest
      potential for establishing conservation credits is within PPAs.




42	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
The implications arising from these findings for a constructive way forward are as follows:

◗	 A narrow definition of aggregated offsets is impractical and too limiting: Limiting
   the use of aggregated offsets to situations in which all biodiversity impacts must be
   established for a number of defined projects at the same time is impractical given
   the varying timelines of projects resulting from the vagaries of the exploration and
   development process and requirements for different resource developers to access
   finance at different times. For this reason, a more elastic definition is needed that
   includes some form of biodiversity or conservation credits.

◗	 A biodiversity offset scheme offers certain advantages over alternatives: Although
   project-specific offsets and compensation funds have merit, aggregated offsets
   combined with a simple form of biodiversity or conservation credit linked to the PPA
   network offers the greatest prospect for sustainable offsets that deliver conservation
   outcomes in the long term and help achieve conservation gains.

◗	 A biodiversity offset scheme could support expansion of the protected areas network:
   In light of the protracted and slow progress toward creating protected areas from
   PPAs, linking an aggregated offsets scheme to the PPAs could provide additional
   and important financial support to their legal establishment and on-the-ground
   consolidation.

◗	 Defining how biodiversity or conservation credits can be linked to PPAs is a priority:
   Given the practical constraints to ensuring the long-term sustainability of biodiversity or
   conservation credits outside PPAs, it is important that these credits be linked to existing
   PPAs. Because progress toward establishing protected areas in Liberia has been so slow,
   using aggregated offsets in this manner offers the potential for true additionality.

◗	 In establishing a biodiversity offset scheme, careful attention needs to be paid to the
   human dimensions of biodiversity: The emerging lessons from establishing protected
   areas in Africa highlight the importance of the human dimension of biodiversity and
   point to critical success factors that should feature in the choice and establishment of
   aggregated offsets and biodiversity or conservation credit areas.

◗	 Project-specific offsets may also have a role: Despite the challenges associated with
   project-specific offsets, they still have a potentially valuable role to play. However, pursuit
   of project-specific offsets should always be subject to the capacity and commitment of
   the company to design and implement effective offsets.

44	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
    5. Legal, Policy, and Institutional
    Framework in Support of a National
    Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Do Legal or Policy Anchors Currently Exist?
This chapter is not a comprehensive review of Liberian legislation but focuses on those
laws and policies relevant to biodiversity protection with specific regard to protected
areas and the potential implementation of biodiversity offsets. Of particular interest are
the Environment Protection and Management Law (2002), the Act for the Establishment
of a Protected Forest Areas Network (2003), the National Forestry Reform Law (2006), and
the draft National Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management Act (2014). In
addition to these, certain sectoral laws also address biodiversity conservation, for example,
the Minerals and Mining Law (2000) and the draft Mining Act (2014).

No Liberian legislation specifically mentions “offsets.” However, the Environment Protection
and Management Law (2002) requires the application of the mitigation hierarchy as
part of the Environmental and Social Impact Assessment (ESIA) process. The Act for the
Establishment of a Protected Forest Areas Network (2003) mandates that 30 percent of
existing forest area should be set aside for protection. The National Forestry Reform Law
(2006) reinforces the need for a protected forest areas network. The draft Mining Act (2014)
states that all mining feasibility studies must comply with International Finance Corporation
(IFC) Performance Standards. In addition, clauses relating to the IFC Performance Standards
are already being integrated into Mineral Development Agreements, which could provide a
legally enforceable anchor for mining companies to implement offsets.

The next paragraphs provide an introduction to the government institutions responsible for
implementing and administering the laws, followed by an overview of these key legislative
provisions. One fundamental cross-cutting point is the question of political will, given
the past history of the establishment of a protected areas network in Liberia. This is an
important consideration that will require a level of introspection and honesty on the part of
various line ministries and agencies.


Forestry Development Authority and Related Legislation and Policy
In 1976 the Forestry Development Authority (FDA) was established as the sole government
agency responsible for forest and forest resource management, including protected areas.
Since its inception, the FDA has largely focused on timber concessions. Logging activities
greatly increased during the 1980s and 1990s to unsustainable levels of harvesting. As
a result of the apparent connection between revenues generated by the sector and the
financing of Liberian civil war and regional conflict, the UN Security Council imposed
sanctions on Liberian timber beginning in 2003.

Following the signing of the Comprehensive Peace Agreement in 2003, attention turned
to supporting reform of the forestry sector. The aim of the reforms was to strengthen
governance, accountability, and transparency, and to improve the sharing of benefits from
the forestry sector, which would allow UN sanctions to be lifted. Several development
partners, including the U.S. government and the World Bank, offered technical and financial
assistance to support the reform efforts. Their assistance was coordinated through the
Liberia Forest Initiative.


	                                      Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	   45
      The National Forestry Reform Law (2006) provided the foundation for a revised process for
      concession allocation and management, and the restructuring of the FDA. The National
      Forestry Reform Law (2006) was supported by the National Forest Policy, National Forest
      Management Strategy, and the FDA Ten Core Regulations. These documents supported
      a “3 Cs” approach, giving equal balance to community, commercial, and conservation
      aspects of forestry. Commitments were made to expand the network of protected areas,
      and a number of suitable areas were identified, requiring community consultations and
      development of legislation to secure these areas. An additional law was passed: The
      Community Rights Law with Respect to Forest Lands (2009). This law and its implementing
      regulations (finalized in June 2011) provide the basis for recognition and regulation of
      Community Forests. Finally, the National Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas
      Management Act (submitted by the Liberian President to the Senate for enactment
      in June 2014) includes a number of important provisions relating to conservation and
      protected areas management.


      The Act for the Establishment of a Protected Forest Areas Network (2003)
      In 2003, the government of Liberia committed to establishing a biologically representative
      network of protected areas covering at least 30 percent of the country’s existing forest area,
      or about 1.5 million hectares. The act provided a comprehensive set of definitions that
      remain in use today and are reflected in other legislative provisions, including definitions of
      National Parks, Game Reserves, Nature Reserves, Multiple Sustainable Use Reserves, Strict
      Nature Reserves, and others. It also identified prohibited and permitted activities within the
      various defined areas. It refers to the fact that the government had identified 11 areas of
      existing National Forests as candidates for the protected forest area classification, but no
      further details were provided.


      The National Forestry Reform Law 2006 (amending the National Forestry Law of 2000
      and the act creating the FDA)
      The National Forestry Reform Law (2006) is a wide-ranging law contained in 23 chapters
      including ownership, administration, policy, commercial use of forests, contractual aspects,
      protected areas, community, and other land rights. Although the law includes no specific
      mention of offsets, several provisions are particularly relevant to the establishment of offsets
      in Liberia.

      ◗	 Section 8.2 Sustainable Management and Utilization of Forest Resources states that the
         government cannot grant Class B or C mineral rights in protected areas or proposed
         protected areas (PPAs). Class A mineral rights cannot be awarded in National Forests
         or PPAs unless there has been an agreement from the FDA and its staff has written
         appropriate guidelines for maximum protection of the environment and sustainable
         management of the forest during exercise of the grant. Compliance with the guidelines is
         a condition of the grant.

      ◗	 Section 9.1 on Protected Forest Areas Network and Wildlife Conservation states that the
         authority shall establish a protected forest areas network, together with conservation
         corridors, and incorporating existing National Forests, to cover at least 30 percent of the
         existing forested area of Liberia, or about 1.5 million hectares.


46	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
◗	 Sections 9.2–9.9 describe the measures that are required for presidential and legislative
   approval. The measures include biodiversity and socioeconomic data, including existing
   threats and resource utilization; a 60-day consultation period; views of local communities;
   and proposed boundaries. Once an area has been gazetted, a management plan is to
   be prepared. Every five years thereafter, a comprehensive management plan for the
   protected area is to be reviewed and republished. Within the protected areas game
   reserves, controlled hunting areas and buffer zones can be created.

◗	 Section 9.7 under Modification of Boundaries or Abolishment, states that “No National
   Forest, National Park, Nature Reserve, or Strict Nature Reserve shall be abolished or
   alienated nor shall its boundaries be modified, except by an act of legislature, following
   consultation with the Forestry Development Authority.”

◗	 Section 9.9 Game Reserves, Controlled Hunting Areas, Buffer Zones, Conservation
   Corridors, and Other Protected Forest Area Categories provides for the establishment of
   “Game Reserves, Controlled Hunting Areas, Communal Forests, and other Buffer Zones”
   to serve as conservation corridors to facilitate sustainable protected forest management
   and biodiversity protection.

◗	 Section 9.10 on Regulations and Prohibitions outlines a number of strict prohibitions,
   including restrictions on individuals or organizations (1) in a Strict Nature Reserve, from
   pursuing activities other than conservation management and research; (2) in a National
   Park, Nature Reserve, or Game Reserve, prospecting, mining, farming, hunting, fishing,
   extracting timber or nontimber forest products, or taking any other action except those
   for management or nonconsumption uses, such as tourism, recreation, and research;
   (3) in Community Forests, prospecting, mining, farming, or extracting timber for
   commercial use; and (4) in a Multiple Sustainable Use Reserve, farming or extracting
   timber for commercial use.

◗	 Section 9.12 Protected Animals, Hunting, and Trade in Wildlife outlines other activities
   of the FDA such as reviewing the population, distribution, and status of Liberia’s wildlife,
   and identifies categories of animals and plants that are threatened or in danger of
   extinction. With regard to the hunting of protected animals, the law states that “No
   Person shall hunt, capture, or trade any species identified in the list established and
   maintained by the Authority under Subsection (a) of this Section.”

◗	 Section 10 Community Rights Aspect of Forest Management, ensures that local
   communities are fully engaged in the sustainable management of the forests of Liberia,
   by granting user and management rights to communities and ensuring that communities
   can equitably participate in and benefit from the sustainable management of the forests.

Section 5.6 of this law also includes provisions for Private Use Permits. Private Use Permits
were a type of license designed to allow private land owners to cut trees on their property
for commercial purposes, but were reportedly subject to misuse by commercial logging
companies (Global Witness 2012). In December 2012, a Liberian government investigation
reported systemic legal violations, including fraud and corruption, in the issuance of illegal
logging licenses covering a quarter of Liberia’s surface area. The investigation report
recommended that the government cancel Private Use Permit contracts and prosecute


	                                       Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	    47
      those guilty of violating laws (Global Witness 2012). In response, President Ellen Johnson
      Sirleaf issued an executive order placing a moratorium on logging by Private Use Permit
      holders and committing to prosecute and sanction those who broke the law.


      National Forest Management Strategy (2007)
      The National Forest Management Strategy summarizes the FDA’s approach to managing
      the national forest endowment. It includes objectives, goals, and management actions
      in pursuit of the overall aim to “conserve and sustainably manage all forest areas so that
      they will continue to produce a complete range of goods and services for the benefit of all
      Liberians and contribute to poverty alleviation in the nation” (FDA 2007, 4). The FDA has
      embraced a “3 Cs” approach—commercial, community, and conservation—that focuses on
      the management of Liberia’s forests to achieve the agency’s overall goal of developing and
      sustaining the benefits of Liberia’s forest resources.

      As part of this process the FDA, in conjunction with the U.S. Forest Service, Conservation
      International, and the Liberia Institute of Statistics and Geo-Information Services, conducted
      a Forest Management Suitability Study that evaluated all forest areas for their relative
      suitability for various land uses. The study incorporated information on towns, roads, and
      the like; biodiversity information from 75 field transects conducted by Flora and Fauna
      International; and three rapid field assessments by Conservation International. Where
      conservation and commercial forestry remain equally suitable, areas were allocated to
      commercial use, recognizing the economic and enforcement realities in Liberia. The team
      then revised conservation area boundaries to form contiguous protected areas using
      boundaries easily defined by the landscape such as rivers and roads.

      The suitability study identified 3.41 million hectares for commercial management,
      80.6 percent of which was considered suitable for this activity. Some 85.7 percent of this
      area was also suitable for conservation and 32.2 percent was suitable for community
      management. Eleven target areas were identified for community management, each
      totaling approximately 5,000 hectares for a total of 52,000 hectares. About 98.7 percent of
      this area is suitable for community management. An estimated 18.75 percent of suitable
      community areas were also suitable for commercial forestry management, and 38.5 percent
      of this area was also suitable for conservation management.

      The suitability study also identified a total existing and potential protected area network
      of 1.14 million hectares, including 193,500 hectares of existing protected areas (that is,
      Sapo National Park and East Nimba Strict Nature Reserve); 93.6 percent of this area is
      suitable for conservation management; 65.4 percent is highly suitable for commercial
      forestry management; 17.6 percent of the protected areas network is also highly suitable
      for community management. Some 950,051 hectares of this area is classified as either
      closed or open dense forest.

      The conservation components of the National Forest Management Strategy include some
      laudable goals. One of these goals is to “Work to conduct social and biological surveys
      of PPAs and allocate up to 950,000 hectares to the National Protected Area Network
      with at least 100,000 allocated per year as consistent with the suitability study” (FDA
      2007, 24). Other goals are to “Develop new Wildlife Management Law and raise awareness


48	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
throughout Liberia on hunting issues including the impact of the law while enforcing the
ban on hunting of all protected wildlife species in Liberia” and to “Ensure conservation at
the landscape scale to preserve integrity of biodiversity” (FDA 2007, 24). However, progress
toward achieving these goals has been slow (see “Overview of institutional strengths and
weaknesses” in this chapter).


Community Rights Law with Respect to Forest Lands (2009)
This law was established with the aim of empowering communities to fully engage in
the sustainable management of forests in Liberia by supporting community rights in the
management and use of forest resources. It asserts a number of principles to guide the
implementation of the law, including that all forest resources on community lands (that
is, Community Forests) are owned by local communities, and that any decision or activity
affecting the status or use of Community Forest resources cannot proceed without the free,
prior, and informed consent of local communities. Community Forestry is defined as the
governance and management of forest resources by communities in designated areas, for
commercial and noncommercial purposes, to further their livelihoods and development.
This law only relates to community rights to access, use, and manage forest resources but
does not extend to land ownership.

Forest Land areas ranging from 5,001 hectares to 49,999 hectares may be designated as
Community Forest Land (section 2.3 of the law). “The Authority shall have the powers to
grant a community the right to access, manage, use and benefit from forest resources on
a specified area of land.”1 Communities may enter into small-scale (1 to 5,000 hectares)
commercial use contracts with small commercial enterprises to harvest timber and
nontimber forest products on a noncompetitive basis. They may also enter into medium-
scale (5,001 to 49,999.99 hectares) commercial use contracts on a noncompetitive basis.
Section 6 of the law states that communities may also enter, in collaboration with the FDA,
into large-scale (50,000 or more hectares) commercial use contracts for timber products on
a competitive basis guided by the Sustainable Forest Management Standards.

In mid-2013, Global Witness reported that the government had received 23 applications for
Community Forest Management Agreements (CFMAs), but that logging companies appear
to be behind the new applications with little or no involvement by local communities.
Global Witness alleged (Global Witness 2013) that this risks turning an instrument designed
to empower communities into an exploitative mechanism by which logging companies
illegally gain cheap access to forests (see also “Overview of Institutional Strengths and
Weaknesses” in this chapter).


National Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management Law (2014, in draft)
This yet-to-be-approved law, which was submitted by the Liberian President to the Senate
for enactment in June 2014, will be referred to as “the draft National Wildlife Law (2014)”
and includes a number of important provisions relating to conservation and protected areas
management. The objectives of the law are the following:

◗	 Provide for the establishment of conservation areas and the management of wildlife
   (within the framework of national legislation including the Forestry Reform Law 2006).


	                                      Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	   49
      ◗	 Provide for the protection of wildlife and wildlife management throughout Liberia.

      ◗	 Provide for cooperative governance in the establishment of conservation areas and
         management of wildlife.

      ◗	 Effect a national system of conservation areas in Liberia.

      ◗	 Provide for a representative network of conservation areas on state land, private land,
         and community lands.

      ◗	 Promote sustainable utilization of conservation areas for the benefit of people in a
         manner that would preserve the ecological character of the areas.

      ◗	 Promote participation of local communities in the management of conservation areas
         and wildlife, where appropriate.

      ◗	 Facilitate the integrated management of conservation and wildlife.

      The law sets out the ambition of managing “wildlife and natural areas for the benefit,
      utility, and enjoyment of all people in accordance with internationally accepted principles
      of ecologically based management” and of enhancing the social and economic benefits to
      forest-dependent communities by “sustainable wildlife management as a source of protein,
      revenue generation and employment.” In parallel, the act establishes the aim of protecting
      and managing wildlife that are “endemic, rare, threatened or endangered by extinction”
      and maintaining the habitats they depend on.

      Section 2.2 of the law also establishes a policy of transferring, to the extent feasible and
      practicable, wildlife management in and outside of protected areas to “communities,
      private land owners and voluntary associations organized for the purpose.” Consistent
      with the idea of devolved responsibility, section 3.2 provides for “decentralization of
      conservation and wildlife management and the incorporation of protected areas and
      wildlife issues in the agenda of District and Community level Environmental Committees.”
      County or local-level authorities may establish a Protected Area Management Committee
      for each protected area created or for a county or region where there is more than one
      protected area, in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.

      The objectives of establishing a national protected areas network are to ensure a viable
      network of sites that are representative of natural ecosystems in Liberia for the protection
      and maintenance of biodiversity and associated cultural resources, and to ensure
      the conservation of viable populations of all indigenous wild species, especially rare,
      endangered, and endemic species.

      Section 5.2.2 of the law reiterates the ambition of the National Forestry Reform Law (2006)
      to establish a “Protected Area Network, together with corridors and incorporating existing
      national forests and community forest lands, to cover at least 30 percent of the existing
      forested area of Liberia, representing about 1.5 million hectares.”

      Section 7.1 of the law deals with private sector participation in wildlife management and
      requires the FDA to transparently and consultatively develop a policy and guidelines for

50	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
private landowner and community-based management or joint forest management of
protected areas, conservation areas, and wildlife management areas.

Of particular relevance to the potential future funding of an offset scheme is Section 10.1
of the law, which requires the FDA to establish a “Conservation and Wildlife Fund for
the administration of protected areas, wildlife conservation and management activities,
and enforcement of this Law.” The sources of funding shall include, but not be limited to
(1) funds appropriated by the legislature; (2) voluntary contributions; (3) donations, grants,
endowments; and (4) payment of fees.

Specifically in relation to mining, it is noted in Section 3.1.2 of the law that the FDA’s role
with respect to protected areas and wildlife management includes a requirement to ensure
“wildlife conservation in the extractive industries such as logging and mining operations.”
Section 5.12 requires the FDA to consultatively develop regulations governing activities
permitted and prohibited in the various management categories of protected forest areas,
conservation areas, and wildlife management areas within one year of the law coming into
effect, including mining. This section may offer further clarity on which of these areas, if
any, may be subject to mineral exploration or mining. Last, although not sector specific,
section 5.14 signals that the FDA may develop protected-area-specific Environmental Impact
Assessment guidelines or “ensure that forest sector-specific EIA guidelines include adequate
EIA requirements for protected areas and that the guidelines promote transparency and
public participation of relevant conservation stakeholders in the process.”


Environmental Protection Agency and Related Legislation and Policy
The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), established by an act of the Legislature of
Liberia in 2003, was formally set up in 2004 as an autonomous agency of the government
of Liberia. The EPA is responsible for coordinating, integrating, and harmonizing
implementation of the National Environmental Policy under the guidance of the National
Environmental Policy Council. The council was established under Section 7 of the 2003
Environmental Protection Agency Act. Under section 30 of the act, the EPA will prepare a
National Environmental Action Plan every five years in consultation with the line ministries
and county environmental committees.

The EPA took over the responsibilities of the National Environmental Commission of Liberia
(NECOLIB), which was established in 1998 with the mandate to coordinate environmental
management activities, including the conservation of biological diversity. NECOLIB was
the focal institution for the Convention on Biological Diversity, the Cartagena Protocol
on Biosafety, the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change and its
Kyoto Protocol, and the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants. These
responsibilities now fall to the EPA.

National Environmental Policy (2003)
The National Environmental Policy of 2003 provides a broad framework for the
implementation of national objectives and plans. The policy aims to ensure the
sound management of resources and the environment, including the “protection and
maintenance of human habitats, the ecosystems, and ecological processes essential for the
functioning of the biosphere” (Ministry of Foreign Affairs 2003, 5). The overall goal of the

	                                        Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	   51
      National Environmental Policy is to ensure the long-term economic prosperity of Liberia
      through sustainable social and economic development, which enhances environmental
      quality and resource productivity on a long-term basis that meets the requirements of
      the present generation without endangering the potential of future generations to meet
      their own needs.

      The ultimate aim of the National Environmental Policy is to ensure the improvement of the
      physical environment, quality of life, and economic and social living conditions of the entire
      citizenry, for present and future generations.

      There is no mention of offsets in the National Environmental Policy, which is not surprising
      given that it dates from before the concept gained widespread acceptance. There is also
      little or no mention of compensation or mitigation, except in the context of bio-prospecting
      (see section 6.2 of the policy). Section 4.12 of the National Environmental Policy, which deals
      with Environmental Economics, recommends the development of “effective decentralized
      resource management mechanisms to involve local communities, NGOs and the private
      sector, thus augmenting the implementation of government agencies.”

      National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (2004)
      Liberia ratified the Convention on Biological Diversity in November 2000, establishing a
      requirement to produce a National Biodiversity Strategy and Action Plan (NBSAP) for the
      conservation and sustainable use of biological diversity. The overall goal of Liberia’s NBSAP,
      prepared between June 2002 and February 2004, is to sustainably use biodiversity on a
      long-term basis to meet the needs of both the present and future generations. The specific
      goals follow:

      ◗	 To take appropriate measures to protect critical ecosystems against harmful effects or
         destructive practices for conservation of biological diversity.

      ◗	 To create biodiversity awareness among sectors of the society and promote international
         cooperation.

      ◗	 To commit the people to the sound and sustainable use of biological diversity to bring
         about socioeconomic development.

      ◗	 To promote rational utilization and conservation of biological diversity.

      ◗	 To promote access to genetic resources and the fair and equitable sharing of benefits
         arising from their utilization.

      ◗	 To contribute to the fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals through poverty
         alleviation, food security, and women’s empowerment in biodiversity conservation
         by 2015.

      As with the National Environmental Policy, the NBSAP dates from before the concept of
      offsets gained acceptance, so there is no mention of offsets within the NBSAP and there is
      also little to no mention of compensation or mitigation.



52	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
The Environment Protection and Management Law of the Republic of Liberia
(Approved 2002, published 2003)
This law is a wide-ranging piece of legislation that is divided into 13 parts and includes
115 sections covering Environmental Impact Assessment, pollution control, protection
of natural resources, protection of biodiversity, restoration, inspection, international
obligations, education, and offenses.

The law makes no specific mention of biodiversity offsets, although ESIAs should include an
understanding of ecological impacts and describe their mitigation. The law does, however,
allow for the setting aside of land for the protection of biodiversity, but doing so must take
into account impacts on local communities.

Specific provisions that are relevant to biodiversity offsets are summarized below.

◗	 Part II, Section 4, Principles of Environmental Management and Objectives includes
   provisions to “Facilitate the restoration, protection, and the conservation of biological
   diversity for the function of the biosphere and the maintenance of the ecological system
   and processes” and to “Ensure the sustainable or wise use of the natural resources in
   pursuance of social and economic development without undermining the ecosystem's
   renewal and resupply processes.”

◗	 Part III, Sections 13–33, Environmental Impact Statement pertain to the ESIA process.
   They identify which projects require ESIAs and outline what is needed to fulfill the legal
   obligations. There is no specific mention of or requirement for biodiversity offsets,
   although there is a requirement in section 14 for the ESIA to describe “ecological
   impacts” and to include a “description of measures proposed for avoiding, minimizing,
   mitigating and monitoring the anticipated adverse effects of the project or activity on the
   environment.”

◗	 Part VI, Guidelines and Standard for the Management of the Environment and Natural
   Resources includes provisions relating to protected areas and threatened species.
   Sections 77–79 address the Protection of Forest and of Natural Environmental Areas.
   Section 77 lays out some of the measures to be undertaken by and the role of the
   EPA, such as issuing guidelines and prescribing measures for the sustainable use and
   protection and management of all forests in Liberia. Section 80 deals with the Protection
   of Wild Animals and Birds, and states, “All wild animals and birds and in particular, rare,
   threatened and endangered species and their habitats shall be preserved and protected
   in accordance with the guidelines and recommendations made by the Agency after
   consultation with the Line Ministry.” Section 80 goes on to state that before any areas
   can be declared as protected, an ESIA needs to be conducted, and a report is required
   on the social and ecological consequences of the declaration. There should also be a
   detailed boundary description of the protected area under this section.

	 Under Section 80, a Wildlife Protected Area is defined as a National Park, Wildlife
  Reserve, Nature Reserve, or any other area the line ministry may designate as a Wildlife
  Protected Area. A Wildlife Management Area is defined as a Wildlife Sanctuary, a
  Community Wildlife Area, or any other area the line ministry may declare a Wildlife

        Management Area. The EPA is responsible for prescribing conservation measures to
        ensure that communities and persons and wildlife coexist in the Wildlife Management
        Area and that wildlife is protected.

      ◗	 Part VII, Protection of Biodiversity, Natural Heritage and the Ozone Layer: Section 83
         deals with the Conservation of Biological Diversity. Among other things, it requires the
         EPA to (1) specify national strategies, plans, and programs for the conservation and
         sustainable use of biological diversity as part of the National Environmental Action
         Plan process, including the preparation of an inventory of biological diversity of Liberia;
         (2) determine which species are endangered, rare, or threatened with extinction;
         (3) integrate conservation into state activities, respecting and encouragement of
         the diverse cultural and aesthetic values and sacred knowledge and interests of the
         communities in biodiversity; and (4) protect indigenous knowledge and collect data on
         the roles of women and youth in the conservation of biological resources and the impact
         of natural resource policies on women and youth.

      Section 84 deals with the Conservation of Biological Resources in situ. It states that the
      FDA shall, in consultation with the relevant line ministry, issue guidelines for, among others,
      (1) “The selection and management of protected areas so as to promote the conservation
      of the various terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems in Liberia”; (2) the “selection and
      management of buffer zones near protected areas”; (3) “special measures for protection of
      species, ecosystems, and habitats [that] are threatened with extinction”; (4) “prohibiting or
      controlling of the introduction of alien species”; and (5) “integrating traditional knowledge
      for the conservation of biological diversity.”


      The Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy (MLME) and Related Legislation
      The MLME ensures the sustainable management and judicious utilization of the country’s
      lands, mines, and energy resources. There are three main departments, respectively
      covering matters relating to lands, mineral resources, and energy. The Lands Department
      deals with land surveys, mapping (for example, of protected area boundaries or exploration
      blocks), and issues relating to land tenure. It also deals with procurement of land for all
      government departments. The Mineral Resources Department has the mandate for the
      mining sector. Its two major operating areas are Mines Administration and Geological and
      Mineral Investigations, including the administration of exploration and mining tenements,
      the processing of applications for grant and renewal of licenses, the allocation of special
      site licenses or permits, as well as the certification of mining personnel and specific mining
      equipment. It also has a mandate for monitoring mining and exploration activities through
      regular inspections for adherence to safe environmental practices. The Department of
      Energy continues to serve and maintain linkages with energy-oriented organizations, both
      state controlled and privately owned.

      Mineral Policy (2010)
      The Mineral Policy was introduced in 2010 and is intended to provide adequate indications
      to the investment community (both national and foreign) of a competitive mineral regime in
      Liberia that is informed by international trends, adheres to international norms, is grounded
      in local conditions, and is accountable to national common interests.



54	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Mining Act (2014, Draft)
The application for the grant of a mineral mining license must be accompanied by an ESIA
for the proposed project. In addition, the introductory section of the draft Mining Act states
that companies’ feasibility studies should “Comply with National Standards and Regulations
of the Liberia, The Equator Principles, World Bank Guidelines and the IFC Performance
Standards.” This extends the reach of domestic legislation to include provisions relating
to biodiversity offsets, as required by the IFC Performance Standards on Social and
Environmental Sustainability.

Section 6 of the draft Mining Act (2014) deals with the reconciliation of competing land uses,
and states that the “Minister must engage in consultation with other relevant Ministers and
Government agencies to design and implement an integrated system of land use planning
to evaluate competing land use options to address and resolve existing conflicting land uses
involving mining operations and mining titles and potential future conflicting land uses.”

The draft Mining Act (2014) enables the minister to give the holder of a Mineral Exploration
License a notice “requesting the surrender of all or a specified part of the mineral title
area, to enable the land to be used for a purpose beneficial to Liberia as prescribed by
regulation” (section 140). Mineral titles can be cancelled for a range of reasons, including
“failure to adopt good working practices” or because the holder “no longer has the
financial or technical resources to carry out the mining management plan.”

Section 144 (Protected Areas) states that certain areas, such as a sacred ground or
wildlife sanctuary, may be protected from mining. The section dealing with environmental
protection (163) states that “In deciding whether or not to grant a mineral title, the Minister
must take into account the need to conserve the natural resources in or on land over which
the mineral title is sought, or in or on neighboring land.”


Which Institutions Should Be Involved in Support
of a Biodiversity Offset Scheme?
As the sole agency with responsibility for managing the forest resources of Liberia, and
given its mandate for establishing and maintaining a protected areas network, the key
institution that would need to be involved in the creation of an offset scheme in Liberia is
the FDA. However, the EPA would almost certainly have a role in oversight of the scheme.
In addition, the Lands Department of the MLME would likely have a role in demarcating
and mapping any future offset areas that form part of the protected areas network. More
substantively, the MLME should also play a role in determining mining footprints and
potentially in extending the reach of the geographic information system for allocating
concessions to support the scheme.

Liberia is still rebuilding after years of civil conflict that came to an end in 2003. Despite the
presence of many dedicated and professional staff, in general, the capacity of government
agencies within Liberia is weak. However, the FDA and EPA are particularly constrained by
the resources available to them, given that their respective mandates and supportive legal
provisions require them to fulfill a broad range of activities across the entire country. Both
agencies lack the necessary equipment and trained staff to carry out their roles effectively.

      Overview of Institutional Strengths and Weaknesses
      An organization chart for the FDA is outlined in figure 5.1. An assessment of key governance
      issues relating to the implementation of REDD+2 in Liberia (Forest Carbon Partnership
      Facility 2012) highlights a number of issues with the capacity of the FDA. In particular, the
      report underscores that “there is an urgent need to enhance the skills and capacity of
      personnel (in FDA in particular) to deliver on the ground and close the ‘governance gap’ in
      implementation” (Forest Carbon Partnership Facility 2012, 4). The same report highlights
      that although the concept of the 3 Cs had been useful, progress on each “C” had been
      unequal, with significant focus on commercial forestry but less progress on community or
      conservation forestry.

      The report also expressed concern that the 3 Cs are operating in parallel, but not being
      integrated in the management of the sector. For example, the land areas deemed suitable
      for each “C” were set out in the National Forest Management Strategy of 2007 (described
      above), but are difficult to interpret because large areas of land were identified as suitable
      for “mixed use” without a clear indication of how this would be effectively managed by
      the 3 Cs structuring of the FDA. The 2012 Forest Carbon Partnership Facility report also
      highlights the reality that a significant amount of land identified as “long-term multiple
      sustainable use” that included forest suitable for any or all of the 3 Cs has since been
      allocated as Forest Management Contracts. These contracts are allocated to logging
      operators to be managed as permanent forest cover, but do not clearly meet conservation
      principles and have limited involvement of communities.

56	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Despite the almost equal numbers of staff allocated to commercial and conservation
activities, the emphasis in the FDA appears to be primarily focused on the commercial
aspect, although, given the findings from the Land Commission (see Chapter 3, The
Implications of Land Tenure for Establishing Protected Areas) and concern over what
happened with Private Use Permits and CFMAs (see “Forestry Development Authority and
Related Legislation and Policy” earlier in this chapter), there may now be greater emphasis
on Community Forestry and more benefit sharing. The alleged exploitation of both Private
Use Permits and CFMAs by commercial interests serves to fuel concerns that the FDA has
a potential conflict of interest in forest protection, given its role in facilitating commercial
forestry and revenue generation from forest resources. It is therefore particularly important
that the EPA, which does not have a role in encouraging revenue generation from the
sector, be involved in overseeing sustainable forest management.


Process for Creating New Protected Areas
Protected areas in Liberia are an integral part of the country’s legislation, conservation
policy, and implementation strategy. Liberia ratified the United Nations Convention on
Biological Diversity treaty in 2000, and the 2004 National Biodiversity Strategy and Action
Plan3 pledges to “set aside at least 10% of the land area for Strict Protection and 30% of
the land area for protection and multiple-use for partial protection.” The commitment to
set aside 30 percent under some form of protection was again stipulated in the National
Forestry Reform Law (2006).

The protected areas network outlined in table 2.2 and figure 2.5 includes the two categories
of current and proposed protected areas. The current protected areas refer to the three
areas that have been officially afforded protection (Sapo National Park, East Nimba Nature
Reserve, and Lake Piso Multiple Use Reserve).

The steps required to establish a protected area are as follows (World Bank personal
communication 2014):

	A.	 Legal establishment (gazettement)
	    	 1.	 Identification of the proposed site by the FDA.
	    	 2.	 Reconnaissance mission to the identified site.
	    	 3.	Hold introductory consultation meeting with the affected community (state the
           purpose).
	    	 4.	 Issue public notice for 90-day opportunity for public comments.
	    	 5.	Conduct biophysical and socioeconomic surveys to gather information on the
           identified site including
			       ◗	 Assessment of wildlife, national cultural, and other resources of the site.
			           ssessment of the existing state of human disturbances and resource utilization
          ◗	 A
             of the site.
	        Conduct consultative workshop for all stakeholders at all levels (community,
    	 6.	
         regional, and national), presenting information about the area and the stakeholders’
         input into the establishment process.

	                                        Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	    57
      	    	 7.	Compile results of surveys, scientific research, and other relevant data and
                 information to include
      			       ◗	 Proposed description of the area.
      			           ssessment of wildlife, national cultural, and other resources of the site or
                ◗	 A
                   forest.
      			       ◗	 Assessment of the existing state of human disturbances and resource utilization.
      			           ummary report of any consultation with government ministries, agencies,
                ◗	 S
                   and persons and local communities of the area.
      			       ◗	 Other environmental impact data for the area.
      	    	 8.	 Prepare proposal for presidential and legislative enactment or approval.
      	    	 9.	 The president, upon approval of proposal, submits it to the national legislature.
      	        The legislature enacts legislation, establishing the respective protected area for
           10.	
           	
               the president for printing into handbill (gazettement completed).

      	 B.	 On-the-ground consolidation
      	    11.	 Provide core staff to support the protected area.
           	
             Physically demarcate the boundary between the protected area and surrounding
      		 12.	
             lands within one year of the establishment of the protected area; this is the
             responsibility of the FDA.
             Produce and implement a Management Plan, which shall be reviewed every
      		 13.	
             five years.

      One challenge presented by the Land Rights Policy (see chapter 3) in its current draft
      is that it is unclear how this process would apply, or need to be adapted to, Customary
      Protected Areas.


      Legal Basis for Establishing Conservation Trust Funds
      Chapter 6 (the section titled “Operational and Management Considerations for a National
      Offset Scheme”) considers the potential of using a conservation trust fund (CTF) to finance
      an offset scheme for Liberia. This section considers whether the legal framework and policy
      environment in Liberia individually and collectively support the establishment and sound
      management of a CTF in Liberia. A fuller discussion of the potential establishment of a CTF in
      Liberia, with reference to other CTFs established elsewhere in Africa, is included in appendix 3.

      Liberian law recognizes trust as a contractual relationship enforceable when validly
      established. The country also has a dedicated statute on the creation and management
      of private foundations. A chapter in the tax code of Liberia is dedicated to the taxation of
      trust and offers clear and predictable rules on taxation of trust income. No Liberian law or
      policy precludes the government or any of its agencies from establishing or contributing
      to a trust fund. The government also has a noticeably strong public policy for biodiversity




58	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
conservation generally; the creation, protection, and monitoring of protected areas;
the effective involvement and participation of communities and civil society generally in
forest management and conservation; and the building of public-private partnerships for
conservation in Liberia.

Although Liberia, like many common law jurisdictions (countries whose laws are based on
English or American laws), has no specific statute on trusts, the legal concept of “trust” is
well established under Liberian laws. The nature of a trust and how it is created to become
enforceable is therefore determined in Liberia by reference to the common law. A trust may
be created by any contractual instrument and by whoever is capable of making or entering
into an enforceable contract. A trust under Liberian law is a legal relationship whereby an
asset or resource is given or set aside by one or more persons to a custodian who holds
and manages it for the benefit of another person (or persons) generally referred to as the
beneficiary or beneficiaries.

A CTF may be established by one or more extractive companies, one or more agencies
of the government of Liberia, or by a combination of extractive companies and agencies
of the government. A trust may be a private trust (created for the benefit of a certain
designated individual or individuals, or class of persons) or it may be a public trust (created
for the benefit of the public at large). A public trust is generally considered a charitable trust
because it is for the benefit of the entire public as opposed to private interests. Because
any CTF dedicated to funding the protection of protected areas would clearly be for public
benefit, it would qualify as a charitable trust. Any charitable CTF would generally be tax
exempt under Liberian law, under section (9) of the Consolidated Tax Code of Liberia.

Although Liberia has no specific trust statute, the country is one of a few common law
jurisdictions with a dedicated statute on foundations. A foundation is substantially similar
to, but slightly different from, a trust. The two are similar in that in either case the donor
irrevocably transfers ownership of the endowment asset or fund for use or application
toward the indicated purpose of the trust or foundation. They are different by the method
of creation and also by the fact that whereas title to a trust property is vested in the trustee,
the same is not true of the founder or manager of a foundation. The private foundations
statute is called An Act to Further Amend the Associations Law as Amended, Title 5 of the
Liberian Code of Laws Revised, by Adding Thereto a New Part VI, chapter 60, Providing for
the Establishment of Private Foundations. It contains detailed provisions on the registration,
purpose, management, and audit of foundations.

With appropriate drafting, a CTF may be established in Liberia under the private
foundations statute or by way of the usual deed of trust executed by the original donor(s).
The statute further provides that a private foundation may, but need not be, charitable.
It also prescribes the modes of establishment of private foundations, and the mandatory
optional provisions of a memorandum of endowment. The statute further requires the initial
assets of a foundation to be not less than US$10,000.00. Many trusts and foundations exist
in Liberia, such as the Joseph Jenkins Robert Educational Trust Fund. This trust was created
more than a century ago by the first president of Liberia for the purpose of promoting
education, and it still exists today. Its trustee is the Methodist Church of Liberia, and the
beneficiaries are the children of Liberia.




	                                        Chapter 5: Legal, Policy, and Institutional Framework	      59
      In summary, there is no provision or interpretation of Liberian law that hinders or could
      hinder the establishment of a CTF. In fact, the laws of Liberia on trust, contract, and taxation
      provide a clear and predictable framework for the establishment of a CTF or any other trust
      (see appendix 3 for further details).



      Summary of Findings and Way Forward
      There is no specific mention of offsets in any Liberian legislation, but clauses relating to
      the IFC Performance Standards are already being integrated into Mineral Development
      Agreements (MDAs), which could provide a legally enforceable anchor for mining
      companies to implement offsets.

      A range of legal provisions in the National Forestry Reform Law (2006) and the Community
      Rights Law with Respect to Forested Lands (2009) relate to and help to underscore the
      conservation of biodiversity. These provisions will be further strengthened by enactment of
      the draft National Wildlife Law (2014). However, allegations of misuse of provisions relating
      to Private Use Permits and CFMAs have undermined the sense that the conservation
      mandate of the FDA is afforded weight equal to its commercial mandate.

      As the sole agency with responsibility for managing the forest resources of Liberia, the key
      institution that would need to be involved in the creation of an offset scheme in Liberia
      is the FDA. However, the EPA would almost certainly have a role in oversight of an offset
      approach. In addition, the Lands Department of the MLME would likely have a role in
      demarcating and mapping any future offset areas that form part of the protected areas
      network.

      The implications arising from these findings for a constructive way forward are as follows:

      ◗	 Need for honest reflection on the question of political will: Given the past history of
         the establishment of a protected areas network in Liberia, the issue of political will is an
         important consideration that will require a level of introspection and honesty on the part
         of various line ministries and agencies.

      ◗	 No specific mention of offsets but MDAs and the draft Mining Act (2014) require
         compliance with the IFC Performance Standards: Although the current laws do not
         specifically address offsets, the draft Mining Law (2014) and the current MDAs do make
         reference to compliance with IFC Performance Standards, which effectively means that
         developers would need to comply with Performance Standard 6 and implement offsets
         if projects affect natural or critical natural habitat. The FDA will also have an opportunity
         to further clarify requirements for offsets under the regulations it is to develop under the
         draft National Wildlife Law (2014) for activities, including mining, that are permitted and
         prohibited in the various protected areas designations.

      ◗	 Address capacity constraints within the FDA and EPA: Numerous studies and reviews
         have highlighted the capacity constraints within the FDA, as well as the tension between
         different elements of the 3 Cs mandate. If an offset scheme is to be successfully
         implemented in Liberia, this issue needs to be addressed.



60	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
◗	 Specific capacity building around offsets: Given that biodiversity offsets are a new
   construct in Liberia and the approach under development is also new, capacity
   development among the key line ministries, including the FDA, EPA, and to a lesser
   extent the MLME, will be required.

◗	 Possible need to update process for establishing protected areas: The National
   Forestry Reform Law (2006) provides the framework for a PPA to become protected.
   However, if some of the PPAs are subject to community deeds and are not in fact public
   land, it is unclear whether the FDA can gazette them, and it is unclear whether existing
   legislation would cover a Customary Protected Areas designation. These uncertainties
   need to be clarified. The regulations governing activities permitted and prohibited in
   the various management categories of Protected Forest Areas, Conservation Areas,
   and Wildlife Management Areas, which are to be produced within one year of the draft
   National Wildlife Law (2014), provide an opportunity to clarify these uncertainties.

◗	 New legislation would be required if offsets were to be extended to other sectors:
   MDAs and the draft Mining Act only cover the mining sector; a change in the
   Environment Protection and Management Law (2002) would be necessary to extend its
   coverage to other sectors.

◗	 The legal framework and policy environment support the establishment and sound
   management of a conservation trust in Liberia: Liberian law recognizes trust as a contractual
   relationship enforceable when validly established; the law also has a dedicated statute on
   the creation and management of private foundations. There is a dedicated chapter of the
   tax code of Liberia on taxation of trust, providing clear and predictable rules on taxation
   and on determination and taxation of trust income. No Liberian law or policy precludes the
   government of Liberia or any of its agencies from establishing or contributing to a trust fund.

◗	 Need to further clarify the implications of the proposed Conservation and Wildlife Fund:
   The commitment in the draft National Wildlife Law (2014) to establish a “Conservation
   and Wildlife Fund for the administration of protected areas, wildlife conservation and
   management activities, and enforcement of this Law” is consistent with the proposed
   model for future funding of an offsets scheme in Liberia (as discussed in “Costs and Long-
   Term Financing Arrangements for a Biodiversity Offset Scheme” in chapter 6). Given that
   details of how the fund would operate are yet to be developed, it is unclear whether
   the proposed Conservation and Wildlife Fund could serve as the vehicle for funding the
   scheme as part of a broader effort to expand the protected areas network. This concern
   needs to be clarified with the government of Liberia, as well as with potential providers
   of funding.

62	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
  6. Methodological Challenges of
  Implementing a National Biodiversity
  Offset Scheme
Introduction
As noted in chapter 1 and at various points in preceding chapters, a number of challenges
must be overcome to ensure the successful implementation of a national biodiversity offset
scheme in Liberia. At the same time, successful implementation of project-specific offsets
is also constrained by a number of factors, as highlighted in chapter 4, and a national
biodiversity offset scheme offers the potential to overcome some of these constraints.

The Business and Biodiversity Offsets Programme (BBOP) has led the way in developing
methodological approaches and supporting documentation for the design and
implementation of project-specific offsets. The three key resource documents in this respect
are the Biodiversity Offset Design Handbook (BBOP 2009b), the Biodiversity Offset Cost-
Benefit Handbook (BBOP 2009a), and the Biodiversity Offset Implementation Handbook
(BBOP 2012). The scope of and relationship between the three key resources are illustrated
in figures 6.1 and 6.2.

The aspects of offset design that are most relevant to a national offsets scheme that
are elaborated on further within this section are steps 4 and 5 in figure 6.1 (highlighted
by a dotted red line) and for offset implementation, activities 2 and 3 in figure 6.2 (also
highlighted by a dotted red line).

With regard to offset design, the most relevant steps that are explored further in this
section are Step (4) Determine the need for (and appropriateness of) an offset, based
on the nature and extent of residual impacts on biodiversity after the application of the
mitigation hierarchy, and Step (5) Decide on methods and metrics to demonstrate that
no net loss will be achieved through the biodiversity offset and to quantify the residual
loss using these metrics. Step (2) Reviewing the legal framework and Step (3) Initiating
stakeholder participation to ensure their effective involvement in offset design are not
addressed because they are already integral to the process for establishing protected areas
(see “Process for Creating New Protected Areas” in chapter 5). Similarly, Step (6) Identifying
potential offset locations and Step (7) Calculating offset gains at appropriate offset
locations will largely have been completed as part of the process of gazetting proposed
protected areas (PPAs). The design elements that are given further consideration in this
section comprise the technical feasibility challenges of implementing an offset scheme.

With respect to implementing offsets, the BBOP Biodiversity Offsets Implementation
Handbook focuses on four main activities (figure 6.2). These are (1) What are the offsetting
activities and where will they be carried out? (2) How will the offset operate and be
managed? (3) How will the offset be financed over the long term (legal, institutional, and
financial aspects)? (4) How will the offset be monitored? The first of these has already been
addressed given that the focus is on PPAs. The fourth activity, although important, will form
an integral part of any protected area management plan (see “Process for Creating New
Protected Areas” in chapter 5) and is not considered further. This section focuses instead
on the operational, management, and financial aspects, that is, the process and institutional
challenges of implementing a biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia.

      Technical Feasibility Challenges
      Determining Need for an Offset Based on Residual Impacts
      It is important that the Environmental and Social Impact Assessments (ESIAs) being
      prepared in Liberia include sufficient information on biodiversity to not only assess direct
      and indirect project-related impacts on biodiversity and ecosystem services, and identify
      any significant residual impacts, but also to determine the need for an offset. As part of the
      ESIA process, the draft Mining Act stipulates that project proponents should comply with
      the International Finance Corporation (IFC) Performance Standards.

IFC Performance Standard 6 (Biodiversity Conservation and Sustainable Management
of Living Natural Resources) states that to ensure the “protection and conservation of
biodiversity, the mitigation hierarchy includes biodiversity offsets, which may be considered
only after appropriate avoidance, minimization, and restoration measures have been
applied” (IFC 2012, 42). “In areas of natural habitat, mitigation measures will be designed to
achieve no net loss of biodiversity where feasible” (IFC 2012, 43). In areas of critical habitat,
the project’s mitigation strategy will be designed to achieve net gains of those biodiversity
values for which the critical habitat was designated (IFC 2012). Critical habitats are areas
with high biodiversity value, including (1) habitat of significant importance to critically
endangered or endangered species, (2) habitat of significant importance to endemic
or restricted-range species, (3) habitat supporting globally significant concentrations of
migratory species or congregatory species, (4) highly threatened or unique ecosystems, and
(5) areas associated with key evolutionary processes. The majority of potential mining sites
in Liberia will affect natural habitats and some are likely to affect critical habitats.

      The Likelihood of an Offset Being Required
      The likelihood of an offset being required will depend on a number of factors, including
      the conservation significance of the habitat (and associated species) affected and
      effectiveness of the mitigation strategies. With respect to criteria (1)–(3) outlined above,
      Liberia harbors a large number of threatened and endemic species. Many mining projects
      in remote locations in Liberia are highly likely to have impacts on species of conservation
      concern and ecosystem services. Much of the unmodified habitat in Liberia could be
      considered critical habitat under the highly threatened or unique ecosystems criterion. The
      International Union for Conservation of Nature’s (IUCN’s) Red List Criteria for Threatened
      Ecosystems (Rodríguez et al. 2011) provides some criteria for defining threat levels for
      habitats, including recent declines in distribution and historical total loss in distribution of
      habitat. The Upper Guinean Forests (hyper wet, wet, and moist evergreen forests, and moist
      semi-deciduous) have drastically declined from an estimated 1,265,000 square kilometers
      to approximately 141,000 square kilometers, a reduction of approximately 85 percent
      of the original vegetation. This means the Upper Guinean Forests could be considered
      “endangered” or even “critically endangered.”

      Special attention should also be given to montane habitats, which are very rare and
      difficult to offset in Liberia. Recent research shows that Liberia supports a diverse range of
      butterflies, with more than 850 species, many new to science. It is very likely that some of
      these species are associated with upland or submontane habitats where the microhabitats
      are significantly more diverse for butterflies. Because many iron ore deposits are found in
      mountainous areas, it is important to consider that potential offsets should include other
      upland areas if possible (Szabolcs Sáfián, personal communication, 2014). Some rivers also
      support highly endemic freshwater fish and crab fauna (Hugueny and Lévêque 1994).

      With respect to the fifth criterion (areas associated with key evolutionary processes), again
      parts of Liberia, particularly just inland from the coast in southeast Liberia and some riverine
      habitats, could be considered critical habitat. It is thought that some areas may have
      played an important role during past climate changes, for example, during the Pleistocene
      ice ages. The presence of evolutionarily important forest refuges has been hypothesized,
      primarily in humid mountainous zones (Mount Nimba), but also along some large riparian
      areas (for example, the Congo Basin) and in littoral areas. These refuge areas are generally
      characterized by a comparatively large number of locally endemic species. Studies in West
      Africa (Poorter et al. 2004) have shown the presence of a belt of high rare and endemic
      species richness that is found about 50–100 kilometers inland, starting in Sierra Leone and
      running through Liberia to southwest Côte d’Ivoire.

      In addition, wet conditions have existed almost permanently over evolutionary time in the
      Upper Guinea ecoregion, allowing species to survive here when dry conditions dominated
      other portions of West Africa. Southern Upper Guinea (including Liberia) is part of the Upper
      Guinea aquatic bioregion, which is characterized by a distinct fish fauna that includes many
      endemics (species and subspecies found nowhere else). This high endemism is likely the
      result of long-term geographic isolation and stable and wet climatic regimes. Rapids and
      waterfalls within individual basins have likely served as additional barriers (Lévêque 1997).

      Other areas that may qualify as critical habitat include internationally and nationally
      recognized areas of high biodiversity value and include all protected areas in Liberia, the

66	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
PPAs, Key Biodiversity Areas, Ramsar Sites, Important Bird and Biodiversity Areas, Important
Plant Areas, and Alliance for Zero Extinction Sites; these are shown in figures 2.1 and 2.2.

Therefore, because almost all mining projects in Liberia will affect natural or critical natural
habitat, the issue is whether there are mitigation strategies to ensure “no net loss” where
feasible in natural habitat or “net gain” in critical habitat. Where a project affects critical
habitat, IFC Performance Standard 6 requires companies to demonstrate the following:

◗	 There are no other viable alternatives within the region for development of the project
   on modified or natural habitats that are not critical.

◗	 The project does not lead to measurable adverse impacts on those biodiversity values
   for which the critical habitat was designated, and on the ecological processes supporting
   those biodiversity values.

◗	 The project does not lead to a net reduction in the global, national, or regional
   population of any critically endangered or endangered species over a reasonable
   period.

Other Considerations with Respect to ESIA and Offsets
The effort involved in characterizing the biodiversity baseline conditions will vary depending
on the nature and scale of the project. The application of the mitigation hierarchy is
fundamental, and for those sectors, such as palm oil, that can avoid high-value sites,
avoidance should be strongly emphasized. For mining projects, where the ore body is fixed
in location, to minimize further direct habitat loss attention should be paid to the location
of access roads, waste rock dumps, tailings dams, other mine infrastructure (including
crushers, concentrators, conveyer belts, sewage treatment plant, offices, accommodations,
waste disposal facilities, and so on), and resettlement sites. Alternative engineering and
processing options should also be considered.

Attention should also be paid to induced (indirect) impacts, particularly the potential impacts
from increased in-migration, such as increased access to forest areas, land conflict, and
increased bushmeat hunting. The mining (or other) project’s impact area—to be considered
when calculating the appropriate offset area—includes the area to be affected by both the
direct and indirect impacts. It is also important to understand that not everything can be
offset. It may not be possible to offset the loss of critically endangered species, or significant
losses of endangered species or endemic species, particularly those that are confined
to habitats that are very rare in Liberia, such as montane habitats. In such circumstances,
preventing irreversible biodiversity losses might require not proceeding with the project, or
setting aside a portion of the concession area for permanent protection. A forthcoming World
Bank publication on offsets suggests a number of red flags to help determine whether offsets
could be high risk and difficult to offset. These include the following:

◗	 Areas where endemic or restricted range species are present.

◗	 Areas where highly threatened ecosystems, species, and their habitats are present.

◗	 Areas that are legally protected or of international importance.

	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	         67
      ◗	 Areas where communities are critically dependent on the natural resource base to
         maintain a traditional and cherished way of life.

      ◗	 Areas subject to competing land use claims and complex land tenure arrangements.

      However, ultimately decisions such as these that are of a strategic nature are for host
      governments to determine.

      The following aspects should be covered by all ESIAs to provide sufficient information for
      application of the biodiversity offset scheme methodology:

      ◗	 Preparation of a habitat map based on different vegetation types in the project area.

      ◗	 Identification of species of conservation concern.

      ◗	 Determination of whether the habitat is modified, natural, or critical habitat.

      ◗	 Identification of key ecological dependencies for certain species that might be affected;
         for example, forest elephants require relatively large home ranges.

      Impacts on ecosystem services should be addressed as part of the ESIA process. Ecosystem
      services cannot realistically be addressed within an offset scheme, particularly if the PPA
      is not easily accessible to communities whose access to ecosystem services has been
      adversely affected by projects. Instead, the issue of loss of ecosystem services must be
      assessed and mitigated or compensated for locally.

      One drawback with the preparation of habitat maps on a project-by-project basis is the lack
      of comparability between ESIAs. Ideally, work would be undertaken in advance to identify a
      national vegetation classification system for Liberia. This classification scheme could also be
      combined with some form of “quality criteria” to signal the extent to which such vegetation
      types are either pristine or modified. Such work is beyond the scope of the current work on
      offsets, but of broader value to conservation and development in Liberia.


      Methods and Metrics to Determine No Net Loss
      Ideally, the methodology would use a transparent and science-based approach to measure
      no net loss and net gain. However, there is no single best way to measure losses and gains,
      and it is very hard to measure ecosystems with a high degree of meaningful accuracy: some
      would argue that the use of quantitative metrics provides a false sense of accuracy. Unlike
      carbon offsets, where metrics are relatively easily comparable and exchangeable (measured
      in tons of carbon dioxide equivalent), biodiversity metrics are much more complex,
      particularly in highly biodiverse regions that are poorly surveyed.

      The use of single metrics such as area of habitat to represent biodiversity losses and gains
      is not recommended because of the complexity of ecosystems. Compound metrics, for
      example, those used in offset schemes in Victoria, Australia (Department of Environment
      and Primary Industries 2013), are considered more scientifically valid. In those cases, the
      basic currency is a composite metric—habitat hectares—which is a metric that combines


68	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
the condition and extent of native vegetation. The habitat hectare approach is considered
practical and cost-effective for Liberia and requires relatively simple site measurements.
For example, 100 hectares of forest in pristine condition would count as 100 quality
hectares (100 hectares × 100 percent quality = 100 quality hectares), whereas 100 hectares
of a slightly degraded forest at 75 percent of “optimum quality” would be expressed
as 75 quality hectares (100 hectares × 75 percent quality = 70 quality hectares). This
methodology was expanded in 2013 to include landscape-scale information. For example,
some sites are better connected to other areas of native vegetation in the landscape,
or provide more important habitat for rare or threatened species than other sites. This
landscape value of a site is captured in two scores. The first is the strategic biodiversity
score, which quantifies the site’s importance for Victoria’s biodiversity relative to other
locations across the landscape. The second is a habitat’s importance score, which is a
measure of the importance of a location in the landscape for the persistence of a particular
rare or threatened species.

A modified version of habitat hectares has been used by other mining companies, such as
Rio Tinto. Although it is increasingly expected that multiple metrics should be used, some
schemes simply use multipliers in the face of uncertainty with respect to outcomes. The
largest obligatory multipliers come under South Africa’s Western Cape offset policy, and
can require up to 30 hectares of land to be offset for every single hectare cleared in critically
endangered habitats (DEADP 2007). Although they are simple, multipliers have been based
on quite complex assessments.

The methodology proposed here tries to balance conservation imperatives and
pragmatism, with a reluctance to create a one-dimensional metric that might not be
supported by stakeholders. It should be noted that this methodology will be refined in
conjunction with stakeholders. Table 6.1 shows how this methodology compares with
some features of existing methodologies. Some aspects are similar, such as identifying
priority biodiversity features and choosing appropriate metrics, but other areas have been
streamlined. In particular, the methodology does not try to quantify precisely the area of
habitat hectares to be lost due to induced impacts. For example, it is difficult to predict the
exact scale of project-induced in-migration. Accordingly, the methodology proposes that
a standard additional buffer area should be applied to all projects; the size of this buffer
would be determined through consultation.

If abundance data are available for species (particularly large mammal data), this
methodology could be extended to incorporate that data. For example, it is possible to
multiply the area of the impact by the density of the species in the impacted area. This
calculation would enable the relationship between species density, as well as area affected,
to be factored into the approach. However, caution should be used in the interpretation
and application of abundance data. Surveys in Sapo National Park estimated 0.20 forest
elephants per square kilometer and from that calculated 124 elephants in the whole
park, the range being from 44 to 242. As can be seen, the coefficient of variation can be
high (Boafo and Massalatchi 2009). This is an indicative example, rather than an explicit
suggestion that adverse impacts on elephants ought to be amenable to offsetting.

The proposed methodology does not use counterfactual scenarios, that is, it does not
apply a discount rate to the area to be offset based on the anticipated annual rate of

      degradation at the project site for the duration of the project if the project were not to
      go ahead. Although the approximate annual rate of deforestation is known in Liberia, the
      rate of deforestation cannot be guaranteed to be zero at the offset site, which the use of
      counterfactuals implicitly assumes. Finally, the methodology does not try to quantify gains
      at the PPA. The main objective of the offset scheme is to directly improve the security
      of priority habitats against future land use change or incompatible land uses, and yield
      measurable outcomes on the ground through improved management of those areas, such
      that gains will be inevitable. PPAs are considerably larger than most project-specific offsets
      could realistically be. In addition, species-specific monitoring would be undertaken as
      part of the protected area management plan. However, it is very important to stress that
      this pragmatism depends on robust biodiversity assessments being undertaken as part of
      project ESIAs. Figure 6.3 outlines the proposed methodology.

The methodological steps may be summarized as follows:


Determine Offset Requirements (area and conservation significance)
The following methodology is proposed and will be developed further with stakeholders in
a workshop planned for 2015 in Liberia.

	 1.	 Prepare a habitat map of the project area identifying different vegetation types.

	 2.	 Determine the conservation significance of the site using the number of species of
      concern and conservation status of the ecosystem. This information could include
      those species that are threatened (endangered and critically endangered and possibly
      vulnerable) and locally (and regionally) endemic. The conservation status of the
      ecosystem or habitat could also be included. For example, much of the unmodified
      habitat in Liberia could be considered critical habitat under the fourth IFC Performance
      Standard 6 criterion (highly threatened or unique ecosystems).




	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	                        71
      	 3.	 Overlay a project infrastructure map to indicate the areas lost from direct impacts
            related to the mine footprint. The direct footprint represents the residual impact after
            incorporation of mitigation measures that influence direct impacts.

      	 4.	 Determine the induced or indirect footprint of the project. A pragmatic approach
            would be to adopt a standard distance. This distance could be based on estimated
            “avoidance distances” for species of conservation concern, although the effects of
            infrastructure on bird populations can extend up to 1 kilometer and for mammal
            populations up to 5 kilometers (Benitez-Lopez, Alkemade, and Verweij 2010). The
            determination of this distance should be based on scientific methods, taking into
            account stakeholder input.

      	 5.	 Calculate loss as measured by habitat hectares based on the direct and induced
            footprint and conservation significance of the habitat affected. The conservation
            significance could be a multiplier depending on the value of habitat. These habitat
            hectares, or multiplier hectares, determine the number of conservation credits that a
            project developer must offset.

      The cost of conservation credits should be established at an upcoming stakeholder
      workshop, planned for 2015. In general, the cost would be based upon the investment and
      recurrent costs of properly protecting and managing a habitat hectare within the offset
      protected area.

      In addition, the acceptability of multipliers to stakeholders depends on a high level of
      transparency in their development and application. This issue would also benefit from
      further engagement and discussion at the planned workshop in 2015.


      Ensure That Offset Delivers Like-for-Like or Better
      This element is qualitative and is designed to ensure that the types of habitats or species
      affected will also be represented at the offset sites. A register of potential offset sites (see
      example in table 6.2) within the expanded protected areas network would be developed;
      it would describe all available information on the nature and extent of habitats and species
      represented. In addition to the list of species present, the register would also include
      population density estimates for charismatic species (if known). It will be important to ensure
      that the offset sites support the same types of habitats and species as those being lost. If
      information is available on the population densities of some of the charismatic species, the
      population estimates at the offset sites should exceed those estimates within the area directly
      or indirectly affected by the project. For example, population estimates and confidence
      limits for chimps for Sapo National Park and Grebo and Gola National Forests were 1,517
      (95 percent confidence interval: 1,033–2,228), 352 (95 percent confidence interval: 214–578)
      and 94 (95 percent confidence interval: 39–225) individuals, respectively (Tweh et al. 2014).

      In general, ensuring permanency of an offset beyond the life of a mining project can be
      very difficult, although for a national offset scheme in Liberia, the offset areas (as part of
      the protected areas network) would be enshrined in law. With effective financial planning
      and continued stakeholder support, conservation of the protected areas network should
      continue in perpetuity.

                           To address these threats, the Management Plans would propose a

                           and management, along with alternative livelihoods assistance to local
                           communities. The offset credits would finance a defined portion of these

Operational and Management Considerations
for a National Offset Scheme
This section considers the institutional roles and responsibilities for establishing a
biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia that is linked to the expansion of the protected
areas network. It also considers the legal aspects of establishing an offset scheme and
governance issues. Although these aspects are relatively straightforward given the explicit
and legally prescribed mandate of the FDA for the protected areas network, a number of
related issues and challenges are highlighted.



	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	           73
      Institutional Roles and Responsibilities for Implementation
      of a Biodiversity Offset Scheme

      Central Role for the FDA and Roles for Other Organizations
      As outlined in chapters 4 and 5, the proposed approach for an offset scheme in Liberia is
      inextricably tied to the expansion of the protected areas network. Given the central role that
      the FDA plays in the establishment and ongoing management of newly protected areas
      (see “Which Institutions Should Be Involved in Support of a Biodiversity Offset Scheme?”
      and “Process for Creating New Protected Areas” in chapter 5), its mandate is to play a
      central role in the creation, day-to-day management, and oversight of an offset scheme in
      Liberia. Clearly, the process of expanding the protected areas network will require in-depth
      engagement with a wide range of interested stakeholders, including local communities.
      However, determining and agreeing on how the offset will work in practice and how mining
      companies (or potentially other developers) can establish their offset requirements—the area
      and type of habitat to be protected and species of concern—will also require a consultative
      process to be undertaken, involving resource developers and conservation interests.

      The process of establishing a robust information base on the baseline biodiversity within
      PPAs that would support biodiversity offsets is well underway as a result of work related
      to the Expansion of Protected Areas Network (EXPAN) Project of the World Bank and
      other survey work. However, it is by no means complete. Information gaps remain on the
      status of biodiversity within PPAs that would enable fully informed choices to be made for
      preferred offset locations, to ensure that the principle of like-for-like or better is respected.
      Filling these information gaps is an area in which nongovernmental organizations (NGOs)
      such as the Society for Nature Conservation in Liberia, the Save My Future Foundation,
      Conservation International, Fauna and Flora International, the Wild Chimpanzee
      Foundation, and work undertaken by the Max Planck Institute have a potentially important
      role to play. In addition, further resources made available for a follow-up project to EXPAN,
      if forthcoming, could provide another source of support to completing the information base
      on biodiversity in PPAs. It is important that people who conduct biological surveys in Liberia
      share their data with the FDA, which would then input it into a database.

      From an operational perspective, the FDA also has the responsibility to prepare and
      implement the management plan for each protected area, and to undertake related
      activities such as demarcating and patrolling the protected area boundaries, removing alien
      invasive species, and instituting management measures to restore partially degraded areas
      of habitat in support of species of conservation concern. Although various funding sources
      could be applied to these activities (including funds provided through an offset scheme),
      these basic responsibilities currently reside with the FDA. However, the draft National
      Wildlife Conservation and Protected Areas Management Law 2014 makes provisions for not-
      for-profit or private organizations to become involved in protected areas management. In
      addition, there may be scope to involve local communities in aspects of PPA management,
      in exchange for allowing the controlled harvesting of resources in the park.

      The FDA is also responsible for monitoring within protected areas. However, given the
      proposed role that newly established protected areas would have in providing offset
      opportunities for mining projects, some enhanced form of monitoring will likely be

required. A range of not-for-profit, conservation-focused organizations (international and
domestic) currently active in Liberia have a potentially powerful role to play in developing
indicators and collecting and analyzing the data necessary to determine whether the offset
is achieving its stated objectives. The FDA and NGOs should create opportunities to ensure
the active participation of local communities in monitoring efforts.

As suggested in “Potential for Offsets and Other Forms of Compensatory Mitigation to
Address Conservation Challenges” in chapter 4 and elaborated earlier in this chapter, the
proposed approach in Liberia relies on establishing biodiversity or conservation credits in
advance of project-related impacts taking place. A biodiversity credit is a unit of gain in
biodiversity. In existing biodiversity-credit-trading schemes, government typically defines
a number of credit types, which may be described as habitat types or in metrics related to
particular species (for example, area of land that supports a breeding pair of a species). For
the offset scheme, the impacts of mining projects would be expressed as a requirement
for a certain number of different credit types on the basis of like-for-like or better. In the
context of Liberia, the basis for establishing credits might best be determined through a
multistakeholder workshop, which may also consider the question of the price that ought
to be applied to credits. In practice, the credit price should reflect the cost of protecting or
managing an area that is like-for-like or better.


Dealing with the Challenge of Capacity Constraints
The challenges relating to capacity constraints at the FDA and the inherent tension
between the agency’s twin roles of conservation and commercial exploitation of forests
are discussed in “Overview of Institutional Strengths and Weaknesses” in chapter 5. To
overcome this tension, a project implementation unit could be established in the FDA with
a mandate to work solely on establishing an offsets scheme and related activities or the
scheme could be included within the REDD implementation unit. This approach would
help to address current capacity constraints and ensure that adequate attention is paid to
successfully establishing the scheme.


Legal and Governance Aspects of Establishing an Offset Scheme
The Biodiversity Offset Implementation Handbook indicates that it may be an attractive
option for the offset activities to take place “within a protected area or form part of the
broader protected area system, since the framework of national protected status may
help guarantee long term management—especially in the case where funding is assured”
(BBOP 2009b, 50). However, it also includes the caveat that such an offset must be able
to demonstrate that it will bring about additional conservation outcomes. The question
of additionality in Liberia is addressed in “Summary of Findings and Way Forward” in
chapter 4. It notes that given the slow rate of progress toward establishing protected areas
in Liberia, using a national offset scheme to help strengthen the protected areas network
offers the potential for true additionality.

Because the proposed approach to a biodiversity offsets scheme is linked to Liberia’s
protected areas system, the National Forestry Reform Law (2006), which deals with the
establishment and management of protected areas, will provide the legal basis for
establishing offset areas (see “Do Legal or Policy Anchors Currently Exist?” in chapter 5).



	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	       75
      The challenges and complexities that often arise in establishing offsets due to issues
      relating to land tenure or usufruct rights are simplified by linking into the protected areas
      network. In principle, protected areas are public lands that have been designated for nature
      conservation; therefore, issues relating to land tenure ought not to arise. Any usufruct
      rights that local communities enjoy would have to be identified and addressed during the
      gazetting and establishment of management plans as part of the process of granting user
      and management rights to communities under section 10 of the National Forestry Reform
      Law of 2006.

      However, one area of uncertainty arises if some PPAs are not public lands and are subject
      to community deeds. The draft Land Rights Policy (2013) provides for the establishment
      of Customary Protected Areas upon request of the community or on initiative of the
      government in collaboration with the community. Such areas “may include, but are not
      limited to: wetlands, major water sources, forest set aside by a community for eco-tourism,
      areas used by secret societies, and land upon which is located a sacred plant, tree, or
      other object with special ancestral significance” (Land Commission 2013, 17–18.) As
      noted in “Summary of Findings and Way Forward” in chapter 5, it is unclear whether the
      current regulatory provisions in the National Forestry Reform Law of 2006 would cover the
      establishment of Customary Protected Areas. It is also unclear whether all of the activities
      that may form the basis for the designation of Customary Protected Areas are compatible
      with conservation.

      With regard to the governance of an offset scheme in Liberia, the role of the FDA is
      central with oversight from the EPA. In addition, there is merit in establishing an advisory
      committee of parties that are currently actively involved in conservation activities in Liberia
      and related scientific research, other line ministries with responsibility for allocating
      concessions (for example, the Ministry of Lands, Mines and Energy or the Ministry of
      Agriculture) or with an interest in conservation (for instance, tourism), as well as a number
      of other individuals who are highly experienced in establishing biodiversity offsets. In
      addition, community members and resource developers should be represented. The
      advisory committee could provide scientific and technical advice to the FDA to ensure that
      the details of the scheme are technically and scientifically sound and are combined with the
      pragmatism required to ensure implementation proceeds. This approach would help ensure
      that arrangements for expanding and managing the protected areas network embody the
      principles of good governance for protected areas (Borrini-Feyerabend et al. 2013) and are
      responsive to these principles (table 6.3).


      Costs and Long-Term Financing Arrangements
      for a Biodiversity Offset Scheme
      After determining the cost of implementing the offset, offset planners need to determine
      where the financial resources to meet these costs will come from and how they will be
      managed. Various means of securing long-term financing for a project-specific biodiversity
      offset can be pursued. One is to create a conservation trust fund (CTF) designed to provide
      consistent funding over a specific period to implement offset management activities.
      Another is to use project finance. The approach to a biodiversity offset scheme proposed
      for Liberia may either preclude or favor certain options.

      Determining the Costs of Implementing a Biodiversity Offset Scheme
      Before determining the preferred funding mechanism, the magnitude of costs to establish
      the offset scheme must be determined. The establishment of biodiversity offsets results
      in a range of different costs for regulatory authorities, project developers, and local
      communities. These typically include the cost elements listed in table 6.4, which includes
      a description of the cost elements and provides some commentary on the situation in
      Liberia that has a bearing on either the scale of these costs or on the responsibility for
      meeting these costs.

      The five major cost elements in expanding Liberia’s protected areas network comprise the
      following:

      	 1.	 Capacity building: Staff training.

      	 2.	 Establishment costs: Costs of physical demarcation, protected area infrastructure,
            baseline biodiversity monitoring, compensation for communities, and so on.

      	 3.	 Management and equipment costs: Ongoing costs of managing the offset area,
            patrolling, maintaining boundaries, and other activities.

      	 4.	 Monitoring costs: Costs of monitoring the offset to ensure that conservation outcomes
            are achieved.

      	 5.	 Administrative costs: The costs incurred by the authorities in administering and
            regulating the offsets scheme.

      Because the expansion of the protected areas network was the exclusive responsibility of
      government, the first three of these cost elements would normally fall on the FDA and are
      likely to have been quantified under the World Bank’s EXPAN project. However, the scheme
      envisages some form of contribution from resource developers in the form of biodiversity or
      conservation credits.

      As noted in chapter 4, this would fall short of true market-based systems such as those in
      Australia or the United States where the value of the biodiversity or mitigation credits may
      vary depending on the quality of the habitat protected as well as the vagaries of supply and
      demand. However, implementation of such systems in Liberia is unrealistic.

      Because of the practical constraints to ensuring the long-term sustainability of biodiversity
      or conservation credits outside PPAs, it is important that these credits be linked to
      existing PPAs. Given the rate of progress toward establishing protected areas in Liberia,
      using aggregated offsets in this manner provides the potential for true additionality.
      Conservation credits could be applied to the establishment and maintenance of PPAs, and
      to compensation for losses to communities arising from their establishment. Individual
      project-related contributions from companies would be tied to specific PPAs that best
      address the offset requirements for that project.

      The budget for the FDA conservation department in 2013 was US$592,320 and they found
      it difficult to manage the existing three protected areas (plus some activities in the Gola,
      Grebo, and Wonegizi PPAs), let alone consider an expanded protected network. FFI (2013)
      calculates that to support all 14 sites (including the three existing ones) would cost about
      $6.2 million under a baseline scenario rather than an “ideal” one with more resources.
      There is clearly a significant shortfall.


      Conservation Trust Funds as a Potential Means of Financing
      a Biodiversity Offset Scheme
      During the past two decades, CTFs have been established in more than 50 developing
      countries and transition economies (TNC 2012). In most cases, CTFs are nongovernmental,
      legally independent grant-making institutions whose primary aim is to raise and invest
      funds, which enables them to grant financial resources for biodiversity conservation and
      related sustainable development purposes.

      Although CTFs are typically independent of government, in many instances government
      officials sit on (and may chair) the governing boards of CTFs. Representatives of civil
      society and the private sector also serve on the governing boards and help shape the
      investment policies of CTFs. Although CTFs are usually not controlled by governments
      (nor are part of a government ministry or agency), they are often explicitly aimed at
      promoting and implementing national biodiversity conservation policies and strategies.
      In Latin America and the Caribbean, for example, 22 CTFs in 15 countries have helped
      supplement government funding for 660 protected areas, of which 455 are public protected
      areas, 150 are private, 45 correspond to traditional population areas, and 10 are of other
      classification (World Bank 2012).

      The type of expenditure supported by CTFs has varied between and within countries and
      has included covering part of recurring operational costs and cost-sharing of the capital
      investments required to meet the objectives of individual protected areas or the protected
      areas network as a whole. These expenditures have included investments in equipment and
      infrastructure, training and community participation programs, and scientific research and
      biodiversity monitoring. Most CTFs have included fund management plan formulation and
      institutional strengthening activities for organizations responsible for the management of
      the protected areas network. The costs of demarcating boundaries, protection, and training
      of park guards are often covered by these funds.

      Most CTFs in Africa (table 6.5) serve as grant-making institutions that provide financing for
      a broad range of conservation and sustainable development projects linked to ensuring
      the success of protected areas (or other focal areas of support). The governing boards
      determine funding priorities and grant allocations. Grants are allocated only to projects that
      contribute to satisfying the mission of the CTF. Some of the CTFs also provide loans and
      investment capital to support local businesses.

Sources and Management of CTF Funding
CTFs can receive capital from multiple sources such as multilateral and bilateral donors,
governments, foundations, NGOs, individuals, and from revenue-generating activities.
Some CTFs have also benefited from the capital raised through debt-for-nature swaps,1
wherein a creditor country “forgives” part of the public bilateral debt of a debtor nation in
exchange for environmental commitments from that country.

The resources managed by CTFs are allocated through different types of financial
mechanisms. Many CTFs begin by managing a single endowment or sinking fund to
support a given protected area or a network of protected areas, but over time they may
evolve into multifund entities that manage a combination of endowments, sinking funds,
or revolving funds (Spergel and Mikitin 2013). Endowment funds are intended to preserve
capital in perpetuity and only provide grants from the interest or returns earned. Sinking
funds allow the front-end capital investment to be used over a long period. The entire
principal and investment income is disbursed over a fairly long period (typically 10 to
20 years) until it is completely spent (and sinks to zero). Revolving funds are designed to
recover the resources that have been allocated through repayment of grants on established
terms (for example, interest rate and period of the loan). The 2012 Conservation Trust
Fund Investment Survey (Mathias and Victurine 2013) indicated that the 36 CTFs surveyed
managed a total of US$672 million in endowment and sinking funds, ranging from
US$1.3 million to more than US$120 million in assets under management. Of the 36 CTFs,
11 were in Africa.

The norms and practices of nearly all CTFs existing as of 2013 have been compiled and
published as Practice Standards for Conservation Trust Funds through an initiative of the
Conservation Finance Alliance. The Conservation Finance Alliance is a global voluntary
network of all CTFs, major donors to CTFs, and many other conservation organizations
and experts aimed at addressing the challenge of sustainable financing for biodiversity
conservation. The Practice Standards identify six key factors considered essential to
designing, managing, and monitoring for CTFs.

◗	 Adequate, documented governance structures and processes that ensure government’s
   participation but not control of the CTF.

◗	 Clearly defined scope of operations that covers grant making, strategic planning,
   and interactions between the government and other partners including companies,
   communities, and donors.

◗	 Administration, covering delineation of roles and responsibilities, operational manuals,
   and financial management procedures including audit.

      Potential Applicability of Conservation Trust Funds in Liberia
      There are several key advantages of establishing a Liberian CTF to support an offset
      scheme:

      ◗	 Payments by mining companies to offset their impacts on biodiversity (in return for
         biodiversity credits) would go to an investment vehicle that is dedicated to the expansion
         and support of the protected areas network. This would ensure that fees paid by mining
         firms would not go toward unconsolidated government revenue, but instead would be
         earmarked for supporting biodiversity offset activities.

      ◗	 Revenue created from biodiversity credits alone will almost certainly be insufficient to
         support the expansion and maintenance of the protected areas network; establishing a
         CTF would enable funding from other sources to be secured.

      ◗	 Annual payments directly from the developer over the life of the project to support
         offsets could also be made directly to a CTF.

      ◗	 CTFs can provide financing aimed at improving the lives of communities local to offsets
         or protected areas, especially those affected in some way by a protected area.

      ◗	 A CTF can strengthen stakeholder participation, as well as improve coordination
         between donor programs and activities with national or regional conservation plans and
         strategies.


      A Review of African CTFs
      Even though CTFs offer a number of potential advantages, they can also be administratively
      costly. Further work is needed to establish whether adequate resources could likely be
      secured to justify the costs of establishing and administering a CTF in Liberia. As a first step,
      an initial review of other CTFs in Africa has been undertaken (table 6.5). This review included
      a preliminary analysis of 12 CTFs established in Africa listed in the 2012 Conservation
      Trust Fund Investment Survey (Mathias and Victurine 2013), along with the BIOFUND in
      Mozambique, which is currently being established. On the basis of this initial review, it was
      evident that the principle of establishing a CTF in support of an expanded protected areas
      network has a number of precedents in Africa, which have attracted varying degrees of
      support. Further interviews with CTF personnel and further analysis of the African CTFs that
      have a significant focus on protected areas was also undertaken, to supplement the limited
      public disclosure by many of these CTFs. This analysis is summarized below and elaborated
      on in appendix 3.

Focus on Protected Areas
Of the 13 CTFs, 9 already have an exclusive or significant focus on protected areas, so the
principle of directing CTF resources to protected areas management is well established.
Some CTFs, such as Mulanje Mountain in Malawi and the Bwindi Mgahinga Conservation
Trust Fund (BMCT) in Uganda, concentrate on one or two areas. BMCT is focused on
supporting conservation actions around the Bwindi Impenetrable Forest and Mgahinga
Gorilla National Parks. The Sangha Trinational Foundation is a cross-border trust fund
that operates in Cameroon, the Central African Republic, and the Republic of Congo. The
Madagascar Biodiversity Fund was created to help that country meet its commitment to
triple its protected areas.

Given the challenges surrounding alternative livelihoods, several of the CTFs (Tany Meva in
Madagascar, BMCT in Uganda, and the Eastern Arc Fund in Tanzania) are strongly focused on
communities to help reduce impacts on protected areas. World Heritage is a particular remit of
the African World Heritage Fund. All the CTFs conduct a fairly broad spectrum of conservation
activities: protected areas management (for example, park management), community
economic development (for example, community training, green energy, livelihoods support),
and education and applied research (medicinal use of plants, for instance).

      Sources of Funding
      The major sources of finance for CTFs in Africa include multilateral agencies, bilateral
      agencies, not-for-profit organizations with a focus on biodiversity, and others with a broader
      focus (for example, the MacArthur Foundation). In addition, debt relief is a significant
      source of funding to African CTFs. However, fewer opportunities for debt-for-nature swaps
      may be available if debt has already been reduced through previous swap arrangements.
      Also, the U.S. Congress has limited the U.S. Agency for International Development’s
      (USAID’s) ability to provide endowments to funds that use public money (though resources
      can still be provided to sinking funds).

      At least 4 of the 13 CTFs have other sources of finance. The Tanzania Forest Fund raises
      significant amounts of revenue from a levy on fees applied to forest uses, which provides
      substantial income to the fund (US$1.2 million in 2013). Such levies might offer one potential
      revenue stream if a Liberian CTF were to be established. Two other CTFs described efforts
      to generate tourism income though these schemes were not yet considered successful. One
      CTF is considering the potential use of biodiversity offsets from extractive industries as a
      source of income. Two respondents were not very positive about carbon trading, with one
      CTF business plan describing the probability of any significant financial inflows from carbon as
      “increasingly remote” because of the insufficient price of carbon on international markets.


      Type and Amount of Funding
      The 13 CTFs have set up endowment funds, and at least four also have sinking funds to
      cover operations and activities. The value of the capital held by the African CTFs ranges
      from US$4.4 million to US$57 million (figure 6.4).2 Several CTFs have estimated target
      amounts of capital in their financial forecasting and are working toward these goals. One
      CTF suggested that an endowment fund should have a minimum of US$10 million to be a
      viable. Another stated that US$30 million to US$35 million is necessary for a CTF to operate
      without the need for ongoing fund-raising.


      Set-Up Costs
      In many cases, costs for the set-up period are funded separately from the endowment
      fund and are financed by donors (for example, the U.K. Department for International
      Development, KwF Development Bank, and the Global Environment Facility) (and
      sometimes with in-kind technical support from others such as World University Service).
      Five CTFs shared data on their set-up budgets, but they are difficult to compare given that
      they cover varying time frames and in many cases include the initiation of conservation
      projects. The lowest figure reported was US$300,000; two CTFs reported US$600,000;
      the remaining two reported US$1.8 million and US$2.4million. One respondent suggested
      that set-up costs, not including the initiation of conservation activities, are closer to
      US$150,00–US$200,000.


      Management Costs
      A number of CTFs shared information on annual budgets. Although it is difficult to compare
      budget data between institutions that have different mandates, scopes, and operational
      structures, it is interesting to note that four CTF interviewees reported administration

and operations budgets of approximately US$400,000–US$500,000. Five of the CTFs also
have budgets for conservation projects and activities of between US$1.35 million and
US$2.5 million. Eight CTFs provided data on the proportion of expenditures that go toward
administrative and operational costs; this figure ranged between 15 percent and 40 percent
of the overall budget. Six of the CTFs spent 25 percent or less. Some interviewees said they
aim to spend 20 percent or less.


Governance
The CTFs interviewed demonstrated a high level of awareness of good practices regarding
CTFs. All had a constitution, trust deed, or related documents. Respondents emphasized
the need to establish a good constitution. All nine of the CTFs interviewed have
independent boards of eight to twelve members. Board members are generally selected
for their individual expertise covering legal, juridical, investment and financial, academic,
NGO, and community backgrounds. A number of CTF boards have one or two government
representatives selected by relevant ministries (such as environment or natural resources).
Others also have donor representatives.

Almost all CTFs have governance structures in place to oversee and support the integrity
of grant-making activities, but the level of disclosure by CTFs varies considerably. Details
on fund managers and related fees are particularly weak. Where disclosure does take
place, some annual reports are a number of years out of date. Transparency of the CTFs
considered in this report is mixed. Although all interviewees spoke of reporting policies,
the public availability of information is not a systematic priority for most of the CTFs. Two
of the CTFs in the group of 13 did not have websites and several others did not have up-
to-date material.


	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	              89
      If the decision is made to establish a Liberian CTF, it is recommended that high standards
      of governance, transparency, and disclosure be integral to the CTF design from the outset,
      drawing on available good practice resources (Spergel and Mikitin 2013; BBOP 2009b).
      According to the CTF Practice Standards published in 2013, it is generally useful to have
      some government-approved members on the CTF’s governing body to ensure sufficient
      coordination and harmonization of the CTF’s activities with government policies and
      institutions (Spergel and Mikitin 2013).

      As a next step, it would be valuable to engage potential providers of funds to explore their
      willingness, in principle, to consider contributing to a Liberian CTF. Further work is also
      needed to estimate the funds that could likely be obtained through the sale of biodiversity
      credits to resource developers in Liberia. Last, the potential to secure additional sources of
      finance to provide a revenue stream for a Liberian CTF should be explored in more detail.
      This exploration should include the Tanzanian model of imposing a levy on forest uses in
      support of conservation as well as the future potential of selling carbon credits from PPAs,
      recognizing that no legal framework for identification or trade of carbon credits currently
      exists in Liberia (Forest Carbon Partnership Facility 2012). See figure 6.5 for an example of
      the potential organization of such a trust fund.

90	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
The Role of REDD+ and Links to the Biodiversity Offset Scheme
and the PPA Network
Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) is a scheme offering
incentives to developing countries to reduce emissions from forested lands and invest in low-
carbon paths to sustainable development. “REDD+” goes beyond deforestation and forest
degradation to include the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests, and
enhancement of forest carbon stocks. Liberia is engaging proactively in the REDD agenda.
In 2013 the country received a US$3.6 million grant from the World Bank Forest Carbon
Partnership Facility to support implementation of the Readiness Preparation Proposal. Liberia
has also secured significant additional funding from the government of Norway.

Flora and Fauna International is working with local partners and communities to develop
two REDD+ demonstration projects. At the project site in Wonegizi PPA, the project
is developing proof of concept of a strategy to implement REDD+ in the context of a
protected area. The aim is to demonstrate that REDD finance can provide additional finance
to highly resource constrained protected areas, and it is possible that a biodiversity offset
scheme and REDD initiatives could be combined in some way to enhance funding.


Are Non-Trust Fund Alternatives for Financing Biodiversity Offsets Viable?
For project-specific offsets—in which the cost of establishing the offset is borne by the
project developer—project finance is a reasonable option for financing the offset as part
of the overall project costs. This approach is also viable for an aggregated offsets scheme
in which a group of extractives or other companies agree to pool resources to establish
an offset. However, for a national biodiversity offset scheme proposed in Liberia, which is
linked to the government-led expansion of the protected areas network, project finance
is not a viable alternative because the scheme is not directly linked to a single project.
However, resource developers may choose to cover the costs of contributing to the scheme
as part of a project finance package.

During the establishment of CTFs in Africa, bilateral and multilateral agencies (notably the
World Bank, the Global Environment Facility, KfW, the French Development Agency, and
USAID) have provided critically important funds to support start-up and establishment
costs. The World Bank’s Consolidation of Liberia Protected Area Network Project (COPAN)
and EXPAN projects have already provided substantial and much-needed support to the
expansion of Liberia’s protected areas network (through GEF grants). However, it is highly
unlikely that bilateral and multilateral agencies would be willing to support the recurring
costs of supporting an expanded protected areas network in Liberia through lending
instruments in the medium term, much less in perpetuity. Therefore, it is recommended that
the option of establishing a CTF to support the expansion of the protected areas network
be pursued (as outlined in “Legal and Governance Aspects of Establishing a National
Biodiversity Offset Scheme” in this chapter).


Next Phase
In the next phase of this project, the World Bank in collaboration with the government of
Liberia will explore in more detail the feasibility of setting up a CTF and select a possible



	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	    91
      pilot site for the offset scheme. In addition, further consideration will need to be given to the
      question of how delivery risks might be dealt with if the resources allocated by a CTF fail to
      deliver improved conservation outcomes. Finally, additional thought should be given to the
      scale and timing of payments to CTFs, to link them to key decision gates for mining projects.


      Summary of Findings and Way Forward
      The technical and process feasibility challenges associated with establishing a biodiversity
      offset scheme are greatly simplified by explicitly linking the approach in Liberia to
      expanding the protected areas network.

      The FDA has the mandate to play the central role in the creation of and the day-to-day
      management and oversight of an offset scheme in Liberia, and the EPA should have an
      oversight role. However, the World Bank (or other development partners) can play a key
      supporting role in the process of determining and agreeing on how the offset will work in
      practice and how mining companies (or potentially other developers) can establish their
      offset requirements.

      The challenges and complexities that often arise in establishing offsets due to issues
      relating to land tenure or usufruct rights over land are simplified greatly by linking into
      the protected areas network. In principle, these areas are public lands that have been
      designated for nature conservation, so issues relating to land tenure ought not arise. Any
      usufruct rights that local communities enjoy would have to be identified and addressed as
      part of the process of gazettement and establishment of Management Plans.

      The proposed approach in Liberia relies on establishing biodiversity or conservation credits
      in advance through the PPAs to support the scheme. The impacts of mining projects would
      be expressed as a requirement for a certain number of different credit types on the basis of
      “like-for-like or better.”

      One area of uncertainty arises if some of the PPAs are not public lands and are subject
      to community deeds. The draft Land Rights Policy (2013) provides for the establishment
      of Customary Protected Areas upon request of the community or on initiative of the
      government in collaboration with the community. It is unclear whether the current regulatory
      provisions would cover the establishment of Customary Protected Areas, nor whether all
      the prescribed activities that may form the basis for the designation of Customary Protected
      Areas are compatible with conservation objectives.

      The potential for CTFs to provide a sustainable source of finance for the biodiversity offset
      scheme has been explored. Most CTFs in Africa serve as grant-making institutions that
      provide financing for a broad range of conservation and sustainable development projects
      linked to ensuring the success of protected areas (or other focal areas of support). Some
      of the CTFs also provide loans and investment capital to support the development of local
      businesses.

      One key advantage of establishing a CTF to financially support the scheme is that payments
      by mining companies to offset their impacts on biodiversity would be dedicated to the
      expansion and support of the protected areas network and earmarked for supporting


92	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
offsetting activities. Another key advantage is that the revenue created from conservation or
biodiversity credits in isolation will almost certainly be insufficient to support the expansion
and maintenance of the protected areas network, and establishing a CTF would enable
funding from other sources to be secured.

The implications arising from these findings are as follows:

◗	 Determining the need for an offset:  It is important that the ESIAs being prepared in
   Liberia include sufficient information on biodiversity to not only assess risks and impacts,
   but also to determine the need for an offset. Some capacity building within the EPA is
   essential.

◗	 A pragmatic methodology for calculating conservation credits required:  The
   methodology proposed in this chapter has a quantitative component (which takes
   account of the direct and indirect impacts as measured by hectares) but also a qualitative
   element that considers “like-for-like or better.” A number of suboptions could be
   discussed at the next workshop in Liberia.

◗	 Overcoming inherent tension between the FDA’s twin roles of conservation and
   commercial exploitation:  A project implementation unit could be established in the FDA
   with a mandate to work solely on establishing a biodiversity offsets scheme and related
   activities (such as gazetting of PPAs). This approach would help address current capacity
   constraints and ensure that adequate attention is paid to successfully establishing the
   scheme. In addition, NGOs currently active in Liberia have a potentially powerful role
   to play in developing indicators and collecting and analyzing the data necessary to
   determine whether the offset is achieving its stated objectives.

◗	 Convening a workshop to agree on a basis for establishing biodiversity or conservation
   credits and price:  Given that a true market-based system is not appropriate for Liberia,
   the basis for establishing credits would best be done through a multistakeholder
   workshop, which could also consider the question of the price that ought to be applied
   to such credits. The government, in collaboration with the World Bank, might be best
   placed to convene such a workshop.

◗	 Need for further clarity regarding land tenure in PPAs:  The status of land ownership
   within some PPAs has been called into question and clarification should be a priority.
   In addition, further clarification should be sought on whether (1) current regulatory
   provisions would cover the establishment of Customary Protected Areas and (2) all the
   prescribed activities that may form the basis for their designation are compatible with
   conservation objectives.

◗	 Establish an advisory committee in support of a national biodiversity offset
   scheme:  Although the FDA must play the central role, there is merit in establishing an
   advisory committee representing organizations actively involved in conservation activities
   in Liberia, the scientific research community, individuals experienced in establishing
   biodiversity offsets, communities, and resource developers. The committee could
   provide scientific and technical advice to the FDA to engender technical and scientific
   efficacy combined with the pragmatism required to ensure implementation proceeds.


	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	       93
      ◗	 Further work needed on establishing a Liberian CTF:  The principle of establishing a
         CTF in support of an expanded protected areas network has a number of precedents
         in Africa, which have attracted varying degrees of support. Further interviews with and
         analysis of the African CTFs was undertaken, given that public disclosure by many CTFs is
         limited. Outreach to potential providers of funds to explore their willingness, in principle,
         to contribute to a Liberian CTF and the potential to secure additional sources of finance
         to provide a revenue stream should be explored in more detail.

      ◗	 Further work to understand the scale of the fees that might be raised through the
         sale of biodiversity or conservation credits:  Further work is also needed to estimate
         the funds that could likely be obtained through the sale of conservation or biodiversity
         credits to resource developers in Liberia.

            mostly directed to countries in Latin America, it may be worth exploring eligibility for Liberia.

	Chapter 6: Methodological Challenges of Implementing a National Biodiversity Offset Scheme	             95
        7. A Road Map for Liberia:
        Summary of Ways Forward
      This chapter presents a first-approximation road map for Liberia to implement a national
      biodiversity offset scheme, if the government chooses to do so. Figure 7.1 groups the
      various actions required to implement the road map into three interrelated categories:
      (1) actions that generate information to enable the development of a biodiversity offset
      scheme; (2) actions that support the scheme through, for example, prohibiting certain
      activities or enhancing rational allocation of concessions; and (3) actions that are central
      to establishing the offset scheme.


      Conclusion
      Implementing a national biodiversity offset scheme in Liberia will be challenging, and a
      number of different elements need to come together for it to happen. However, some of
      those elements are already present. Liberia supports extraordinary biodiversity and has
      identified a representative network of proposed protected areas over a period of many
      years. The challenges associated with establishing the scheme are greatly simplified by
      explicitly linking the approach to expanding the protected areas network. Liberia also has
      a legislative framework that supports this process. The more significant challenges relate
      to the capacity of the Forestry Development Authority and the Environmental Protection
      Agency to support such a scheme and the issue of land tenure and the fact that alternative
      livelihoods and food security are not easily solved and need to be addressed as part of the
      process of gazetting new protected areas. However some of these issues will be addressed
      as part of the Liberia REDD+ Investment Program. The World Bank (or other development
      partners) and civil society organizations play a key role in supporting this process. A
      workshop will be organized in conjunction with the government of Liberia and other
      stakeholders in 2015 to update progress on some of the issues highlighted in the report.

    Appendix 3: Additional Details to
    Support the Establishment of a
    Conservation Trust Fund in Liberia
A3.1  Comparative Review of Existing Conservation Trust Funds in Africa
A3.1.1  Background
This overview is prepared as part of a broader study on using a Conservation Trust Fund
(CTF) as a potential means of financing aggregated biodiversity offsets in Liberia. An
initial review of publicly accessible sources of information on CTFs in Africa indicate that
the principle of establishing a CTF to support a protected area network has a number
of precedents. However, the public sources of information are limited and a series of
interviews were carried out with representatives from the African Conservation Trust Fund
in order to identify lessons learned and explore good practice examples.

Thirteen CTFs were considered, twelve established, and one is currently being established.
Interviews were carried out with respondents from nine of these CTFs using a questionnaire
broadly based on good practice standards as outlined by the Conservation Finance Alliance
(CFA).1 The resulting data and recommendations presented in this report cover:

◗	 Overview information;

◗	 Funding;

◗	 Fund-raising;

◗	 Governance and operations;

◗	 Investment management; and

◗	 Partnerships and transparency.


A3.1.2  Overview

Date Established and Legal Framework
All of the thirteen CTFs considered in this report were established between 1994 and
2011, only two before 2000, with most of them (seven) in the period between 2000 and
2010. The nine CTFs for which interviews were carried out are all legally created entities
within their countries of operation with the exception of one (the Tri-National Sangha
Foundation) which is registered in the UK. These CTFs described are registered as a variety
of organizations: foundations, trusts, charitable entities, and not-for-profit groups.

Purpose
Nine of the thirteen CTFs have an exclusive or significant focus on one or more protected
areas, either a single reserve (such as Mulanje Mountain (MMCT) in Malawi) or a number
of Parks or Reserves, and sometimes across borders (such as the Trin-National Sangha
Foundation). Many of the CTFs are playing a very significant role in the conservation of



	                                                                                              	   107
       Protected Areas in their countries (such as the Madagascar Biodiversity Fund which was
       created to help the country meet its commitment to triple its protected areas). Several of
       the CTFs have a strong focus on communities (Tany Meva in Madagascar, Bwindi Mhahinga
       (BMCT) in Uganda and the Eastern Arc Fund (EAMCEF) in Tanzania) and one, the African
       World Heritage Fund (AWHF) has a particular remit on World Heritage. All the CTFs have
       a fairly broad spectrum of conservation activities: protected area management (e.g., park
       management), community economic development (e.g., community training, green energy,
       livelihoods support), education and applied research (e.g., medicinal use of plants).


       A3.1.3  Funding

       Type of Fund and Capitalization
       The thirteen CTFs have set up Endowment Funds, and at least four also have Sinking Funds
       to cover operations and/or activities. All but one of the nine interviewed CTFs have received
       capital from multiple sources, including multilateral and bilateral donors, governments,
       foundations, non-governmental organizations and from debt-for-nature swaps.

       The value of the capital held by the CTFs that were reviewed varies from USD$4.4m
       to USD$57m.2 Several CTFs have estimated target amounts of capital in their financial
       forecasting and are working towards these goals. In a general way, one suggested that
       an Endowment Fund should have a minimum of $10m to be a viable. Another stated that
       $30–35m is necessary for a CTF to operate without the need for ongoing fund-raising.


       Annual Budget Information
       A number of CTFs shared information on annual budgets. Although it is difficult to compare
       budget data between institutions that have different mandates, scopes and operational
       structures, it is surprising to note that four CTF interviewees reported similar administration

                                                    Admin & Operations costs are 25% or
$400–500k. Five of the CTFs also have budgets
                                                    less of annual budgets for half the CTFs
for conservation projects/activities that are
                                                    interviewed.
within a similar range, between $1.35m–$2.5m.
Eight CTFs provided data on the proportion
spent on administrative and operational costs; this figure spanned a range between 15%–
33% of overall budget with one outlier at 40%. Most of the CTFs (six) spent 25% or less.
Some interviewees said they aim to spend 20% or less.


Setup and Fund-Raising
Information was gathered on the setup phase for CTFs; this typically involves planning,
institutional and legal establishment, financial forecasting and administrative setup. In
many cases, costs for the setup period are funded separately to the Endowment Fund and
provided by donors (e.g., by DfID, KwF, GEF) (sometimes with in-kind technical support
from others such as the World University Services). Five CTFs shared data on their setup
budgets; these are difficult to compare as they cover varying timeframes and in many cases
include the initiation of conservation projects. The figures were $300k, $600k for two of the
CTFs, $1.8m and $2.4m. One respondent suggested that setup costs—not including the
initiation of conservation activities—are closer to $150k–200k.

 Many respondents strongly emphasized the need for funding which is separate from the
 endowment capital to cover expenses related to setup.


Fund-Raising
All respondents discussed the need for fund-raising in relation to raising capital and in
relation to operating and project costs. The latter becomes necessary when annual income
from the Fund is insufficient to cover costs, for example before the Fund reaches target
capital, or when performance of the Fund is poor. The majority of CTFs interviewed for
this paper included fund-raising as a permanent part of their programmes, in most cases,
primarily for funding projects.

Three respondents discussed the need for different approaches to fund-raising, particularly
when establishing a new CTF. For example, there may be fewer opportunities for debt-for-
nature swaps if debt has already been reduced through previous swap arrangements. Also,
the American Congress has limited USAID ability to provide endowments to funds using
public money (though funds can still be provided to sinking funds).

◗	 Several CTFs recommended against seeking Endowment Fund capital at the cost of
   delaying conservation activities. Project funding can be easier to obtain than endowment
   capital (as project outcomes are time bound and can be readily credited to donors). In
   addition, conservation outcomes on the ground help build a profile for the CTF, which in
   turn helps with fund-raising.

◗	 Partnering with donors also carries costs, with respect to reporting and complying
   with requirements, which can be higher than expected. These requirements should be



	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	      109
         understood and—to the extent possible—CTFs should design reporting systems which
         consider efficiency while still meeting donor needs.

       At least four of the thirteen CTFs considered have other sources of finance. The most
       developed system is a levy fee for forest uses. Two others described efforts to generate
       tourism income though these schemes were not yet considered successful. One CTF is
       considering the potential use of biodiversity offsets from extractive industries as a source
       of income. Two respondents were not very positive about carbon trading with one CTF
       business plan outlining the probability of any significant financial inflows from carbon as
       “increasingly remote” due to the insufficient price of carbon on international markets.


       A3.1.4  Governance and Operations Overview
       All the CTFs interviewed had a Constitution, Trust Deed and/or related document.
       All nine of the CTFs interviewed have independent Boards made up of eight to twelve
       members; two CTFs have a Board of Trustees as well as a separate Board of Governors
       where the five Trustees hold legal representation of the Fund and the Governors (between
       seven and twenty) play an advisory role. There is also an example of a larger General
       Assembly (36 members) to provide oversight to the Board.

        Respondents emphasized the need to establish a good constitution. One recommended
        keeping guidance and procedure documents separate from the Constitution for flexibility and
        for enabling easy updates.


       Role of the Board
       All CTF respondents described similar responsibilities for the Board: establishing policies,
       guiding and approving the strategic plan, budget and annual working plans, approving
       the grant process and playing a role in the selection of grants and reviewing financial
       statements. Five of the nine CTFs interviewed reported that the Board had fiduciary duty
       with respect to the Fund. One respondent said the Board did not have this responsibility.

        Respondents emphasized the need for the Board to be truly independent, and perceived
        as such.


       Selecting Board Members
       Board members are generally selected for their individual expertise covering legal,
       juridical, investment/financial, academic, NGO and community backgrounds. A number of
       CTF Boards have one or two government representatives selected by relevant Ministries
       (e.g., Environment, Natural Resources). Others also have donor representatives. One CTF
       outlined a process whereby community Board members are selected by the communities.
       Another CTF has a requirement for an international Board member based outside the
       country in order to ensure alignment with international trends. This approach is in contrast
       with another CTF whose representative suggested that foreign board members should
       be replaced by local people when possible. One CTF respondent described an approach
       of bringing in external members to the Board on an as-needed basis (e.g., investment or
       technical experts).

N Board meetings a year                 34 formal meetings a year.




Board Term
At least half the CTFs interviewed have defined fixed terms for their Board members; this
varies from two to four years usually renewable for one term. Only one CTF reported no
formal requirements in this regard. All CTFs reported regular formal Board meetings every
three to four months; in two examples this is only every six months. Approximately half of
the CTFs have a policy of staggering Board members.

 Several CTFs stressed the importance of an engaged and committed Board. Some
 recommended selecting Board members who have a dedicated interest in the CTF, others
 emphasized the need to make sure there is Board engagement in between meetings. One CTF
 has an Executive Committee to ensure more continuous engagement.

All the CTFs interviewees described approaches for avoiding conflicts of interest for Board
members (e.g., Board members cannot put forward grant applications). Clearly, there is
a high level of awareness on this issue; however, the individual policies of the CTFs were
not assessed for their level of formality and completeness. In the case of the African World
Heritage Fund, the unique nature of the World Heritage system means that one party,
IUCN, is both a Board member (as a World Heritage advisor) and an executing partner
(providing training to grantees on how to put forward World Heritage site bids).


Operations
All the CTFs interviewed appeared to have strategic plans, usually for a period of five
years, as well as annual work plans. At least one CTF uses a broad consultative process for
developing the strategic plan. Another suggested that a three year planning cycle would be
better suited for capturing new priorities when working across a broad geographic remit.

All the CTFs interviewed (bar one that is not yet established) have between eight and
28 staff members fulfilling functions such as communications, administration, monitoring,
technical staff (conservation expertise and/or management), financial management and
support staff, with at least two reported field based staff members outside the main office.
One CTF has witnessed a drastic reduction in staff members (from eleven to two) as a result
of the Fund’s poor performance.

 Some of the respondents spoke positively of secondment programmes, either with donor
 agencies or with other CTFs in Africa. The latter was particularly recommended as an effective
 way to share experiences.


	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	        111
       Different opinions were voiced regarding the ideal profile of the CEO/director of the
       CTF. One respondent strongly recommended knowledge of financial markets and fund
       management over and above conservation expertise. Others considered that financial
       expertise could be outsourced and that it is more important to focus on a dynamic leader.
       One respondent suggested that having easy access to a diversity of expertise (legal,
       financial, conservation) was the most important thing.


       Grants
       All nine CTFs interviewed have criteria for allocating grants and referenced more detailed
       guidelines; however these were not reviewed in detail. One CTF employs a participatory
       selection process with local community representatives.

        The capacity of grantees to use resources, deliver on projects and monitor and report on
        results needs to be evaluated and understood, particularly when working with communities.
        Capacity building may be a necessary part of grant allocation. Some CTFs have requirements
        for communities receiving grants to work with partners such as NGOs who can support this.


       Measuring Outcomes
       In many cases, CTFs have in-house capacity to monitor and evaluate outcomes from
       activities. That is supplemented by monitoring of outcomes carried out by grantees (with
       various levels of systematism). Many considered that monitoring needs could not be met by
       grantees alone. At least one CTF is developing an electronic data system for compiling data
       from monitoring.


       A3.1.5  Investment Management Overview
       At least 4 of the CTFs have a policy of maintaining and growing the Fund, with several
       aiming to recapitalize income when separate funds are available for projects and
       operations. However, poor financial performance of the Fund has undermined those efforts
       with at least two CTFs having had to draw down capital at different times. The financial
       crisis of 2008 affected most CTFs and, at times, returns have not always been as high as
       anticipated.

        Almost all the CTF respondents emphasized the importance of understanding financial
        investments. Some stressed the need for informative and frequent communication with
        the Asset Manager. There are also examples of CTFs jointly seeking advice from financial
        consultants as an efficient way to gain insights and provide cross-institutional learning.


       There was at least one example of an effort to stabilize income from the variability of fund
       performance. This CTF has a formal policy of only spending each year the equivalent of
       the average return over the last five years. For example, this year’s spend from the Fund’s
       income will be the equivalent of a 4% return with any surplus in actual return recapitalized.

       Some of the CTFs have formal investment policies for their Funds. One has a policy of
       in-country investment; unfortunately the fund has suffered greatly from the instability of



112	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
the local investment market. Another has a requirement for investments to be in offshore
markets which are considered the most stable (in this case in the U.S.), and another has
a policy of mixing in-country and offshore investments. At least two CTF respondents
described a policy that included ethical investment considerations.

Many of the CTFs have independent reviews of the investment performance on a periodic
(though not necessarily systematic) basis. These reviews provide advice from third party
financial managers. In some cases they are designed to raise awareness/build capacity
within CTFs on investment strategies and risks.

Most of the CTF interviewees reported carrying out financial auditing, in some cases
communicated through annual reports. Very few of the CTFs have the most current annual
reports available (e.g., on their websites), though most were quite willing to share them
when asked. In a similar way, details about asset managers are rarely disclosed on websites,
but freely shared by most in interviews (these included UBS, Standard Bank, JPMorgan,
Schroder and Vanguard).


A3.1.6  Partnerships and Transparency
All the CTFs have different partnerships at the local and international level. The interviewees
all spoke positively of partnerships; many were particularly positive about the Consortium of
African Environmental Funds (CAFÉ) as a valued network for CTFs and a useful way to learn
from each other. Many of the respondents knew each other, and a spirit of collaboration and
willingness to help seems to prevail between the CTFs.

Transparency is mixed with the CTFs considered in this report. Although all interviewees
spoke of reporting policies, the public availability of information is not a systematic priority
for most of the CTFs. Two of the CTFs in the group of thirteen did not have websites and
several others did not have up-to-date material. That said, the nine interviewees were
forthcoming with information and mostly easy to contact. Only three of the CTFs did not
respond at all.


A3.1.7  Some Possible Lessons for a Liberian CTF
Overall, interviewees were positive about the use of CTFs for conservation purposes. They
had a number of lessons to share and also demonstrated a high level of awareness of good
practices regarding CTFs.

◗	 The financial performance of the Fund is extremely important. Accordingly, there should
   be someone with investment and financial expertise on the staff at a senior level as well
   as on the Board. There should also be regular financial investment reviews with third
   party advice to CTF staff and Board. 

◗	 Fund raising is important and there should be this expertise within Staff and Board.

◗	 The Board members should be selected for personal commitment and drive as well as
   expertise. There should be outside expertise brought to advise the Board at times as
   needed (on conservation, fund raising, investments, etc).


	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	         113
       ◗	 Separate funding for the setup phase is needed (200k+).

       ◗	 Guidance documents and manuals should be developed outside the Constitution so that
          they can be updated.

       ◗	 There needs to be a robust business plan which explores possible sources of income,
          estimates them as realistically as possible and sets target amounts for the Endowment
          Fund, recapitalization, and project spending.

       ◗	 There should be a policy for stabilization of income from the Fund (e.g., setting annual
          budget depending on an average income over a 5 year period).

       ◗	 A Secondment with a successful CTF would be useful for learning how CTFs operate, are
          governed, fund raise, and market themselves.

       ◗	 The Liberian Fund should demonstrate high levels of transparency.



       A3.2  Legal Review of Enabling Environment and Any Constraints
       for Establishing a Conservation Trust Fund in Liberia
       A3.2.1  Overview of Liberia Conservation Imperative and History of CTFs in Africa
       The need for biodiversity conservation in Liberia is urgent and compelling. Liberia’s
       huge forest of approximately four (4) million hectares (accounting for about half of the
       total landmass of the country) has been a subject of many reports and studies, detailing
       its rich biodiversity and the attendant need for its conservation. The World Bank recently
       conducted and concluded one of such studies/reports. In its forthcoming report titled
       Aggregated Biodiversity Offsets: A Roadmap for Liberia’s Mining Sector (“Aggregated
       Offsets Report”), the World Bank study notes the “exceptionally diverse ecological
       communities and distinctive flora and fauna” in Liberia, and detailed the “priority areas for
       conservation” and “key biodiversity areas (KBAs)” within Liberia that need but currently
       receive little or no protection.

       Liberia has a history of over 30 years of biodiversity conservations efforts, but with little
       to show as success. The Aggregated Offset Report traced the Liberian Government’s
       efforts on biodiversity conservation, beginning with the establishment of a department of
       wildlife in the 1970s and the subsequent establishment in 1983 of the Sapo National Park,
       up to the establishment of the East Nimba Nature Reserve in 2003 and Lake Piso Multiple
       Sustainable Use Reserve in 2011. The above-mentioned three (3) protected areas account
       for 3% of the landmass of Liberia, although the Act for the Establishment of a Protected
       Forest Areas Network (2003) obliged the Government of Liberia to establish a protected
       area network covering at least 30% of the total forest area of Liberia.

       Inadequate budgetary support coupled with significant pressure to generate revenue
       from logging, mining and large-scale agriculture hamper the creation and management of
       protected areas and put at risk the remarkable biodiversity in Liberia. It requires financial
       resources to cover the cost of conservation, and this cost rises as the total areas under


114	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
protection increases. Yet, the statutory agent responsible for forest conservation in Liberia—
FDA—is chronically underfunded.

The Aggregated Offsets Report acknowledges the Liberian law requirements that
extractive companies implement biodiversity offsets, but argues that individual, project-
specific conservation is likely to be inefficient in Liberia for a number of technical
reasons. What it recommends as an effective means of promoting higher conservation
outcome is the establishment of some form of aggregated biodiversity offsets along with
a conservation trust fund (CTF) whereby mining companies co-fund the CTF to ensure
effective management of PPAs and generate greater conservation outcomes, which then
could be in lieu of all or some of the biodiversity conservation obligations under the mining
and environmental laws of Liberia as well as applicable concession agreements.

The establishment and use of a conservation trust fund offers great potential of securing
long-term, sustainable financing for the PPAs in Liberia. A Conservation Trust Fund (CTF)
is generally a non-governmental, legally independent grant-making institution whose
objective is to raise and manage funds for biodiversity conservation. CTFs are supported by
USAID, the World Bank and many other institutions and governments.

The use of CTFs as a funding mechanism for biodiversity has increased dramatically
over the past two decades following critical acceptance by many conservation experts,
bilateral and multilateral donors, the private sector and civil society. There are over
50 CTFs currently in existence, while many more are being established in diverse countries
in nearly all regions of the world. There are about twelve CTFs in Africa. For example, in
Madagascar, a CTF was established in January 2005 with the stated objective of “securing
the finances of the Malagasy national park system” of more than 40 national parks “through
financial endowment of an environment fund.” With a diverse, large number of donors
that include the Madagascar government, the World Bank, GEF, AFD/FFEM, WWF, CI
and KFWT, the Madagascar CTF raised about USD11.0 Million during its first two year
period of existence between 2005–2007. A similar trust fund, Fondation Parcs Nationalux
et Reserves (FPNR), was established in the Ivory Coast in 2002 “to finance recurrent costs
of the national parks and reserves.” Another CTF is the KILIMANJARO ENVIRONMENTAL
CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT TRUST FUND established by the Government of
Tanzania in partnership with the people of Kilimanjaro.

The work and experiences of the various CTFs have been documented and shared through
CTFs networks such as the Latin American and Caribbean Network of Environmental Trust
Funds (RedLAC) and the Consortium of African Funds for the Environment (CAFE). Also, the
norms and practices of nearly all CTFs existing as at 2013 have been compiled and published
as Practice Standards for Conservation Trust Funds through an initiative of the Conservation
Finance Alliance (CFA), which is a global voluntary network of all CTFs, major donors to
CTFs, as well as many other conservation organizations and experts aimed at addressing the
challenge of sustainable financing for biodiversity conservation. The Practice Guides identifies
six (6) key factors “that are considered essential” to designing, managing and monitoring
every CTF to be fit for purpose. The six factors are (i) adequate, documented governance
structures and processes that ensure government’s participation but not control of the CTF;
(ii) clearly defined scope of operations that covers grant-making, strategic planning and
interactions between the government and other partners including companies, communities


	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	         115
       and donors; (iii) administration, covering delineation of roles and responsibilities, operational
       manuals and financial management procedures including audits; (iv) asset management,
       which encompasses investment strategies and fiduciary responsibilities and relationships with
       various types of investments professionals; (v) monitoring and evaluation; and (vi) resource
       mobilization which covers fundraising and managing payments for environmental services
       (PES), compensation funds, offsets payments, etc.

       The principles of directing CTF resources to protected areas management is therefore
       fairly established, especially in the African region. At least eight of the CTFs are dedicated
       entirely or substantially to protected areas. A CTF in Liberia can certainly benefit from the
       experiences of the eight CTFs focused on funding and managing PPAs.


       A3.2.2  Current Legal and Policy Environment for Establishing a CTF in Liberia
       The legal framework and Policy environment in Liberia individually and collectively
       support the establishment and sound management of a conservation trust in Liberia.
       Liberian laws recognize a trust as a contractual relationship enforceable when validly
       established; it also has a dedicated statute on the creation and management of private
       foundations. There is a dedicated chapter of the Tax Code of Liberia on taxation of trusts,
       which provisions offer clear and predictable rules on taxation on determination and taxation
       of trust income. No Liberian law or policy precludes the Government of Liberia or any of its
       agencies from establishing or contributing to a trust fund. There is also a clearly noticeable
       strong public policy on the part of the Liberian government for (i) biodiversity conservation
       generally, (ii) the creation, protection and monitoring of protected areas (PAs), (iii) the
       effective involvement and participation of communities and civil society generally in forest
       management and conservation; and (iv) the building of public private partnership (PPP) for
       conservation in Liberia.

       The legal concept of “trust” is one well established under Liberian laws. It is true that
       Liberia, like many common law jurisdictions (meaning countries whose laws are based on
       English and/or American laws), have no specific statute on trusts. The nature of a trust and
       how it is created to become enforceable are therefore decided in Liberia by reference
       to the Common law. This adoption of the Common law principles and rules on trust is
       pursuant to Section 40 of the General Construction Statute of Liberia (also referred to as
       the Reception Statute), which provides that “the rules adopted for chancery proceedings
       in England, and the common law and usages of the courts of England and of the United
       States of America, as set forth in case law and in Blackstone’s and Kent’s Commentaries”
       shall, “when applicable, be considered Liberian law.” Hence, relying on the Reception
       Statute, the Supreme Court of Liberia held in a 2009 decision that “in the law of trusts,
       an Inter Vivos Trust takes effect during the life time of the Settlor/Trustor and it remains
       in existence until revoked during the life time of the trustor, or until a condition in said
       trust is broken.” The Supreme Court has also held that a trust instrument is sufficient
       to establish a valid, enforceable trust when it (i) establishes an identifiable trust res; (ii)
       appoints a trustee, which may be natural or legal person(s); and (iii) names a beneficiary or
       group of beneficiaries, adding that “the issue of ascertainable beneficiaries can be clearly
       established by an examination of the trust instrument.”




116	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
A trust may be created by any contractual instrument and by whoever is capable of
making or entering into an enforceable contract. This is because a trust under Liberian
law is a legal relationship whereby an asset or resource is given or set aside by one or more
persons to a custodian who holds/manages it for the benefit of another person(s) generally
referred to as the beneficiary or beneficiaries.

A CTF may be created by (i) one or more extractive companies; (ii) one or more agencies
of the Government of Liberia; or (iii) by a combination of extractive companies and
agencies of the government. Any legal person under Liberian law has the capacity to enter
into and perform any and all lawful contracts. Each extractive company and agency of the
government is therefore capable of entering into contract, and of creating a trust. Neither
the Government of Liberia nor any of its agencies is precluded from entering into contract
with private legal entities. In fact, private companies and public agencies and authorities
enter into contract rather frequently. Any extractive company or agency of the government
may therefore lawfully create a CTF through contract, by acting alone or in conjunction with
other(s). The management of the trust fund and the activities that it may fund may also be
stipulated in the relevant trust instrument.

A trust may be a private trust (i.e., created for the benefit of a certain designated
individual or individuals, or class of persons) or it may be a public trust (i.e., created
for the benefit of public at large). A public trust is generally considered a charitable
trust because it is for the benefit of the entire public as opposed to private interests. A
conservation trust fund dedicated to funding the protection of protected areas (PAs) is
definitely for the benefit of the public and therefore qualifies as a charitable trust.

A charitable conservation trust Fund is generally tax exempt under Liberia law. Section (9)
of the Consolidated tax Code of Liberia provides that the “Government of the Republic
of Liberia, government agencies, and charitable organizations that are approved by and
registered with the Ministry of Finance, Republic of Liberia are referred to as “Exempt
persons” and are exempt from tax to the extent provided in this Code.” Importantly,
Section 9(f) states that a private charitable or not-for profit organization is not eligible for
registration as a registered charity if it engages in political activities or “the revenue or
property of the organization is used in a way inconsistent with the charitable purposes for
which the organization was established.”

While Liberia has no specific trust statute, the country is one of a few common law
jurisdictions with a dedicated statute on foundations. A foundation is substantially similar
to, but slightly different from, a trust. The two are similar in that in either case the donor
irrevocably transfers ownership of the endowment asset or fund for use/application towards
the indicated purpose of the trust or foundation. They are different by the method of
creation and also by the fact that while title to a trust property is in the trustee, the same is
not true about the founder or manager of the foundation. The private Foundations statute
is called An Act to Further Amend the Associations Law as Amended, Title 5 of the Liberian
Code of Laws Revised, by Adding Thereto a New Part VI, chapter 60, Providing for the
Establishment of Private Foundations. It contains detailed provisions on the registration,
purpose, management and audit of foundations.




	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	          117
       With appropriate drafting, a CTF may be established in Liberia under the Private
       Foundations statute or by way of the usual deed of trust executed by the original
       donor(s). The procedures for the formation of a Foundation are detailed in the Private
       Foundations statute. The statute first defines a private foundation as (i) an entity established
       by a Memorandum of Endowment; (ii) holds assets irrevocably transferred to it by one or
       more donors; and (iii) registered and is a legal entity which can sue and be sued. The statute
       states that management of the assets of a private foundation should be in accordance with
       the Memorandum of Endowment, and that assets can be realized, applied, administered,
       invested and disbursed. Further, the statute lists activities or objectives that are not
       permitted for private foundations, and they include:

       	 a.	 Trade; manufacturing, adventure or concern in nature of trade;

       	 b.	 Being or becoming a member of a partnership, except limited partner in a limited
             partnership;

       	 c.	 A shareholder or a member in a company, except limited company;

       	 d.	 A director of a company;

       	 e.	 Carrying out activity to which Banking or Insurance Laws apply; and

       	 f.	 Activity prohibited in or from within Liberia.

       The statute further provides that that a private foundation may, but need not be charitable. It
       also prescribes the modes of establishment of Private Foundations, and the mandatory optional
       provisions of a Memorandum of Endowment. The Statute further requires an initial asset of
       a foundation to be of a value not less than US$10,000.00. If the value is not currency, there
       should be filed with the Registrar a certified statement by a person named in the Memorandum
       of Endowment as an officer that the assets satisfies the required value of US$10,000.00.

       A CTF may be established in Liberia under the Private Foundation statute as was done in
       Madagascar where the Madagascar CTF (called “Madagascar Foundation for Protected
       Areas and Biodiversity”) was established on January 6, 2005, under the Malagasy
       Foundation Law, and has received donation from the World Bank, GEF, WWF, CI, KFW and
       others, with the administrative costs for the first two years covered by USAID, WWF and
       KFW. See, Madagascar trust fund for sustainable protection of nature reserves, Dr. Ralf
       Kadel (KFW) and Noemie Burkl (BMZ (2007)).

       Many trusts and foundations do exist in Liberia, and are known to varying degrees. A
       well-known trust is the Joseph Jenkins Robert Educational Trust Fund. This trust was created
       more than a century ago by the first president of Liberia for the purpose of promoting
       education, and it still exists today. Its trustee is the Methodist Church of Liberia and the
       beneficiaries are the children of Liberia.

       There is no provision or interpretation of Liberian law that hinders or could hinder the
       establishment of a conservation trust fund. In fact, the laws of Liberia on trust, contract,




118	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
and taxation provide a clear and predictable framework for the establishment of a
conservation trust fund or any other trust.

A CTF established under Liberian laws can have and manage many funds from various
sources and, in respect of any such multi-fund, it is perfectly legal and without any
restriction whatsoever for such fund to receive an endowment or fund from one or more
sources that is ear-marked for a particular purpose or project within the general purpose/
objective of the CTF. A Liberian CTF may commence with one fund and then evolve over
time to managing more funds, or may in fact start as a multi-fund to the extent possible
and/or provided in the trust deed. Further, while a Liberian CTF can be a multi-fund, there
is no restriction whatsoever to stop it from receiving contribution of any asset that is ear-
marked for a particular purpose or area such as biodiversity offsets, wildlife conservation,
etc. In fact, Section 60.6(b)(vii) of the Private Foundation statute expressly provides for
endowment of supplemental assets to a foundation.

The Government of Liberia’s long-standing commitment to the designation and policing
of certain biodiversity-rich areas as protected areas and its knowledge of the chronic
funding problem that faces conservation efforts makes the government more amendable
to consider CTF and other creative mechanism for financing conservation. The records
show that efforts to establish national parks, nature reserves and protected areas started
more than thirty years ago, and continue to this date. While there are many factors
responsible for the little progress made this far, one major cause for the slow progress is
inadequate funding.

The “Conservation and Wildlife Fund” proposed in a draft bill (Wildlife Law of 2014)
recently submitted by the President of Liberia to the Legislature represents concrete
evidence of a major policy shift towards finding creative financing mechanisms for
conservation in Liberia. According to the draft Wildlife Law 2014, the “Conservation and
Wildlife Fund” is “for the administration of protected areas, wildlife conservation and
management activities” in Liberia.

The Government has a positive history of public private partnerships. Governments in
some countries, especially those of civil law traditions, are generally reluctant to accept
mixed management of legal entities when the Government does not hold majority share
or voting powers. This situation does not pertain in Liberia. Rather, the Government has a
history of joint venture with private entities to develop extractive resources or further some
public cause. Hence, the Government accepted a joint venture with a number of companies
for operation of the Lamco Mines, and is also currently in a joint venture (where it has a
minority position/voting power) with ArcelorMittal for operation of the Nimba Mountain.
Also the Government of Liberia established the Liberia Extractive Industries Transparency
Initiative (LEITI), which is governed by a supervisory board (called Multi-stakeholders Group)
that comprises nearly equal representations of three (3) major stakeholders groups, namely,
the Government, private sector, and civil society. Significantly, the Government continues to
fund LEITI through the national budget (last year allocation was a little over a Million USD),
although it has less than half of the membership of the LEITI Board and correspondingly co-
controlling vote on the board.




	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	       119
       The existence of social development funds and the mechanism/principles under which
       extractive companies currently contribute to these county social development funds
       speak to an accommodating policy framework for CTF or similar funding arrangement
       that encourages or requires extractive companies to contribute to a socially beneficial
       cause in lieu of meeting another contractual or statutory obligation. The basis for
       extractive companies to contribute to county development funds is contained in Mineral
       Development Agreements (MDAs). Indeed, many of the MDAs contain a provision
       requiring extractive companies to contribute adjustable specified sums of money to social
       contribution/social development funds under the condition that such contribution is in
       lieu of the company’s obligations under Section 9(3) of the Exploration Regulations. For
       example, Section 8.2(a) of the MDA between Putu Iron Ore, Inc. and the Government of
       Liberia provides that Putu Iron Ore Mines, Inc. “shall pay an annual social contribution”
       beginning with the initial amount of US$500,000 in 2011, US$1.25 million in 2012,
       US$3 million in each of 2014, 2015 and 2016 and upwards, and that such “Annual Social
       Contribution shall be in lieu of any obligation of the Company pursuant to Section 9.3(b)
       of the Exploration Regulations.” Section 9.3 of the Exploration Regulations imposes
       “local community enhancement obligations” on each mining company and requires them
       to, among other things, “expend each year during the License Term an amount equal
       to at least 2% of its approved budget for each year on the construction, maintenance or
       rehabilitation of schools, clinics within its License Area or within other local communities
       affected by the Licensee’s operations.”

       Incidentally, all the MDAs also contain requirements for environmental protection and
       management, including the submission and updating of EIA and EMP as well as the
       updating of the EIA and EMP. The MDAs and the Exploration Regulations also impose
       an Environmental Restoration Obligations and require a funding guarantee or security
       in respect of such obligation. Although a Restoration order may not necessarily be a
       typical biodiversity conservation intervention, it is possible and herein suggested that
       the idea in the case of social contribution is adaptable, and that extractive companies
       may be required to contribute to a CTF under an appropriate arrangement where a
       contribution made may be in lieu of some of the project-specific Environmental Restoration
       Obligation of the company.

       There is also strong public policy for the involvement of civil society and communities
       in forest management and conservation. The Forestry law is quite specific about the
       requirement for effective participation and voice of communities in forest management. The
       Government also recognizes the principle that communities and forest dependent people
       who bear the cost for protection of the forest (by way of foregoing having forest resources
       forming their sources of livelihood) should be provided adequate alternative sources of
       food and/or income. The involvement of communities in a CTF is encouraged, favored and
       supported by the legal and policy frameworks in Liberia.


       A3.2.3  Financial Opportunities/Constraints for CTF in Liberia
       The explicit Tax Treatment of Trust (including deductibility of contribution to charitable
       trust); the liberal currency regime, including no restriction on expatriation of funds; and the
       existing financial obligations of extractive companies under their concessions agreements




120	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
as well as the recognition of CTFs as proven financial mechanisms for funding conservation
programs all constitute good financial opportunities for successful establishment and
operation of a CTF in Liberia. Also serving as an independent opportunity is the fact that
neither the Government of Liberia nor any of its agencies have statutory restriction on
allocating for or contributing to a charitable trust.

Chapter 5 of the Liberian Tax Code titled “taxation of trusts and estates” contains
detailed provisions on properties and liabilities of trust, the determination of trust
income, foreign income tax, taxation of beneficiaries, etc. It also provides, inter alia, that
“transactions between a trust and its trustee and beneficiaries shall be respected” and
also that “separate calculations of the taxable income of a trust shall be made for separate
trusts regardless of whether they have the same trustees.” Section 500 (a) of the Code
states that “a Trust is liable to pay tax separate from its beneficiaries on its income for a
tax year.”

A Charitable CTF is and will be entitled to tax exemption. Section 9(a) of the Tax Code
provides that “charitable organizations that are approved by and registered are referred to
as “Exempt Persons” and are exempt from tax to the extent provided in this Code.” This
means that where a charitable trust is established, it is entitled to tax exemption upon its
registration with the relevant authorities, although Section 9(f) says that such a charitable
trust or a similar not-for-profit organization may lose its tax exemption if it engages in
political activities or “the revenues or property of the organization is used in a away
inconsistent with the charitable purpose for which the organization was established.”

Section 205 (b) of the Tax Code (Charitable Contribution Deduction) states that a
“deduction is allowed a tax to a taxpayer filing a tax return under Section 900 or 901 for
the amount of a contribution made to a qualifying organization.” Subsection (2) of
Section 205(c) further states that “when the contribution is in the form of noncash property,
the amount of the contribution is the property’s adjusted tax cost or its fair market value,
whichever is lower.”

The foregoing clearly shows that the tax code presents good financial incentives for
successful establishment and operation of a CTF as a charitable trust in Liberia.

The Financial laws of Liberia implements a liberal currency regime and unrestricted
current and capital accounts, which are all favorable to mobilizing and investing assets
of a CTF established in Liberia. The United States Dollars is legal tender in Liberia along
with the Liberian Dollar, and the rate of exchange between the two and other currencies is
market-determined. There are no foreign exchange controls of any kind. Any person, legal
or natural, may repatriate any sum of money from Liberia to wherever, although a regulation
of the Central bank requires that amounts beyond a certain threshold be transferred only
through banking channels.

Extractive companies may be willing or lawfully required to contribute to a CTF in Liberia.
The internal corporate conservation policies of many extractive companies should generally
make them more amendable to consider funding a well-structured CTF that promises value
for money.




	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	       121
       Additionally, the Environmental Restoration Obligation Funding Agreement required
       in a number of MDAs and/or the Remediation and Restoration security required by
       Section 103 of the Exploration Regulations can be creatively structured to provide
       incentives for extractive companies to contribute to a CTF in Liberia. For example,
       Section 5.5(c) of the Putu Iron Ore MDA state “upon approval of the feasibility, (i) the
       Company and the Government shall enter into an Environmental Restoration Obligation
       Funding Agreement or (ii) the Company shall provide the Government, as a beneficiary,
       a funding guarantee from an Acceptable Third Party Financial Institution guaranteeing
       the restoration obligation . . . for each five-year period.” It further provides that “for
       the purpose of this Agreement, an Environmental Restoration Obligation Funding
       Agreement” means an agreement between the Company and the Government that
       (i) requires the establishment of an escrow account with an Accepted Third Party Financial
       Institution pursuant to an escrow agreement to be entered into among the Company,
       the Government and such Accepted Third Party Financial Institution; (ii) requires the
       Company to fund such escrow accounts in advance of the applicable five year period such
       that at all times such escrow contains at minimum an amount equal to (x) the aggregate
       estimate for closure cost. . . .”

       Similar to the mechanism of treating contributions to county development funds as being
       in lieu of their obligations under Section 9.3 of the Exploration Regulations, it is suggested
       that extractive companies may be incentivized to contribute to a CTF and the contribution
       counted towards any agreed portion of their total EMP obligations.

       Many donor institutions, international organizations and foreign governments are likely to
       support the establishment and funding of a CTF in Liberia. A USAID publication describes
       a CTF as a conservation financing mechanism involving a partnership between government
       and extractive industries for financing biodiversity. The USAID publication also says that
       one of such “systems for organizing biodiversity payments is a USAID-supported business
       and biodiversity Offset Program (BBOP), which is a partnership between companies,
       governments and conservation experts to explore biodiversity offsets.” The World Bank
       also recognizes the practical values of CTFs, and has tracked their performances, which it
       published as Practice Standards for Conservation Trust Funds (hereinafter referred to as
       CTF Guide). The funding sources of many other existing donors show a number of other
       institutions and foreign governments that have supported them. A fair conclusion therefore
       is that many donor institutions and foreign governments who endorse CTF as a efficient
       financing mechanism for biodiversity conservation are actively working in Liberia and have
       contributed and/or are contributing to forest governance, management and conservation
       generally in Liberia. Notable among these organizations are the World Bank, USAID,
       Norwegian Governments, and other foreign governments. Their familiarity with and support
       for CTF should be a good opportunity to convince them to contribute to CTF in Liberia.


       A.3.2.4  Need and Possibility of Establishing the Liberian CTF
       as a Non-Governmental Organization
       It is essential for the effectiveness and financial viability of a Liberian CTF that it is
       established as an inclusive public private partnership that optimizes available tax
       procedures and also promotes the participation and interest of communities and all other
       relevant stakeholders. Effective and sustainable biodiversity conservation is more than a


122	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
law or government policy. It has substantial impact on many lives and therefore requires
the collective involvement of society, including forest dependent communities, donors and
others to ensure success. This advises or requires that a CTF be established not as another
government agency, but as an independent legal entity established by and through an
effective partnership between the Government and civil society inclusive of communities as
well as extractive companies. This ensures true public private partnership that inspires the
confidence of both the communities and donors.

The Practice Guides reflecting the experiences of nearly all CTFs state that “conservation
Trust Funds are private, legally independent institutions.” Accordingly, a key practice
standard under governance of CTF is stated as follows:

    A CTF is established under the laws of a country that effectively ensures the CTF’s
    independence from government, that has clear and well enforced laws concerning
    private non-governmental organizations (including Foundations or trusts), and that
    does not subject the CTF to paying substantial taxes.

The foregoing CTF norm of practice along with other governance standards under the
Practice Guides, requires the following with respect to a CTF established under Liberian law:

	 1.	 That the CTF is established through written instrument (a trust deed or memorandum
      of endowment, as the case may be) in keeping with the procedures established under
      Liberian law;

	 2.	 That the purposes/objectives of the trust are clearly stated to enable its registration
      and operation as a charitable trust or foundation, which would therefore make it tax
      exempt;

	 3.	 That the Government of Liberia is one of several parties responsible for the
      governance of the Trust; and

	 4.	 That there are clear provision in the CTF’s instrument of creation relative to governing
      body (or bodies), including their selection and responsibilities, ensuring that the trust is
      neither a government entity or controlled by the Government.

As an international practice standard, Governance Standard 10 is the norm in nearly
all successful CTFs. The following trust funds in Africa are all private legal entities,
although with Government’s participation: (1) Mgahinga and Bwindi Impenetrable Forest
Conservation Trust (MBIFCT) which was set up in 1994 under the Uganda Trust Act to
provide long-term funding for the conservation of the Mgahinga National park (MGNP)
and the Bwindi Impenetrable National Park in Uganda; (2) The Madagascar Foundation for
Protected Foundation established under Malagasy Foundation law for securing finances of
the Malagasy national park system of over forty (40) national parks; (3) Kilimanjaro National
Park; (4) Fondation Parcs Nationalux et Reserves (FPNR).

Having the Government of Liberia participate as one of several partners with rights for
the governance of the Liberian CTF is not prohibited by Liberian laws, but in fact has fact
has a precedent. Under Liberian corporate laws, anyone can serve as a director or officer


	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	           123
       of a Liberian legal entity irrespective of shareholding, nationality or residence. There is also
       no Liberian law that requires the government to have a majority position or controlling
       vote as a condition for the government or any of its agencies to serve as member of the
       board of a legal entity or contribute to the entity’s budget/funding needs. An instrument
       creating a Liberian CTF or bylaws adopted thereunder may therefore lawfully name relevant
       agencies of the government as some director(s) of many directors of the CTF, the eligibility
       requirements and selection procedures for directors, and the number of votes required to
       make a binding decision. There is ample evidence of the Government of Liberia accepting
       as members of the board of some legal entities including extractive companies although it
       has minority shares and non-controlling votes.

       The statutorily established governance structure of the LEITI—which is working
       excellently and has led Liberia to becoming a world leader in EITI implementation—
       provides both a good precedent and model for the governance of the Liberian CTF. In
       2007 Liberia joined the Extractive Industries Transparency Initiative (EITI), which is a global
       standard for transparency over payments and revenues from oil, gas and mining companies.
       The EITI Criteria requires that a national EITI program be led by the Government but under
       the ultimate management and oversight of a multi-stakeholders group (MSG) comprising
       representatives from the Government, extractive companies and civil society. In compliance
       with the EITI Criteria, Liberia established its EITI program and also established an MSG
       that comprises the entire named three stakeholders group, pursuant to a memorandum of
       understanding executed by the three stakeholders groups. The MOU was later replaced
       by an executive order, then an act of the legislature. Section 6.1 of the LEITI Act states
       that “the governing body of the LEITI shall be the Multi-Stakeholders Steering Committee
       (“MSG”).” Section 6.2 also states that “the management of the LEITI along with the
       implementation of all activities and programs of the LEITI shall be done by or under the
       authority and supervision of the MSG,” and Section 6.3 then details the specific authority
       and responsibilities of the MSG. Section 6.4 then addresses the composition of the MSG
       as follows: “The MSG shall comprise of at least fifteen (15) members to be drawn from the
       Government, civil society, and the private sector as follows:

       	 a.	 Government: Seven representatives to include the Minister of Finance; the Minister
             of Lands, Mines & Energy; the managing Director of the Forestry Development
             Authority; and the President/CEO of the national Oil Company of Liberia (NOCAL) or
             its successors as permanent members;

       	 b.	 Civil Society: Four (4) representatives to include (1) Publish What You Pay—Liberia or a
             successor organization; and (2) a representative of a recognized association or union of
             workers in the extractive sectors as permanent members; and

       	 c.	 Private Sector: Four (4) representatives to include at least one representative from the
             mining, forestry and oil sectors as permanent representatives.

       The LEITI governance mechanism is an example of what has worked in Liberia and can be
       built on to comply with the governance standards of CTFs, except that there should be
       an express provision for inclusion of communities and donors, and the exclusion of the oil
       sectors.




124	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
A.3.2.5  Advice on Initial Documents and Action for the Establishment,
Governance and Operation of a Liberian CTF
In order to establish the Liberian CTF and ensure its effective operation as a charitable
trust, several key documents need to be prepared and carefully vetted by stakeholders
to ensure broad inputs and ownership. Also key is procurement of a competent and
experienced person or firm to serve as the chief administrator of the fund during the
first years of the Fund when strategic plans need to be developed and investment policy
and procedures established. The key initial documents that need to be developed for
the establishment and commencement of operations of the Liberian CTF are (1) the trust
instrument; (2) the bylaws or a comparable document of internal governance; (3) conflict
of interest policy; (4) a compliance list or schedule of statutory and regulatory obligations;
and (5) a Definite-term Funds Management Contract with a consultant firm in lieu of
employment contracts for senior officers of the trust. These documents are all normal
requirements for effective corporate governance in Liberia and under Liberian laws.

The instrument by which the trust is created (a trust’s primary, governing document)
needs to provide a clear statement of the purpose/objectives of the CTF, its status as a
private, non-governmental organization and composition, powers and responsibilities of
its governing body (or bodies). As stated herein above, the Liberian CTF can be created
under EITHER the trust laws of Liberia (in which case the trust instrument will normally be
a “deed of trust”) or under the Private Foundations statute of Liberia (in which case, the
primary governing instrument will be the “memorandum of endowment”).

By whatever means the CTF is created, the key requirement is that its primary governing
instrument clearly sets forth the following:

	 1.	 The purpose or objectives of the CTF;

	 2.	 The status of the CTF as a charitable or not-for-profit organization to continue in perpetuity;

	 3.	 The composition, powers, responsibilities governing body (or bodies) of the CTF,
      ensuring that the composition reflects a fair mix of representation of relevant agencies
      of government, extractive companies, civil society and international donors/partners
      that ensure a high level of independence; and

	 4.	 The initial assets/endowment irrevocably transferred to the CTF by the donors/trustors
      of the trust.

The purpose/objective of the Liberian CTF should embrace the full complement of
activities (including responses to challenges) identified by the Aggregated Offsets Report
and/or Liberian stakeholders as necessary for effective and sustainable management of
protected areas. The purpose and objectives of the Liberian CTF may therefore include,
but not be limited to (i) grant making to fund the cost managing all PAs by the FDA and
other relevant agencies; (ii) making of grants to fund community-based socioeconomic
development projects for the communities adjacent to each PA, including projects related
to alternative sources of food and occupational activities; (iii) funding of research activities,




	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	              125
       including study of the effectiveness of biodiversity offsets; (iv) handling of biodiversity
       payments under the aggregated offsets contemplated or proposed to be implemented in
       Liberia; and (v) the effective and prudent management of the financial assets of the Trust,
       including the priorities (or percentage of funding to be allocated across the key activities).

       The trust instrument should of necessity state the status of the CTF as a charitable
       organization that does not contemplate the making of profit and will not make a
       distribution of its assets irretrievably transferred to it. The clear statement of the
       charitable status is essential for easy registration of the Liberian CTF as a tax-exempt
       charitable organization covered by Section (9) of the Tax Code. The irretrievable transfer
       of assets is also necessary to satisfy the existential requirements of a trust, and also to
       ensure full tax-exemption coverage of all assets of the trust. The express statement also
       provides continuing notice to all directors and officers of the trust of their obligation to
       conduct the activities of the CTF in such a way that maintains its tax-exempt status. For
       example, the Kilimanjaro CTF is established as a not-for-profit organization by these
       words: “From this sequential realisation, we, the people of Kilimanjaro, have decided to
       form a Non-Governmental Organisation (NGO) called KILIMANJARO ENVIRONMENTAL
       CONSERVATION MANAGEMENT TRUST FUND. This organisation shall be executed
       under the guidance of the Government, shall involve Government and non-Government
       organizations; the Regional Administrative Secretary shall be the Chief Executive Officer.”

       The Trust deed or memorandum of endowment of the Liberian CTF should clearly
       define the composition, powers and responsibilities of its governing body, making sure
       that the membership of such governing body is carefully structured to promote high
       levels of independence and for representation of all relevant stakeholders. The rule of
       Liberian law is that all corporate powers are exercised by or under the aegis of the board
       of directors or trustees. It is also the rule of Liberian corporate law that unless otherwise
       stated in the articles of incorporation or a trust, the board of directors or trustees of has
       statutory authority to take any action, including removing and/or replacing any of its
       members if determined necessary for the effective governance of the legal entity. The
       foregoing rules emphasize the importance of stating fundamental principles, and rules of
       a trust in its primary, governing document. Given the statutory authority of a board as the
       body with ultimate responsibility for the governance of any corporation, including a CTF, it
       is important that provisions relating to the scope of authority of the board, its membership
       and means of selecting members are clearly set forth in the primary governing document.
       Otherwise, such matters may be stated in subsequent bylaws, which may be amended
       rather frequently, thereby leading to situation(s) tending to undermine the requisite
       stakeholders’ relationships.

       Another reason why it is important for the Trust instrument to state the composition, powers
       and responsibilities of the governing body is to ensure an inclusive, multi-stakeholders
       board with carefully defined rules for selection and removal of members. This inspires
       confidence of all segments of society including opposition politicians and other critics of
       any government, thereby helping to prevent the CTF from being seen from political lenses
       that leads to reluctance of communities to comply, poor support from civil society and
       attempted repeal or funding cuts in case of change of political leadership. It also helps with
       satisfying the policies of many donors for contributing to only CTFs or Funds that are not
       controlled by Government.


126	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
Based on a scan of stakeholders relevant to the work of a Liberian CTF, it is suggested
that the composition of its governing board be patterned after that of the Liberian EITI
(LEITI), but to have its membership comprise the following four (4) broad stakeholders
groups: (1) Agencies of the Government; (2) Private Sectors; (3) Communities/Civil Society;
and (4) Donor groups. Like the LEITI where the Ministry of Lands, Mines & Energy and
the Ministry of Finance are co-chairs of the LEITI MSGs, it may also be beneficial to have
the FDA and the EPA serve as co-chairs of the Governing board of a Liberian CTF. Having
a government agency chairing the board offers a lot of advantages, which may ensure
needed sync between the CTF work and that of the government and also helps fund-raising
as a number of donors will see such active involvement and leadership of the government
as demonstrated policy commitment to biodiversity conservation in Liberia. Regarding
the civil society stakeholder group, Leading civil society organizations such as SDI, Green
Advocates and SAMFUL could also form (on a rotational basis or otherwise) portions of the
representation from communities and CSOs, while existing county community forest bodies
may be organized to provide effective representation of communities. The selection of the
private sector representation could be basically patterned after the LEITI model but with
little or less representation from the oil and gas sector. The World Bank, USAID and one
or two bilateral donors could also serve on the board to ensure active participation of the
donor community, even if their representation could be gradually scaled down after a few
decades when the Fund had been fairly established.

It is very important, and is also a practice norm, that members of the governing board
have a range of competencies and experiences relevant to the work of the CTF. A good
board selection process will therefore include first defining the competencies/eligibility
requirements of members of the board.

It is essential that the Governing Body of the Liberian CTF promptly prepare and adopt
necessary bylaws to elaborate detail rules about governance of the Trust. The Bylaws
should and will cover quorum, frequency of meetings, notices for meeting; Board sub-
committees and other advisory/technical committees; Minutes Book and recordation
of minutes, number and appointment/removal of officers. Under Liberian laws, unless
otherwise stated in the articles or bylaws corporate decisions are taken based on simple
majority. Further, directors are required to meet at least four (4) times a year, and a meeting
of the Board may be held in or out of Liberia. The Board may hold a meeting by conference
call once all directors can hear one another simultaneously. Further, The Board can make
any decision without a meeting once a written consent in lieu of meeting is signed by all
directors setting forth the decision.

Some of the foregoing very flexible rules of normal corporate governance are not quite
amendable to the governance of a trust. Hence, there is a need to modify to default
corporate rules of Liberian laws by carefully drafted bylaws. It is important to have the
number of directors agreed based on the need to have fair representation of stakeholders
but with an objective of also avoiding difficulty in achieving quorum. The minimum of
15 members established by the LEITI Act is a useful point of reference. The Bylaws should
also provide, among others, for the holding of at least four (4) meetings a year, at least
two of which should be face-to-face meetings of director; adequate recordation of all
deliberations of the board or any subcommittees; and that at least two meetings be held
in Liberia.


	Appendix 3: Additional Details to Support the Establishment of a Conservation Trust Fund	        127
       The Bylaws also need to clearly elaborate the responsibilities of the management body
       headed by the chief executive of the Fund. The usual provision in every bylaw is that
       the Board will observe the line between oversight and executive functions relating to
       implementation of activities.

       Under Liberian laws, all directors and corporate officers owe the corporation fiduciary
       duties that include the duty of care (reasonable management of all property of the
       corporation); and duty of loyalty (honesty in fact and in deed, not putting self-interest
       over that of the corporation). Although the scope and consequences for these duties
       are well established under the Common law, the practice is to provide specific guidance
       relative to the key content of the duties through the bylaws and by way of a conflict of
       interest policy. It is therefore essential that the board of the Liberian CTF promptly prepare
       and adopt a concise conflict of interest policy that provides for the definition, identification,
       avoidance and management of potential and actual conflicts of interest to reduce exposure
       of the CTF to opportunism, legal and reputational risks. The Conflict of Interest Policy will,
       of necessity provide for the disclosure of all material, financial and investment interest
       (including regular updates of such disclosure); and the recusal procedures applicable when
       a situation of conflict of interest arises.

       It is of absolute importance that each director, officer and member of the staff of the CTF
       make a sworn declaration that they read and understood the CTF’s Conflict of Interest
       Policy and undertake to faithfully abide by same. Thankfully, the adoption of conflict of
       interest policies has achieved increased prevalence since the passage of the Liberian Code
       of Conduct act.

       The Stakeholders and/or the Governing Board of the Liberian CTF needs to engage a
       professional consultant firm to provide fund management services for the first five or
       more years to ensure a solid foundation for the CTF. The management of a CTF requires
       specialized skills and good years of experience, especially in these times of market
       volatility. Most of the skills sets are not readily available in country. Hiring a professional
       firm to manage the fund may therefore be an economically efficient means of obtaining
       all the needed skills set through one institutional consultant firm, which may be one of the
       international conservation NGOs or a fund management firm. This approach of addressing
       the administration and management of the fund will not only inspire confidence, but will
       help build the capacity of Liberian nationals to take over management of the CTF, thereby
       laying a solid foundation for the long-term success of the CTF.

       Significantly, a similar challenge was faced in designing the chain of custody system
       currently being implemented in Liberia. Then, a decision was made to hire a Swiss company
       called SGS to manage the COCS under a management contract for some defined period
       during which they would train Liberians and ultimately transfer implementation to them.
       That precedent is worth following.


       A.3.2.6  Conclusion/Next Steps
       The necessary legal framework, policy environment and financial conditions for
       establishing a CTF are present in Liberia. In keeping with this engagement to consider
       both possible opportunities and hindrances to establishing a Liberian CTF, I have carefully


128	   A National Biodiversity Offset Scheme
searched the laws, polices and financial conditions in Liberia, but failed to see any material
factor that could hinder the establishment of a CTF in Liberia. Instead, the research finds
that the laws of Liberia along with the attending policy and financial conditions are very
conducive for establishing a CTF in Liberia. Even where a CTF is for any reason established
in another country, Liberian laws permits it to apply for and be granted authority to
operate in Liberia under its original instrument of creation. Upon the granting of such
authority by the Registrar of Companies, the Trust may fully operate in Liberia as if it had
been established in Liberia. The procedures for original establishment and application
for authority are quite straight forward, and can take not more than ten (10) working days
maximum.

The next natural steps towards establishing a Liberian CTF may include the following:

	 1.	 Submission of report to FDA: This is necessary to have a focused discussion with FDA,
      as the statutory agency responsible for forest management, to obtain its buy-into the
      idea of a Liberian CTF.

	 2.	 Engagement with other relevant agencies: The FDA should then engage other
      relevant agencies of the Government to agree on a position on CTF, which the
      agencies could sell to the President of Liberia for announcement as a Government
      policy on CTFs.

	 3.	 Announcement of a CTF Policy: This policy should expressly provide for the design
      and governance of the CTF through a multi-stakeholders process.

	 4.	 Convening of a Stakeholders Meeting: The FDA along with other agencies then
      convene a meeting of relevant Liberian stakeholders to discuss and hopefully agree
      to the principle of a CTF, along with a timeline for its establishment. Also they agree
      to technical committees to prepare legal documentation; financial plans, and fund-
      raising strategies. Membership in each committee could be on the basis of individuals
      volunteering or appointment by the lead agency of the Government.

	 5.	 Submission of Reports of Technical Committees: The Reports of the technical
      Committees are vetted through meetings of stakeholders who then agree on the next
      course of actions.

	 6.	 Follow-up meetings and actions, as agreed.
