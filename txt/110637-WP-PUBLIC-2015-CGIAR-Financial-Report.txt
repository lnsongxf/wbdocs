Figure 5 below shows the disbursement rate in 2015,
compared with that of 2014. At the end of 2015, the
disbursement rate reached 99%, the same as in 2014.
While disbursements during the year have improved,
from 65% at the end of 2013 to almost 100% in 2014
and 2015, the idea of quarterly disbursements has not
been feasible.

As mentioned earlier, it is important to find
mechanisms that provide the flexibility of fund
disbursements earlier in the year.

         Notes:
         A      Legacy: Grants which were signed on or before 13 May 2011.
         B      Donor doesn't accept: Donor has expressly stated that it will not pay CSP.
         C      No indirect cost /donor indirect cost does not cover CSP: Donor has not expressly refused to pay CSP, but the maximum indirect
                cost allowed does not cover Center indirect cost and CSP.
         D      Non-SRF: Center indicates that grant is outside of SRF and so not liable to CSP.
         E      Other: Sundry reasons such as donations in kind, CSP already accounted for (Challenge Program), consultancy type income.
         F      Pending information: Further information has been requested from Center, but not received at time of publication.

CGIAR has long used five financial indicators:
(1)    The long-term financial stability ratio measures the adequacy of an organization’s reserves and its ability
       to absorb longer-term revenue reductions or funding shocks.
(2)    The short-term solvency ratio monitors the liquidity of a Center and its ability to pre-finance and operate
       in the short term when donor contributions are delayed.
(3)    The indirect cost ratio is an indicator of the cost of a Center’s support functions.
(4)    The management of the donor receivable/payable or current ratio measures cash flow from donors.
(5)    The external audit opinion provides an outside view.


Trends may be used to evaluate how a Center is               The following discusses these           indicators   and

Liquidity is an organization’s ability to meet its short-term spending requirements. The two primary indicators of
liquidity are:

a)      Center liquidity, which is calculated as working capital divided by daily operating expenses, expressed in
        days of operation, as illustrated in Figure 13 below. The minimum recommended range is 90-120 days.
b)      Current ratio, which is calculated as current assets divided by current liabilities, as shown in Figure 14
        below. The ratio should be at or above 1.

Daily operating expenses Total operating expenses of a Center, less deprecia-
                         tion divided by 365 days. This indicator measures
                         the daily cash requirement of a Center in the
                         course of normal operations.
Direct costs             Operating costs incurred by a Center that can be
                         traced directly to a project or discrete research
                         activity. Common examples of direct costs include
                         the cost of staff assigned to a specific project, or
                         the cost of supplies or equipment consumed by the
                         project.
Indirect costs           General and management costs not directly attrib-
                         utable to research, which need to be allocated
                         indirectly. They are also often referred to as over-
                         head, institutional costs or governance costs.
Indirect cost rate       Ratio of indirect costs to direct costs, expressed as
                         a percentage.
Liquidity                An organization’s ability to meet its short-term
                         obligations. Technically, it is the difference
                         between current assets and current liabilities.
                         Liquidity can be in terms of a ratio (called ‘current
                         ratio’) or number of days of operating expenditure.
                         Liquidity is also referred to as ‘working capital’.
Long-term stability      Indicator that measures the number of days of
(adequacy of reserve     operation that a Center can support from its own
indicator)               resources (i.e., reserves). It is computed as unre-
                         stricted net assets less net fixed assets, divided by
                         daily operating expenses, excluding depreciation.
