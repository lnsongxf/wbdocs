INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Adjusting to pressures
July 2013
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.

          Ihsan, Shakira Jones, Alex Sienaert, Ashley Taylor and Violeta Vulovic. Administrative

 Executive summary: Adjusting to pressures




Adjusting to mounting     The second quarter of 2013 was an eventful one as Indonesia’s economy, policy settings and
pressures and new         financial markets adjusted to pressures which have been mounting over recent quarters and
events, the second        to shifts in the global environment. Following slightly weaker-than-expected growth in the
quarter of 2013 saw       first quarter, there are signs that domestic demand, particularly investment, has continued to
significant economic,     moderate. On the fiscal front, the combination of lower revenues and higher subsidy
policy and financial      spending continued to pressure public finances. A revised Budget, incorporating a long-
market developments       awaited increase in subsidized fuel prices, along with a comprehensive compensation
in Indonesia              package to reduce the impact of higher fuel prices on the poor, was approved on June 17.
                          Meanwhile, international financial markets have reacted strongly to the prospect of
                          quantitative easing in the US winding down in coming quarters, triggering a major sell-off in
                          emerging market assets, including Indonesia, prompting Bank Indonesia (BI) to adjust
                          interest rates higher.

International financial   Predicated on the new signals that the US Federal Reserve will likely end its bond purchase
market volatility has     program by mid-2014, US Treasury yields rose markedly over the June quarter, with
increased…                spillovers to international financial markets. This was reinforced by the recent growing signs
                          of a significant divergence in economic momentum between key high income economies,
                          notably the US and Japan, gaining steam, and major developing economies, notably China,
                          growing at a slower pace than expected. These factors triggered a sharp sell-off of emerging
                          market assets and increased market volatility, including in Indonesia. Many emerging market
                          currencies slid against the US Dollar, the value of emerging equities fell by 7.5 percent over
                          the quarter (as measured by the MSCI EM local currency index), and the cost of government
                          financing rose markedly, with emerging market US Dollar bond spreads, for example, up by
                          50 basis points (as measured by the JP Morgan EMBIG index).

…and Indonesian asset Indonesian asset markets have corrected sharply in recent weeks, in line with other emerging

                      of May until the end of June. These outflows contributed to the 4 percent fall in Indonesian
                      equities from the start of May through the end of the second quarter and the significant rise
                      in the government bond yield curve, with yields climbing by 150-220 basis points since early

External demand is        The World Bank continues to expect a steady, if gradual, increase in global economic growth
projected to pick up      in coming quarters. This reflects a projected slow acceleration in activity in high income
only slowly in coming     economies, where growth remains generally sluggish but is on a firming trend, helped by a
quarters                  resilient US private sector recovery and prospects for stronger growth in Japan, while Euro
                          Area economic conditions remain difficult. The growth trajectory of developing countries is
                          also uneven, but is also expected to firm somewhat. Overall, Indonesia’s major trading
                          partners are projected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2013, similar to the rate in 2012, but 0.3
                          percentage points lower than the March 2013 IEQ projection, reflecting below-expectation
                          first quarter growth outcomes, such as in China. Major trading partner growth is projected to
                          pick up to 4.0 percent in 2014. The still modest global growth outlook, and the
                          strengthening of the US Dollar during the recent period of market turbulence, have also kept
                          downward pressure on commodity prices, with the prices of Indonesia’s most important
                          commodity exports declining significantly over the quarter.

A revised Budget has      The revision of Indonesia’s Budget (APBN-P) for 2013 occurred against the backdrop of
been approved and         weaker financial market conditions and signs of disappointing growth momentum amongst
subsidized fuel prices    some other developing countries. The key features of the revised Budget approved by
have been increased       Parliament were a revision of projected spending on fuel subsidies (to IDR 200 trillion),
                          predicated on a near-term increase in subsidized fuel prices, and a package of compensation
                          measures designed to reduce the impact of higher fuel prices on the poor. The 2013 deficit
                          has been revised upwards by 0.7 percentage points to 2.4 percent of GDP, due to lower
                          projected nominal revenues, in line with weaker anticipated GDP growth, and higher total
                          expenditure (including on fuel subsidies, despite the recent increase in subsidized prices).
                          The rise in subsidized fuel prices was made effective on June 22 with the subsidized petrol
                          price rising by 44 percent to IDR 6,500 per liter and the subsidized diesel price increasing by
                          22 percent to IDR 5,500 per liter.

Though inherently         The sizable increase in subsidized fuel prices is a major reform, and follows the missed
uncertain, the fiscal     opportunity to adjust prices in 2012. In the short-term it helps to cap the likely increase in
savings due to the fuel   the 2013 Budget deficit. Longer-term, the reform is part of a needed response to ongoing
subsidy reform may be     adjustments in Indonesia’s economy - increasing demand for imported energy due to strong
substantial               growth coupled with declining domestic oil production and, crucially, the imperative to
                          redirect fiscal spending more efficiently and more equitably in support of Indonesia’s
                          development agenda. The World Bank estimates that the direct fiscal savings from the
                          increase in subsidized fuel prices will be IDR 42 trillion in 2013, rising to IDR 85 trillion in
                          2014, the first full year in which the higher prices will apply. While significant, the base case
                          estimated savings are inherently uncertain. A rise in global energy prices or continued
                          weakening of the Rupiah could increase the gap between subsidized prices and the market
                          price, pushing subsidy spending higher, notwithstanding the recent price adjustment.
                          Therefore, there continues to be a strong case for building on this reform by increasing the
                          flexibility of subsidized prices and bringing them more into line with market prices.

Higher temporary          The macroeconomic impact of the fuel subsidy reform package is expected to be
inflation is the main     manageable and largely short-term in nature. The reform package is expected to have only a
near-term                 small net negative impact on growth in the near-term, with the negative impact on
macroeconomic             purchasing power for the poor substantially offset by the compensation package. The higher
impact                    fuel prices will initially have a large impact on inflation, raising annual average inflation in
                          2013 by around 1.8 percentage points to 7.2 percent, peaking at around 9 percent year-on-
                          year (yoy) towards the end of the year. However, the adjustment is a one-off shift of the
                          price level, which means the impact on inflation will be unwound by mid-2014, assuming
                          that long-term inflationary expectations are not affected and monetary policy is responsive
                          to any signs of second-round, persistent price pressures. The World Bank estimates that the
                          increase in subsidized fuel prices will narrow the current account deficit by a modest 0.2
                          percentage points of GDP in 2013, relative to a no-reform scenario. Over the medium-term,

                         the impact on Indonesia’s external accounts is difficult to quantify but should be broadly
                         positive, by encouraging the more efficient use of fuel imports and by bolstering investor
                         confidence in Indonesia’s fiscal position and policies.

The growth outlook       Growth in Indonesia moderated in the first quarter of 2013 to a slightly weaker than
has weakened,            expected 6.0 percent yoy. The economic outlook has also weakened, with commodity prices
prompting a downward     declining further and indications that investment growth is slowing more than initially
revision of the World    anticipated. Negative consumer confidence effects from the anticipation of the fuel subsidy
Bank’s projection for    reform, consequent temporary inflation, and the recent correction in asset markets, have
2013 GDP growth, to      added to the headwinds to domestic demand. The drag on growth from net exports is
5.9 percent              expected to diminish through the remainder of 2013, though the recovery in exports is
                         expected to be more subdued and import growth is expected to be weaker, reflecting the
                         weaker outlook for investment. Overall, the World Bank has lowered its GDP growth
                         projection for 2013 to 5.9 percent, from the 6.2 percent projected in the March 2013 IEQ.

Indonesia’s growth       While the World Bank’s base case is for a moderate slowdown in Indonesia’s growth in 2013,
outlook faces risks…     picking up again in 2014, the risk of a more pronounced growth slow-down is high. This risk
                         could be catalyzed by a more marked weakening in domestic demand, for example, due to
                         stronger-than-anticipated impacts from temporarily higher inflation due to higher fuel prices,
                         or a steeper or more prolonged reduction in investment spending growth, as the recent
                         financial market volatility hits confidence and increases financing costs. A further weakening
                         in commodity prices also poses a significant risk, given the importance of commodity-related
                         activity for foreign currency earnings, corporate profits and investment activity. The recent
                         uncertainty over the trajectory of China’s economy therefore also has a significant bearing on
                         the outlook.

…highlighting the        Recent events and the base case outlook for the coming quarters suggest that Indonesia’s
need for                 policy settings likely need to adjust to somewhat less buoyant economic conditions, and
macroeconomic policy     potentially to more difficult external financing conditions. Bank Indonesia’s decision to raise
settings to remain       the overnight deposit facility and policy rates in early June, and the increase in subsidized fuel
responsive to changing   prices, are examples of policy adjustments to changing conditions, which can help safeguard
conditions…              macro stability, in support of future growth. Allowing the Rupiah exchange rate to adjust

                         may also be desirable. Maintaining a flexible, yet predictable and well-communicated,
                         approach to macroeconomic policy-making, as well as continued progress in the
                         implementation of policies and improvement of the regulatory environment, will be key as
                         Indonesia continues to navigate a period of significant domestic and international economic
                         challenges.

…and the importance           The increase in social spending under the revised Budget, in part to help shield poor
of redirecting spending       households from the impact of higher fuel prices, is significant, and the design of the social
towards the most              compensation package demonstrates the important steps being taken towards developing a
vulnerable, with the          more comprehensive, integrated and well-targeted social support system. The approved
fuel subsidy reform           package of compensation measures totals IDR 29 trillion, or about three-quarters of the
compensation package          estimated total fuel subsidy savings in 2013. The compensation package comprises two main
contributing to this          components. First, a Special Compensation Program, which includes an unconditional cash
                              transfer (Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat, BLSM) for 15.5 million of Indonesia’s
                              poorest households for a period of four months, the provision of additional rice to
                              beneficiaries of the Rice for the Poor (Raskin) program, and additional spending on
                              infrastructure programs. Second, under the Social Protection Acceleration and Expansion
                              Program, spending on financial assistance programs for poor students and on the conditional
                              cash transfer program (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH), is being expanded. The evidence,
                              based on Indonesia’s past experience with unconditional cash transfers, suggests that these
                              measures can generally be expected to provide adequate, timely and effective assistance for
                              protecting the poor and vulnerable households that are least able to cope with the effect of
                              higher fuel prices, subject to minimizing implementation difficulties by focusing on
                              monitoring and feedback systems and making continued improvements in targeting.

Over the longer-term,         Social protection in Indonesia is also poised to be strengthened further when the new
the implementation of         national social security system (Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional, SJSN) starts being implemented
Indonesia’s new               in 2014. The SJSN aims to provide all Indonesians with the same health coverage, pension
national social security      (defined benefit), old-age savings (defined contribution), death benefits and work accident
system could bring big        compensation. If well implemented, the SJSN programs can help to reduce vulnerability,
improvements but will         protect against economic shocks, facilitate job mobility, reduce elderly poverty, help reduce
be challenging…               inequality, and mobilize scarce savings. However, the success of the new system will
                              ultimately depend on how well it is designed, implemented and managed. The Government’s
                              efforts to implement a well-designed, fiscally sustainable, robust and comprehensive national
                              social protection system will prove challenging and will require a series of major actions from
                              the Government and relevant administrative bodies to succeed.

…and will take place          The health coverage programs of the SJSN will be rolled out as Indonesia faces health and
against the backdrop of       nutrition problems of increasing complexity, driven by the processes of rapid development
a changing social             and urbanization. With a third of children under five stunted, not only is the capacity of the
environment, including        nation’s future workforce compromised, but their propensity for becoming overweight and
as the health needs of        suffering from cardiovascular diseases in later life is also greatly increased. Factors
Indonesia’s population        encouraging weight-gain, particularly for the growing share of Indonesians with urban
evolve over future            lifestyles, are exacerbating the situation, such that overnutrition problems are already
decades                       affecting the majority of adults. Unless action is taken now, not only to tackle maternal and
                              child undernutrition, but also to tackle the overnutrition problems in older children and
                              adults, the prevalence of Non-Communicable Diseases might increase dramatically, with
                              negative consequences for economic development and social welfare.

Continuing to improve         To enhance service delivery and increase the Government’s capacity to successfully
the efficiency of the         implement ambitious new programs such as the SJSN, further improvements in the
civil service will be vital   performance of Indonesia’s civil service bureaucracy will be required. Evidence suggests that
to meet Indonesia’s           the existing process of bureaucracy reform has already had a positive impact on human
ambitious development         resources dynamics in participating institutions, including recruitment and promotion
goals                         processes, and on staff productivity. Much more remains to be done, however, to sustain
                              productivity gains while ensuring a sustainable public sector wage bill, and modernizing
                              control systems and organizational design. Right-sizing of the government bureaucracy is a
                              politically sensitive issue but one that has been prioritized by the Government. A number of
                              legal, regulatory and capacity constraints to right-sizing remain to be overcome, but these can
                              be feasibly addressed, and doing so will be an important step forward in the creation of a
                              more efficient and effective civil service.

 Adjusting to pressures                                               Indonesia Economic Quarterly




 A. Economic and fiscal update




                 1. Emerging market assets fell sharply in recent months
Emerging market           International financial market developments in the second quarter have provided a stark
assets fell sharply,      reminder of the continued vulnerability of emerging markets, including Indonesia, to rapid
adjusting to new          changes in global financial conditions. The prospect of the unwinding of quantitative easing
information on            in the US, and reassessment of the relative economic growth trajectories of major high
quantitative easing and   income and developing economies, triggered a major sell-off in emerging market assets. US
the global economic       Treasury yields began to rise sharply at the start of May, with the 10-year benchmark
outlook…                  increasing by 80 basis points to 2.5 percent at the end of June. From the beginning of May
                          through the end of June, the value of emerging market equities fell by 7 percent (as
                          measured by the local currency MSCI EM index, Figure 1), and domestic bond yields and
                          US Dollar bond spreads rose by 120 and 70 basis points, respectively (as measured by
                          benchmark JP Morgan indices). Emerging market and commodity currencies like the
                          Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian Dollar fell on the order of 10 percent.

…and Indonesia has        Indonesian asset markets have also corrected sharply in recent weeks, in tandem with other
also been significantly   emerging markets. From the start of May through the end of the second quarter, Indonesian
impacted                  equities fell 4 percent, and foreigners were heavy net sellers of over IDR 18 trillion (USD 1.8
                          billon) in stocks, effectively erasing the substantial inflows seen previously in 2013 (Figure 4).
                          The Government bond yield curve has risen and flattened significantly, with yields climbing
                          by 150-220 basis points since early May. Foreign holdings of Indonesian bonds have also
                          declined sharply, dropping by IDR 14 trillion (USD 1.4 billion) since April (Figure 4). The
                          outflows from the Indonesian equity and bond markets in recent weeks do not appear
                          disproportionate to those seen across other major emerging markets, many of which have
                          also seen heavy outflows. Equity price performance has been comparable but domestic
                          bonds have underperformed relative to many of Indonesia’s peers, with expectations since
                          February of higher inflation due to higher subsidized fuel prices and a wider 2013 Budget
                          deficit contributing to the upward pressure on yields.

…as markets adjust to          The possible reduction of the US Federal Reserve’s bond purchasing program later this year
global policy changes          reflects expectations that the US economy will continue to improve, following growth in Q1
and diverging                  of 1.8 percent annualized, up from 0.4 percent in Q4 2012, and most economic data in
economic momentum              recent months surprising positively. In contrast, the recent performance of developing
                               economies has been patchy. GDP growth in Brazil was just 2.2 percent in Q1 at an
                               annualized pace and Indian real GDP was 4.7 percent higher than its year-ago level, close to
                               the slowest pace of expansion since 2009. China’s GDP in Q1 was higher by 7.7 percent yoy
                               (yoy) – strong growth, but below consensus expectations. The most recent available
                               economic data point to a continued significant divergence in economic momentum between
                               key high income economies (notably the US, Japan, and Germany) and major developing
                               economies (notably China) (Figure 2).

External demand is not    The World Bank continues to expect a steady, if gradual, increase in global economic growth
expected to pick up       in coming quarters. This reflects a projected slow acceleration in economic activity in high
strongly in coming        income economies, where growth remains generally sluggish but is on a firming trend,
quarters                  helped by a resilient US private sector recovery and prospects for stronger growth in Japan,
                          while Euro Area economic conditions remain difficult. The growth trajectory of developing
                          countries is also uneven, but developing country growth overall is also expected to firm
                          somewhat. On an annual basis, the economies of Idonesia’s major trading partners are
                          projected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2013, similar to the rate in 2012, and 0.3 percentage
                          points lower than the previous projection in the March 2013 IEQ, reflecting below-
                          expectation growth outcomes amongst major trading partners such as China in Q1. Major
                          trading partner growth is projected to pick up to 4.0 percent in 2014. The recent sell-off
                          across emerging market assets, and its potential impact on financing costs and availability,
                          and investor confidence, keeps the risks to these projections skewed to the downside.

                 2. The revised Budget: subsidized fuel prices raised and a larger
                    deficit projected
A revised Budget has      Against the backdrop of the weakening in international and domestic financial markets, a
been approved and         revised Budget (APBN-P) for 2013 was approved by Parliament on June 17. Its key features
subsidized fuel prices    were a revision of projected spending on fuel subsidies, predicated on a near-term increase
have been increased       in subsidized fuel prices, a package of compensation measures designed to reduce the impact
                          of higher fuel prices on the poor, and a higher projected Budget deficit for the year,
                          stemming from lower projected nominal revenues, higher total expenditure, and weaker
                          anticipated GDP growth. Accordingly, an increase in fuel prices was announced by the
                          Minister of Energy and Mineral Resources on June 21 (Regulation Permen ESDM No.
                          18/2013); effective June 22, the price of subsidized petrol was increased by 44 percent to
                          IDR 6,500 per liter and the price of subsidized diesel was increased by 22 percent to IDR
                          5,500 per liter.

The target budget         The revised Budget deficit target for 2013 is 2.4 percent of GDP, up from 1.7 percent
deficit for 2013 is now   previously (Table 4). The larger anticipated deficit results from a 2 percent downward
2.4 percent of GDP, up    revision of projected revenues, to IDR 1,502 trillion, and a 3 percent upward revision of
from 1.7 percent          expenditures to IDR 1,726 trillion. The primary deficit is projected to reach IDR 112 trillion
previously                (1.2 percent of GDP), which is IDR 72 trillion more than in the original Budget for 2013.
                          The lower revenue projection mostly results from lower expected tax revenues in 2013,
                          which are lowered by 4 percent from the original Budget to IDR 1,148 trillion, with the
                          biggest adjustments applying to projected income taxes and taxes on international trade,
                          reduced by 7.9 percent and 17.5 percent, respectively. Behind these downward revisions to

                            revenue projections lies a reduction in projected GDP growth from 6.8 to 6.3 percent. Oil
                            lifting for the year is also revised lower, to 840 thousand barrels per day (bpd) from 900
                            thousand bpd previously, but a USD 8 per barrel increase in the average crude oil price for
                            the year, to USD 108 per barrel, increases targeted oil-related revenues by almost 7 percent
                            compared to the original Budget for 2013.

Targeted expenditures       On the expenditure side, fuel subsidy spending is projected to increase by IDR 6.1 trillion
increase relative to the    versus the original Budget of IDR 193.8 trillion, despite the sizable increase in subsidized
original Budget on the      fuel prices. This reflects the fact that, in the absence of reform, energy subsidy spending
back of higher social       would have significantly outstripped the originally budgeted amount, reflecting fuel
spending and energy         consumption and price pressures. Electricity subsidies are targeted to reach IDR 100 trillion
subsidies                   (IDR 19.1 trillion more than in the original Budget), so that total energy subsidy spending is
                            projected to be 9.1 percent higher than in the original Budget, at IDR 300 trillion. The other
                            key feature on the expenditure side is an increase in social spending of IDR 7 trillion to IDR
                            81 trillion, due in part to the compensation package designed to reduce the impact of higher
                            subsidized retail fuel prices. Section B.1 discusses these new social assistance measures in
                            more detail.

The fiscal impact of        The World Bank estimates that in the absence of reform, the actual spending on fuel
the fuel subsidy reform     subsidies in 2013 would have overshot the original 2013 Budget target by approximately
is positive but will have   IDR 25 trillion. With reform, fuel subsidy spending is projected by the World Bank to be
only a modest net fiscal    IDR 177 trillion – somewhat below the level in the revised Budget of IDR 200 trillion, due
impact in 2013…             to different macroeconomic assumptions for oil prices, GDP growth and the exchange rate
                            (Table 4). The direct fiscal savings for 2013 of having increased the subsidized fuel price at
                            the mid-point of the year are therefore estimated by the World Bank to be IDR 42.1 trillion
                            (or 0.5 percent of projected GDP), and IDR 13 trillion net of the IDR 29 trillion
                            compensation package (or 0.14 percent of GDP). The main fiscal benefit conferred by the
                            subsidy reform in 2013, therefore, is that the Government will avoid significantly
                            overshooting targeted spending on fuel subsidies, which would have placed additional
                            pressure on a fiscal deficit which was already being widened by weaker than expected
                            revenue growth.

…while future fiscal        Relative to a no-reform, “business as usual” scenario, the fiscal savings over the next few
savings, while              years from the increase in subsidized fuel prices are significant (Figure 5). Using baseline
inherently uncertain,       macroeconomic projections and assuming a stable exchange rate and oil prices, fuel subsidy
are significant relative    spending is projected by the World Bank to drop to IDR 148 trillion in 2014 from IDR 177
to a no-change              trillion in 2013 and IDR 212 trillion in 2012. This implies a full year fiscal saving of IDR
scenario                    85.2 trillion in 2014 (0.8 of GDP), relative to having not increased fuel prices. Savings
                            relative to the no-reform scenario are projected to increase in the subsequent two years (IDR
                            97.7 trillion in 2015, and IDR 112.4 trillion in 2016). However, these multi-year savings
                            estimates are inherently uncertain, as they depend crucially on the future path of
                            unsubsidized fuel prices, which in turn depend on international energy prices and the Rupiah
                            exchange rate. A rise in global energy prices or continued weakening of the Rupiah could
                            increase the gap between subsidized prices and the market price, pushing subsidy spending
                            higher.

A cumulative budget            The first five months of 2013 saw a cumulative budget deficit of almost IDR 26 trillion. This
deficit of IDR 26              is an unusual result for the early part of the year; with the exception of 2012, when a budget
trillion was recorded          deficit of IDR 4 trillion was recorded, the budget balance is normally positive over this
for Jan–May 2013               period. The unusual part-year deficit is a result of relatively weak revenue growth and higher
                               spending, adding to the imperative to reduce fuel subsidy spending.

Revenue collection             Total revenues in January-May 2013 grew by 10.1 percent (yoy), which is slightly higher than
moderated in the first         in the comparable period in 2012 (8.3 percent), but considerably below that in 2011. Relative
five months of 2013            to the annual projection, revenue collection in the first five months of 2013 has been the
                               lowest in recent years (at 33.4 percent of targeted whole-year revenue), despite significantly
                               improved collection of non-tax revenues (which, however, represent only about 23 percent
                               of total revenues). Moderation in collections growth was recorded for all taxes, in line with
                               weaker nominal GDP growth, and moderation in consumption growth in particular, as
                               discussed in Section 4, as well as lackluster exports and commodity prices. The weakness in
                               income tax revenue growth is largely driven by weaker corporate income tax collection due
                               to slower nominal GDP growth and lower commodity prices, but was also affected by a
                               substantial increase in the taxable income threshold (Penghasilan Tidak Kena Pajak, or PTKP).1

Budget execution in          On the expenditure side, Budget execution displayed its typical seasonal pattern of moderate
the first five months        disbursements for the beginning of the year, but has slightly improved compared to previous
has slightly improved        years. By end of May, 30.6 percent of projected annual expenditures in the revised Budget
compared to previous         were disbursed, which is the highest in recent years, and even after excluding subsidy
years but remains            spending budget execution was moderately high compared with previous years, at 30.4
challenging                  percent. Overall, however, budget execution remains a challenge, particularly in light of
                             spending allocation changes as a result of the revised Budget which may complicate budget
                             execution over the remainder of 2013. In addition, ongoing challenges with respect to
                             conditional budget approvals (Bintangs) in the first quarter continue to cause delays in the
                             spending of some line Ministries.

Gross financing needs Funding conditions, both domestically, and externally in the wake of the rise in global rates
have risen considerably since May, have tightened since the previous edition of the IEQ. Following the revised
                        Budget and IDR 70.9 trillion increase in the projected deficit, gross debt financing for 2013
                        is expected to increase by IDR 52.6 trillion relative to the original 2013 target, to IDR 380.6
                        trillion, according to the Debt Management Office (DMO). The prospect of this additional
                        supply of debt has been one factor driving the significant correction in the domestic bond
                        market since February, along with anticipation of the inflationary effects of fuel subsidy
                        reform and international market conditions; bond yields have risen on the order of 150-200
                        basis points across the yield curve to levels last seen in mid-2011 (see Section 3 for more
                        discussion of financial market developments). This presents a somewhat more challenging
                        picture for issuance, with primary market demand weakening during the latter part of Q2
                        and 56 percent of the revised, higher gross issuance need for 2013 remaining to be met as of
                        June 25.2 Risks to the government finances from higher yields are mitigated by the relatively
                        low proportion of variable rate debt in the total debt stock (approximately 16 percent in
                        2012, according to DMO figures), and the Government has significant contingent financing
                        and cash reserves in place to draw on in the event of a more severe dislocation in the bond
                        market.

The World Bank               The World Bank projects that overall revenue collection in 2013 will be slightly lower than
projects that the 2013       projected in the revised Budget (Table 4), reflecting moderation in projected nominal GDP
fiscal deficit will be 2.1   and commodity prices (as discussed in Section 4), still challenging resources sector
percent of GDP,              conditions, and a small net negative effect on VAT collections from the fuel subsidy
slightly lower than in       increase. The World Bank also projects that overall expenditure will be slightly below the
the revised Budget           revised Budget, reflecting continuing challenges in budget execution (particularly for capital
                             and material spending), as well as slightly lower energy subsidy spending due to a lower oil
                             price assumption (USD 106 per barrel against the Budget assumption of USD 108 per
                             barrel). On balance, the World Bank projects a slightly narrower Budget deficit in 2013, of
                             2.1 percent of GDP, against the revised Budget target of 2.4 percent.

in markets follows a      this should be placed in the context of a generally robust performance in the first five
strong start to Q2        months of 2013. Indonesian equities performed particularly strongly in the first half of the
                          quarter, building on price gains in the first quarter amidst continued robust corporate profit
                          growth across most sectors and strong net foreign purchases of Indonesian equities, totaling
                          IDR 26 trillion (USD 2.7 billion) in the year to mid-May. Indonesian equities rose 20 percent
                          from the start of 2013 until 21 May, led by property (up 57 percent) and the consumer goods
                          sector (up 38 percent). Bond market performance was more mixed, with higher inflation
                          pushing yields somewhat higher, but foreign investors were still net buyers of IDN 33 trillion
                          worth of domestic bonds over the same period.

The bilateral US          After easing through March and April, aided by robust net foreign purchases of domestic

                          as IDR 9,960 per USD in late June for the first time since September 2009, while offshore
                          non-deliverable forward (NDF) rates breached 10,000 in early June. Surprising markets,
                          Bank Indonesia (BI) reacted on June 12 by raising its overnight bank deposit (FASBI) rate
                          by 25 basis points, to 4.25 percent. This was followed by a rise in the reference policy rate of
                          25 basis points to 6 percent on 13 June – the first increase since 2011.

                          exchange rate higher. The Rupiah has now appreciated by 3 percent on a trade-weighted
                          basis and by 4 percent on a real basis since the beginning of 2013. Consequently, since the
                          start of 2013 there has been little real adjustment of the exchange rate to Indonesia’s weaker
                          external position, suggesting that a combination of somewhat tighter monetary policy and a
                          continued orderly depreciation of the Rupiah may be appropriate.

Bank credit growth has    Credit growth continued to ease in the second quarter, with nominal credit growth slowing
eased recently, driven    to 22 percent yoy in April, cutting real growth (ex post) to 15 percent yoy in April, its
by weaker investment      weakest pace since December 2010. Investment lending has led the moderation, easing to 24
lending                   percent yoy to April, down from a peak of 30 percent to July 2012, in line with the
                          weakening in real investment activity (Figure 7). Growth in consumption lending slowed to
                          19 percent to March, while growth in working capital loans has also eased recently. Banking
                          sector system-level prudential indicators remained stable into 2013, with non-performing
                          loans remaining around 2 per cent, while profitability metrics for Indonesian banks remain
                          strong, including relative to regional peers.

Residential property        Despite a slowing pace of bank lending for construction and residential mortgages in recent
prices have accelerated     months (Figure 8), property price growth has accelerated. Nationwide property price growth
at the fastest pace in      was 11.2 percent in the year to March, the fastest pace for a decade. Higher prices were led
over a decade, while        by strong price growth among smaller homes (with floor space of less than 36 square
commercial property         meters), which are exempt from the stronger loan-to-value requirements introduced for
shows even stronger         residential mortgages in mid-2012. A new BI survey of the Jakarta secondary market for
growth                      residential property (excluding apartments) also points to strong price growth, with prices up
                            3.8 percent quarter-on-quarter in Q1 for medium-sized homes and 3.5 percent for large
                            homes, reflecting strong growth in Jakarta land values.3 Meanwhile commercial property also
                            showed continued robust price growth, with industrial land prices across the Jabodetabek
                            region up 65 percent over the year to the end of the first quarter, while office rental rates are
                            up 15 percent over the same period (Figure 9). Such rapid price growth in pockets of the
                            property sector bears careful monitoring but as noted in the March 2013 IEQ, overall
                            property-related exposures in the financial system remain relatively small with property-
                            related lending accounting for around 14 percent of total bank credit, and 12 percent of
                            corporate bond issuance in the year to March 2013.

                      4. The outlook for the Indonesian economy has weakened
The outlook for growth The rate of growth of the Indonesian economy moderated in the first quarter of 2013 to 6.0
has deteriorated..     percent yoy, slightly weaker than expected. The outlook for the economy has weakened, with
                       the lagged impact of lower commodity prices bearing down on investment and the economy
                       facing headwinds from the effects of renewed financial market turbulence and higher
                       subsidized fuel prices.

…prompting a                     The World Bank has lowered its projection for GDP growth in 2013 to 5.9 percent, down
downward revision of             from the 6.2 projection in the March 2013 IEQ, largely as a result of a more subdued
the World Bank’s                 outlook for domestic demand. Investment growth has slowed more than initially expected,
projection for 2013              while confidence effects from the anticipation of the fuel subsidy reform and correction in
GDP growth, to 5.9               asset markets have likely weighed on domestic demand. The drag on growth from net
percent                          exports is expected to diminish through the remainder of 2013, though relative to previous
                                 projections the recovery in exports is expected to be more subdued and import growth is
                                 expected to be weaker, reflecting the weaker outlook for investment. The net real sector
                                 impact of the proposed fuel subsidy reform is expected to be small, with the negative impact
                                 on consumption and investment from a higher fuel price likely to be largely offset by the
                                 positive impact on growth of the compensation package. However, with the higher outlook
                                 for inflation, further monetary tightening may be necessary, which could further slow the
                                 pace of growth.

Real GDP growth in               Indonesia’s economic activity moderated in the first quarter of 2013, as growth in domestic
the first quarter of 2013        demand, particularly investment, eased (Figure 10). Real GDP rose by 6.0 percent yoy in Q1,
continued to                     marking the tenth consecutive quarter of 6 percent or higher growth. The Q1 result was
moderate…                        lower than the 6.1 percent yoy growth seen in the fourth quarter of 2012, while on a
                                 seasonally-adjusted (sa) quarter-on-quarter (qoq) basis the economy grew by 1.3 percent,
                                 down from 1.7 percent in the fourth quarter. Nominal GDP growth also continued to ease,
                                 to 8.7 percent yoy, the slowest rate in 9 years (Figure 11). The weakness in nominal growth is
                                 due mainly to a sharp reduction in GDP deflator growth, with a significant fall in export
                                 prices on the back of lower global commodity prices a key contributor.

                               from over 6.0 percentage points in the June quarter of 2012, to a zero contribution to overall
                               investment growth in the March quarter of 2013 (Figure 12). This weakness is consistent
                               with the ongoing weakness in commodity-related activity, which draws heavily on foreign
                               capital investment. There was also some moderation in building investment in the quarter
                               (85 percent of total investment), which grew by 7.2 percent yoy, down from 7.8 percent in

A number of high                    High frequency indicators for April and May are suggestive of a continued moderation in
frequency indicators                growth. Continued falls in capital imports (Figure 14), along with the moderation in lending
have eased recently…                for investment discussed above, suggest that investment growth will stay weak in the very
                                    near-term. Imports of capital goods continued to fall for the fifth consecutive quarter in
                                    April, and were down 22.5 percent yoy. Growth in cement sales, a key indicator of building
                                    activity, moderated to 13.1 percent yoy in May, down from 16.8 percent in March and has
                                    weakened significantly in seasonally-adjusted sequential terms (Figure 15), indicative of a
                                    continuation in the moderation in building investment seen in the first quarter. However,
                                    continued robust demand in the residential property market, which has resulted in large
                                    increases in property prices as reported in Section 3, should lend some support to building
                                    investment going forward. While the HSBC PMI, at 51.6 in May, continues to suggest
                                    expansionary business conditions in the manufacturing sector, industrial production is
                                    showing signs of weaker momentum in seasonally adjusted sequential terms (Figure 15).
                                    Indicators of consumption point to some near-term weakness, with retail sales increasing by
                                    9.7 percent yoy, well down from growth of close to 20 percent yoy in late 2012. Measures of
                                    consumer confidence continue to trend down, with the BI consumer confidence index lower
                                    in both April and May, likely adversely impacted by the anticipation of the announcement
                                    Government’s subsidy reform. However, election spending in the lead up to the 2014
                                    presidential elections should provide a boost consumption growth in late 2013 and early
                                    2014, consistent with past experience.

The net growth impact               The increase in subsidized fuel prices may be an additional headwind for investment in the
of fuel subsidy reform              short-term, since it will add directly to the cost of transportation, and indirectly to the cost
is not expected to be               of intermediate goods, thus increasing both operating and investment costs. On the other
large                               hand, the reduction of wasteful spending on fuel subsidies should serve to boost investor
                                    confidence in Indonesia’s fiscal position and reform trajectory. The higher price of fuel is
                                    also expected to negatively impact private consumption through reduced purchasing power.
                                    However, the proposed compensation package (of around IDR 29 trillion), which includes a
                                    significant cash transfer to the poor, as discussed in Section B.1, will offset some of the
                                    negative impact on consumption. For non-poor households there may be a temporary
                                    reduction in consumption but this may be mitigated by a corresponding nominal wage increase as
                                    seen in 2008 when manufacturing employees’ nominal wage growth moved up in response to
                                    both the rise in fuel price and higher food price inflation. The Government’s compensation
                                    package also incorporates some spending on basic infrastructure (of IDR 7.25 trillion),
                                    which should have positive flow-on effects to other areas of the economy.

GDP growth is forecast The World Bank’s projection for GDP growth in 2013 is 5.9 percent, lowered from 6.2
at 5.9 percent for 2013  percent in the December 2012 IEQ (Table 6). Private consumption is expected to be the
and 6.2 percent for 2014 main driver of growth, supported by pre-election spending towards the end of this year,
                         though there may be some weakness in the near-term. Investment growth is expected to
                         cool further, as indicated by a continued moderation in credit for investment and the
                         sustained slowdown in spending on imported capital goods. Solid growth in building
                         investment, supported by robust growth in the residential construction sector, should
                         provide some offset, given that construction accounts for around 85 percent of total
                         nominal investment spending. Both import and export growth should remain under pressure
                         over 2013, with somewhat weaker than previously-expected major trading partner growth

subsidized fuel          The spike in inflation is expected to be temporary and will be completely phased out over
prices…                  time. Prudent management from BI should help ensure that there is not a persistent rise in
                         inflation expectations and underlying inflation. Unlike past fuel prices increases, these
                         increases have come at a time when inflation is well contained, with headline inflation
                         moderating in line with lower food prices and core inflation relatively low and stable.

                         the indirect impact is large as diesel is used by buses and trucks for public and commercial
                         transport. The once-off nature of this reform means that the impact on annual inflation
                         washes out by the September quarter of 2014, when headline inflation is expected to be 5.2
                         percent yoy (Figure 16).

…as well as pushing      The higher price of fuel is also expected to push poverty basket inflation significantly higher
up poverty basket        by around 1.2 percentage points in 2013 and 1.3 percentage points in 2014 to 7.4 percent
inflation…               and 8.0 percent, respectively. While, the average consumer will experience the price increase
                         both at the fuel pump and a generalized increase in prices of other goods, a poor
                         households’ consumer basket, which contains almost no direct consumption of fuel, will be
                         affected largely through the impact of higher transportation costs on the price of food
                         (which represents 60 percent of their consumption basket) and on public transport.

…but core inflation is   Underlying price pressures are expected to remain contained, with the impact on core
expected to remain       inflation expected to be more muted. This is because core inflation excludes administered
contained                and volatile items, with services and goods in the core price basket affected only indirectly by
                         rising transportation or other input costs of firms taking the opportunity to reset their prices.
                         Core inflation is expected to be around 0.5 percentage points higher in 2013 and 2014,
                         assuming that there is not a sustained increase in inflation expectations (a reasonable
                         assumption given the one-off nature of associated price increases, but will nevertheless
                         require vigilance on the part of BI to act in the event that higher inflation expectations do set
                         in).

Headline inflation             As mentioned above, the fuel price increases come at a time when headline inflation is
moderated in April and         easing, driven by lower food inflation, and core inflation is well contained. Headline inflation
May…                           eased to 5.5 percent yoy in May, down slightly from 5.6 percent in April and its recent peak
                               of 5.9 percent in March. Poverty basket inflation has also moderated, to 6.6 percent in May
                               from 7.0 percent yoy in March. Furthermore, core inflation remains relatively low and stable,
                               at 4.0 percent yoy in May, suggesting that underlying price pressures remain moderate
                               (Figure 17), though also helped by the declining trend of the world gold price. Meanwhile,
                               economy-wide inflation, as measured by the GDP deflator, continued to grow below
                               headline inflation in the first quarter of this year, easing to 2.5 percent yoy.

…due largely to food           Food price inflation has eased in recent quarters, to be 11.1 percent yoy in May, following
price disinflation             the beginning of the main harvest and the reversal of some import restrictions in March for
                               key staples, such as garlic and onions. Food inflation had risen sharply in the first 3 months
                               of this year, peaking at 12.9 percent yoy in March, and driving a pickup in headline and
                               poverty basket inflation. While this increase partly reflected the increase in food prices that
                               typically occurs in the lead up to the main harvest period, severe flooding in January, as well
                               as changes in trade policy as discussed in the March 2013 IEQ, also drove the price of key
                               food staples up. The reversal of some of these measures has seen price falls for a number of
                               key staples, with the price of garlic now below its level as of December of last year (Figure
                               18). The price of shallots has continued to come down, however, chili prices have increased
                               recently. The domestic price of rice, another key staple, has seen some declines in recent
                               months, though the gap between domestic and international prices has widened, as large
                               crops produced by major producer countries have reduced international rice prices.

Economy-wide price         Economy-wide price growth has remained muted, with growth in the GDP deflator
growth has been            moderating significantly from a recent peak of 8.5 percent yoy in Q3 2011, to its current rate
subdued, in line with      of just 2.5 percent. While this moderation partly reflects an easing in underlying consumer
weakness in export         inflation, it also stems from a significant easing in the prices of Indonesia’s exports and the
prices                     mining and quarrying sector. Export prices were 1.3 percent lower yoy in the March quarter,
                           while the aggregate price of mining and quarrying sector output was 1.4 percent lower. This
                           drop-off in prices has coincided with significant falls in the prices of Indonesia’s key
                           commodities since late 2011. There are some signs that economy-wide inflation could be
                           turning around, with sequential growth in the GDP deflator picking up in recent quarters.
                           Furthermore, with consumer prices representing a large share of the GDP deflator, GDP
                           deflator inflation will also be affected by the fuel price adjustment. Accordingly, GDP
                           deflator inflation is projected to rise to be 4.3 percent in 2013 and 6.3 percent in 2014.

The inflation outlook is   A further depreciation in the exchange rate and a sustained increase in inflation expectations
contingent on the          following the fuel subsidy reform and minimum wage increases, are key upside risks to the
movement in the            inflation outlook. Pass-through from the higher US Dollar/Rupiah exchange rate into
exchange rate and          consumer prices has so far been limited. This is in part because, when measured in trade
inflation                  weighted terms, the depreciation of the currency has been mild (see Box 2 in the December
expectations…              2012 IEQ), and the effective exchange rate has in fact appreciated in recent months, as
                           discussed in Section 3. A further weakening of the Rupiah, however, would present some
                           upside risk to inflation.

…which increased           Consumer expectations of near-term inflation have increased in recent months, in line with
significantly in May…      the anticipation of fuel subsidy reform and higher fuel prices in the near-term. The BI 3-
                           month price expectation index registered a significant increase in May, up by 14.5 basis
                           points reflecting large increases across all components, particularly Transportation,
                           Communication, and Financial Services. While it is usual to see a large increase in near-term
                           price expectations as Ramadan approaches, this increase was much larger than usual, likely
                           reflecting expectations of the mooted subsidized fuel price increase. Furthermore, the 6-
                           month price expectation index increased by 10.3 basis points in May, following declines over
                           the past two months. In line with the increase in consumer expectations, retailers are also
                           expecting inflationary pressures going forward, with BI’s 3-month retailer price expectation
                           index up 20 basis points in April.

…and will need to be       It will be important to monitor inflation expectations and price-setting behavior over the rest
monitored                  of 2013, given the fuel price increases, but also the large increases in minimum wages
                           granted for 2013. It is not expected that there will be a sustained increase in inflation
                           expectations as a result of the fuel subsidy reform due to the once-off nature of the price
                           increases. In addition, while there is no clear indication that the large increases in minimum
                           wages for 2013 granted by some provinces are materially feeding into higher inflation
                           expectations and wages, wage pressures may yet become more visible and filter into prices as
                           the year progresses. These upside, cost-push risks to the inflation outlook are mitigated by
                           signs of some moderation in domestic demand, which should serve to limit the risks of
                           second-round effects from higher fuel prices or wage pressures.

                                   April). Among Indonesia’s major commodity exports, only natural gas (which accounts for
                                   approximately 10 percent of total exports) has seen a strong recovery in global prices, with
                                   benchmark Asian LNG prices up approximately 11 percent in 2013 through May. In coming

                                Indonesia, supporting capital inflows over the longer-term. However, temporarily higher

Indonesia’s current             Looking ahead, the World Bank projects the current account deficit to total USD 25.2 billion
account deficit is              in 2013, or 2.7 percent of GDP. This implies a 2013 forecast current account deficit roughly
expected to persist at          in line with that in 2012 as a share of GDP, of 2.7 percent of GDP. This projection reflects a
similar levels to 2012          combination of gradually improving exports and weaker import growth, including due to
                                fuel subsidy reform. The current account is projected to narrow to 2.1 percent of GDP in
                                2014 as exports recover further. The overall balance of payments is expected to record a
                                deficit of USD 4.8 billion in 2013, on account of the Q1 outcome, anticipated whole-year
                                current account deficit, and the recent deterioration in capital inflows to emerging markets,
                                including Indonesia. As noted in the March 2013 IEQ, the weakening in Indonesia’s balance
                                of payments dynamics and further Rupiah depreciation pressures have occurred against the
                                backdrop of a gross external financing need which has risen significantly in recent years,
                                driven primarily by increased gross private external debt (see Box 2). Indonesia’s ability to
                                sustain strong FDI inflows, attract potentially volatile portfolio capital investment, and
                                navigate the needed adjustments to ensure the balance of its external position will therefore
                                likely remain in focus.

Box 2: External debt levels remain modest but liquidity risk has risen
Indonesia’s gross external stock has been growing since 2006, almost doubling from USD 133 billion to USD 257 billion as of April
2013. In light of the increase in market volatility seen during and since the 2008/9 global financial crisis, including over the last
quarter for emerging markets, this sizable increase in external debt in absolute terms merits closer examination to assess Indonesia’s
vulnerability to external shocks. At the outset, it is important to note that the sustainability of Indonesia’s external debt position is not
in doubt, with the latest (2012) IMF Article IV report, for example, finding that Indonesia’s “…external debt ratio is expected to
follow a declining path, and remain at manageable levels, under all standardized-shock scenarios.”

While total external debt (owned by non-residents) has risen in absolute terms, as a share of GDP external debt has trended lower,
declining from 47.7 percent of GDP in 2005 to 29.7 percent of GDP at end 2012 (Figure 27). This decline in external debt has been
driven by a sharp reduction in external public debt, which decreased from 28.4 percent to 14.8 percent of GDP. Conversely, the ratio
of private sector external debt to GDP has fallen to 12 percent in 2010 and risen again to 15 percent at end 2012. Private debt now
accounts for 50.2 percent of total external debt as of end-April, up from 40.3 percent in 2005.

The sustained increase in private sector external debt in recent years has been led by firms across several sectors, particularly those in
the mining and drilling, electricity, gas and water, and financial, leasing and business services sectors. The borrowing of the financial
sector, driven by foreign banks and joint ventures, accounts for the bulk of the debt increase. Financial sector external debt has
almost tripled, climbing from USD 12.9 billion in 2006 to USD 35.2 billion at end-April 2013, or 27.3 percent of total private external
debt (Figure 28), surpassing that of the manufacturing sector (down to 20.3 percent from 32.4 percent as a share of total). Firms in
the mining and drilling sector have been the next most active source of additional external borrowing, with debt rising four-fold over
2006-2012 and accounting for 16.8 percent of total private external debt at end April 2013 (Figure 28). Finally, the external debt of
companies in the utility sector has risen from USD 6.5 billion to USD 16.3 billion.

Standard metrics indicate an increase in the liquidity risks associated with Indonesia’s external debt position. Short term external debt
(by remaining maturity) has increased significantly since 2006 and now accounts for 21.7 percent of total debt, up from 15.6 percent
in 2006, due mainly to the rise in short term private debt, which now accounts of 72.6 percent of total short-term external debt, up
from 59.4 percent in 2006. The ratio of private short term debt over exports has grown steadily from 9.9 percent to 17.8 percent over
this period, though this ratio has also been affected since 2011 by the decline in exports. As of April 2013, total external short term
debt equated to half of Indonesia total currency reserves (Figure 27). Indonesia’s external debt service financing requirement has also
risen, increasing as a share of exports from a quarter in 2007 to more than three quarters in 2012 (Figure 27). There is also an
increasing reliance on US Dollar-denominated debt, which now accounts for 88 percent of total private external debt, to the relative
detriment of the Japanese Yen. Thus, while some firms may enjoy natural US Dollar hedges, such as in the mining and drilling sector,
the greater concentration of external debt in US Dollars may imply greater vulnerability to a sharp appreciation of the US Dollar.

A number of factors mitigate the risks Indonesia may face from the increased use of external financing by banks and corporations.
First, in the non-financial sectors, the bulk of new borrowing has been from parent and affiliated lenders and such inter-company

loans may be less vulnerable to roll-over risk, and are one component of the strong increase in foreign direct investment into
Indonesia experienced in recent years. In fact, if anything, official statistics likely understate the inter-company loan share in the
overall external debt, since inter-dependencies between onshore and offshore affiliated companies are not always transparent.
Further, since 2011, according to Bank Indonesia, compliance with external debt reporting requirements has also improved,
increasing the visibility of private external debt in the official statistics and making it more difficult to interpret the upward trend in
reported debt stocks and servicing costs. Over time, ongoing improvements in statistical coverage should facilitate improved
monitoring of Indonesia’s private external debt dynamics, including at the more micro level; the top 100 companies in terms of
external debt ranking account for around 65 percent of overall debt exposure.

                     7. Risks to the outlook remain heightened on domestic and external
                        grounds
The growth outlook              The World Bank base case is for economic growth in Indonesia to slow only moderately in
faces risks…                    2013, from 6.2 percent in 2012 to 5.9 percent in 2013, before picking up again in 2014. The
                                key risk to this outlook is to the downside, where the recent modest weakening in domestic
                                growth momentum extends and Indonesia experiences a more pronounced slow-down.

… as fuel subsidy               The increase in subsidized fuel prices, while necessary on fiscal grounds and a positive
reform presents                 development in terms of meeting Indonesia’s medium-term development goals, presents
challenges to                   challenges to macroeconomic management in the near term. Higher fuel prices will initially
macroeconomic                   generate a large one-off increase in the price level. Underlying price pressures are expected to
management in the               remain contained, yet if temporarily higher inflation shows signs of feeding into higher
short-term…                     inflation expectations, and if the Rupiah remains under pressure, further monetary tightening
                                may be necessary, slowing the pace of growth. The resilience of private consumption, the
                                single biggest source of demand in the economy, will be tested over the remainder of 2013
                                by the higher temporary inflation.

… while investment       The weakening of investment growth, which began in mid-2012, likely reflects the lagged
growth has continued     impact of weaker commodity prices since mid-2011. Commodity sector conditions affect
to weaken                investment directly, as seen by the sharp drop-off in foreign transportation, and machinery
                         and equipment investment, which is a key input in commodity-related activity. The strength
                         of commodity demand also feeds into investment demand indirectly by affecting export
                         earnings, household consumption (through household incomes, especially in regions where
                         commodity production is important), as well affecting investment funding availability
                         (through company profits). Given the complexity of these terms of trade and income effects,
                         the lumpy nature of many investment projects, and the uncertainty surrounding international
                         commodity prices, the future course of investment is difficult to predict and is a key source
                         of uncertainty in the growth projections. Furthermore, should the latest down-turn in
                         international commodity prices persist, investment could prove to be more of a drag on
                         growth than currently expected.

There is renewed         As set out in the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects report in June, the tail risks of a sharp
uncertainty over         slowdown in global economic growth, such as resulting from a renewal of financial market
external demand…         distress in the Euro Area, have lessened since the March 2013 IEQ. However, slowing
                         growth momentum amongst some major middle income economies and the sharp sell-off
                         seen in emerging markets in recent months adds to the uncertainties over the trajectory of
                         the global economy. Further weakening in global commodity prices poses a particular,
                         significant downside risk to the outlook for Indonesia’s economy.

…and highlighting the      Recent events and the base case outlook for the coming quarters suggest that Indonesia’s
need to make               policy settings likely need to adjust to somewhat less buoyant economic conditions, and
continued                  potentially to more difficult external financing conditions. Bank Indonesia’s decision to raise
macroeconomic policy       the overnight deposit facility and policy rates in early June, and the increase in subsidized fuel
adjustments                prices, are examples of policy adjustments to changing conditions, which can help safeguard
                           macro stability, in support of future growth. Allowing the Rupiah exchange rate to adjust
                           further gradually, should this be warranted by developments in Indonesia’s external position,
                           may also be desirable. Maintaining a flexible, yet predictable and well-communicated,
                           approach to macroeconomic policy-making, as well as continued progress in the
                           implementation of policies and improvement of the regulatory environment, will be key as
                           Indonesia continues to navigate a period of significant domestic and international economic

                           economic outlook are not yet known, but are likely to be in the billions of dollars. The
                           1997/98 haze episode is estimated to have cost USD 9 billion for Southeast Asia (Applegate,
                           2006) and USD 6.3 billion for Indonesia alone (according to the Asian Development Bank).
                           Today, with more sophisticated agriculture and tourism industries in place and higher
                           population density in these areas, the economic losses could be even higher.

                           On the environmental side, these fires have the potential to eliminate most of the recent
                           progress made on climate change mitigation in the forest sector. In addition, the fires and
                           haze generate tension with Indonesia’s important neighbors, distracts policymakers and
                           generates negative international publicity. The fact that this is a seasonally recurring problem
                           despite the substantial costs highlights the significant governance challenges present in the
                           natural resource sectors. Although the use of fire is illegal (in 2001, Indonesia passed a law
                           [Government Regulation 4/2001] that forbids all forest and land fires), fires are still
                           deliberately started for forest clearance purposes, especially within oil palm and industrial
                           tree plantation concession areas. Enforcement of the existing law and better land use
                           practices require a common effort from the public and private sector, including the
                           plantation companies, many of them from Malaysia and Singapore.

 B. Some recent developments in Indonesia’s economy




                 1. Examining the fuel subsidy compensation package
To avoid adverse         The reduction of the fuel subsidy is expected to increase inflation, driven primarily by the
effects of fuel price    increase in fuel, food, and transportation prices throughout Indonesia, as discussed in
increases on the poor,   Section 5 of Part A. As food and transport costs comprise a large share of a poor or
the Government will      vulnerable household’s expenditures, any increase in these costs is likely to have a negative
invest in a wide-        impact. World Bank projections estimate that, in the absence of compensation, the increase
reaching compensation    in fuel prices (to IDR 6,500 per liter for petrol and IDR 5,500 per liter for diesel) would
package…                 significantly slow the decrease in the poverty rate; without compensation, the official poverty
                         rate would fall from 12 percent in March 2012 to 10.5 percent in March 2014, implying a
                         significantly slower pace of poverty reduction than that seen over recent years. In contrast,
                         with a short-term compensation measure of a cash transfer to poor and vulnerable
                         households for four months, projections suggest that poverty will fall more significantly, to
                         9.4 percent by March 2014. The compensation package included in the revised Budget is
                         therefore expected to play a key role in helping Indonesia continue to reduce the poverty
                         rate in the short-term despite higher subsidized fuel prices, as well as constituting a
                         significant expansion of social protection over the longer-run. The following Section will
                         review the individual components of the Government’s overall compensation package, and
                         assess the extent to which these programs are expected to provide adequate, timely and
                         effective assistance for protecting poor and vulnerable households that are least able to cope
                         with the negative effects of higher fuel prices.6

… to both cushion        To avoid a negative impact of higher fuel prices on poor and vulnerable households, two
households in the        types of responses are required. First, short-term and temporary protection measures are
short-run and expand     needed to cushion households from the immediate inflationary impact of the fuel price
the social protection    increase. Second, long-term responses can help to support on-going poverty reduction
system in the long-run   efforts – especially targeting the poorest households – and address rising inequality.

                              Reflecting these twin response types, the Government of Indonesia prepared a
                              compensation package that is included in the 2013 Budget revision recently approved by
                              Parliament. The package, totaling IDR 29.05 trillion or about 74 percent of the total fuel
                              subsidy savings, includes two main components: a) the Special Compensation Program
                              (Program Kompensasi Khusus), and b) the Social Protection Acceleration and Expansion
                              Program (Program Percepatan dan Perluasan Perlindungan Sosial, P4S).

                         a. Short-term programs to protect poor and vulnerable households
Short-term programs to Program Kompensasi Khusus includes three temporary measures to protect poor and vulnerable
cushion poor           households from the inflationary shock of the fuel price increase:
households from
                       a. First, an unconditional cash transfer (Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat, BLSM) in
immediate effects have
                            the amount of IDR 150,000/household/month for a duration of four months will be
been controversial…
                            provided to 15.5 million households in two payments.
                              b.   Second, in addition to the 15kg of rice per poor household per month that is already
                                   being distributed through the Rice for the Poor (Beras Miskin, Raskin) program, the
                                   Government will provide an additional 45 kilograms (kg) of subsidized rice to the same
                                   households that will receive BLSM. This will be provided in 15kg bundles once a month
                                   for three months.
                              c.   Third, some of the savings will be re-allocated to three short-term infrastructure
                                   programs: community level infrastructure (Percepatan Perluasan Pembangunan Infrastruktur
                                   Permukiman, P4-IP), potable water systems (Percepatan Perluasan Pembangunan Sistem
                                   Penyediaan Air Minum, P4-SPAM), and irrigation and water source infrastructure
                                   (Percepatan Perluasan Pembangunan Infrastruktur Sumber Daya Air, P4-ISDA).

                              Much of the controversy surrounding the design of the compensatory measures has focused
                              on the proposal to use BLSM as an instrument to buffer poor and vulnerable households
                              from the fuel price increase. Opponents have argued that cash benefits could be easily
                              politicized and used as a means for political parties to garner support in the run-up to
                              general elections scheduled for 2014. In addition, there were many concerns about the
                              effectiveness of using unconditional cash transfers to protect the poor. Critics argued that
                              such programs are not effective; they are more likely to be misspent, not reach those who
                              deserve protection, foster laziness among the poor or create greater dependency on the state.

…but research shows       Research on Indonesia’s experience with unconditional cash transfers (UCTs) can shed light
that cash transfers are   on the debate about the effectiveness of the upcoming BLSM program.7 Following the
most effective in         increase of fuel prices in 2005, the Government launched the Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT),
quickly providing         which provided cash compensation totaling IDR 1,200,000, delivered in four installments, to
protection                a total of 19 million recipient households. The program was again deployed in 2008 when
                          fuel prices temporarily increased further, and 18.4 million households were compensated
                          with a total of IDR 900,000, divided into three payments. Research conducted by the World
                          Bank on the implementation and effectiveness of UCTs in Indonesia found that:
                           BLT was effective in preventing poor households from being negatively affected. The transfers, equal
                               to approximately 15 percent of monthly spending, were sufficient to keep targeted
                               households from falling further behind. Moreover, there was also a spill-over effect: the
                               BLT program actually helped to stimulate an increase in spending among non-recipient
                               households. As a consequence, the World Bank has estimated that without the 2008-09
                               BLT, poverty would have increased in March 2009 to 15.8 percent from 15.4 percent in
                               March 2008, rather than falling as it did with the BLT, to 14.2 percent.
                           There is no evidence that beneficiary households misspent the transfer. BLT was used to buy basic
                               necessities (especially rice), one-time costs like school fees or clothes for Eid ul-Fitr
                               holidays, or transportation costs. Spending on tobacco and alcohol did not increase in
                               BLT households relative to poor households that did not receive the transfer.
                           Similarly, there is no evidence that BLT induced laziness or dependency. Heads of households that
                               received BLT were not more likely to leave work. This is most likely because the size of
                               the benefit was not large enough, or sustained enough, to discourage working. In fact,
                               BLT households were more likely (by ten percentage points) to report that they had
                               found new jobs and moved into employment, perhaps using the BLT money for
                               transportation to more distant but better jobs, or to assist with childcare.
                           BLT funds reached almost all recipients on the beneficiary lists, but local officials increasingly extracted
                               “fees” from beneficiaries. Transfers were made directly from the Ministry of Finance to
                               beneficiary households, through post offices, eliminating opportunities for misdirection
                               of the funds. There were reports, however, that after cash transfers were collected by
                               recipients some post office officials and community officials charged “fees.” This
                               occurred 10 percent of the time in 2005, and 46-54 percent of the time in 2008-09. This
                               was typically done to re-distribute to households that were not included in the list (due
                               to miss-targeting or otherwise) and to subsidize collective transportation and identity
                               card costs.
                           There is no evidence that shows whether or not BLT undermined social capital. Some critics of cash
                               transfer programs in Indonesia argue that it can erode social capital such as seen
                               through voluntary community work, or gotong royong. No research to date, however, has
                               clearly proven the effects of cash transfers, either negative or positive.
                          These findings indicate that UCTs are effective in providing temporary assistance to buffer
                          poor households from short-term price shocks. Moreover, the mechanism for disbursing the
                          transfers is the more direct and simple than any of the other existing social assistance
                          programs available in Indonesia, although implementation matters for the benefits to be
                          fully effective.

But the exclusion of      Nevertheless, the BLT still excluded many poor and vulnerable households that were not
many poor indicated a     included on the beneficiary list. With a coverage of 18.5m households, BLT was targeted at
need for better           approximately the poorest 30 percent of households. Of these, around half were excluded,
targeting methods         according to a recent World Bank report, and half of all benefits went to households outside
                          of the poorest 30 percent. Despite this, when targeting was compared across Indonesia’s
                          major social assistance programs, BLT performed the best. In order to be effective as a
                          social assistance instrument, program targeting needs to ensure that benefits are received by
                          poor and vulnerable households.

In-kind transfers,         In-kind transfers, such as the provision of subsidized rice through Raskin, are another
however, are shown to      mechanism that can quickly provide protection to at-risk households. Previous research,
be less reliable           however, shows that the program faces many delivery challenges.8 In 2010, recipient
                           households reported that they bought an average of 3.8kg per month, far short of the 13-
                           16kg of subsidized rice that should have been provided to poor and vulnerable households
                           (based on public announcements). While some of the rice is re-distributed across
                           communities, up to 30 percent of Raskin allocations (based on estimates between November
                           2003 and January 2004) went missing in-between the distribution points and Raskin-buying
                           households; in some areas the estimated rate was as high as 75 percent. Furthermore, the
                           Raskin price for households is often higher than the stipulated price. Between November
                           2006 and January 2007, households reported paying IDR 1,689 per kilogram of Raskin rice,
                           while the official price was IDR 1,000 per kilogram. Efforts, however, are currently
                           underway to improve the targeting, socialization and delivery of Raskin benefits.

Advances in targeting      Since 2010, the Secretariat of the National Team for the Acceleration of Poverty Reduction
will ensure that           (TNP2K), with the assistance of Statistics Indonesia (BPS), has been developing a Unified

to reach the right         advantage of being a single registry to target all programs, rather than having to rely on a
households…                fragmented set of lists held by different programs, as was done in the past.9 As a
                           consequence, poor households are more likely to receive all the programs to which they are
                           entitled, rather than just some. Moreover, the careful design of the database and
                           incorporation of international best practices means that many of the previously excluded
                           poor households will now become program beneficiaries.

…as Indonesia begins       The BDT includes 25 million households, or just over 40 percent of Indonesians. BDT is
to move towards a          now operational and has already been used to select 400,000 new beneficiaries for the 2012
more integrated social     expansion of Indonesia’s pilot conditional cash transfer program, Program Keluarga Harapan
assistance                 (PKH). In addition, 76.4 million names were drawn from the BDT for the new Jamkesmas
framework…                 (health fee waivers for the poor) cards, and 15.5 million households for targeting Raskin.
                           Also, the Ministry of Education has agreed to use the BDT for the selection of beneficiaries
                           for Bantuan untuk Siswa Miskin (BSM), a series of programs that provide financial assistance
                           to poor students. The TNP2K team managing the registry has been working closely with
                           various regional governments at both provincial and district level who have requested the
                           data for local government social assistance and poverty alleviation programs financed by
                           regional budgets. For some of these programs, such as Jamkesda (local health assistance
                           programs, which supplement Jamkesmas), using the Unified Database to select beneficiaries
                           provides the necessary coordination in targeting to avoid overlapping beneficiaries.

                           With the launch of Program Kompensasi Khusus and P4S, the Government is taking the
                           opportunity to issue a Social Protection Card (Kartu Perlindungan Sosial, or KPS) to the
                           poorest 15.5 million households in the database. This card is the basis for receiving BLSM
                           and additional Raskin benefits from the compensation program, as well as for eligibility for
                           an expanded BSM under P4S. The use of a single card for multiple programs marks an
                           important first step towards an integrated social assistance framework in Indonesia. This
                           will be the first time Indonesia has coordinated social assistance programs and beneficiaries
                           using a single registry, and paves the way in the future for integrated delivery of benefits, as
                           well as complaints and grievances.

…and ensures that         Furthermore, the Government will be coordinating with local communities to help identify

                         however, will depend on designing and delivering methods that can be scaled up and

                              households in 2013 and 3.2 million households in 2014. At the same time, average
                              benefit levels will increase from IDR 1.4 million to IDR 1.8 million per year per
                              household.
                         By re-allocating fuel subsidy savings to its long-term social programs, Indonesia is effectively
                         using this opportunity to both scale up and reform its emerging social assistance system.
                         This is much needed. In 2010, Indonesia spent almost IDR 30 trillion on its social assistance
                         programs, equivalent to 0.5 percent of GDP. This is low in comparison to other East Asian
                         countries that spend, on average, 1 percent of GDP, or Latin American countries that spend
                         an average of 1.3 percent of GDP. Although there is still a need to deepen investments in
                         social protection as Indonesia transitions to more sophicated systems that are appropriate
                         for a middle-income economy, the reallocation of fuel subsidy savings this year is a
                         significant step in the right direction.

assistance program
                              Improvements in the adequacy of BSM assistance. In the past, assistance was not adequate for poor
                              families to keep their children in school. Typically, the benefit levels were equal to
                              approximately 30 percent of education out-of-pocket costs faced by families. Also, BSM
                              amounts were not indexed to inflation; therefore, beneficiaries saw the value of the transfers
                              erode over time. By increasing the benefit levels through the P4S program, it is more likely
                              that households will be able to afford to keep their children in school for the mandatory
                              levels of primary and junior senior secondary.

                              Improvements in the targeting of BSM assistance. The P4S program continues the Government’s
                              overhaul of the methods used to target BSM. As mentioned above, the Ministry of
                              Education and Culture and the Ministry of Religious Affairs have been working closely with
                              the TNP2K Secretariat to use the Unified Database to target BSM beneficiaries. Previously,
                              the distribution of assistance was carried out by school-based committees based on local
                              quotas that were not aligned with regional poverty rates. The targeting performance was
                              poor; a student from the richest 60 percent of households was equally likely to receive
                              assistance as a student from the bottom 40 percent of households.

                              In addition to using the unified database to identify student beneficiaries, major changes
                              have been made in how benefits are claimed. Students from eligible families can now
                              approach schools, carrying their Social Protection Card and supporting documentation, to
                              claim their entitled assistance. By empowering beneficiaries in this way, it is expected that the
                              expansion of BSM through the P4S program will help to ensure that a greater share of
                              assistance will reach students who are at the greatest risk of dropping out.

PKH                      natal care, immunizations, and growth monitoring check-ups for babies and infants.11
                         Program impact on improving school enrollment and time spent in school, however, was
                         statistically insignificant (with the exception of hours spent in school, which only saw a 5
                         percent improvement over baseline values). As with BSM, given existing PKH
                         implementation issues identified in the World Bank’s review of Indonesia’s social assistance
                         programs, the reforms that will be carried out through the P4S program are also likely to
                         increase the effectiveness of the PKH program.

                         Improvements in the adequacy of PKH benefits. It is likely that the full impact of the program was
                         not realized because the benefit levels did not match the expenses faced by families in order
                         to afford health and education services. For example, benefit levels were sufficient to cover
                         the total expenditures for one year of junior secondary education, but less than half (43
                         percent) if transportation costs were included. Similarly, mid-wife delivery charges range
                         between IDR 200,000 – 800,000 (based on a 2008 SMERU study), which at the high end is
                         equivalent to the previous PKH transfer for pregnant mothers. Also, the benefit levels have
                         not been adjusted for inflation, which has eroded the real value of the cash transfers over
                         time; this resulted in a 22 percent decline in the real value of the benefit levels between 2007
                         and 2010 (adjusted using poverty basket inflation).

                         Under the P4S program, minimum benefit levels will increase from IDR 600,000 to IDR
                         800,000 per year per family, and the maximum benefit level will increase from IDR
                         2,200,000 to IDR 2,800,000 (the calculation is based on number of number and age of
                         children, and the inclusion of pregnant or lactating women in the family). In addition, by
                         receiving the Social Protection Card, PKH beneficiary families will automatically have access
                         to the BSM program, BLSM and Raskin allocations. This will be the first time that individual
                         programs in Indonesia are deployed as a system to provide comprehensive support to
                         extremely and chronically poor households. Taken together, this assistance will allow them
                         to better afford to invest in health and education services, increasing the chance that their
                         children can better help themselves escape poverty.

Attention is needed to   The design of the compensation package is a major advance in the evolution of Indonesia’s

and monitored            and effective delivery of the individual components of the program. In the past,
                         implementation problems have undermined the efficacy of these programs. In the BSM
                         program, for example, 83 percent of students who reported receiving assistance in 2009
                         reported receiving only 39-50 percent of stated benefit levels. Although it takes time to build
                         effective delivery systems, there are immediate actions that the government can undertake to
                         monitor and improve the delivery of P4S programs.

                               First, focus on improving beneficiary awareness of entitled benefits under the compensation package. In
                                the past, the delivery of social assistance programs has been undermined by limited
                                beneficiary knowledge about the program or how to claim benefits. A vast majority of
                                interviewed Jamkesmas cardholders, for example, did not know what hospital
                                outpatient services their card entitled them to. An experiment conducted by J-PAL in
                                cooperation with the TNP2K Secretariat on innovations in Raskin delivery, found that
                                beneficiaries received more subsidized rice when awareness raising activities informed
                                them about how much rice they were entitled to. Therefore, communication materials
                                and strategies prepared by the TNP2K Secretariat for P4S play an important role in the
                                implementation of the program, but responsibility still falls on implementing agencies to
                                use the materials to improve awareness of beneficiaries and their communities.
                               Second, conduct in-time monitoring of the program in order to fix problems during implementation and
                                ensure accountability for P4S delivery. Program monitoring is typically carried out by local-

                     findings for the evaluation can be linked to future budget allocations of implementing
                     agencies to encourage improvements in program delivery.

                  2. Indonesia’s challenge: implementing the new social security system
Indonesia is               The Government of Indonesia is in the process of implementing a new National Social
implementing a new         Security System (Sistem Sosial Nasional, or SJSN). Programs under the new system are
social security            mandatory and will cover all Indonesians, including both formal and informal sector
system…                    workers, for five benefits – health, pension, old-age savings, death benefits and work
                           accident – and provide the same benefits for all. Contributions to the SJSN programs are set
                           at levels that are sufficient to finance expected expenditures; each fund should be self-
                           sustaining. The legal bases for the new system are Law No. 40/2004 on National Social
                           Security System and Law No. 24/2011 on Social Security Administrative Bodies (Badan
                           Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial, or BPJS). This Section provides a brief overview of the ambitious
                           task of implementing the SJSN system, focusing on key challenges and factors to consider
                           for successful implementation of the new and comprehensive social security system.

…which may bring big The national social security system will help Indonesia mobilize the population’s increasing
benefits for the country disposable income to strengthen the coverage and depth of the health system, protect
and its citizens         against premature death and work injuries, and provide income security following exit from
                         the labor force. The SJSN programs are consistent with the government’s pro-poor, pro-
                         jobs, pro-growth agenda, and will play a major role in supporting the government’s
                         macroeconomic policies, in the medium- and long-term. They are also part of the programs
                         to ensure human rights and individual dignity for all Indonesians. If implemented well, the
                         SJSN programs can help reduce vulnerability, protect against economic shocks, facilitate job
                         mobility, reduce poverty among the elderly, help reduce inequality, and mobilize scarce
                         savings.

Fulfillment of the SJSN    The success of the new system will ultimately depend on how well it is designed,
vision depends on          implemented and managed. The Government’s efforts to implement a well-designed, fiscally
future decisions and       sustainable, robust and comprehensive national social protection system will prove
actions                    challenging and will require a series of major actions from the Government and the BPJS to
                           succeed. Collaboration among implementation working group members from multiple
                           ministries will be needed to ensure collective agreement on the broad strategy for the
                           implementation and operation of the new system.

                        a. Putting the change in context: Where Indonesia is now
Social security            Indonesia currently has social insurance schemes covering separate segments of the labor
coverage is currently      market. A different social security administrator manages each scheme. These
fragmented and             administrators are for-profit state-owned enterprises that report to the Ministry of State-
incomplete…                Owned Enterprises and are supervised by a variety of different Ministries. Only about 12
                           percent of workers are covered by a pension scheme, almost entirely in the formal sector,
                           and about 60 percent of the entire Indonesian population are covered by health insurance.

…with coverage for         The administrator PT Taspen manages the pension and endowment insurance programs for
civil servants, the        civil servants and PT Asabri manages the pension and endowment insurance for military and
military and police        police personnel. Civil servants receive a lifetime pension annuity financed by the state
                           budget and paid through PT Taspen. They are also eligible for an endowment insurance
                           program that pays a lump sum at retirement and death benefits before and after retirement.
                           Military personnel have very similar benefits to those of civil servants, but PT Asabri
                           manages those programs. Only civil servants, the military and those covered by voluntary
                           employer-sponsored defined benefit pension plans are currently eligible for lifetime monthly
                           annuity benefits.

… but limited coverage PT Jamsostek provides social insurance for formal sector workers. Almost every enterprise
for formal sector      is obliged to register itself and its workers with PT Jamsostek and provide social security
workers…               benefits to its employees. Unfortunately, compliance is poor and only about 10 million out
                       of an estimated 40 million formal sector workers are active contributors. One of the social
                       insurance programs is an old age savings fund, referred to as Jaminan Hari Tua (JHT).
…and very limited      The bulk of informal sector workers have no social protection. There is a small pilot

informal sector, and      program for informal workers sponsored by Jamsostek that includes old age savings
health, coverage          benefits. The progress in expanding coverage through the Jamsostek pilot project, however,
                          has been slow. The total number of members was only about 400,000 by the end of 2010.
                          The turnover of members is also very high, as members can sign up and leave the program
                          at any given time.

                          In terms of health insurance coverage, PT Askes provides insurance primarily to civil
                          servants and their families and covers about 16.4 million people. PT Jamsostek provides
                          health insurance to about 5.5 million people, while another 10 million are covered by
                          employers who opted out of Jamsostek coverage and established their own programs. The
                          Jamkesmas fee-waiver program sponsored by the Ministry of Health provides coverage to
                          about 86.4 million poor and vulnerable people while Jamkesda programs (financed by local
                          government budgets and generally complementary to the national Jamkesmas program)
                          cover about 32 million, though some of these may also be covered by Jamkesmas. Finally,
                          about 5 million individuals have purchased private health insurance. Consequently, the total
                          covered is about 150 million, or about 60% of the population.

Implementation of         The SJSN program implementation began in earnest with the passage of the BPJS Law in
SJSN, starting with the   November 2011. The law reduces the number of social security administrators, introduces a
health system, is now     new legal and governance structure and a simpler system of supervision, increases system
underway…                 transparency and provides more open public information. In addition, decrees issued by the
                          Coordinating Ministry of People’s Welfare in February and March 2012, established the
                          bureaucratic structure and responsibilities for SJSN implementation.

                          The SJSN health system will begin on January 1, 2014. The Government has already issued
                          a regulation defining the benefit package for the health program. The required contribution
                          rates for the poor, informal sector and formal sector, however, are still under discussion.
                          The health benefit package is comprehensive and covers almost all types of medically-
                          required interventions. This is consistent with the requirements of the SJSN Law. It also
                          maintains the high level of coverage that is currently provided under the Jamkesmas
                          program, which has the richest benefit package of any program in the country today. Even
                          expensive procedures such as open heart surgery, organ transplants, hemodialysis and cancer
                          treatment are covered. This will put a tremendous strain on Indonesia’s health system, as it
                          will likely take the government years to increase the supply side – facilities, equipment,
                          medical supplies and health care professionals – to sufficiently handle the expected demand
                          for sophisticated health services.

                          The SJSN employment programs – including pension (defined benefit), old-age savings
                          (defined contribution), death benefits and work accident – will not begin until July 1, 2015
                          and consequently, they are at an earlier stage of development. A roadmap to guide the
                          implementation is expected to be issued shortly. Active discussion on the design and
                          financing of the SJSN employment programs, the rules for investment of pension plan
                          assets, and the rules for asset-liability management of the pension program have also begun.

…including                Based on the BPJS law, there will be only two administrators: one for health and one for the
institutional             employment programs. The two BPJS will be not-for-profit public legal entities operated in
transformation            the best interest of all participants.

                          Both PT Askes and PT Jamsostek – the BPJS Health and BPJS Employment, respectively –
                          are actively working on their transformations, with a focus on those activities that must be
                          completed by December 31, 2013. These include the impending shutdown of both
                          companies, the calculation of plan liabilities, the transfer of assets to the new BPJS and to
                          the appropriate social insurance funds, and the starting financial statements for BPJS Health
                          and BPJS Employment. There is also on-going discussion about the governance structure,
                          internal audit procedures, oversight and supervision of the two new entities.

                      b. Coverage, cost and fiscal sustainability considerations
Universal coverage        The national social security system is a bold effort to transform Indonesia’s social protection
promotes labor            system. One of the main goals is to achieve universal coverage – that is, to cover all
mobility and stabilizes   Indonesians in the new system regardless of whether they work in the formal or informal
program financing         sector. With the new programs beginning in 2014 and 2015, the government plans to reach
                          universal coverage by 2019. International experience, however, suggests that it will likely take
                          a decade or more to expand coverage to the entire population. For example, in Japan and
                          Korea it took more than 20 years to achieve full coverage. Nonetheless, if it is done well,
                          everyone will participate and receive benefits from the programs and the costs of the
                          programs will be equitably shared to achieve social solidarity. Universal coverage will also
                          allow workers to change jobs without losing coverage, and will create a more dynamic labor
                          market.

A successful system       The nationwide SJSN programs will differ in both design and coverage from the existing
will require attractive   programs and will include a new defined benefit pension program. There are two
benefits at a fair and    fundamental ways to think about designing the SJSN programs. The first method – the
affordable price          social policy perspective – is to determine the desired level of benefits and then calculate the
                          costs and required contribution rates. The second method is to start by determining the
                          amount that employers, labor and the government are willing and able to contribute and
                          then work backward to determine the affordable level of benefits. In practice, it is best to
                          use a combination of both methods to produce optimal results. The goal is to find a
                          combination of benefits and contributions that are both meaningful and affordable even in
                          the face of adverse experience.

                          The process of defining benefits and setting contribution rates for the SJSN programs will
                          need to take into account different characteristics, needs, and ability and willingness to pay
                          between formal and informal sector workers. Programs must be designed with workers’
                          wants and needs in mind, but at the same time the required contribution rates must be
                          actuarially determined and set at a reasonable level for workers, employers and government.
                          Workers must be able to afford the contributions and the contribution rate must not create
                          an unreasonable burden on employers. In the end, workers and employers should contribute
                          because they want to, not because they are forced to. Reasonable benefit levels and modest
                          contribution rates will also allow the government to pay for the poor without jeopardizing
                          the country’s fiscal position.

                          The SJSN health program provides a good illustration of these challenges. The SJSN law
                          requires a comprehensive medical package and this has been incorporated into the
                          implementing regulations. The contribution rates for the poor, informal sector not poor and
                          the formal sector are still under discussion, as are the methods that will be used to reimburse
                          medical personnel and facilities for their services. Although the new system begins on
                          January 1, 2014, it will take time for the system to be able to fully deliver on its promises.
                          Some of the many challenges facing government include raising members’ awareness of the
                          program and it eligibility conditions and benefits, managing participant expectations,
                          building a network of public and private providers and facilities, and improving the capacity
                          and quality of the medical system. All these activities, as well as population aging will
                          increase the demand for high quality, sophisticated medical services. It will be challenging
                          for the government to provide these comprehensive medical services while keeping costs at
                          a level that participants can afford.

Programs must be          In this respect, it is important to formulate and implement policies and procedures to ensure
fiscally sustainable in   the fiscal sustainability of the SJSN social insurance funds and to ensure that the financial
the short and long-       risks of the social insurance programs are properly managed. Financial analysis, complex
term…                     actuarial calculations and sophisticated computer models are needed to quantify the financial
                          impact of proposed designs and ensure that contributions are sufficient to pay promised
                          benefits.

…with sustainability     Another reason for caution in setting contribution rates is that the SJSN Law does not allow
considerations           the net assets from one SJSN social insurance fund to be used to subsidize deficits in
applying to each fund    another fund. Rather, each fund must have its own contribution rate and be self-sustaining.
                         Although the BPJS and the social insurance funds are not-for-profit, the social insurance
                         funds will require some net asset, set at a sufficient level to cover claim reserves and to
                         cover random fluctuations in claims. Without some net asset, the funds would need to turn
                         to the government for additional funds every time claims were higher than expected.

                         The amount of net asset required will vary by fund, as the risk of adverse claim fluctuations
                         is greater for some funds than others. For example, the risk of higher than expected claims
                         is greater in the health fund than in the death benefit fund.

                         Although not required by law, to the extent possible, within any one fund the contribution
                         rates for the formal sector, informal sector who are not poor and the informal sector poor
                         should be properly calculated so that there are minimal subsidies among the three groups.
                         Otherwise, the groups that are paying too much will resent being forced to subsidize the
                         benefits of the groups that are paying too little.

The SJSN pension         The SJSN pension program presents several additional challenges because the cost will
program poses            increase over time as the pension system matures and as the population ages. This program
particular challenges    must be carefully monitored, managed and adjusted to keep it fiscally sustainable over time.
                         Pension programs have particularly long time horizons. Workers may begin making
                         contributions at age 20, may not retire for another 40 years, and then may receive benefits
                         for another 30 years. Consequently, the time frame for planning, financing and investing is
                         very long. Pension plans take decades to fully mature and are significantly impacted by long-
                         term trends such as population aging. For this reason, pension models often make
                         projections over 75 to 100 years. Especially for pensions, the short-term impact of program
                         introduction or changes is normally very different from the long-term impact.

                    c. Administration, governance and capacity considerations
Robust administrative    In order to properly administer the social security programs, it is important to ensure
systems are needed,      everyone receives a unique identification number and that there is no duplication of
particularly for the     identification numbers. The SJSN and BPJS laws make each BPJS responsible for issuing
unique IDs required…     unique ID numbers to its members. Since using different ID numbers for the health and
                         employment programs is inefficient, the two BPJS will need to work together to issue a
                         common identification number for use in all five SJSN programs.

                         The unique ID number has two distinct purposes. It will allow individuals to prove their
                         identity when requesting services or receiving payments. And it will be used to track
                         individual salary, service credits and contribution history in the social insurance funds. The
                         unique identification numbers for SJSN members could be the same as the national
                         identification number (Nomor Induk Kependudukan, NIK) or it could be a different number
                         that is mapped to the NIK. Assessment should be done on the adequacy of the NIK and
                         any potential enhancements that could be made to help facilitate its effective use in SJSN
                         program administration.

…and for collection of   Another key administrative task is to collect and properly credit contributions for all
contributions from       workers. While contribution collection mechanisms for formal sector workers are already
both formal and          available today in Jamsostek’s mandatory social insurance programs, there is still widespread
informal sector          evasion. The current participation rate in Jamsostek’s old age savings program (Jaminan Hari
workers…                 Tua, JHT) is below 30 percent, in large part because Jamsostek lacks enforcement authority.

                         Unlike formal sector workers, there is no effective contribution collection mechanism
                         available for informal sector workers. Consequently, it is crucial to develop an effective
                         contribution collection model for the informal sector now. Otherwise, there will
                         undoubtedly be low informal sector participation. This will have two negative consequences.

                         Informal sector workers will not be entitled to benefits from the SJSN programs, and the
                         financial stability of the SJSN system will be undermined. When evasion is widespread, it
                         negatively impacts the financial solvency of the insurance programs, because only the poorer
                         risks will choose to join while the better risks will choose to evade. This is known as adverse-
                         or anti-selection and it can easily threaten the financial stability of the social insurance
                         scheme.

…which will need to      The Government will need to study a wide range of possible collection mechanisms,
be piloted and tested    examine other countries’ experiences and pilot test possible options for collecting
                         contributions from both formal and informal sector workers. The choice of contribution
                         collection strategy combined with effective enforcement and proper program design is
                         needed to ensure program stability and continued political support. One important part of
                         any solution will be the maximum use of integrated IT systems to automate administration,
                         reduce errors and control costs.

Proper governance and    Good governance and oversight of the SJSN system and BPJS operations is critical given the
supervision are needed   large amounts of money that will flow into the five SJSN social insurance funds and the
to ensure system         critical role the two BPJS play in the social protection system. The BPJS must be held
integrity                accountable for properly administering the SJSN programs and performing their assigned
                         responsibilities. Performance benchmarks are needed and there should be a system of checks
                         and balances in place that ensures transparency and accountability so the public will have
                         trust in the system. International accounting standards (accrual accounting) should also be
                         implemented to present a clear picture of the financial status of the BPJS and the social
                         insurance funds that it manages. It is important to have separate accounting for the BPJS
                         and for each of the social insurance funds, as fund assets and liabilities are not BPJS assets
                         and liabilities, and the assets of each of the social insurance funds must be kept separate.
                         The two BPJS must operate the programs in the best interest of participants, and
                         participants' complaints should be promptly heard and addressed. The BPJS Law requires
                         the BPJS to establish a quality control unit to handle complaints and respond within
                         specified time periods.

                         By law, the BPJS will be supervised internally by their Board of Commissioners and by an
                         internal audit department. In addition, they will be supervised externally by the National
                         Social Security Council (Dewan Jaminan Sosial Nasional, DJSN), the new Financial Services
                         Authority (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan, OJK) and the State Financial Audit Board (Badan Pemeriksa
                         Keuangan, BPK). It is important for the specific roles and responsibilities of all these parties
                         to be clearly defined and understood, and these arrangements should be agreed to and
                         documented in writing.

Government capacity      Risk management and overall capacity building are needed to ensure that the SJSN programs
to manage risks is       are properly managed. The Ministry of Finance needs the human resources and IT systems
needed to protect the    to properly monitor the financial status of the SJSN programs and make adjustments to
financial integrity of   design features and contribution rates to ensure their long-term fiscal sustainability. The
the system               responsible unit will need to include actuaries, statisticians, mathematicians, demographers
                         and experts in computer modeling to properly gather and manage needed data, maintain
                         financial and actuarial models to project plan costs and periodically adjust contribution rates
                         to maintain long-term solvency of the programs. Personnel in the supervisory organizations
                         must be knowledgeable and ensure there is an effective structure for external supervision
                         and control of BPJS operations, and an effective internal audit department within the BPJS.
                         If this is not done properly, it could result in a large liability for the state budget. This could
                         happen if programs become underfunded and the state budget must make up for any
                         shortfalls. Therefore, it is in the Government’s best interest to develop an effective
                         computer modeling and risk management capability, and effective external supervision.

importance of the         responsible for operating the programs, they will have more trust in the system and are more
SJSN system               likely to participate without being compelled to do so. This will be particularly true for
                          informal sector workers. While their participation in the program is mandatory, it will be
                          harder to enforce payment. The BPJS Law relies on informal workers coming to the nearest
                          BPJS office to pay contributions, making it important to raise their awareness of program
                          benefits.

                     e. Summary: a long journey towards comprehensive social security coverage
Implementation is a       Ensuring a successful system will require attention to key implementation issues that include

require time and          program implementation; developing a national retirement income strategy and assuring the

stakeholders to fully     financial and actuarial models and government capacity to ensure the fiscal sustainability of
implement                 the SJSN programs. As discussed in this Section, particular attention should be paid to the
                          program design features and the proper calculation of required payroll contributions.
                          Carefully designed and implemented administrative systems and procedures will be needed
                          to issue unique identification numbers, collect contributions, maintain individuals’ accounts,
                          and pay benefits properly and in a timely fashion. All of the above will need to be supported
                          by the required regulations and decrees, and by outreach and awareness building of the
                          program (that is, program “socialization”).

                          The implementation will likely be challenging and take longer than expected to fully achieve
                          the stated goals. However, the new programs, even if they do not fully achieve all their lofty
                          goals, will still be a significant improvement over the current system, and there will be
                          opportunities to further improve the programs and the overall system over time.

Nutrition problems          Household incomes have increased significantly in recent years but, partly due to this

to Indonesia’s              that this Section explores. With a third of children under five stunted (that is, shorter than
development…                expected for their age), not only is the future capacity of the nation’s workforce
                            compromised, but their propensity for becoming fat and suffering from cardiovascular
                            diseases in later life is also greatly increased. Changing consumption patterns and lifestyles
                            associated with increasing urbanization are exacerbating the situation, such that overnutrition
                            problems are already affecting the majority of adults. Unless action is taken now, not only
                            tackling maternal and child undernutrition but also tackling the overnutrition problems in
                            older children and adults, the prevalence of non-communicable diseases (NCD) will increase
                            dramatically, undermining Indonesia’s economic progress in coming decades.12

                            unlike stunting, can be reversed. Undernutrition of micronutrients is also common and can
                            contribute to growth failure as well as other body dysfunctions, such as anaemia in cases of
                            iron deficiency and goitre resulting from iodine deficiency. Overnutrition is most commonly
                            measured in terms of overweight and obesity, caused by eating more food than is needed
                            and leading to accumulation of body fat. Obesity is recognized as a disease condition and in
                            adults is commonly measured by the Body Mass Index (BMI) which is weight divided by
                            height squared.

Overnutrition is            The DBM is a global problem that affects rich and poor countries alike: 25 percent of the

                            income countries (LMICs) are considered to be affected by the DBM, with overweight
                            increasing faster than underweight is decreasing in most of them. While globally obesity has
                            doubled in the last three decades, it has tripled in LMICs in just two decades.

                            laid down in preparation for a scarce environment in life outside the womb. If stunted
                            children have accelerated weight growth later in childhood, there is an increased risk for

                             of lost productivity, the cost of child undernutrition in Asia has conservatively been
                             estimated at 2-3 percent of GDP.16 The cost of treating NCDs in stunted adult populations
                             will be expensive. In South Africa, for example, the cost of treating CVD alone was taking
                             up a quarter of health spending a decade ago. NCDs are already responsible for the majority
                             of deaths worldwide, and are disproportionately high in LMICs, where nearly 80 percent of
                             all NCD deaths occur. The World Economic Forum suggests that globally NCDs will cost
                             more than USD 30 trillion over the next 20 years, representing 48 percent of global GDP in
                             2010. This will undermine economic growth in LMICs especially unless mitigation measures
                             are taken.17 In Indonesia, DBM is likely to seriously undermine efforts to reduce poverty as
                             well as erode economic growth, thus impeding progress towards achieving the first priorities
                             of the 2010-2014 RPJMN.

The poor are more          However, despite the evidence showing that obesity is on the rise, misperceptions of the
affected by overweight     issue tend to cloud its urgency. For example, in many circles, it is assumed that obesity is
and obesity than the       exclusively a problem of the rich. But this is not the case in Indonesia. The Basic Health
rich                       Survey (Riskesdas) of 2010 showed that although overweight/obesity increased with
                           income, peaking at 32 percent in the upper wealth quintile, the lower wealth quintiles were
                           also affected (about 20 percent). The greatest number of overweight and obese individuals is
                           found in the poorer segments of the population, and conditioned by increasing obesogenic
                           (i.e., obesity-causing) urban environments. The poorest adults in these environments, who
                           are also the most stunted, are particularly vulnerable.

Indonesians may be         Another misperception concerns the physical nature of obesity, as this often calls to mind

do not appear to be        Indonesia. Even those that do not appear “fat” may be carrying significant amounts of
“fat”                      hidden fat in their bodies. This is in part a result of constrained growth in the first 1,000
                           days, followed by the accelerated growth during childhood perpetuated by urban lifestyles.
                           Further, for Indonesians, the health risks associated with having excess body fat – whether
                           visible or not - begin at a BMI lower than that in other parts of Asia, and certainly lower
                           than the international standard.18 That this excess fat is not always physically evident
                           contributes to an underestimation of the urgency of the problem in an increasingly inactive
                           and urbanizing population.

                         c. Understanding the causes of DBM in Indonesia
The causes of DBM          While the causes of DBM across the course of one’s life are complex, a useful way to analyze
are divided into four      DBM in Indonesia is to adopt the system map of obesity developed by the Foresight Project
thematic areas             in the UK. This map groups more than 100 variables into four thematic areas: health and
                           biological environment; economic and food environment; physical and built environment;
                           and socio-cultural environment.

Health and biological      Indonesia is well on its way in its demographic transition. Deaths due to communicable

cause of death             throughout the country. At the same time, life expectancy has improved. Today, NCDs
                           account for the majority of disability and mortality in Indonesia. CVD is the leading cause of
                           death, accounting for 30 percent of all NCD deaths, followed by cancer, chronic obstructive
                           pulmonary disease, and diabetes.

The health system has      The health infrastructure, however, is still deficient in many ways. Sanitation coverage has

support nutritional        not well-equipped to implement nutrition interventions, due in part to health workers’ lack
programs                   of training in nutrition and a perception that stunting and obesity/overweight are not
                           significant problems, or linked to NCDs. Few health facilities measure nutritional status
                           routinely and many lack the equipment to do so. Indonesia’s strong commitment to achieve
                           universal health coverage (UHC) for its population, however, combined with launching its
                           Scaling Up Nutrition initiative, represent excellent opportunities to improve nutrition.

                              introduction of complementary foods. In 2010, only 15 percent of babies were breastfed
                              exclusively for 6 months – half of the 32 percent that was reported in 2007 and much less
                              than the 40 percent, which was reported in 2002. Breast milk substitutes are still commonly

                          awareness of the DBM problem, schools are not yet a venue for preventing child obesity.
                          Urban planning and local government have an important role to play in increasing options
                          for pedestrian physical activity as the majority of the population does not get enough

The socio-cultural        Indonesia continues to retain its traditional cultures even while immersing itself in all forms
environment is also       of modern media. Traditional customs influence maternal and early child undernutrition, and
increasingly obesity-     social norms dictate that many women get married at young age: 25 percent of all women of
causing                   reproductive age are married before age 18, and 10 percent before age 16. The age of the
                          mother at first birth is a key correlate of child health outcomes, where the risks of stunting,
                          diarrhoea, and anaemia diminish significantly as a woman delays her first birth through to
                          age 27-29 years, regardless of socioeconomic status.19 At the same time, children watch
                          around 4 hours of television a day, and the advertising of processed food dominates the
                          media, with advertisements targeted toward children. The majority of parents report that
                          their purchases are influenced by their children’s choice more than advertisements,
                          suggesting the need to curb these external influences, as recommended by the World Health
                          Assembly.

                        d. Addressing DBM in Indonesia
An overarching policy     The actions needed to strengthen the response to nutrition issues are well-established and
framework is needed       recognized under the global Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) Movement, which Indonesia joined
                          in September 2012 alongside 39 other countries. Indonesia also plays a strong role in the
                          Movement’s Lead Group. Focusing on maternal and child undernutrition, the Government
                          is progressing on its SUN policy framework and planning guidelines. Indonesia should build
                          on the SUN framework as it considers how to further enhance its responses to the DBM
                          problem across the life course. An overarching DBM policy framework is needed to increase
                          coordination among government ministries in four policy pillars: food security, food safety,
                          healthy lifestyles, and nutrition. Most of these focus areas are included in the SUN platform
                          established under the Coordinating Minster of Peoples Welfare. Some of these policies and
                          strategies are already contemplated in the National Action Plan for Food and Nutrition,
                          2011-2015, developed by the National Development Planning Agency (Bappenas). As the
                          plan for 2016-2020 is developed, the other elements in the framework should also be
                          considered.

Existing interventions    Many of the necessary interventions are already being implemented in Indonesia and the
need to be scaled up,     firm commitments underpinning Indonesia’s plans for universal health care and the SUN
while addressing gaps     Movement are laying the groundwork for future improvements in nutrition. But while there
                          has been progress in covering some areas, gaps remain. For example, implementation of
                          direct interventions during early life, especially breastfeeding, still need to be improved.
                          Similarly, despite advances through food fortification with micronutrients, maternal anemia
                          also needs greater attention. Finally, social welfare programs have helped ensure food
                          security among the poorest of the poor, but a greater emphasis is needed on food quality as
                          well as quantity. Schools are critically important venues for enabling healthy lifestyles that
                          will help mitigate the effects of DBM, but have not yet been utilized for this purpose. Health
                          professionals need better training in nutrition, so that stunting is perceived as an issue, and
                          that overweight and obesity are recognized as problems to be prevented, not just treated.

ambitious bureaucratic     size of the civil service. To address this challenge, the Government of Indonesia has
reform process that        embarked on a radical reform process known as bureaucracy reform (BR), which was
began in 2006              introduced in 2006 starting with the Ministry of Finance (MOF). The objectives of the
                           reform are to streamline business processes, improve the policies and practices of human
                           resource management and reduce corruption in the Ministry of Finance. Since then, the BR
                           agenda has been rolled out across ministries and other government agencies. As of 2012,
                           around 56 ministries and agencies were involved in BR, which will extend to another 22 in
                           2013 and 2014.

A key feature of the       One of the key features of this reform initiative, as designed by MOF, was the introduction
reform is the              of an extra BR allowance tied to job type. This is different from the basic salaries and
introduction of an         allowances that are tied to rank and seniority. An evaluation of current jobs was carried out
extra allowances based     and new job descriptions were then developed, determining the complexity, scope and
on job analyses and        accountability of jobs. Based on this evaluation, allowances of different sizes were
grading                    introduced for each job type. This Section will review the BR allowance initiative and the
                           evidence on the impact of the allowances on performance. It will also discuss current
                           bureaucracy reform priorities, particularly the importance of restructuring and right-sizing.

                       a. Impact of bureaucracy reform
BR allowances have         While BR allowances have increased wage bills in participating institutions, independent
led to improvements in     evaluations – such as the annual Public Service Integrity Survey issued by Indonesia’s
the modernization of       Corruption Eradication Committee (Komisi Pemberantasan Korupsi, or KPK) – have indicated
human resource             that BR has had positive impacts in MOF. These positive changes include improved
practices...               recruitment processes, which ensure that recruits are adequately qualified. BR also supported
                           the establishment of Assessment Centers used to assess current employees’ competencies
                           and potential for promotion. Performance evaluations of units and individuals has also
                           improved using approaches such as the Balanced Scorecard methodology. In addition,
                           training has become more technically focused. These modernized human resource practices
                           imply that BR is supporting the professionalization of civil servants in key institutions.

…as indicated by a         These positive outcomes are confirmed in a pay and performance survey that was recently
recent pay and             undertaken by the Ministry of Administrative and Bureaucracy Reform (MenPAN-RB) and
performance survey         the World Bank. The survey was conducted in 2012 and covered more than 4,000 Jakarta-
                           based civil servants, in lower ranks20, drawn from fourteen government ministries and
                           agencies. In the survey, ministries and agencies were divided into four categories: (1) those
                           that have received BR allowances; (2) those that were approved but had not yet received BR
                           allowances; (3) those that had applied to participate in the BR program; and, (4) those that
                           had not applied to participate in the BR program. The aim of the survey was to provide an
                           assessment of progress to date in Bureaucracy Reform.

… indicating that          The survey indicates that staff in ministries and agencies that have undertaken bureaucracy
participating              reform are more likely to agree that their colleagues contribute more than expected (Table
institutions have better   9). Promotion and regulatory decisions in participating institutions appear significantly less
recruitment and            likely to be unpredictable and the product of favoritism. In addition, surveyed staff believe
promotion systems          that institutions that have undergone BR are better at identifying the best candidates for jobs
                           and can recruit high quality staff more easily.




                           20Lower ranks, in this context, refers to civil servants that are categorized as Echelon IVA, IIID and
                            IIIA. Echelon 4 staff have worked in the civil service for approximately 8 years, while Echelon III staff
                            have worked in the civil service for approximately 8-13 years.

                                At the same time, it would help to move the responsibility for implementation of civil

                        c. Restructuring and rightsizing in the Government of Indonesia
Restructuring             Restructuring in Indonesian agencies faces specific regulatory and operational constraints.
government agencies       The current civil service regulatory framework, based on Law 8/1974 (amended by Law
faces regulatory and      43/1999), was a codification of the New Order regime’s concept of the Indonesian civil
operational constraints   service. This is based on a centralistic, highly detailed approach, which is inspired by military
                          practices that gave little flexibility for line ministries and agencies. The guiding principle
                          could be characterized as “one size fits all.”

Many agencies suffer      Within this system, civil service organizational structures and staff establishments are based
from fragmentation of     on symmetric rather than operational considerations. This places a focus on balanced
tasks and decision        numbers of units and sub-units and a certain number of positions at each level, rather than
making, as well as        on what is needed operationally. As a result, many government agencies suffer from
overstaffing and          fragmentation of tasks as well as of decision-making powers, since these are distributed
redundancy                among a large number of pre-defined sub-units. Another result of the current regulations is
                          overstaffing in most institutions, implying both quantitative (too many units and sub-units
                          and too many positions) and qualitative (unqualified position holders) redundancies.

The need for “right-      In addition to the restructuring imperative, there are two other key drivers for right-sizing.

staff needed for          wage bill and the lack of clear and transparent productivity benchmarks, along with the
enhanced service          introduction of BR allowances.25 This problem could be partly assuaged by a reduction in
delivery                  staffing levels. Secondly, there are significant numbers of poor performers in the civil
                          service who lack the knowledge, skills and abilities to deliver the enhanced service delivery
                          that BR is working towards. For these individuals, right-sizing could offer a socially and
                          politically acceptable exit strategy.

staff and appointing      and staffing levels; remove staff who do not have a place within the new structure; and
new staff                 appoint staff and new joiners to positions in the new structure.

                          23 Indonesia’s civil service pension program and endowment savings program (Tunjangan Hari Tua,
                            THT) are stand-alone retirement programs, providing benefits solely to civil servants and distinct from
                            retirement income program covering other segments of the labor force. The pension and THT
                            programs are sponsored by the government and administered by PT Taspen, a State-Owned Enterprise

Streamlining of           There are a number of legal and regulatory “windows” that could provide severance options

possible, especially      structures of government agencies. The basic civil service law (Art 23, Law No. 43/1999)
through retirement…       permits termination due to “streamlining of government” – but there appears to be
                          reluctance to use this provision, and some uncertainty about how it would be applied in
                          practice as implementing regulations are still missing. A more tractable option is likely to be
                          retirement – either at the normal retirement age of 56 years, or using the provisions for early
                          retirement at 50 years of age, plus 20 years of service (Pensions Law No. 11/1969).

…but a reliance on        There are a number of constraints to successful and cost-effective severance of surplus staff.
early retirement will     Reliance on early retirement will impose substantial additional burdens on the civil service
burden civil service      pension scheme, which itself should be undergoing a fundamental reform. While the future
pensions                  pension costs of regular retirement at 56 or 60 years should already be factored into pension
                          reform models, significant additional early retirements at 50 years (which is currently rare)
                          are not. While financing this additional investment raises a challenge, it is important to note
                          that the expense is a one-off increase in pension liabilities, not a higher expense trajectory.

There is a need to        With no guidance from MenPAN-RB on the development of severance programs, there is a

wide standards on         political and equity reasons it would be reasonable for civil servants to expect at least as
severance                 good a severance deal as the previous best on offer – hence a costly “leveling up” dynamic is
                          likely to occur in the absence of a government-wide standard. Ministry-level schemes may
                          also fall prey to moral hazard, as the programs’ designers will be closer to their beneficiaries
                          and may be tempted to choose more expensive packages (“golden handshakes”), rather than
                          allowing aged-based retirement to deliver results more cheaply.

‘Revolving door’          Despite a detailed and inflexible regulatory framework for determining organizational
problems can be           structures and for workforce planning, Indonesia’s civil service lacks effective controls to

incentives for reduced    Government is giving increasing attention to the effectiveness of its operations and whether
headcounts                these are being conducted at least cost. The focus of spending reviews will vary but they
                          may examine whether line ministries have the right number and mix of staff to perform their
                          operations - with right-sizing a possible option. Unless there are rigorous headcount
                          controls – ideally with a position-based personnel management system which integrates
                          structural considerations, special functions and staff – it is highly likely that the “revolving
                          door” will undermine severance efforts..

Internationally, the      Internationally, the trend is towards more open, merit-based appointment and promotion
trend is towards more     systems, but this is still subject to significant limitations in Indonesia. Agencies have a high
open, merit-based         degree of delegated authority to fill posts using their own staff. This is subject to restrictions,
appointment and           however, which limit certain positions to certain ranks,26 potentially preventing the best
promotion systems         person from being hired for the job.27 In fact, the civil service operates as a closed system,
                          with external recruitment permitted only at entry levels. While lateral entry from outside the
                          civil service to the higher grades is not permitted (Civil Service Law No. 43/1999 article 12),
                          transfers between agencies are possible, though the system for doing so is opaque. As a
                          result, there is no internal market for recruitment and transfers within the civil service. Such
                          a market would enable appropriately qualified and skilled civil servants to respond to the
                          incentives created by the differential performance allowances now in place, or being put in
                          place, across government agencies.

                                summarized in Table 10, along with high-level suggestions for reforms. Continued progress
                                in this area will depend, in part, on the provisions of the new civil service law, which is

INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Continuing adjustment

October 2013
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a longer-
          term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over the period,
          the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social welfare. Second, the
          IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and policy issues, and analysis
          of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is intended for a wide audience,
          including policymakers, business leaders, financial market participants, and the community of
          analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office. The report is compiled by the Macro
          and Fiscal Policy Cluster, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM) Network,
          under the guidance of Jim Brumby, Sector Manager and Lead Economist, Ndiame Diop, Lead
          Economist and Economic Advisor, and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. The core project team,
          with responsibility for Part A (economic update), editing and production, comprises Arsianti,
          Magda Adriani, Brendan Coates, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Shakira Jones, Alex Sienaert, Violeta
          Vulovic and Michele Savini Zangrandi. Administrative support is provided by Titi Ananto and
          Sylvia Njotomihardjo. Dissemination is organized by Farhana Asnap, Indra Irnawan, Jerry
          Kurniawan, Nugroho, Randy Salim and Marcellinus Winata, under the guidance of Dini Sari
          Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Alex Sienaert (Section B.1 on policy
          package), Natalia Cubillos Salcedo and Henry Sandee (Section B.2 on container dwell times at
          Tanjung Priok), Ahya Ihsan and Bill Wallace (Director, AIPEG) (Section C.1 on infrastructure
          investment), and Samer Al-Samarrai (Section C.2. on local governance and education
          performance). Key input and comments were also received from Djauhari Sitorus, Pamitra
          Wineka and The Fei Ming (banking sector, credit and corporate sector update), Ririn Purnamasari
          and Matthew Wai-Poi (BLSM and poverty update), Rubino Sugana (public revenues), Mark
          Ahern, Enda Ginting and Hari Purnomo (budget execution), and Yue Man Lee, Mattia Makovec,
          Arvind Nair, Sjamsu Rahardja, Connor Spreng and Della Temenggung (policy package), Wahyoe
          Soerdarmono, Paul Lemaistre and Jon Sariatmadja (infrastructure investment). The team also
          benefited from discussions and comments from Deepak Mishra, David Hawes and Roland Rajah
          (AusAID), and Bill Wallace (AIPEG).

 Executive summary: Continuing adjustment




Indonesia is              Indonesia’s economic growth is slowing, weighed down by the cumulative impact of the
undergoing significant    weakening in key commodity prices which has been underway since 2011 and by tightening
economic adjustments      domestic and international financing conditions, and challenged by aspects of the policy
precipitated by a         environment. At the same time, external financing needs have increased, in part due to the
weakening in its          widening current account deficit. The pace of adjustment to these developments has
external balances…        intensified in recent months. Along with other major emerging market economies (EMEs),
                          Indonesian financial markets have experienced considerable turbulence, with the Rupiah
                          depreciating significantly against the US dollar. Policy settings are also responding, with
                          monetary policy, for example, being tightened.

…bringing slower          Reflecting these developments, the World Bank’s projection for 2014 growth has been
growth and increasing     lowered to 5.3 percent – still relatively resilient, but a notable downgrade on the near-term
the focus on policies     economic outlook. The current phase of economic adjustment also brings with it risks of a
                          more material, and longer-lasting, down-shift in growth, in the absence of the support
                          provided by cheap international financing costs and strong commodity demand. This places
                          a premium on continued macroeconomic policy adjustment, enhancing ongoing efforts to
                          lift competitiveness and the sustainable growth rate of the economy, and on protecting the
                          vulnerable from the impact of moderating growth and future economic shocks.

International financial   Recent months have seen marked international financial market turbulence, triggered by the

been at the fore,         debt and equity financing costs for EMEs, including Indonesia, have responded abruptly to

…but key commodity        In part reflecting the moderation in China’s growth and investment outlook, international
prices have remained      commodity prices have generally remained under downward pressure, the key exception for
under pressure, with      Indonesia being global fuel prices. The export-weighted US Dollar price index of Indonesia’s
the exception of oil…     top six commodity exports (accounting for just under half of total exports) fell by 8 percent
                          in 2013 through the end of August, to be 35 percent lower than its post-2008/09 peak in
                          January 2011. The price of Brent crude oil, in contrast, rose 7 percent from January 2011 to
                          August 2013, and is broadly flat year-to-date. This divergence between global energy prices
                          and non-energy prices has been an important driver of the weakening in Indonesia’s balance
                          of trade since 2011, and places additional pressures on the Government’s fiscal position.

…presenting a             Global economic growth is set to continue improving, with Indonesia’s major trading
challenging picture for   partners projected to grow by 3.4 percent over 2013, the same rate for the year as a whole as
Indonesia’s external      in 2012 but reflecting a pick-up in the second half of 2013, and moving up to 3.9 percent in
balances                  2014. However, in the baseline commodity prices are not projected to turn significantly
                          more supportive for Indonesia’s terms of trade. Furthermore, as global financial markets
                          continue to adjust to the implications of reduced monetary accommodation in high income
                          economies, the volatility of capital flows, and external financing costs, appear set to remain
                          elevated, for Indonesia as for other EMEs. Indonesia’s economic and policy adjustment to
                          weaker external balances, now well underway, is therefore likely to remain center-stage.

Growth slowed in the      A moderation in demand has an important role to play in moving the current account, and
second quarter, but       hence overall external financing needs, into alignment with the tighter external financing
despite this an           conditions. Indonesia’s economy has indeed slowed over 2013 so far, with investment
unexpectedly wide         growth being the major drag. Growth in the second quarter was 5.8 percent, dipping under
current account deficit   6.0 percent for the first time since 2010. Despite the incipient weakening in domestic
was recorded              demand, seasonal factors, coupled with the sustained weakness in export revenues,
                          contributed to an unexpectedly large widening of Indonesia’s quarterly current account
                          deficit to 4.4 percent of GDP. The release of these data, and the reactions of investors
                          already rebalancing their portfolios in favor of high income economy assets, placed
                          considerable pressure on the Rupiah in late August. These pressures contributed to Bank
                          Indonesia’s decision to lift interest rates further, taking the cumulative increase in key
                          interest rates since June to 150 basis points, and to introduce additional macro-prudential
                          measures to dampen credit growth and new policies to support foreign exchange liquidity,
                          which had tightened.

GDP growth is             In light of recent events, a more pronounced moderation in Indonesia’s economic growth to
projected to slow and     5.3 percent in 2014, from 5.6 percent in 2013, is now projected than was previously expected
the current account       (Table 1). This compares with the July 2013 IEQ projections of a dip to 5.9 percent for 2013
deficit to narrow         and then return to 6.2 percent in 2014. The current account deficit is projected to remain
modestly through          sizeable, though with a narrowing bias, to come in at 2.6 percent of GDP in 2014. Having
2014…                     been pushed higher temporarily by the June increase in subsidized fuel prices, inflation is
                          expected to peak in year-on-year terms in the fourth quarter and, absent significant cost-
                          push shocks, to moderate to an annual average of 6.7 percent in 2014.

                            currency, volatility seen since May. External risks to the outlook center on the trajectory of
                            non-oil commodity prices, international fuel costs, and external financing conditions. Much
                            also depends on the performance of China’s economy, and investment demand, and the
                            quality of the policy responses in both high income and developing economies as global
                            liquidity becomes less abundant. Should these factors play out favorably, there is also a
                            chance that the global recovery through 2014 proves stronger than expected in the base case,
                            lifting Indonesia’s growth prospects and providing some relief for its external position, so
                            long as it can capitalize on the opportunities generated by stronger global trade and
                            investment dynamics.

…placing a premium          Indonesia’s fiscal and monetary policy settings will continue to play a key role in facilitating
on continued                the adjustments now taking place and in minimizing associated risks. There are, however,
macroeconomic policy        trade-offs between the objectives of restraining inflation, supporting growth and adjusting
flexibility to facilitate   the current account deficit to the tighter financing environment. Monetary policy faces the
near-term                   challenge of calibrating interest and exchange rates so as to guard against rising inflationary
adjustment…                 pressures as cost pressures rise (such as from the pass-through of the weaker currency or
                            wage increases) while facilitating improvements in the external balances, and without unduly
                            crimping economic growth and weakening public and private sector balance sheets. With the
                            2014 Budget under discussion with Parliament, fiscal policy faces the challenge of slower
                            revenue growth, and higher energy subsidy and nominal debt-financing costs, raising the
                            importance of lifting further the quality of spending and of revenue mobilization.
                            Maintaining a prudent overall fiscal stance, coordinated with the tightening in monetary
                            policy, can help to meet this challenge. Building on the important June increase in subsidized
                            fuel prices, further reforms to the current system of inefficient and distortionary energy
                            subsidies could play an important role in freeing up spending for key development
                            expenditures such as infrastructure and health, as well as in limiting the sizeable fiscal risks
                            they generate to fluctuations in the exchange rate or shocks to global oil prices.

…reducing                   Given the uncertainties generated by moderating growth momentum, and volatile but
uncertainties through       generally tightening external financing conditions, maintaining strong communication
communication and           around policy changes and a strong focus on implementation can help to support
contingency                 confidence. Policy also has a role to play in mitigating the negative impacts of particularly
planning…                   adverse scenarios, should tail risks materialize. The Government has put considerable efforts
                            into enhancing its crisis preparedness in recent years. Monitoring and response coordination
                            mechanisms are in place to facilitate a flexible response to any major market dislocations.
                            The Government now has contingent fiscal financing equivalent to approximately USD 5
                            billion to draw on in the event of a significant deterioration in financing conditions, while
                            Bank Indonesia has recently made efforts to secure additional bilateral US Dollar swap lines.

…and continuing to          The recent pressures on the external balances and growth serve as a reminder of the need
drive progress on           for further efforts to improve the diversification of Indonesia’s exports and to lift the
reforms to lift             competitiveness of the economy in order to sustain a more rapid pace of growth and
Indonesia’s sustainable     development. The depreciation of the Rupiah to date should provide a short-term boost to
growth rate                 competitiveness, but this will only prove lasting if not eroded by domestic cost pressures,
                            such as from wage increases, and if policies and investments are put in place to enhance the
                            flexibility of the supply-side of the economy. Measures to increase competitiveness and
                            improve the regulatory environment can thus assist not only to alleviate near-term external
                            funding pressures by stimulating exports and encouraging foreign direct investment, but also
                            help to lift longer-term employment and economic growth.

The Government’s            In response to the intensification of financial market pressures, and in conjunction with the
policy package              monetary policy and currency market measures mentioned above, on August 23 the

                           increase, there is also the opportunity for reforms to be strengthened in the near-term, given
                           the potential costs and consequences of not doing so in the current economic environment.

In the near-term,          Efforts to improve Indonesia’s international connectivity have a crucial role to play in
improving                  increasing the country’s export competitiveness and encouraging investment. One of the key
international              practical challenges for improving Indonesia’s international connectivity is reducing dwell
connectivity, such as      times at Indonesia’s most important port, Tanjung Priok (handling over two-thirds of

The level and quality of   As well-recognized by the Government, improvements in Indonesia’s physical infrastructure
infrastructure spending    can also unlock another well-known constraint on Indonesia’s competitiveness and
remains a key              sustainable growth rate. Better infrastructure can also enhance other development outcomes,
determinant of long-       such as in health and education, by improving accessibility. Recent evidence compiled by the
term trade and growth      World Bank suggests that there have been insufficient additions to Indonesia’s infrastructure
performance                capital stock since the Asian financial crisis, causing it to fall relative to both the total capital
                           stock and to the size of the economy. Over the 2001-2011 period, initial simulations suggest
                           that moving the annual growth in the infrastructure capital stock up to 5 percent, against the
                           actual estimated rate of 3 percent, could have lifted average annual GDP growth to 5.8
                           percent, 0.5 percent above the actual average, resulting in a 5 percent higher level of GDP in
                           2011. While results such as these are sensitive to assumptions, they do point to the need to
                           improve both the quantity and quality of public investment, while also providing a strong
                           enabling environment for private sector infrastructure investments. Continuing to increase
                           the budget allocation for infrastructure plays a role, but fiscal sustainability and competing
                           demands for public funds also argue for a strong focus on efficiency, including ensuring the
                           smooth operation and maintenance of existing infrastructure, and further efforts to improve
                           the quality of public investment management. Improved data availability and quality in this
                           area to inform policy is also needed.

Education                  Also vital for growth, as well as being a key development goal in its own right, is Indonesia’s
performance is also        human capital – the knowledge and skills of its people. In the last fifteen years, Indonesia
critical for               has introduced a comprehensive package of education reforms designed to expand access
development, requiring     and improve quality. A key component of the reform process has been the devolution of
more improvements in       responsibility for basic education services to local governments and schools, and
local governance           improvements in local governance can thus play a vital role in raising the quality of basic
                           education and ensuring children leave school with adequate skills. Indeed, the Indonesian
                           Local Education Governance (ILEG) surveys, conducted in 2009 and 2012, suggest that the
                           quality of local governance is important for improving district education performance,
                           making it important to continue to address key governance constraints, and to better
                           coordinate and integrate central government financing in local education planning.

 A. Economic and fiscal update




                 1. International market volatility as external financing costs have risen
International financial   The external picture for Indonesia, and other emerging market economies (EMEs), has been
market volatility has     dominated by international financial market volatility, and a rise in external financing costs,
been at the fore…         triggered by the prospect of the gradual normalization of monetary policy in the US.
                          Between early May (as speculation mounted that a reduction in the US Federal Reserve’s
                          bond purchases would be announced) and early September (when market expectations that
                          the Federal Reserve would begin to “taper” its purchases later in the month peaked), the
                          benchmark 10-year US Treasury bond yield rose by 135 basis points, to just under 3 percent,
                          its highest level since May 2011. In response, debt and equity financing costs for EMEs,
                          including Indonesia, moved up abruptly (Figure 1), and investment outflows were seen.

…although economic        Market developments have also reflected a continued strengthening of growth in high
conditions in high        income economies. The Euro Area emerged from its long recession in the second quarter,
income economies are      and the economies of both Japan and the US expanded at a solid pace. Third quarter data
improving…                suggest that this has continued, and the pick-up is expected to be sustained, as high income
                          economies continue to recover from the 2008/09 global financial crisis and its aftermath.
                          This ongoing recovery can support Indonesia’s exports, both directly (as close to a third of
                          exports are sold to the Euro Area, Japan and the US) and indirectly, through its spillover
                          into global demand and Indonesian export prices. However, the outlook for Indonesia’s
                          other trading partners is more mixed.

…adding to a mixed        Currency and stock market sell-offs were most pronounced for those EMEs with significant
picture for major         current account financing requirements, notably Brazil, Turkey, South Africa, India and
developing                Indonesia. Part of the selling pressure in emerging markets experienced through early
economies…                September, however, can be attributed to the pricing in of a smaller growth differential
                          between emerging and high income economies, reflecting slower growth in the former and,
                          as discussed, faster growth in the latter. This, coupled with the expectation of less abundant
                          global liquidity, presents a challenging combination for many EMEs, and the outlook for
                          Indonesia’s major developing country trading partners is indeed mixed. China (the

                            commodity prices) appears on track to meet its official target of 7.5 percent growth in 2013,
                            down just slightly from 7.8 percent in 2012, while in contrast growth has declined
                            significantly in India (which accounts for approximately 7 percent of total exports and is a
                            major market for selected export products such as coal and palm oil).

…while non-energy           International commodity prices have generally weakened further in recent months,
commodity prices have       influenced by the strengthening in the US Dollar, the key exception being global fuel prices
continued to weaken         (which were affected by concerns over the conflict in Syria). The export-weighted US Dollar
                            price index of Indonesia’s top six commodity exports (accounting for just under half of total
                            exports) fell by 8 percent in 2013 through the end of August, to be 35 percent lower than its
                            post-2008/09 peak in January 2011 (Figure 2). The price of Brent crude oil, in contrast, rose
                            7 percent from January 2011 to August 2013, and is broadly flat year-to-date. The divergent
                            trend between global energy and non-energy prices since 2011 is in stark contrast to their
                            more typical close correlation, and is a key aspect of the significant deterioration in
                            Indonesia’s trade balance since 2011 (see Section 3), and adds to fiscal pressures given
                            energy subsidy spending.

The global growth           The World Bank continues to expect a gradually improving global economic backdrop for
backdrop is expected        Indonesia, whose major trading partners are expected to grow by 3.4 percent in 2013,
to continue improving,      picking up to 3.9 percent in 2014, supporting demand for Indonesia’s exports. However,
but the risks remain        persistent, and often interrelated, risks to the international economic outlook remain, both
high amidst financial       on the upside and downside. Much depends on the continued positive trajectory of high

                            appears set to remain elevated, for Indonesia as for other EMEs.

                 2. Indonesia’s economy is expected to continue decelerating into 2014
Economic growth has     As experienced by many other major EMEs, Indonesia’s economy has slowed over 2013,
moderated so far in     weighed down by weaker investment momentum. Growth in the second quarter moderated
2013 and this is        to 5.8 percent, below 6.0 percent for the first time since 2010. The World Bank has lowered
expected to continue    its projection for GDP growth in 2013 to 5.6 percent, down from the 5.9 percent projection
                        in the July 2013 IEQ, and has also lowered the projection for growth in 2014 to 5.3 percent
                        from 6.2 percent previously. The sizeable downgrade for 2014 reflects a more subdued
                        outlook for domestic demand, as the economy adjusts to tighter financing conditions and
                        lower commodity prices. While export prices, particularly for commodities, are expected to
                        be weak, export volumes are expected to continue to stage a mild recovery as growth in
                        advanced economies recovers. Import growth will likely remain relatively subdued,
                        consistent with the outlook for domestic demand and the (lagged) effects of the Rupiah
                        depreciation. Consequently, unlike in 2012, when net exports were a drag on growth, it is
                        expected that net exports will add to growth over 2013 and 2014.

Domestic demand         Indonesia’s real GDP growth slowed in the second quarter of 2013, to 5.8 percent year-on-
eased slightly in Q2…   year (yoy) versus 6.0 percent in the first quarter. Quarter-on-quarter growth in seasonally
                        adjusted terms of 1.4 percent was marginally higher than the first quarter result of 1.3
                        percent. On the expenditure side, a continued easing in investment growth was the key
                        driver behind the yoy moderation, though there was also some contribution from
                        consumption, with overall domestic demand growth slowing to 4.7 percent yoy, from 5.0
                        percent yoy in Q1. Partially offsetting the moderation in domestic demand has been net
                        exports, which added to growth in the first half of 2013, as growth in export volumes has
                        continued to improve, outpacing that of imports.

                        GDP growth will likely remain subdued in the near-term. The negative terms of trade shock,

significant fall in            quarterly growth rate (to 2.4 percent qoq-sa), though it is difficult to draw conclusions from
commodity-related              quarterly movements in investment due to its lumpy nature. To date most of the weakness in
activity                       investment growth has been due to investment in machinery and equipment and
                               transportation (Figure 4), as reflected in drops in capital goods imports. This has coincided
                               with a significant fall in commodity-related activity, particularly in nominal terms, putting
                               downward pressure on export earnings and profitability, which has fed through into lower
                               investment and production. In contrast, the growth in real building investment (85 percent
                               of total investment) has remained solid but could come under additional pressure going
                               forward.

…and investment is             The outlook for investment has weakened since the July IEQ. The cost of a number of key
expected to weaken             inputs has increased significantly. The depreciation of the Rupiah has led to higher imported

conditions expected to         corporates, the scope for internal financing through retained earnings has been affected by

investment                     expected to dampen credit and investment, putting pressure on investment, including
                               building-related investment (Figure 5). With historical experience suggesting that higher
                               interest rates impact economic activity with a lag of a couple of quarters, the negative impact
                               on activity, particularly investment, will mostly occur towards the end of 2013 and into 2014.
                               Given the significant risks to investment, such as a further tightening in financing conditions
                               but also regulatory changes or uncertainties, particularly as the political cycle intensifies
                               ahead of national elections, Box 3 highlights the marked sensitivity of the outlook for GDP
                               growth in 2014 to the trajectory of investment.

confidence has dipped          expected to adversely impact on consumer purchasing power. These developments have
                               been weighing on consumer confidence, with the BI consumer confidence index dropping
                               in July and August, retracing the gains it has made over the past 18 months. Higher interest

                               positive offset for consumption growth in late 2013 and into 2014 (Figure 6).

The oil and gas trade         Indonesia’s monthly oil and gas trade balance has been in deficit since August 2012, and
deficit remains a             continues to be a major drag on the overall trade balance. The oil and gas trade deficit stood
particular challenge          at USD 2.4 billion in Q2 (narrowing from USD 3.4 billion in Q1), and subsequently widened
                              sharply to USD 1.9 billion in July alone (affected by seasonal factors as in August it narrowed
                              to USD 0.9 billion). Domestic crude oil production continues to decline, with the crude oil
                              balance entering into deficit, while limited onshore oil refining capacity has seen the
                              processed oil trade deficit widen to USD 5.4 billion in Q2, albeit down from USD 6.2 billion
                              in Q1, according to BPS.

deficit…                       This places an increased reliance on financing from portfolio (USD 2.5 billion in Q2) and
                               “other” investment (USD 2.3 billion) inflows. The portfolio investment inflows included
                               USD 3.0 billion in global government bond issuance, offsetting significant net outflows from
                               Indonesian domestic bonds and equities. The surplus in “Other” investment in Q2
                               represented a swing from a deficit of USD 7 billion in Q1, as a result of strong recorded
                               deposit and currency inflows (USD 4.6 billion), partly reflecting seasonally strong foreign
                               currency demand from bank customers to service external debts and repatriate profits,
                               prompting banks to repatriate deposits onshore.

remain broadly stable          Q1, on account of stronger outbound direct investment. Inbound direct investment inflows,
                               as measured in the balance of payments, remained relatively stable at USD 4.2 billion (up
                               slightly from USD 4.1 billion in Q1), but down on the average of just under USD 5 billion
                               seen over 2011 and 2012, during which inflows moved up rapidly. Despite the growing
                               sectoral diversification of inbound FDI, with manufacturing accounting for almost half of
                               total FDI inflows in Q2, overall inbound FDI flows remain closely correlated with
                               movements in global commodity prices, likely reflecting the channeling of commodity-
                               related revenues into investments in other economic sectors in Indonesia (Figure 14). As a
                               result, weaker global commodity prices, along with policy and political uncertainty in the
                               run-up to the 2014 elections, pose risks to the outlook for FDI inflows.

                          the Rupiah – down 20 percent so far this year – will also provide some support to the trade
                          balance by increasing Indonesia’s external competitiveness (though in trade-weighted terms
                          the depreciation has been more modest, as shown in Section 4, below). Finally, export
                          revenues are projected to pick up on the back of strengthening major trading partner
                          growth, together with a stabilization of commodity export prices into 2014.

conditions have           (Figure 16). Tighter external financing conditions and Rupiah depreciation make for a more
tightened                 costly and challenging environment for refinancing existing external debt, over half of which
                          (or 15 percent of GDP) now consists of private external debt. This is particularly the case for
                          corporates without access to natural currency hedges (through US Dollar revenues) and
                          those heavily exposed to the recent weakening in global commodity prices. Official reserves
                          remain more than sufficient to cover Indonesia’s short-term external financing needs,
                          although the ratio of short-term external debt to official reserves has risen to around 50
                          percent, from 40 percent at end-2011. However, more importantly, external liquidity risks
                          have risen, with the debt service ratio rising to 80 percent in June 2013, from around 30
                          percent in mid-2011. Bank Indonesia projects that repayments of external debt excluding
                          trade finance, revolving loans and currency and deposits will total USD 32.6 billion over
                          August to December 2013, of which USD 28.8 billion is private debt, with a further USD
                          33.4 billion in gross repayments expected in January-July 2014.1

The CAD is projected      Overall, the World Bank projects a current account deficit of USD 29 billion in 2013, or 3.4
to be 3.4 percent in      percent of GDP, wider than the deficit of 2.8 percent of GDP in 2012. In 2014, the current
2013 and 2.6 percent in   account deficit is expected to narrow to 2.6 percent of GDP, as the anticipated slowdown in
2014…                     economic activity into 2014 dampens import demand, while recent Rupiah depreciation and
                          a pick-up in growth among Indonesia’s major trading partners provide some support to
                          exports.

…assuming that a               As always, current account balance projections are sensitive to the trajectory of domestic
significant external           demand and of non-oil commodity prices (for exports) and international fuel costs (for
financing difficulty can       imports). At the present time of heightened concern over the external financing
be avoided…                    requirements of major EMEs, including Indonesia, however, an additional assumption
                               underpinning the above baseline projection is that the adjustment process to tighter external
                               financing conditions remains orderly. This assumption depends crucially upon the path of
                               domestic and international policies and their interrelationship with investor confidence.
                               Some policy changes to support foreign investment and trade competitiveness can be put in
                               place in the short term (see Sections B.1 and B.2). However, other improvements in
                               competitiveness are likely to take longer, including addressing the costs and bottlenecks
                               caused by Indonesia’s infrastructure gap (see Section C.1). In the near-term, therefore, much
                               focus will remain on the adjustment of import demand, both through expenditure switching
                               (as Rupiah depreciation lifts import prices) and compression (as monetary and credit
                               conditions tighten and more expensive imports discourage discretionary expenditure on
                               goods with few or imperfect domestic substitutes in the short-run). Moderating domestic
                               demand can play a role in easing balance of payments pressures, making policy coordination
                               and communication paramount, particularly against the backdrop of an intensifying political
                               cycle, as discussed further in Section 7, below.

                                 Indonesian equities fell by 8.6 percent over 19-20 August alone. After subsequent

                                 quarter. Meanwhile the five-year Rupiah-denominated government bond yield increased by
                                 180 basis points from the start of the quarter to reach 8.24 percent on September 11, before
                                 retracing 40 basis points to end the quarter at 7.85 percent. Looking through the volatility in
                                 financial asset prices, the most pronounced trends in the financial sector have been the
                                 depreciation in the Rupiah and the tightening in domestic and external financing conditions.

significantly, through     Pre-empting the increase in subsidized fuel prices, and with pressure on the Rupiah
rate increases…            intensifying since May, BI surprised markets on June 11 by increasing its overnight deposit
                           facility (FASBI) rate by 25 basis points, followed by a 25 basis point increase in its reference
                           rate at its subsequent June policy meeting. This was followed by a 50 basis point increase in
                           these key policy rates in July. Policy rates were left unchanged at the scheduled Board of
                           Governors meeting in August, though some new macro-prudential measures were
                           announced. Following the release of weak second quarter balance of payments statistics and
                           intensifying pressure on the Rupiah, the FASBI and reference rates were lifted by a further
                           50 basis points at an extraordinary policy meeting held on August 29 (in addition, the upper
                           bound of the interest rate corridor, the BI lending facility rate, was also increased by 25 basis
                           points). This was followed by a further 25 basis point increase in the FASBI, reference and
                           lending facility rates at the scheduled meeting on September 12. Thus, since June, BI has
                           raised its overnight deposit facility and reference rates by 150 basis points (to 5.5 and 7.25
                           percent, respectively), and its key lending rate by 50 basis points (to 7.25 percent).

…and macro-                A number of macro-prudential measures with a tightening bias have also been taken, with
prudential measures        the upper band of the loan-to-deposit ratio target having been lowered from 100 to 92
                           percent alongside more stringent loan-to-valuation ratios for residential mortgages, while the
                           secondary reserve requirement ratio is set to be raised to 4 percent (from 2.5 percent) by
                           December. BI has also taken a number of steps to facilitate liquidity management: allowing
                           both government bonds and BI certificates of deposit to be counted against banks’
                           secondary reserve requirements, and introducing shorter tenor BI deposit securities.

                           percent to July, up from 23 percent in May. Working capital loan growth has come down to
                           19 percent yoy in July, from around 24 percent yoy in early 2013, and consumption lending
                           growth has been stable at around 20 percent yoy. Aggregate banking sector indicators remain
                           stable, with non-performing loans remaining below 2 per cent, while Indonesian bank
                           profitability has remained high. However, despite this performance to date, the banking
                           sector could still face pressures on margins and credit quality from further decelerating
                           growth or additional financial market volatility in upcoming months.

                           of the macro-prudential measures mentioned above, BI reduced the upper bound of its
                           target for a bank’s loan-to-deposit ratio from 100 to 92 percent, and increased the secondary
                           minimum reserve requirement for rupiah deposits to 4 percent, from 2.5 percent. 2
                           Aggregate deposit growth slowed to 14 percent to July, in line with further weakening in
                           nominal GDP growth to 7.8 percent in the year to June, resulting in a rise in the overall bank
                           loan-to-deposit ratio to 88.7 percent in July, up from 83.6 percent at end-2012 (Figure 20).

Residential property      Indonesian nationwide residential property price growth eased slightly in Q2, to 10.7 percent
price growth stabilized   yoy in June, down from a record pace of 11.2 percent yoy in March. Smaller homes (with
in Q2 but remains         floorspace of less than 36 square meters) continue to exhibit the strongest price growth, up
elevated in some          16 percent yoy to June, and remain exempt from BI’s more stringent loan-to-value
market segments           requirements for residential mortgages for first home buyers. Commercial property also
                          showed continued robust price growth, growth rates in the selling prices of residential
                          apartments and industrial land, and of office space rentals, all remained above 25 percent on

                          property sector activity and price growth may well be impacted by tighter financing

                     5. Inflation has picked up on higher fuel prices
Headline yoy inflation         Inflation dynamics over the third quarter were dominated by the effect of fuel subsidy
increased to 8 percent at      reform and the seasonal impact of Ramadan. The Government’s move to increase the
the beginning of the third     subsidized diesel price by IDR 1,000 per liter and the petrol price by IDR 2,000 per liter on
quarter on the back of         22 June has led to a sharp rise in headline inflation, pushing up year-on-year inflation for the
increased fuel and food        next four quarters. Month-on-month inflation, however, is expected to stabilize relatively
prices                         quickly, in line with past episodes of fuel price reform, with Bank Indonesia’s recent rate
                               hikes and the ongoing tightening of credit conditions helping to dampen the feed-through
                               into second-round effects and inflationary expectations. The combination of the residual
                               effects of trade restrictions introduced in October 2012 and the rise in demand over
                               Ramadan period caused food price inflation to pick up, with chili, onion and garlic being
                               particularly impacted. Trade restrictions have been at least partially unwound, and food
                               prices now appear to be on a downward trend.

Higher subsidized fuel         Increased fuel prices likely contributed just over half of the 3.3 percent month-on-month
prices are estimated to        rise in headline CPI in July (Figure 22). As a result, headline inflation has moved to 8.6
have contributed close to      percent yoy in July, from 5.9 percent in June, and edged up further to 8.8 percent in August,
half of mom inflation in       before declining somewhat to 8.4 percent in September (Figure 23). Core consumer prices
July…                          have picked up slightly, to 4.5 percent yoy in August, and to 4.7 percent in September.
                               During previous fuel price increases in October 2005 and June 2008, core consumer price
                               increases quickly reverted to their levels prior to the reforms (Figure 24). Changes in core
                               inflation, however, have to be monitored on a longer term horizon, as higher fuel prices may
                               feed with a lag into higher input costs. The fact that subsidized fuel prices remain well below
                               international prices also means that higher prices are currently being artificially suppressed
                               by the subsidy regime.

… and food prices an           Along with fuel, prices of selected food items also spiked in the second quarter of 2013,
additional one-third           following the introduction of the Food Law, which was passed in October 2012 (Figure 25).
                               A number of trade restrictions linked to the Food Law have now been reversed, including
                               beef quotas now being replaced by a switching tariff depending on domestic prices, setting
                               prices on a downward path. The Ramadan period in July-August, however, also had the
                               usual, upward impact on prices. Increased food prices – with some items up two- to five-
                               fold from their levels in October 2012 – contributed 1.1 percentage points to month-on-
                               month (mom) inflation in July. Prices for these food items appear now to be on a downward
                               path, indicating welcome relief from inflationary pressures from this source.

Further inflationary           The recent depreciation of the Rupiah poses risks to inflation in the short run, by driving up
pressures could come           the cost of imports. Depreciation in the second quarter likely contributed up to 0.5
from the second round          percentage points to headline CPI. In principle, the effect of the currency depreciation on
effects of the fuel price      inflation is likely to be non-linear, increasing in the short run as increased import prices feed
increase, the recent
weakening of the Rupiah,
                               into the CPI basket, and decreasing thereafter as the price shock drops out of the base. In
and minimum wage rises         light of this, further inflationary pressures are to be expected from the recent depreciation,
for 2014 …                     and the movement of the exchange rate is one of the main risks to the baseline inflation
                               outlook. Additional supply-side risks to inflation are also to the upside, notably from
                               potential further increases in minimum wages for 2014 (following the large increases granted
                               for 2013), and the possibility of second- and third round effects from the reduction in the
                               fuel subsidy.

                 6. The fiscal risks from energy subsidy costs are to the fore again
The fiscal deficit        The ongoing slowdown in nominal GDP growth, subdued international commodity prices,
through August was        and nominal depreciation of the Rupiah, are impacting Indonesia’s fiscal sector. During the
notably higher than in    January-August 2013 period, an overall deficit of IDR 101 trillion was recorded, versus a
the same period in        deficit of IDR 35 trillion in the same period last year (Table 4). Revenue collection growth
2012…                     has slowed, recording the lowest yoy growth since 2009. Realized expenditure growth has
                          also come down, but overall disbursement rates have shown some improvement.

…due to a broad-based The first eight months of 2013 saw a broad-based moderation in yoy growth of revenue
reduction in revenue  collection, which reached 56 percent of its 2013 target in January-August. In particular, non-
collection…           oil and gas income taxes, which represent the bulk of income taxes (around 86 percent) and
                      just under one-third of total revenues, recorded a noticeable slowdown in yoy growth (6
                      percent relative to a 14 percent average growth for the corresponding periods of 2010-2012).
                      Value-added tax (VAT) collections growth has also slowed (to 13 percent relative to a 22
                      percent average for the corresponding period of 2010-2012). International taxes, particularly
                      exports duties, actually contracted by 13 percent yoy, on the back of lower commodity prices
                      which also affected non-tax revenues, both from the oil and gas and other resource sectors.
                      Overall non-tax revenues in the first eight months of 2013 grew by only 3 percent yoy
                      compared to a 19 percent average for the corresponding periods of 2010-2012.

… whereas Budget          By the end of August, about IDR 946 trillion, or 55 percent of total annual budgeted
execution performance     expenditure in the revised 2013 Budget, had been spent, just above the corresponding level
has slightly              of 54 percent in 2012. Spending growth in the first eight months of 2013 reached 14 percent
improved…                 yoy, down from 23 percent in 2012. Energy subsidy spending accounted for just over 30
                          percent of spending excluding transfers, reaching 65 percent of the revised 2013 Budget
                          allocation. Capital spending appears to have gained some traction, growing by 18 percent
                          relative to the corresponding period last year. However, disbursements remain back-loaded,
                          with only 32 percent of allocated capital spending for the full year realized in the first eight
                          months, although this was an improvement on the equivalent level of 29 percent in 2012.

…though the bintang       As of end-June 2013, the Ministry of Finance reported that IDR 32 trillion of line ministries’
challenge remains…        budgets (5 percent of total) was still on hold (such that the budget warrants are allocated a
                          star or bintang), declining from the level at the end of April 2013 of IDR 87 trillion (or 15
                          percent of line ministries’ total budgets).6 These conditional approvals, which have tended to
                          significantly impede disbursements, are due to activities requiring Parliamentary approval,
                          incomplete supporting documents such as terms of reference (TORs), detailed costing, and
                          Spending Responsibility Letters.

…and some new             To address a number of impediments to budget execution the Government has recently
policies and              taken steps to improve the regulatory environment. In particular, a new Government
regulations have been     regulation (PP 45/2013) has been issued that eliminates the requirement to reappoint
introduced to address     spending unit (Satker) officials each year. This measure will allow the Satkers to function
budget execution          from the beginning of the fiscal year, thereby accelerating spending; introduces commitment
challenges                controls which, alongside other benefits, will help the Ministry of Finance to monitor the
                          amounts committed by line ministries and take early action where there are delays in
                          implementation; allows advance procurement before the start of the fiscal year, allowing
                          contracts to be signed earlier in the fiscal year; and provides a legal basis for the carryover of
                          the budget to the next year for national priority activities and multiyear contracts.

                          The Ministry of Finance (MoF) has also issued a new ministerial regulation (PMK 94/2013)
                          which includes measures to streamline budget execution. The regulation, which sets out how
                          the budget documents are prepared and reviewed, includes provisions to: eliminate the use
                          of budget blocks (bintang), with line ministries now being given responsibility for addressing

Box 1: An update on unconditional cash transfers and the poverty rate
 Following the increase in subsidized fuel prices on June 22, temporary unconditional cash transfers (Bantuan Langsung Sementara
 Masyarakat, BLSM) have been distributed to 15.5 million households by the state owned post office (PT POS) using Social Protection
 Cards (Kartu Perlindungan Social, KPS). As described in the July IEQ, the BLSM is one of the four compensation packages
 implemented by the Government to mitigate the impact of higher fuel prices to poor and vulnerable households. The other three
 programs include the expansion of conditional cash transfers (Program Keluarga Harapan, PKH) and scholarships (Bantuan untuk Siswa
 Miskin, BSM), and the temporary increase of rice for the poor (Beras Miskin, Raskin). According to PT POS, 94 percent of the IDR
 4.7 trillion allocation of the first phase has been disbursed. The undisbursed 6 percent is due mainly to difficulties in locating targeted
 beneficiaries. The second phase, which commenced on September 2 has reached 94 percent of the allocation (as of 1 October),
 indicating relatively smooth distribution. In order to correct any inaccuracies in the beneficiary lists, the Government has increased
 flexibility by allowing communities at the village level to verify and revise beneficiary lists through community meetings.

 Turning to the broader picture on poverty, on July 1, Statistics Indonesia (Badan Pusat Statistik, BPS) announced that the national
 poverty rate for March 2013 was 11.4 percent. This represents a 0.6 percentage point decline from the 12.0 percent level in March
 2012. The rural poverty rate (14.3 percent) remains nearly double that of urban poverty (8.4 percent), but continues to decrease
 faster, down from 15.1 percent and 8.8 percent the previous year, respectively. The national average poverty line was increased by
 9.2 percent from IDR 248,707 per person per month to IDR 271,626, driven by increases in both food and non-food prices, across
 both urban and rural areas. Regional variation in poverty is high, with poverty in Maluku and Papua, for example, double the
 national average, at 24.0 percent, while Kalimantan has the lowest poverty rate at 6.4 percent, or around half the national average.

 The 0.6 percentage point decline in the poverty rate this year was roughly the same as the 0.5 percentage drop experienced between
 2011 and 2012. This continues the trend of slowing poverty reduction in recent years, with the last two years seeing the smallest
 declines in percentage point terms in a decade, with the exception of the increase in 2006 accompanying the global food price shocks.
 As discussed in the March 2013 IEQ, slowing poverty reduction is not unexpected as poverty approaches 10 percent, since the
 remaining poor are increasingly further below the poverty line, and thus faster consumption growth is required to maintain the same
 pace of poverty reduction as measured by the official poverty rate. Ordinarily, this trend, along with the slower economic growth
 projected through 2014 and elevated inflation, would limit expectations of poverty reduction in 2014. However, the disbursement of
 BLSM in the second half of 2013 is likely to mitigate the upward pressure on the poverty rate. As a consequence, the likelihood of
 achieving the Government's RPJM target of reducing poverty to 8 to 10 percent in 2014 is unclear. However, the concurrent
 expansion of long-term safety net programs – in particular BSM and PKH – is an important strategy for increasing the speed of
 poverty reduction beyond 2014.

The World Bank                  Taking into account the outturn in January-August, the reduction in commodity prices,
projects that the               depreciation of the Rupiah, and weaker nominal GDP growth, the World Bank has revised
Budget deficit in 2013          up its projection of the Budget deficit for 2013, from IDR 189 trillion in the July IEQ (2.1
will be 2.5 percent of          percent of GDP) to IDR 226 trillion (2.5 percent of GDP) (Table 5). Projected revenues
GDP and 2.3 percent of          have been revised downwards by 1.0 percent, and projected total expenditures revised
GDP in 2014                     upwards by 1.4 percent (due mostly to higher projected energy subsidy spending, despite
                                June’s subsidized fuel price increases, see Box 2). For 2014, the World Bank’s preliminary
                                projection is for a Budget deficit of 2.3 percent of GDP, though much will clearly depend on
                                the final features of the approved 2014 Budget.

The 2014 Budget is              The proposed 2014 Budget is currently under discussion in Parliament and it is expected to
making its way                  be approved (with potential amendments) by the end of October. The projected Budget
through Parliament              deficit in the draft Budget was 1.5 percent of GDP, but the Finance Minister has recently
                                announced that the latest estimate for the 2014 deficit is 2.02 percent of GDP.7

                                In terms of some of the main expenditure categories, personnel expenditure is proposed to
                                increase by 19 percent relative to the 2013 revised Budget, reflecting on-going bureaucracy
                                reform, and increases in basic salary and pension payments by 6 percent and 4 percent,
                                respectively. The Government is implementing a flat budget policy for material expenditure,
                                particularly for expenses relating to operational, official travel, and meetings. Capital
                                expenditure is proposed to increase by 7 percent, implying only a modest increase in real
                                terms following several years of very strong real capital spending growth, albeit from a low

The depreciation of the         The depreciation of the Rupiah through September places upward pressure on a range of
Rupiah has placed               expenditures, particularly fuel subsidy spending (see Box 2). As a result of the weaker
renewed upward                  Rupiah, fuel subsidy spending for 2013 is likely to increase by IDR 21 trillion relative to the
pressure on subsidy             projection in the July IEQ. Hence, in the baseline scenario, the projected net saving for 2013
costs                           (including spending on BLSM and compensation programs) from the June 2013 increase in
                                subsidized fuel prices of IDR 13.1 trillion will not be realized, although the subsidy costs
                                would be even higher without this price adjustment. This development highlights the fiscal
                                risks from the current system of fixed subsidies, subjected to ad hoc periodic adjustments,
                                from movements in the exchange rate or oil price. It also stresses the urgency and
                                importance of pushing ahead with further reforms to energy subsidies, such as a move to a
                                more rule-based approach, to make sustained progress in raising the quality of public
                                spending.

Box 2: The fiscal impact of changes in the Rupiah exchange rate and oil prices
 Simulations can be used to examine the direct risks to the budget deficit from shifts in the exchange rate and international oil prices.
 For example, a 10 percent weaker Rupiah against the US dollar compared with the World Bank’s base case assumptions is estimated
 to lead directly to a roughly 0.7 percentage point of GDP increase in the fiscal deficit in both 2013 and 2014, to 3.2 percent and 3.0
 percent respectively. This clearly assumes that there are no adjustments in other spending levels in response, which would likely be
 the case given the 3 percent of GDP national deficit rule. A 10 percent increase in oil prices relative to the baseline is projected to
 add roughly 0.3-0.4 percentage points of GDP to the baseline fiscal deficit.

 The significant estimated sensitivity of the fiscal deficit to both the exchange rate and oil prices comes mainly from the expenditure
 side, due primarily to an increase in energy subsidy costs, in intergovernmental transfers to the regions from shared revenue from oil
 and gas, and an increase in spending on education (given the mandate that education spending be 20 percent of total spending).
 Although the impact on revenues is not as significant as for expenditures, projected nominal revenues are negatively impacted;
 changes in exchange rates have an effect on VAT and customs collection (both imports and exports duties), while changes in oil
 prices affect revenues through income taxes from oil and gas, VAT (through the sensitivity of imports to oil price changes, and
 though the increase in prices and resulting changes in private consumption), customs duties (both imports and exports duties), and
 non-tax revenues from natural resources.

 These simulation results should be treated as indicative only. In particular they focus on the first-round direct fiscal impacts and
 abstract from the indirect impacts through broader economic effects of the shocks. In addition, they require a number of
 assumptions (due to data and statistical limitations), and do not take into account the policy reaction function to such shocks, for
 example, in terms of cutting other spending or moving forward with other fiscal reforms.

                  7. Policy settings and ongoing reform progress can play a key role as
                     external balances adjust
External balance            In the base case, the pace of Indonesia’s economic growth is expected to moderate and then
developments pose the       stabilize at a level which is still solid but more commensurate with a more sustainable
greatest near-term risk     current account deficit under tighter global liquidity conditions. Economic developments
to growth…                  and policy settings, notably moderating domestic demand growth, the June increase in
                            subsidized fuel prices, the subsequent tightening in monetary policy, and the continued
                            depreciation of the Rupiah, are conducive to maintaining macroeconomic stability, a
                            prerequisite for growth and development. The key risk to this baseline scenario is that the
                            adjustments now underway, and projected in the base case to continue, are overtaken by a
                            significant increase in external financing strains, for example due to significant further
                            weakening in key export commodity prices or net inward investment dynamics. This would
                            require a more rapid adjustment via further significant depreciation in the Rupiah, placing
                            pressure on reserves, and requiring monetary policy tightening to stabilize Indonesia’s
                            external balances, denting confidence and further reducing growth (see Box 3 for a
                            discussion of growth sensitivities via investment impacts).

…placing a premium          Indonesia’s fiscal and monetary policy settings will continue to play a key role in facilitating
on continued                the adjustments now taking place and in minimizing associated risks. There are, however,
macroeconomic policy        trade-offs between the objectives of restraining inflation, supporting growth and adjusting
flexibility to facilitate   the current account deficit to the tighter financing environment. Monetary policy faces the
near-term                   challenge of calibrating interest and exchange rates so as to guard against rising inflationary
adjustment…                 pressures as cost pressures rise (such as from the pass-through of the weaker currency or
                            wage increases) while facilitating improvements in the external balances, and without unduly
                            crimping economic growth and weakening public and private sector balance sheets. With the
                            2014 Budget under discussion with Parliament, fiscal policy faces the challenge of slower
                            revenue growth and higher nominal debt-financing costs, raising the importance of lifting
                            further the quality of spending and of revenue mobilization. Maintaining a prudent overall
                            fiscal stance, coordinated with the tightening in monetary policy, can help to meet this
                            challenge. Building on the June increase in subsidized fuel prices, further reforms to the
                            current system of inefficient, distortionary energy subsidies could help to free up spending
                            for key development expenditures such as infrastructure and health, as well as limiting the
                            fiscal risks they generate to fluctuations in the exchange rate or shocks to global oil prices.

…reducing                   Given the uncertainties generated by moderating growth momentum, and volatile but
uncertainties through       generally tightening external financing conditions, maintaining clear communication around
communication and           policy changes and a strong focus on implementation can help to support confidence. Policy
contingency                 also has a role to play in mitigating the negative impacts of particularly adverse scenarios,
planning…                   should tail risks materialize. The Government has put considerable efforts into enhancing its
                            crisis preparedness in recent years. Monitoring and response coordination mechanisms are in
                            place to facilitate a flexible response to any major market dislocations. The Government has
                            contingent fiscal financing equivalent to approximately USD 5 billion to draw on in the
                            event of a significant deterioration in financing conditions, while Bank Indonesia has
                            recently made efforts to secure additional bilateral US Dollar swap lines.

…and continuing to          The recent pressures on the external balances and growth serve as a reminder of the need
drive progress on           for further efforts to improve the diversification of exports and to lift the competitiveness of
reforms to lift             the economy in order to sustain a more rapid pace of growth and development. The
Indonesia’s sustainable     depreciation of the Rupiah should boost competitiveness in the short-term, but this will only
growth rate                 prove lasting if not eroded by domestic cost pressures, such as from wage increases, and if
                            policies and investments are put in place to enhance supply-side flexibility. Measures to
                            increase competitiveness and improve the regulatory environment can thus assist not only to
                            alleviate near-term external funding pressures by stimulating exports and encouraging
                            foreign direct investment, but also help to lift longer-term employment and economic
                            growth. The Government’s policy package, announced on August 23 contains measures
                            which aim to address some of these issues; see Section B.1.

outlook. The World Bank base case for investment assumes
                                                                      7.0
that investment growth remains subdued over the rest of 2013
and into 2014. This projection is predicated on a moderation in
corporate profits and tighter financing conditions. Investment        6.5
may also face headwinds as the political cycle intensifies ahead
of national elections in 2014, and from ongoing regulatory and        6.0
policy uncertainties.                                                                                                      High

growth, with the IMF (2012) finding that a 1 percent higher             4.0
real interest rate leads to a 0.2 percent decline in investment
growth. However, this analysis also finds that it is actually the

further decline in Indonesia’s terms of trade, and possible
policy responses necessitated by adverse developments in the external balances, will also act both to reduce profitability and retained
earnings, and the cost and availability of investment financing.

The outlook for GDP growth in 2014 is sensitive to the trajectory of investment (Figure 27). A 1 percentage point deviation in
investment growth from the baseline forecast in 2014 would lead to around a 0.3 percentage point deviation in GDP growth in 2014,
taking annual growth up to approximately 5.6 percent (up from baseline growth of 5.3 percent), or down close to 5.0 per cent. Under
a more adverse scenario, where investment weakens as much as it did in the global financial crisis (around 2 percentage points lower
than the baseline), then GDP growth for 2014 would be around 0.6 percentage points lower, at around 4.7 percent (Figure 27).

B. Some recent developments in Indonesia’s economy




                1. The Government’s August policy package
Following market        As discussed in Part A, financial market pressures on Indonesia intensified in mid-August,
pressures, the          following the release of second quarter balance of payments statistics that showed a wider
Government              than expected current account deficit, against the backdrop of a reduction in investor
announced a policy      appetite for emerging market assets globally. In response to this, the Government of
package in August…      Indonesia announced a policy package (“the package”) on 23 August, in order to address
                        Indonesia’s external imbalances, by boosting exports and restraining imports, promoting
                        inbound investment to boost supply side capacity and raise productivity, while supporting
                        employment during a likely slowing in the pace of economic growth in the near-term. This
                        section provides a brief overview of the measures that have been announced. An outline of
                        the parallel policy responses announced by Bank Indonesia and OJK is provided in the Part
                        A discussion.

…aimed at               The policy package is focused on economic stabilization and structural reforms and has four
stabilization and       pillars. First, supporting foreign direct investment by removing impediments to progressing
structural reforms,     with key strategic investment projects (“de-bottlenecking”), simplifying licensing
organized around four   requirements, and expediting the revision of the negative investment list. Second, measures
pillars                 aimed at improving the current account balance, by providing tax breaks for export-oriented
                        firms, raising taxes on some luxury goods imports, and raising domestically produced
                        biodiesel requirements in the fuel mix (to help dampen fuel imports). Third, measures aimed
                        at maintaining employment growth, including tax breaks for labor-intensive sectors,
                        relaxation of some restrictions in bounded zones, and revisions to the minimum wage-
                        setting process. Fourth, measures to counter inflation, mainly by replacing import
                        restrictions with price-based mechanisms for beef and horticultural products.

                     a.   Measures to support foreign direct investment

A revised negative        Initial implementation of the investment-support measures has focused on an accelerated
investment list (DNI)     revision of the Revised Negative Investment List (Daftar Negatif Investasi, DNI), which
has been announced…       stipulates limits to foreign investment across Indonesia’s business sectors. Revisions to the
                          DNI have been discussed by the Executive and consultations with the private sector have
                          been underway since the earlier part of 2013.

…informed by a            The Government has announced that the revision of DNI will be based on a number of
number of guiding         guiding principles. First, the revised DNI should be “investor-friendly”, as far as allowed by
principles                existing laws, since these limit Presidential regulation prerogative. For example, the Law on
                          Horticulture limits foreign equity in horticulture businesses to 30 percent, a restriction which
                          will be incorporated in the forthcoming DNI. Second, changes to the DNI proposed by
                          Ministries which have the effect of increasing restrictions should not be accepted. Third,
                          industrial classifications are to be simplified, and the regulatory oversight of industries is to
                          be harmonized, such that duplication is avoided (for example, if a business sector is currently
                          regulated by two ministries, this should be reduced to just one ministry, with the least
                          restrictive of the overlapping regulations selected). The principles informing the revised DNI
                          suggest that a revised list would continue to incorporate the restrictions on foreign equity
                          investment which apply, through existing law, in the horticulture sector, but relax foreign
                          equity limits in a handful of other sectors, notably tourism, pharmacy, industry and
                          transport.

An “investor-friendly”    The new DNI has not yet been published and applied, and this delay is unfortunate, as it
revised DNI would         would bring with it more certainty around foreign participation limits across sectors. In
help to reduce            general, the emphasis under the guidelines for the accelerated revision is for a more open
regulatory uncertainty,   foreign investment framework. In principle, this would be positive for foreign investment.
even as considerable      In addition to the issuance and application of a revised DNI, there continues to be room for
challenges remain,        improvement in the overall regulatory environment for foreign investment. A clearer

Government’s broader      clarity and transparency of policy. In addition, ensuring that the DNI serves as the single
strategy…                 comprehensive list of investment restrictions would be desirable, as in the past the DNI has
                          been superseded by new restrictions on investment introduced in sectoral laws, such as in
                          horticulture and the postal law, adding complexity to the regulatory environment.

underway to simplify      di Bidang Penanaman Modal, PTSP), and reducing the types of licenses relating to investment
licensing…                activities. As a first step, the Government will focus on simplifying licenses in the
                          strategically important oil and gas sector, reducing the current sixty-nine types of licenses for
                          oil and gas investments to eight licensing groups. The Coordinating Ministry of Economic
                          Affairs and Presidential Working Unit for Supervision and Management of Development
                          (Unit Kerja Presiden Bidang Pengawasan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan,UKP4) are working on an
                          action plan to implement this reform within a year.

                          smaller investors than the oil and gas sector, who may find complex regulations more of an
                          impediment than the generally large-scale companies operating in the oil and gas industry.

                      b. Measures to improve the current account deficit and maintain Rupiah stability

Trade measures are         Downward pressure on the current account balance has stemmed from a combination of
focused on supporting      weakening export revenues and generally strong import demand, as discussed in Part A. The
exports…                   announced package seeks, first, to support exports (and employment as discussed below) by
                           providing tax deductions for labor-intensive sectors (textiles, footwear, furniture, children’s
                           toys and confectionary), and reducing corporate income taxes by 25-50 percent of total
                           income payable, depending on the degree of export-orientation. The tax break is temporary,
                           applying for the remainder of the tax year at the time of the implementing regulation (i.e.
                           from September-December 2013), and also allows for tax payments to be delayed without
                           penalty for up to three months. As is common with such incentives it can be difficult to
                           assess ex ante their impacts, and their application, and fiscal costs, should be as transparent as
                           possible. Second, the package aims to boost mineral exports by allowing approved exporters
                           to submit revisions to their annual 2013 work plan in order to increase their export volume
                           for 2013. In a press release on 29 August, the Vice Minister of Energy and Mineral
                           Resources emphasized that the measures announced in the package apply only until January
                           2014. The ban on raw mineral ore exports (effective January 2014) therefore still appears
                           likely to be implemented.

…and reducing certain      Measures to discourage import demand center on fuel imports and luxury consumer goods.
categories of imports      First, biodiesel blending requirements for domestic fuels are being increased, with the aim of
                           reducing reliance on imported fossil fuel-based diesel. This measure is longer-term in nature,
                           with the implementing regulation stipulating annual increases in biodiesel in the fuel mix
                           through 2025, tailored by user group. The implementation challenges, and broader impacts
                           of such a policy, for example on the environment and agriculture sector, will be important to
                           assess. It is not yet certain how quickly these measures will be implemented or what their
                           ultimate impact will be on the current account deficit, given their potential to induce
                           substitution away from palm oil exports. Second, taxes on selected luxury goods, such as
                           imported luxury cars and other high-end branded consumer goods, are increased 25-50
                           percent. This measure, while symbolic, is unlikely to have a material impact on overall
                           import demand, given that consumer goods account for less than 10 percent of total
                           imports. As part of the implementing regulation, taxes on some categories of goods are also
                           being reduced, which may also offset some of the overall impact of this measure on
                           imported goods demand.

                      c.   Measures to support employment

Focus on labor-            In addition to tax breaks for labor-intensive firms, described above, employment support
intensive industries in    measures in the package are essentially two-fold. First, regulations pertaining to bounded
the bounded zones…         zones are relaxed, for example allowing firms in these areas to sell a higher proportion of
                           their output domestically (up from 25 to 50 percent), and to make more use of sub-
                           contracting. Bounded zones are where labor-intensive, light manufacturing factories are
                           overwhelmingly located, and these receive incentives in exchange for exporting the bulk of
                           their output. Although the measures announced as part of the August package may prove
                           positive for employment, international experience suggests that measures which open the
                           domestic market to firms in bounded zones may also bring additional regulatory challenges
                           and costs, and affect firm incentives. For example, with firms potentially subject to different
                           tax requirements on different portions of their output, this could potentially reduce
                           incentives for firms to export.

…and on minimum              Second, changes are proposed to the mechanism for setting provincial minimum wages
wage-setting                (Upah Minimum Provinsi, UMP) to prevent layoffs caused by excessive increases in minimum
                            wages. The reform proposal outlines a mechanism for achieving a more certain, simple, and
                            fair minimum wage setting process, aiming to make employers, workers and job seekers
                            better off, by promoting a more evidence-based and less politicized wage-setting process,
                            leading to more predictable annual increases, and by introducing improvements in the
                            governance structure that reduce the scope for discretionary decision making.9

Reform of the               Reform of the minimum wage-setting process is complex. Negotiations and final agreements

complex…                    regulations (whether revised or not) is not easy, and requires monitoring and coordination at

                            implementation, as well as between central and local governments and relevant actors
                            (District Governors and Wage Councils).

                            monitoring policies should also improve compliance with the system. If applied
                            appropriately, this reform therefore has the potential to improve certainty, simplicity and
                            transparency in minimum-wage setting, supporting equity and balancing trade-offs in the
                            setting of minimum wages, which is a vital price for many workers and businesses, both
                            directly, and indirectly through its impact on wage-setting across the economy.

                            unwound. As part of the policy package, additional steps are being taken to shift from
                            restricting import quantity to managing the difference between the domestic and
                            international prices of beef and horticultural products, which should improve transparency
                            and somewhat reduce the risks of sharp price increases due to a lack of imported supplies.
                            Subsequent to the announcement of the policy package, there have also been some
                            additional moves towards relaxing trade restrictions, notably on soybeans, with the scrapping
                            of import permits and (temporary) elimination of a 5 percent tariff. However, given the
                            challenges in coordinating policy across agencies, it remains to be seen whether the revised
                            policy stance on imports of these products can be implemented effectively.

Achieving an optimal       There is no off-the-shelf set of optimal policies for reacting to deterioration in market
policy response to         conditions and shifting economic conditions. Rather, Indonesia’s policymakers face complex
shifting economic          challenges, though with some common aspects to those in other emerging market
conditions, and when       economies such as Brazil and India (where external financing conditions have also tightened,
faced by volatile          and growth has slowed). While there may be many potential policy levers, there are also
markets, is complex        implementation costs and potential trade-offs to consider, as well as the overall
                           communication strategy. For example, maintaining strong employment and wage growth is
                           clearly desirable, but introducing measures to support employment which stimulate the
                           economy can go against the moderation in overall demand growth which may be necessary
                           to address the current account deficit. Policy interventions may also impede other
                           adjustments, such as in key relative prices, which can help maintain domestic and external
                           balances, and introduce additional uncertainty over the regulatory environment.

The Government’s           In light of the current challenges faced by the Indonesian economy, the policies announced
policy package appears     by the Government seem well-focused at the micro-level. As always, the timing and nature
broadly positive for the   of the implementation of the announced measures will be crucial in determining how

further built upon…        of the negative list are yet to be finalized some six weeks since the package was announced.
                           The policy package should also be evaluated from the perspective of Indonesia’s broader
                           strategy to lift the sustainable pace of economic growth and development over the medium-
                           term. In this context, the policy package should be seen as part of an ongoing process of
                           policy reform and implementation, which can be built on further.

…with additional           Given the pressure on Indonesia’s external balances and consequent need to lift

                           to reduce import dwell time (see the following Section).

…and maintaining           To build on the August policy package in the fiscal policy arena, a very positive policy signal,

sector reforms             subsidy reforms, such as moving towards a more predictable and transparent fuel price
                           adjustment mechanism, combined with deepening and expansion of the social protection
                           framework. In addition, the Government could proactively enhance its preparedness for
                           slower growth by putting in place a systematic monitoring and response mechanism to
                           provide social protection in a targeted and effective manner. It will be important to ensure
                           that the fiscal stance, as outlined in the 2014 Budget under consideration, remains prudent
                           and coordinated with monetary policy. A big push on revenue administration can support
                           this by limiting debt financing needs, consolidating the strengthening in the public balance
                           sheets which Indonesia has already achieved, while further improvements in budget
                           execution can help to support growth. While some of these steps may seem like longer-term
                           measures, they can have a positive near-term impact by signaling the direction of Indonesia’s
                           policy and growth trajectory.

                               for long-term investment, both of which are policy areas under particular focus in light of
                               the recent deterioration in Indonesia’s external balances. This section examines one of the
                               key, practical challenges to improving Indonesia’s international connectivity – reducing dwell

…in enhancing the              Improvements in international connectivity can support the ability of Indonesian firms to
long-term                      move up the value chain. Indonesia’s sizeable potential for growing its manufacturing sector
competitiveness of             and international trade is well-known, but realizing this potential faces a number of
Indonesia’s                    challenges. Most Indonesian manufacturing firms currently engage mainly in basic
manufacturing sector           processing activities, and consequently operate in low positions in regional and global value
through moving up              chains. For Indonesian industry to move up value chains, thus increasing the value-added of
value chains…                  its output and generating more high quality jobs, wide-ranging policy and infrastructure
                               improvements will be required, including significant reforms to the business environment,
                               labor regulations, access to finance, innovation and better connectivity. Not all of these
                               factors can be addressed overnight. However, in the short and medium term, the
                               competitiveness of Indonesian firms would benefit significantly from being able to access
                               quality international inputs at world prices.

…and facilitating              Better international connectivity can also help to deliver improvements in productivity and

                               to an increase in demand for domestic inputs as well.10 Thus, ensuring that the process for
                               importing goods is as efficient as possible is crucial for Indonesia’s long-run development.

                          a.   Improved port performance: the key to unlocking trade

Transport and trade            Currently, Indonesia compares poorly to other developing Asian countries on transport and
facilitation issues are        logistics measures such as cost, efficiency, and quality, including infrastructure, customs, and
some of the biggest            the competence of the logistics industry. (Figure 28). Under-investment in ports and roads
constraints to traders         infrastructure in Indonesia has contributed to serious congestion problems and hence to
in Indonesia                   Indonesia’s relatively poor logistics performance. While improving physical infrastructure is
                               crucial, this is a longer-term endeavor, leaving performance improvements as the key short-
                               term measure for alleviating capacity constraints. This is the case at Tanjung Priok port,
                               Indonesia’s main trade gateway, handling over two-thirds of the country’s entire
                               international trade. Tanjung Priok has long reached full capacity, and given that the new
                               international container terminal is not scheduled to be operational until 2018, the
                               Government is focusing on steps to improve port efficiency.

Port performance is               As gateways to the global markets, ports serve as a critical key nodes and principal
one of the most critical          interchange points for domestic and international freight movements. Ports are where most
areas of trade                    trade transactions take place and, therefore, where most of the delays occur. On trade
facilitation reform…              corridors, at least 50 percent of delays happen at the port of entry.

…with port dwell time             Dwell time is defined as the elapsed time that cargo spends within the port limits, from the
a particularly                    moment it is unloaded from the vessel and is on the ground until it leaves the port premises
important element of              by road or rail. Lowering dwell times allow ports to increase volume, revenue and foster
port performance                  competition with other similar ports in the country or regionally. Dwell time figures are
                                  commonly used to attract shipping lines and cargo traffic to a port, giving port authorities
                                  and container terminal operators strong incentives to improve this performance indicator.

Long dwell times                  For goods that are intermediate products in a supply chain, on-time delivery is valuable.
increase overall trade            Unreliability and uncertainty bring costs that can potentially discourage investments, increase
costs, impacting                  inventories and associated storage costs, dampen the scale expansion of an enterprise and
productive activities,            dissuade the start of new export initiatives. Delays also dramatically affect terminal capacity,
especially for export             performance and investment needs, which in turn increases cost and results in even more
and re-export-oriented            uncertainty, forming a vicious cycle. Lastly, for ports located in dense urban areas, it is
industries                        essential to maintain the flow of goods and traffic, as episodes of congestion and surges in
                                  dwell time can be extremely disruptive for trade and the port-city environment.

Dwell time for imports            A focus on improving container dwell times for imports (i.e. inbound containers) is generally
in particular is vital for        appropriate in developing countries such as Indonesia. For many countries the aggregate
port performance as               volume of exports is often lower than that of imports but, more importantly, the dwell time
imports often involve             for outbound containers is usually low (on average one or two days). Imports involve most
greater costs and time            of the border controls, and incur greater costs and time penalties than exports. In any case,
delays than exports               both directions of trade use the same service providers, so an improvement in the quality of
                                  these services benefits all traders.

Dwell time at Tanjung             According to the most recent estimates, the average import container dwell time at Tanjung
Priok has almost                  Priok has almost doubled from 5.2 days in January 2011 to 10.1 days in August 2013 (Figure
doubled in the last two           29). To understand the reasons behind this rapid lengthening in the time needed to clear and
years                             remove containers from the port, it is necessary to have a closer look into the components
                                  of dwell time. Import containers’ dwell time can be broken into three distinct stages that

                                correspond to different processes, different responsibilities and agency relationships (Figure
                                30). The upstream component comprises the time between the arrival of the ship and the
                                submission of the import declaration to Customs. The customs clearance segment
                                corresponds to the elapsed time from the submission of the import declaration until the
                                clearance is obtained. The downstream component spans from the receipt of customs
                                clearance until leaving the port premises, in this case, the gates of the Jakarta International

                         c.     Where are the main challenges?
The main dwell time             Contrary to widespread perceptions of poor performance of Customs Clearances and abuses
delays occur in the             of port facilities by importers, a recent study shows that 58 percent of the average dwell time
upstream stage…                 occurs in the upstream (pre-customs) stage (Figure 32). Although many sources of delay can
                                be seen throughout the import process, focusing on efficiency gains in the upstream
                                component could therefore have a significant impact on the overall dwell time average of
                                Tanjung Priok. Major sources of delays in the upstream component are the inefficiency of
                                the 24/7 system, delays in the submissions of import declarations, and the
                                underperformance of the Indonesian National Single Window (INSW).

                                            averaging 38 percent of the total of containers that arrive in one week (Monday through to
                                            Sunday). Most of the freight forwarders, shipping-line companies and banks do not work
                                            over the weekend or after business hours, pushing back the submission of the Customs
                                            import declaration (PIB) until the following Monday, and delaying the start of the clearance
                                            process. Thus, while the number of containers arriving at the weekend is higher per day than
                                            during the week, the number of submissions for Customs clearance is lower per day over the
                                            weekend (Figure 33). Customs services are also only available on request during weekends or
                                            after business hours, adding an extra step if the importer wants to clear goods over the
                                            weekend.

                                            pre-approved importers). Depending on the risk channel assigned, the importer will obtain a
                                            different treatment for Customs clearance, thus determining the length of the stay in the
                                            port from there on. The priority risk channel (MITA Prioritas) has a relative short dwell (an
                                            average of 4 days) but this channel only accounts for 16 percent of the containers and
                                            comprises a small group of only 105 importers. Importers in this risk channel are allowed
                                            deferred payments for Customs duties and taxes, and they do not need to submit the
                                            manifest number in the import declaration, allowing the earlier submission of the import
                                            declaration than in other channels.

                             The i-Care system (integrated cargo release) was recently launched in Tanjung Priok to
                             integrate all services in the downstream component, aiming to eliminate face-to-face
                             interactions between truck drivers and Customs officials at the gate. A pilot was launched in
                             TPK Koja in November 2012 and it is also integrated with the INSW. The Government has
                             also set up an Integrated Physical Inspection Facility (TPFT), allowing Customs, Quarantine
                             and BPOM to conduct inspections at the same time, reducing the movement of containers
                             and allowing for faster physical inspection times in the yellow and red channels. The TPFT
                             was developed in conjunction with Pelindo II (the state-owned company operating Tanjung
                             Priok) and all the government agencies and began operations in February 2013. This
                             initiative should help to reduce the average dwell time of containers arriving in the yellow

                          infrastructure investment has increased markedly, led by sub-national governments.
                          However, despite the Government’s commitment to improve infrastructure provision and
                          spending, the overall level of infrastructure investment has barely returned to pre-1997/98
                          levels in real terms and has failed to keep pace with increasing demand.

                             development. SOE investment also dropped by about 1.8 percent of GDP. Total (local and
                             central) government investment declined by 0.9 percent from an average of 3.3 percent of
                             GDP during 1995-1997 to 2.4 percent of GDP over 2008-11 (Figure 34).

Government                   In constant price terms (using the national accounts investment deflator), total infrastructure
infrastructure               investment during 2008-11 was about a third lower than its level in 1995-97. However, by
investment, although         2008-11 annual average government (central and local) infrastructure investment in constant
down relative to GDP,        prices had recovered to 1995-97 levels, while SOEs and the private sector remained down
has almost recovered         around 30 and 70 percent. The government sector contribution to overall infrastructure
in real terms, driven by     investment has therefore increased, led by sub-national government spending on local road
sub-national                 investment. The rising importance of sub-national investment reflects the impact of fiscal
government                   decentralization in 2001 in which spending assignments and financing were transferred to
investment…                  sub-national governments. Prior to decentralization, about 80 percent of the government
                             infrastructure investment came from the central government, with only 20 percent provided
                             by sub-national governments. Subsequently this has shifted to about 65 percent of spending
                             implemented by sub-national government and 35 percent by the central government.

                         b. Indonesia’s stock of infrastructure capital has likely declined relative to the total…

Led by robust                  As mentioned above, Indonesia’s aggregate investment growth has been strong in recent
construction                   years, with gross fixed capital formation growing in real terms at 8 percent on average
investment growth              between 2001 and 2011, largely driven by construction. As a result, Indonesia’s overall
Indonesia’s total              capital stock ratio-to-GDP has risen from an estimated 1.7 times GDP in 1995 to 2.1 times
capital-to-output ratio        GDP in 2011. Has infrastructure capital stock, which is a key input to productivity and
has increased in recent        growth, kept track with this overall trend? The following section will explore this important
years                          question, including the likely implication on output growth.

In contrast, estimates         The Perpetual Inventory Method (PIM), combined with the assumptions outlined in Box 4,
suggest that the               can be used to estimate the level of Indonesia’s infrastructure capital stock. Preliminary
infrastructure capital         estimates indicate that the declining real infrastructure investment rate in the face of
stock has likely               depreciation and rapid economic growth have likely resulted in a declining level of
declined relative to the       infrastructure stock relative to the size of the overall economy. For example, after
size of the economy            depreciation, the average real growth of the infrastructure capital stock between 1996 and
and the total capital          2011 was 3 percent, below the average real GDP growth rate of 4 percent (including the
stock                          1997/98 crisis period). The pace of infrastructure investment growth has also not kept pace
                               with the real growth in the overall capital stock, which averaged 4.4 percent over this period
                               (Figure 35). As a result, Indonesia’s infrastructure capital stock has gradually declined from
                               an assumed starting value of 28 percent of total capital stock in 1995 to 20 percent in 2011
                               (Figure 36). The recent pick up in public infrastructure investment has been only sufficient
                               to slow the rate of relative decline. The rise in the growth rate of overall investment in the
                               last decade has been led by the non-infrastructure construction sector. While these estimates
                               are subject to a range of caveats the broad findings do appear relatively robust to different
                               assumptions (see Box 4).

provision of infrastructure services, which
matter for growth and development outcomes, is dependent upon the quality and efficiency of the investments.
The Perpetual Inventory Method is used to estimate the infrastructure capital stock, by taking an estimate of the initial capital stock
value (in 1995 from when the infrastructure investment data are available) to which gross investment flows are added and from
which depreciation of the existing stock is subtracted. Based on this approach, Indonesia’s estimated infrastructure capital stock in
2011 of 49 percent of GDP is close to McKinsey Global Institute (2013) average estimates (over 1992-2011, including capitalized
maintenance) for India at 58 percent of GDP but below averages for middle and high income economies of 70 percent of GDP.
Due to data limitations, a number of assumptions have been made to construct the capital stock estimates. First, following Van der
Eng (2008) who estimates the capital stock in Indonesia between 1950 and 2007, the initial value of the total capital stock is assumed
to be 1.7 times GDP in 1995 and the initial level of infrastructure capital stock is assumed at 28 percent of total capital stock.
(Although the initial value of total and infrastructure capital stock use Van der Eng’s estimate, the trends and levels of total and
infrastructure capital stock for the subsequent period of analysis are different due to different methodologies).
Second, the annual depreciation rate for infrastructure assets is assumed at 5 percent, following the Ministry of Finance’s assumption
for tax accounting purpose for building and transportation equipment (MoF, 2009). This rate is in-between the implicit depreciation
rate of 6.1 percent used by Van der Eng for Indonesia, and a 3.5 percent rate used by Arslanalp (2011) for middle-income countries.
Finally, it is important to note that the use of investment data may underestimate the contribution of maintenance spending on
sustaining asset life. However, this may be offset by the likely overestimation implied by assuming a one-to-one relationship between
infrastructure investment and the accumulation of productive assets. For example, Pritchett (2000) argues that there is lack of
relationship between investment spending (flow) and the accumulation of productive assets, particularly in developing countries,
owing to inefficiencies and waste.
The estimates of the infrastructure capital stock are sensitive to the assumptions on the initial level of the infrastructure stock and
the depreciation rate (Table 7); if initially in 1995 the infrastructure capital stock was 33 percent of total capital stock (5 percentage
points higher than the baseline), then the annual growth of the infrastructure capital stock over the period would have averaged 2.2
percent, lower than the baseline, as the higher initial stock would result in more depreciation relative to the new investment flows,
but the final estimated level in 2011 would be higher. Depreciation rate assumptions also affect the growth rate and infrastructure
capital stock level; a lower depreciation rate of 3.5 percent (below the baseline of 5 percent) would result in a higher average growth
rate of the infrastructure stock and its estimated level relative to the total capital stock would be higher than the baseline.

The weak growth of              Capital stocks, including infrastructure, reflect the capacity of the economy to produce
infrastructure capital          goods and services. The quality and quantity of the infrastructure capital stock - particularly
stock has likely                core infrastructure such as roads network, railways, bridges, ports, airports, electricity,
hampered Indonesia’s            telecommunication facilities, and water systems - is a critical input to economic productivity
recent economic                 and competitiveness. The majority of empirical studies find a positive relationship between
performance                     infrastructure capital stocks and output (Box 5). As such, and as expected from the impacts
                                of infrastructure weaknesses on businesses and households on a daily basis, the relatively low
                                growth in Indonesian’s infrastructure capital stock has likely hampered Indonesia’s economic
                                performance over the past decade.

 For simplicity, in the simulations an elasticity of output to infrastructure capital stock of 0.15 was assumed, along the lines of the
 empirical findings of Ligthart and Bom (2009) and Corong et al (2012). On the one hand, this relatively conservative elasticity
 assumption takes into account the concerns over the weak linkages between monetary investment, physical capital stock, and
 infrastructure service provision. On the other hand, this assumption could underestimate impact of positive externalities of
 accumulated infrastructure capital, for example on improving accessibility to education and health services. It also is recognized that
 the multiplier of infrastructure investment to growth varies between types of infrastructure investment. For example, OECD (2009),
 using measures of physical infrastructure per capita, estimates a range of multipliers for various type of infrastructure, for example,
 roads (0.3 – 0.46), railway infrastructure (0.39 – 0.53), motorways (0.42-4), electricity (0.39), telephone mainline infrastructure (0.39 –
 0.42), and telephone subscriptions (0.34 – 0.45). Due to data limitations, this disaggregated analysis by type of infrastructure is not
 conducted for Indonesia.

… which would have         Extensive empirical analyses suggest that higher GDP growth often contributes to poverty
contributed to faster      reduction. Given the official poverty line and Indonesia's consumption distribution - that is,
poverty reduction and      how many people lie within 1 percent of the poverty line - in recent years, for every 1
improved development       percent growth in the incomes of the poor, the national poverty rate declines by 0.5
outcomes                   percentage points. Applying this rough rule of thumb, and some assumptions about how
                           much GDP growth passes through to household consumption growth of the poor, a higher
                           growth of infrastructure capital stock of 5 percent (than actual average of 3 percent), could
                           increase the growth of poor consumption by an additional 0.3 percent per annum, and be
                           associated with an additional 0.15 percentage point fall in poverty per year. From 2001-11,
                           this would mean a 1.5 percentage point lower poverty rate (i.e., this year's poverty would be
                           9.9 percent rather than its current 11.4 percent). If the growth of infrastructure capital stock
                           would have been averaging 10 percent, this number would be 4.5 percentage points over the
                           period, or a current poverty rate of 6.9 percent. These estimates are clearly simplifications
                           but are intended to be illustrative. It is also important to recognize that the extent to which
                           infrastructure-supported growth may support further poverty reduction is influenced by
                           many factors, such as the type of infrastructure, its geographical location, condition, and the
                           period of analysis.

A continued focus on        Since the 1997/98 crisis, Indonesia has had difficulties in achieving sustained growth of its
lifting the quality and     infrastructure capital stock. In fact, while there are significant data limitations, the evidence
quantity of                 suggests that infrastructure stock has not increased greatly over this period, causing it to fall
infrastructure spending     relative to both the total capital stock and to the size of the economy. With demand for
is critical for Indonesia   better infrastructure services only likely to increase, the need to continue improving
to realize its growth       infrastructure investment is clear. In this regard, improving both the quantity and quality of
potential...                public investment is important. Continuing to increase the budget allocation for
                            infrastructure development plays a role, through redirecting spending, for example, from
                            energy subsidies, and supporting improved revenue mobilization. In parallel, the
                            Government’s efforts, mentioned in Part A, to support spending execution and project
                            implementation should be sustained. Fiscal sustainability and competing demands for public
                            funds also argue for a strong focus on efficiency, including ensuring the smooth operation
                            and maintenance of existing infrastructure, and, more broadly, on improving the quality of
                            public investment management to deliver effectively on the priority public infrastructure
                            needs of the economy. In addition, it will be important to support policies, regulations and
                            institutions, such as in relation to public private partnerships (PPPs), which can build a
                            stronger enabling environment for private sector infrastructure investments.

…and further data           As discussed, measuring the size of Indonesia’s total and infrastructure investment, capital
collection and analysis     stocks and their impact on growth has been challenging due to a range of data limitations
can help to inform the      and required assumptions. The estimations and simulations presented above are an initial
quality of evidence-        step in this analysis. Improving the quality, timeliness and coverage of the data is an
based policy making in      important step for enhancing this analysis and to inform better evidence-based policies on
support of this goal        infrastructure needs and performance. Extensions to this analysis can also support these
                            objectives, for example, by linking the investment and capital stock estimates to real sector
                            indicators, by disaggregating the investment and stock by type and by region, by linking
                            spending on operations and maintenance to the capital stock estimates, by making
                            adjustments to take into account the quality of investments, and by examining in more detail
                            their relationships with outcomes including growth and inclusiveness. Estimates of the
                            current economic costs of infrastructure weaknesses can also further enrich this analysis.
                            This includes not only the economic costs of congestion but also the opportunity costs of
                            the private sector’s responses, such as purchasing in-house generation capacity or adding
                            additional trucks to compensate for fewer deliveries per day by each truck due to congestion.

need, and this is vital    and support the foundations for a peaceful future. For example, recent international
for development            research has shown that ensuring all children leave school with basic literacy and numeracy
                           skills can raise annual per-capita growth by up to one percentage point.14 Such an advantage
                           would have a significant positive impact on Indonesia's medium-term growth trajectory and
                           development outlook. This section discusses recent survey evidence on the important role
                           that improvements in local governance can play in raising the quality of basic education and
                           ensuring children leave school with adequate skills.

Education reform has       In the last fifteen years, Indonesia has introduced a comprehensive package of education
led to expanded school     reforms designed to expand access and improve quality. A key component of the reform
access but more            process has been the devolution of responsibility for basic education services to local
modest improvements        governments and schools. These reforms, coupled with an unprecedented increase in
in learning                government investment in education have resulted in significant improvements in education
                           access particularly for the poorest children. 15 However, improvements in learning
                           achievement have been more modest and children still leave school with inadequate skills for
                           the needs of the labor market. As with other education systems around the world, improving
                           the quality of basic education continues to be a central challenge.

Strengthening local        Strengthening the capacity of local governments to manage their education systems
government capacity is     effectively is vital if efforts to raise education quality are to be successful. The ability of local
a crucial ingredient for   governments to deliver good quality basic education services varies considerably across
improved education         Indonesia. Identifying the key dimensions of governance that underpin effective education
quality                    service delivery can provide a starting point for addressing existing weaknesses and raising
                           education performance.

                          variation but research has shown that the quality of local governance is also important. In
                          particular, studies have shown that education outcomes are better in districts that have more
                          effective planning and budgeting systems and have lower levels of perceived corruption.16
                          These findings suggest that efforts to improve education outcomes will need to address
                          weaknesses in local governance to be successful.

                               4.   Assess the effect of donor-supported capacity building activities

                          The districts participating in the ILEG survey are not representative of Indonesia as a whole.
                          In particular, the districts that participated in the survey tended to be poorer than other
                          districts but had similar levels of education access and achievement.

                                 incorporate decisions made by local and school level planning processes into annual
                                 district education work plans.
                               Management information systems. Measures the availability of good quality information
                                 on local education systems that can be used for education planning and monitoring
                                 processes.

                            be used to explore associations between the dimensions of governance and education
                            performance.

summary measure of          set of indicators in each area are combined into a sub-index. For example, the sub-index for
the quality of local        transparency and accountability is a weighted average of ten indicators. These sub-indices are
education governance        averaged to construct the ILEG index which is an overall measure of the quality of local
                            education governance. The index ranges from 0 to 100 percent with low scores indicating
                            that key components of governance that drive better education performance are not in place
                            and high scores indicating that these components already exist.

                            examination scores. Districts       controlled for other factors that could determine district
                            that devote a greater share of      examination scores (e.g. poverty levels)
                            their budgets to education and hire more qualified teachers, for example, tend to have better
                            enrolment rates and examination scores. Putting the results together suggests that better
                            quality local governance is associated with better education performance (Figure 39).

                           schools. Despite these setbacks, some aspects of management control have improved over
                           the last few years. In particular, asset management systems appear to have been strengthened
                           and a greater proportion of districts are carrying out yearly stock inventories and have passed
                           local legislation on asset management.

Differences between        The factors underlying the decline in the dimension of governance associated with efficient
planned and realized       resource use are more complex. This area of governance is most closely associated with an
spending point to          assessment of the effectiveness of district education offices to plan, budget and monitor the
weaknesses in              use of education resources. A key indicator of effectiveness in this area is the difference
budgeting for              between planned and realized education spending. This indicator deteriorated between 2009
education…                 and 2012; the number of districts reporting gaps between planned and realized spending of
                           less than 10 percent over the last three years fell from 46 percent to 32 percent. However,
                           the large adjustments in the revised budgets are partly due to revisions in intergovernmental
                           transfers that local governments cannot control.

                               2012 the proportion of districts that set budget priorities and ceilings before sector offices
                               (e.g. the education office) start their own planning exercises increased from 44 percent to 74
                               percent. These improvements reflect recent efforts by the central government to introduce
                               performance based budgeting and medium term expenditure frameworks.

Box 6: The effect of capacity development grants provided to district education offices
 The Basic Education Capacity (BEC) program provided support to all of the sampled districts in the ILEG survey through technical
 assistance and the provision of local capacity development grants of approximately USD 255,000. While the grants were relatively
 small (on average less than one percent of average annual education expenditure) they were designed to strengthen local education
 governance and improve education performance.

 It was expected that local governments would use the capacity building grants to focus on the main areas of weakness identified in
 2009 partly through the first round of the ILEG survey. However, it appears that areas assessed to be the weakest were allocated less
 grant resources than the strongest areas. For example, in 2009 districts ranked relatively highly on the ILEG sub-index for education
 service provision standards, yet this area received the largest share of BEC grant resources. It is not possible to directly attribute the
 changes in the quality of local education governance reported by the ILEG survey from 2009 to 2012 with capacity building efforts.
 However, the weak targeting of resources for capacity building is likely to have played a part in the mixed picture of improvements in
 governance recorded by the survey. Future capacity-building support programs should build on the experience of the BEC program,
 which points to the importance of carefully targeting support, cutting across governance sectors, and tailoring support to district
 characteristics.



                          d. Without addressing key governance constraints, performance is unlikely to improve

District education             The findings of the ILEG survey demonstrate the importance of the quality of local
performance will not           governance in improving district education performance. Put simply, district education
improve without                performance is unlikely to improve without strategies to address the key governance
strategies to address          constraints highlighted in this section. However, progress in strengthening local education
key governance                 governance over the last four years has been slow, despite efforts to strengthen district
constraints                    capacity. Major challenges therefore need to be addressed if local education governance is to
                               be improved.17

Better coordination            While strengthening local governance is crucial for sustained progress in the education
and integration of             sector it is also important to recognize that central government transfers and education
central government             sector programs present a number of challenges to district level education governance. The
financing in local             current intergovernmental transfer system introduces incentives for higher salary spending
education planning is          which may distort the decision-making process and result in mismatches between school
needed                         needs and district allocations. While local governments provide the bulk of funding for
                               basic education, the central government still contributes significantly. In order to reduce the
                               risk that central government programs undermine district efforts to improve education
                               sector management and governance there is a need for improved coordination and
                               integration of central and local government programs. This includes efforts to clarify roles
                               and responsibilities and an increased effort to incorporate central government programs into
                               local planning processes are clearly needed.

INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Slower growth; high risks

December 2013
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office. The report is compiled by the
          Macro and Fiscal Policy Cluster, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM)
          Network, under the guidance of Jim Brumby, Sector Manager and Lead Economist, Ndiame
          Diop, Lead Economist and Economic Advisor, and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. Led
          by Alex Sienaert, the core project team, with responsibility for Part A (economic update),
          editing and production, comprises Arsianti, Magda Adriani, Brendan Coates, Fitria Fitrani,
          Ahya Ihsan, Elitza Mileva, Violeta Vulovic and Michele Savini Zangrandi. Administrative
          support is provided by Titi Ananto and Sylvia Njotomihardjo. Dissemination is organized by
          Farhana Asnap, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan, Nugroho Sunjoyo, Randy Salim and
          Marcellinus Winata, under the guidance of Dini Sari Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Leni Dharmawan, Lily Hoo, Mattia
          Makovec, Arvind Nair, Cindy Paladines, Della Temenggung, Violeta Vulovic, and Matthew
          Wai-Poi. Key input was received from The Fei Ming, Neni Lestari, Djauhari Sitorus, Connor
          Spreng, Ekaterine Vashakmadze and Anna Wetterberg. The report also benefited from
          discussions with, and in-depth comments, from Mark Ahern, Jamie Carter, Sjamsu Rahardja,
          David Nellor and Bill Wallace (Australia Indonesia Partnership for Economic Governance)
          and Roland Rajah (Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade).

 Executive summary: Slower growth; high risks




Looking ahead to 2014,    The final quarter of 2013 has seen the continuing adjustment of the Indonesian economy to
Indonesia faces slower    more subdued commodity prices and tighter external financing conditions, and to the related
growth, and significant   pressures on external balances. Policies have responded, particularly through tighter
economic risks…           monetary conditions, the Rupiah has depreciated substantially in real terms, and investment
                          spending and output growth have weakened. These developments are broadly supportive of
                          continued macroeconomic stability, including by helping to lower the current account
                          deficit, although their impact continues to play out, adding additional uncertainty to the path
                          of the domestic economy. At the same time, the international environment is also shifting,
                          with global growth expected to improve, bringing potential policy changes, notably in US
                          monetary policy, which could add to the pressures on Indonesia’s external financing
                          position.

…requiring a policy       In light of the slower pace of growth, and the risks facing the economy, there is a strong
focus not only on         need for Indonesia to augment the recent macro focus on tighter monetary policy, exchange
macro adjustment but      rate adjustment and import compression, with deeper reforms to lift export performance
also on credible          and support investment inflows, especially FDI. Progress on the credible implementation of
implementation of         such measures can help to limit the vulnerability of Indonesia’s external balances to tighter,
longer-term               or more volatile, global financing conditions and can help to support a sustainable virtuous
investment- and           cycle of strong investment, including foreign investment, and output growth over the
export-enhancing          medium term. The political dynamics of an election year may play an important role in
reforms                   framing policy choices in 2014 but this backdrop also adds importance to the need for clear
                          communication and coordination of such deeper reforms, both in the formulation and
                          implementation stages, and for the avoidance of policy missteps. This would support local
                          and foreign investor confidence in Indonesia’s future economic trajectory, and external
                          financing inflows.

 Slower growth; high risks                                              Indonesia Economic Quarterly


The performance of         Economic conditions amongst the world’s largest economies, and Indonesia’s major trading
the global economy is      partners, remain uneven. Growth in the US has picked up steam over 2013, the Euro Area
expected to improve        has finally exited its long recession but its recovery remains subdued, while growth in Japan,
further in 2014…           though positive, has weakened. China’s economic activity accelerated in the second half of
                           2013, joined in recent months by India, but activity in some other major developing
                           economies like Brazil has remained more subdued. Moving into 2014, the baseline
                           expectation is for global economic conditions to strengthen, as high income economies gain
                           more traction, supporting growth in developing economies, notably including China, and
                           resulting in a continued modest expansion in the demand for Indonesia’s exports.

…and commodity             International commodity prices have generally increased in recent months lifting the price
prices have                index of Indonesia’s top ten commodity exports by 3.8 percent since August (though it
stabilized…                remains 2 percent lower in 2013 and 22 percent below its recent peak in February 2011),
                           helped by higher coal, natural gas, and palm oil prices. If sustained, the nascent stabilization
                           in commodity prices would help arrest the decline in Indonesia’s terms of trade which has
                           driven much of the deterioration in the external balances. However, the baseline outlook of
                           only a moderate pick-up in global growth, coupled with the likelihood of tightening global
                           liquidity conditions and more structural downward pressure on prices from supply-side
                           factors, does not suggest a major upswing in commodity prices in 2014.

…but international         The international outlook, although improving, still contains sizeable policy challenges and
policy risks and           uncertainties. In Europe, the recovery is fragile and will likely be uneven due to ongoing
financial conditions       deleveraging and considerable reform challenges. In Asia, the pace and manner in which
continue to pose           ambitious structural reform efforts in China and Japan are implemented, and elections in
challenges for             India, will shape the outlook. Above all, the timing and pace of the phasing out of the US
Indonesia                  Federal Reserve’s asset purchase program (so-called “tapering”) is uncertain, but keeps the
                           risks of global market volatility and more difficult external financing conditions to the fore.

Domestic policy and        As highlighted in the October 2013 IEQ, the expectations of tapering, and related tightening
economic adjustments       external financing conditions, beginning in May, combined with the gradual transmission of
over 2013 have been        lower commodity prices since 2011, have precipitated a number of important economic and
significant…               policy adjustments in Indonesia over the second half of 2013, which are ongoing. Bank
                           Indonesia (BI) has raised its policy interest rate corridor by 175 basis points (bp) since June,
                           when the Government increased subsidized fuel prices by an average of 33 percent. The
                           Rupiah has depreciated by 24 percent against the US Dollar year-to-date, largely since
                           August, and in real trade-weighted terms fell by 12.5 percent from its recent peak in May
                           through October.

…and growth has            Indonesia’s economic growth has slowed notably, to 5.6 percent year-on-year (yoy) in the
slowed notably,            third quarter, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of declining growth from the recent high
reducing import            of 6.4 percent yoy in Q2 2012. Most of the slowdown has been driven by softening
demand, especially of      investment spending, which was up a relatively modest 4.5 percent yoy in the third quarter,

to stabilize the current   Weaker investment spending has cut capital goods imports, the US Dollar value of which
account deficit            was 16.3 percent lower yoy over the three months to October. Overall import volumes have
                           been subdued, and contracted significantly in Q3. Export volumes also contracted in
                           sequential terms in Q3, but not by as much as imports, such that net exports added
                           significantly to output growth. Overall, indications are that Indonesia’s trade balance is
                           shifting in such a way as to stabilize and begin to narrow the overall current account deficit.

Macroeconomic              The monetary policy and exchange rate adjustments seen in 2013 are broadly positive for

…but risks around this      These projections, however, are subject to significant uncertainty, and risks are tilted towards
base line are skewed        weaker domestic growth. In particular, the baseline view is contingent on external financing
towards slower              conditions being sufficiently supportive to avoid precipitating a more abrupt external
growth…                     balance adjustment, causing economic disruption and a knock-on impact on growth. Such a
                            deterioration could be triggered by international market developments, or be specifically due
                            to domestic economic and policy developments. In addition to the risks around growth,
                            there are also risks to the fiscal outlook. For example, the World Bank estimates that a 10
                            percent depreciation of the Rupiah increases the fiscal deficit by 0.3-0.4 percentage points of
                            GDP, largely by raising fuel subsidy costs (see the October 2013 IEQ).

…with a particular          Indonesia’s GDP forecasts are particularly sensitive to the investment outlook which faces
focus on risks to           risks from further real interest rate increases and exchange rate volatility, or from a greater-
investment growth, but      than-expected tightening in credit conditions impacting the thus-far solid growth in building
also to the resilience of   investment. There is also the risk that private consumption growth—although notably
private consumption         resilient to date—may come under more pressure from higher prices and interest rates,
                            weaker income growth and negative wealth and confidence effects. Even mildly weaker
                            domestic demand growth than currently anticipated (e.g. a 0.5 percentage points reduction in
                            private consumption and investment growth relative to their base lines) could reduce 2014
                            growth to below 5 percent. A more severe moderation in domestic demand, for example,
                            due to an intensification of external financing constraints or negative confidence effects
                            associated with policy missteps, could feasibly move 2014 growth to below 4.5 percent.

There is a need for         With consumption goods accounting for less than 10 percent of Indonesia’s imports, the
policies to support         slowdown in imports, while supporting a reduction in the current account deficit, mainly
exports and FDI             means less raw material and intermediate products for manufactured goods production, and
inflows, and to avoid       fewer capital goods. In the absence of available, competitive, domestic substitutes this will
potentially damaging        likely come at a direct cost to current and future export and output growth. While import
measures aimed at           compression due to relative price and income effects can play a useful short-term role in the
import suppression          adjustment process, the real policy challenge for Indonesia is therefore not to focus on
                            additional import suppression through regulatory measures, but rather to increase exports,
                            and to secure more and higher quality external financing, particularly FDI.

Measures to support       While FDI into Indonesia has so far proved resilient, if still at lower levels relative to GDP
improvements in the       than many regional peers, it is underpinned by three factors which have all come under
business environment      varying degrees of recent pressure: Indonesia’s huge natural resource base (undercut by
have an important role    generally softer global commodity prices and regulatory uncertainties), the large and growing
to enhance Indonesia’s    domestic market (undercut, at least in the near-term, by the headwinds facing domestic
underlying                demand), and Indonesia’s potential as a regional production hub in Asia (undercut by
attractiveness to FDI     regulatory uncertainties, and skills and infrastructure gaps). Consequently, there is a clear
inflows…                  need to make more progress to support FDI, including by moving forward on a pro-
                          investment revision of the negative investment list (DNI), a centerpiece of the
                          Government’s August policy package still awaiting implementation, and strengthening the
                          quality of the overall investment policy formation process to minimize policy uncertainty.
                          The Government has also launched a significant policy package to improve the ease of doing
                          business, with an action plan announced on October 25 across eight “Doing Business”
                          areas. The challenge now is to implement this package on the ambitious February 2014
                          timeline, providing a positive signal as to the trajectory of the business environment and
                          commitment to reform implementation.

…and process and          The real depreciation of the Rupiah over 2013, by boosting international competitiveness,
regulatory                presents an opportunity for Indonesia to improve its export performance. Furthermore, the
improvements in trade     weakening in commodity prices could also shift investment more towards the non-resources
facilitation and          sector, including export-oriented manufacturing. As highlighted in the October 2013 IEQ, a

deliver “quick wins” to   performance of import cargo clearance in ports such as Tanjung Priok in Jakarta, which by
lift exports              improving efficiency and predictability in trade logistics could boost exports and strengthen
                          Indonesia’s participation in the global production network. Supporting longer-term export
                          competitiveness also requires a continued focus on plugging infrastructure and skills gaps.

A continued emphasis      As highlighted in this and previous IEQs, fuel subsidies remain a major source of fiscal risk,
on the quality of         dent the ability of the flexible exchange rate to absorb shocks, and divert spending away
spending, including,      from more efficient uses, including the needed increases in public investment. Although any
through subsidy           fuel price increases appear politically unpalatable ahead of elections, there is clearly a strong
reform, can help to       need for further reforms, while at the same time improving the safety net for the poor and
meet longer-term          vulnerable. Reform options include those that may not result in an immediate increase in
development goals…        prices, such as implementing a rule-based approach for setting subsidized fuel prices in such
                          a way as to gradually limit the fiscal exposure to higher Rupiah-denominated fuel prices.

…along with measures      Reallocating spending from subsidies could support a strengthening of Indonesia’s social
to make further           assistance programs. While the recent expansion in long-term social assistance programs
progress in the fight     from the third quarter of 2013 is welcome, social assistance spending (at about 0.5 percent
against poverty, …        of GDP) remains low by global standards and commitment to the ongoing growth of social
                          assistance, and effective program implementation, will be required to help speed up poverty
                          reduction. For example, poverty in Indonesia fell by 0.6 percentage points in the year to
                          March 2013, to 11.4 percent as measured by the official rate. Moving into 2014, higher
                          prices and slower economic growth add to the poverty reduction challenge. Indeed, the
                          World Bank projects the March 2014 poverty rate to be 11.0-11.1 percent, indicating a
                          continuation of the ongoing slowing of poverty reduction and suggesting that the
                          Government’s 2014 target of an 8-10 percent poverty rate will likely be missed.

…to address longer-       To make further progress in achieving Indonesia’s medium-term development objectives, it

                          governance capacity for effective service delivery.

 A. Economic and fiscal update




                    1. Slowly improving global demand, external financing risks remain
The growth                Economic conditions amongst the world’s largest economies, and Indonesia’s major trading
performance of            partners, remain uneven. The Euro Area finally exited from recession in the second quarter
Indonesia’s major         of 2013, following six consecutive quarters of contraction, but growth softened again in the
trading partners          third quarter (to 0.4 percent at a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate, qoq saar), suggesting
remained mixed            that its path to recovery remains bumpy. Growth also weakened in Japan in the third
through the end of        quarter, to 1.1 percent qoq saar, while, in contrast, US growth firmed to 3.6 percent qoq
2013…                     saar, suggesting that the US economy has continued to gain steam fairly steadily through
                          2013. Amongst major developing economies, growth in China moved up to 9.3 percent qoq
                          saar, but in Brazil output contracted in Q3 versus Q2, by 0.5 percent (seasonally adjusted),
                          and growth has been relatively subdued in India (at 4.8 percent year-on-year, yoy, in Q3),
                          though recently showing signs of re-accelerating.

…but global demand is     Looking ahead to 2014, high income economy growth is expected to remain at or above its
expected to stage a       recent pace, with the Euro Area’s still-fragile recovery expected to continue, and the US
modest improvement        economy expected to expand at close to its current rate. Supported by this mild expansion,
in 2014…                  developing country growth is also expected to increase, with China’s economy growing by
                          7.7 percent in 2014, and developing country growth excluding China climbing to above 4
                          percent in 2014, up from approximately 3.5 percent in 2013. Consequently, the World Bank
                          projects the weighted average growth of Indonesia’s major trading partners to increase to 3.9
                          percent in 2014, up 0.5 percentage points from 2013. In the base case, therefore,
                          international demand should increase moderately through 2014, supporting a continued
                          modest expansion in the demand for Indonesia’s exports.

…and Indonesia’s               International commodity prices have generally increased in recent months. The weighted US
major commodity                Dollar price index of Indonesia’s ten most important export commodities, accounting for
prices may be                  approximately half of total export revenues, troughed in September and picked up through
stabilizing, following         the end of November, helped by higher coal, natural gas, and palm oil prices (Figure 1). As a
over two years of              result the year-to-November decline was trimmed to 2.5 percent from 7 percent in
sustained losses               September. However, the index remained down 22 percent from its February 2011 peak,
                               with the prices of coal (down 40 percent), palm oil (down 37 percent) and copper (down 27
                               percent) having fallen most precipitously from their 2011 highs. Should it prove sustained,
                               the nascent stabilization in commodity prices would help arrest the decline in Indonesia’s
                               terms of trade which has driven much of the deterioration in its external balances. However,
                               the base line outlook of only a moderate pick-up in global growth conditions through 2014,
                               coupled with the likelihood of tightening global liquidity conditions and more structural
                               supply-side factors placing downward pressure on prices, does not suggest a major upswing
                               in commodity prices. In addition, as noted in the October 2013 IEQ, Indonesia’s terms of
                               trade continue to suffer from the fact that global oil prices, impacting the country’s sizable
                               fuel imports, remain relatively elevated compared with non-energy commodity prices.

However, ongoing               While the expected modest increase in global growth in 2014 should be broadly positive for
policy uncertainties           Indonesia by supporting overall export demand, the international outlook continues to be
cloud the international        clouded by major policy uncertainties, keeping the risks of more adverse global growth
outlook…                       scenarios elevated. In Europe, high unemployment (12 percent for the Euro Area), large
                               output gaps, and continued credit contractions in the periphery generate deflation risks,
                               while reform fatigue may mean that the reforms necessary to boost structural growth prove
                               hard to deliver, complicating the economic recovery. In Asia, the pace and manner in which
                               ambitious structural reform efforts in China and Japan are implemented, and national
                               elections in India, will shape the outlook.

                                concern. Emerging markets, including Indonesia, therefore face tighter global liquidity
                                conditions, placing upward pressure on their external funding costs and potentially making it
                                more difficult to rely on net portfolio investment inflows to meet external financing needs.

Indonesia continued to transmission of lower commodity prices since 2011, precipitating a number of important
moderate in Q3…        economic and policy adjustments in Indonesia, and weighing on growth. The pace of
                       expansion of Indonesia’s economy has slowed down, a trend which the World Bank expects
                       to continue at least into the early part of 2014. Real GDP in the third quarter was up 5.6
                       percent yoy, marking the fifth consecutive quarter of weakening growth in year-on-year
                       terms, down from the recent high of 6.4 percent in Q2 2012 (Figure 3). In sequential terms,
                       growth in Q3 slipped to 5.0 percent qoq saar, down from 5.5 percent in the previous two
                       quarters and the recent high of 6.6 percent in Q4 2012. In contrast to real GDP, nominal
                       GDP growth picked up sharply, to 12.1 percent yoy in Q3 from 8.2 percent yoy in Q2,
                       reflecting an increase in the growth of the GDP deflator—the broadest measure of prices
                       across the economy—which had previously fallen to very low levels. This is line with the
                       sharp rise in consumer prices following the June subsidized fuel price increase (Figure 4),
                       and likely also reflects higher import prices as a result of the Rupiah depreciation.

growth…                         across quarters, has been on a downward trend since its recent peak of 12.5 percent yoy in
                                Q2 2012 (Figure 5). Building investment, which accounts for approximately 85 percent of
                                total nominal fixed investment spending, has remained resilient, in fact expanding at a rapid
                                9.5 percent pace (qoq saar) in Q3. The slowdown in overall investment has been driven by
                                the smaller but more volatile components of investment spending. Spending on foreign
                                machinery, equipment and transportation goods (together accounting for the bulk of non-
                                building fixed investment) was close to flat in Q3 compared with Q2, leaving them well
                                below their year-ago levels (with foreign machinery and equipment and foreign

subdued                        added significantly to output growth in the third quarter.

In contrast,                   Private consumption, which accounts for about 55 percent of total expenditure, continued
consumption growth             to increase strongly in Q3, by 6.9 percent qoq saar to be up 5.5 percent yoy, despite the June

                               market turbulence and currency depreciation experienced over the quarter. The resilience of
                               household spending reflects in part the positive impact of the Government’s IDR 30 trillion
                               compensation package following the fuel price increase (which began to be disbursed during
                               Q3, as discussed further in section B.1, and compares with the estimated rise in
                               consumption over the quarter of IDR 111 trillion). Other reasons likely include lags in the
                               transmission of monetary policy to the real economy, consistent with the still rapid pace of
                               credit expansion recorded through September, delays in the impacts of the asset price
                               movements seen over the quarter (which have increased import and financing costs) on
                               domestic prices, and relatively limited near-term linkages between asset prices and consumer
                               spending (that is, only modest wealth effects).

                           production side, cement sales over the available 2-month period since Ramadan (i.e.
                           September and October) were up 12.9 yoy, roughly halving from growth of over 21 percent
                           yoy seen early in 2013 (Figure 7). The HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for
                           Indonesia’s manufacturing sector suggests marginally expansionary conditions, standing at
                           50.3 for November.

…and output growth is The World Bank expects that Indonesia’s GDP growth will slow further, to 5.3 percent in
projected to slow     2014 in the base case (Table 2). Domestic demand faces headwinds from tighter financial
further               conditions, as discussed further in Section 5, but also from potentially longer-term
                      constraints due to less supportive commodity prices and terms of trade than in recent years.
                      In particular, private consumption, the mainstay of the Indonesian economy, has so far
                      remained notably resilient, but is likely to come under more strain, denting growth. The
                      investment outlook hinges on building investment, which in the face of tighter credit,
                      reduced investable funds from commodity-related profits, and increased import costs (as
                      discussed in Section 4) is also likely to slow. Election-related spending in 2014 will likely add
                      materially to domestic demand, as campaign-related activity adds to private consumption,
                      but is temporary in nature, and may in part substitute for other spending. Overall, risks to
                      the growth outlook are skewed to the downside, as discussed in Section 7.

Consumer inflation has Consumer prices have been volatile over 2013, reflecting first the impact of trade restrictions
been volatile over     on certain foods (later unwound), and then the impact of the June increase in subsidized fuel
2013…                  prices. While the direct impact of the fuel price increase has now faded and food price
                       disinflation has set in following Idul Fitri, underlying inflation pressures (as measured by
                       core CPI) have increased significantly since May. Going forward, the challenge for monetary
                       policy will be to gauge ongoing risks of higher pass-through from the exchange rate into
                       consumer prices (sometimes called “imported inflation”), and rising price expectations,
                       broadly offset by the expected continued moderation in domestic demand.

…but headline                 Consumer prices as measured by the headline consumer price index (CPI) surged by 5.5
inflation momentum is         percent from June to August, largely as a result of the 33 percent average increase in
now subdued as the            subsidized fuel prices implemented on June 22, but also the seasonal impact of Ramadan,
effects of the fuel           which this year fell in July/August. This abrupt increase in the price level has elevated year-
subsidy reform and            on-year inflation to 8.4 percent in November. However, headline inflation momentum has
Ramadan have faded…           abated since August, with the headline CPI essentially flat month-to-month over this period,
                              as transportation-related price increases have flattened out and food prices have fallen back
                              significantly from their Ramadan-related increases in the middle of the year (Figure 9).

                            yoy in August, to 12.2 percent in November.

Rice prices have            The domestic price of rice, a key component of the consumption basket of poor households
increased fairly            in Indonesia, increased by 5.1 percent yoy in November. This fairly modest increase was due
modestly, though            to relatively favorable production. Indonesia’s rice production in 2013 is estimated officially
remaining well above        to have increased by 2.6 percent following the final harvest of the year, to 70.87 million tons
international prices        (44.6 million tons on a milled basis), mainly reflecting expanded acreage, as yields are
                            estimated to have remained at 2012 highs of 5.1 tons per hectare. The modest rise in
                            domestic rice prices has also contributed to a reduction in the gap between Indonesian and
                            comparable international prices (from Thailand or Vietnam). Indonesian prices were a
                            record 90-110 percent higher (depending on quality) than international prices in June, falling
                            to 50–60 percent higher in November. The reduction of the Indonesian-international rice
                            price gap was also driven by an increase in Rupiah-denominated international rice prices
                            (including an 8 percent and 29 percent increase for medium quality rice from Vietnam in US
                            Dollar in Rupiah terms, respectively).

The pick-up in core         Although the lack of upward momentum in headline CPI is an encouraging indication that
inflation, however,         overall consumer price pressures remain contained, the recent pattern of core inflation—
suggests caution is still   which excludes volatile items such as food and fuel—argues for caution (Figure 10). Core

                            November over the previous three months, has been significant.

…especially in light of        One source of upward pressure on core inflation since May has likely been the depreciation
cost-push pressures            of the Rupiah which, while broadly supportive for Indonesia’s economic adjustment to
from the weaker                external constraints, adds to cost-push inflation pressures through the price of imported
Rupiah                         goods. Given the significant 24 percent nominal depreciation of the currency year-to-date,
                               the rise in core inflation has so far been relatively modest. However, in the absence of a
                               counterfactual, it is important to note that inflation may have been more subdued in the
                               absence of the Rupiah depreciation. It is also likely that the weaker Rupiah will continue to
                               feed into inflation with a lag, as importers may absorb higher import costs for a time in
                               order to preserve market share, but later pass on increases as a result of ongoing margin
                               erosion. Finally, with much of the Rupiah’s adjustment to date having occurred only since
                               August, it is too soon to know for sure how Rupiah depreciation will feed through into
                               inflation. As a rule of thumb, however, it is estimated that a 10 percent Rupiah depreciation
                               adds approximately 0.5 percentage points to inflation in a given quarter.

In the base case,              In the base case, inflation pressures are expected to remain contained, consistent with the
headline inflation is          weaker growth outlook, with headline inflation declining gradually through Q2 2014 to
expected to remain             approximately 7.5 percent. Headline inflation is then expected to fall sharply as the impact of
below its recent peak,         the June 2013 fuel price change drops out of the base in Q3 2014, following which headline
but core inflation             CPI should return to below the ceiling of BI’s current target band of 3.5-5.5 percent yoy.
pressures to remain on         Core inflation, however, is expected to be pushed higher in coming months (to
the rise through the           approximately 5.5 percent in Q1 2014) by the exchange rate and wage rises, including from
first half of 2014             the impact of new minimum wage increases for 2014 (including the 11 percent increase
                               agreed for the District of Jakarta). Risks to the base case expectations for inflation are
                               balanced, with the outlook depending on the interplay between Rupiah depreciation, wage-
                               setting for 2014 and temporary factors such as higher election-related spending in Q1 2014,
                               set against the weaker domestic demand growth trend and tighter financial conditions.

                    4. Indonesia’s current account deficit remains in focus, despite slowing
                       imports
External balance           Indonesia’s current account deficit showed signs of stabilizing in the third quarter, but at
pressures remain           USD 8.4 billion remained well above net direct investment of USD 5.1 billion, implying a
central to the outlook     significant “basic balance” deficit (of USD 3.3 billion in Q3). This gap highlights Indonesia’s
for Indonesia’s            continuing reliance on potentially volatile portfolio investment inflows, a potential
economy                    vulnerability that is likely to remain a strong focus for policymakers and investors. In
                           addition, although Indonesia’s overall external debt burden is low, external debt repayments
                           are significant, adding to the currency and refinancing risks faced by the Government and
                           corporate sector in the context of ongoing international financial market uncertainties. In the
                           base case, the current account balance is expected to narrow through 2014, but the modest
                           likely pace of improvement, and economic costs of import compression, argue for a
                           continued policy focus on improving export performance and supporting foreign direct
                           investment as a source of high quality external financing.

Indonesia’s current        In the third quarter of 2013, the current account deficit was USD 8.4 billion, or 3.8 percent
account deficit            of GDP (Figure 11), narrower than the USD 10 billion or 4.4 percent of GDP deficit seen in
narrowed to 3.8 percent    the second quarter. Early indications for the final quarter of 2013 are that this gradual
of GDP in Q3 from 4.4      narrowing of the deficit is set to continue, with the monthly goods trade balance, as
percent in Q2              measured by BPS, albeit volatile, returning to a small (USD 42 million) surplus in the month
                           of October.

Non-oil and gas export     The non-oil-and-gas goods trade balance returned to surplus in August after four consecutive
revenues were weak in      months of deficit, and remained positive through October (Figure 12). Non-oil and gas
Q3 but show some           exports slowed through Q3, reflecting in part further weakening in the global prices of major
signs of having picked     commodity exports in the early part of the quarter, and the dampening impact of Idul Fitri
up into Q4…                holidays on exports. Within non-oil and gas exports, manufacturing export revenues dropped
                           by 2.8 percent relative to Q3 2012 and non-manufacturing (including all major commodities
                           ex-oil and gas) export revenues were down by 8.1 percent relative to Q3 2012. Early
                           indications of export performance in the fourth quarter are encouraging, with exports across
                           the region firming, and Indonesia’s non-oil and gas export revenues rising by 2.5 percent yoy
                           in October, likely helped by improving demand from key trading partners such as the US and
                           China. As discussed in Section 2, export volumes also appear to have broadly held up
                           through the latest available, third quarter data, being up 5.3 percent yoy, showing the
                           depressing effect on export revenues of low prices and pointing to the possible rebound of
                           export revenues in coming quarters should commodity prices indeed have stabilized and
                           external demand continue to increase modestly. A significant risk to exports, however, is the
                           mooted ban on raw mineral exports, discussed in Box 1.

…while the oil and gas     Most of the weakening in Indonesia’s overall current account balance since late 2011 has
trade deficit appears      been due to the collapse of the non-oil and gas trade surplus, driven mainly by declining
largely unaffected by      commodity export prices. However, Indonesia’s monthly oil and gas trade balance also
the increase in            remains a major drag on the overall trade balance, and has moved into deficit since August
subsidized fuel prices     2012. The oil and gas trade deficit stood at USD 2.4 billion in Q2 and widened to USD 3.9
                           billion in Q3, amplified by higher holiday season-related fuel demand but also suggesting that
                           oil import demand has been relatively insensitive to the sharp increase in subsidized fuel
                           prices implemented in June. Subsequent monthly data, for October, does show a significant
                           drop in oil-and-gas imports—with the oil and gas deficit shrinking by 50 percent mom to
                           USD 750 million—but given the volatility of the monthly data this is insufficient to gauge
                           whether significant fuel import relief is now filtering through.

balance…                       in October, on a 3-month moving average basis. Consumer goods imports account for only
                               a small share of imports (7 percent of total import costs, over the 12 months through
                               October) but have been flat since August at similar levels to one year ago. Oil and gas
                               imports are the only major import category to have remained stubbornly high during Q3
                               but, as noted above, even these recorded a significant slowdown in October (Figure 13).

                            manufacturers. In addition, about 50 percent of manufactured imports into the most import-
                            heavy sectors comprises of specific inputs to production, notably chemical and metal
                            products, and equipment. Consequently, the expected ongoing moderation in manufacturing
                            and construction growth in 2014 will likely assist in continuing to lower the import bill
                            (Figure 14), but may also have implications for employment and income generation in those
                            sectors. In addition, as described in the March 2013 IEQ, there is a sizable component of
                            imported inputs used in the production of Indonesia’s non-commodity exports. Higher
                            costs of imported inputs to production—due either to ongoing Rupiah depreciation or other
                            policies aimed at import suppression—therefore may also potentially weigh on export
                            competitiveness, offsetting some of the benefits from the real exchange rate depreciation.

As the trade balance        Overall, indications are that Indonesia’s trade balances are shifting in such a way as to
adjustment plays out,       stabilize and begin to narrow the overall current account deficit. As mentioned above,
the focus on                quarterly goods and services export volumes, as measured by the national accounts, have
Indonesia’s external        held up, and goods export revenues as measured by the monthly BPS trade data increased in
financing                   year-on-year terms in October for the first time since March 2012 (albeit by a modest 2.6

to remain                   deficit which has opened up since August 2012 shows some signs of narrowing. While
                            positive for returning Indonesia’s overall external balances to a sustainable position,
                            however, import compression comes with costs, and the pace of improvement so far has
                            been gradual, keeping external financing vulnerabilities very much in focus.

Financial account           Turning to the financial account side of the balance of payments, Indonesia's capital and

turned negative…            reflecting uncertainty during the quarter regarding the timing and pace of tapering by the US
                            Federal Reserve. Weaker offshore bond issuance in Q3 also played a role. Other investment
                            recorded a deficit of USD 2.1 billion largely due to currency and deposit outflows. This
                            reversed the surplus seen in Q2, which was due to a combination of seasonal USD currency
                            inflows aimed at servicing seasonal corporate US Dollar demand.

inflows                     instruments in Q3 2013 was at its highest level since Q4 2011 in Q3, USD 1.9 billion, up
                            from USD 453 million in Q2. FDI into equity on the other hand dropped by 17 percent
                            from Q2, at USD 3.5 billion. Overall, direct investment inflows appear to be holding up in
                            the face of the weakness in global commodity prices in recent quarters and heightened
                            regulatory uncertainty in key sectors for inbound investment, especially mining. These
                            inflows, however, can be lumpy and are based on long-term decisions which are affected by
                            the policy environment, which is subject to risks as described in Section 7.

The current account         The current account deficit is projected to reach to 3.5 percent of GDP or USD 30.6 billion
deficit is projected to     in 2013 as a whole, on the back of a narrowing in the current account deficit for the fourth
narrow to 2.6 percent       quarter to approximately USD 6.4 billion (or 3.2 percent of GDP). In 2014, the current
of GDP in 2014              account deficit is projected to persist, although narrowing to USD 22.8 bn (2.6 percent of
                            GDP) supported by subdued import growth and a mild pick up in export demand (Table
                            3). This baseline view, however, remains contingent on external financing conditions being
                            sufficiently supportive, in light of the fact that Indonesia will likely continue to run a basic
                            balance of payments deficit through 2014, increasing its reliance on potentially volatile
                            portfolio investment flows. In addition, a specific additional risk to the trade balance is the
                            impact of the ban on raw mineral exports, scheduled to come into effect in January 2014
                            (Box 1).

Box 1: The potential near-term impact of the proposed ban on unprocessed mineral exports on Indonesia’s trade balance
As 2014 approaches, attention has turned to the potential impact of the proposed ban on unprocessed exports, which is set to come
into effect from January 2014. The 2009 Mining Law (UU 4/2009) requires all mining business permit (IUP) and Contract of Work
(CoW) holders to ‘add value’ to mining products through domestic refining and processing with a five year compliance horizon.
Initially set to come into force in May 2012, the proposed ban was delayed until January 2014, where based upon current regulations,
IUP and CoW holders will no longer be permitted to export mineral ores or refined products of copper, nickel, tin, bauxite and iron
ore, among others, that are below the minimum mineral content– all requiring smelting capacity.*

At the time of writing, the implementation details of the proposed ban are still under discussion. In part this reflects concerns about
the potential near-term impact on Indonesia’s mineral exports, at a time when Indonesia already faces significant external financing
pressures. Commodities account for the bulk of Indonesia’s exports, comprising roughly two-thirds of merchandise exports by value.
Exports of processed and unprocessed minerals in 2012 alone totaled USD 10.4 billion, around 5 percent of total exports. The
overall share of processed exports in mineral exports has increased steadily, from 40 percent in 2001 to 52 percent in 2012.

In broad terms, there are three direct trade channels through which the export ore ban can have an impact on Indonesia’s trade
balance. The first is a negative impact, via lower exports of unprocessed minerals. The second effect on exports (positive) would
occur if there are increased volumes of exports of processed minerals. The third effect, through imports of capital and intermediate
goods to build and operate smelters, would have a negative impact on the trade balance. Estimating these effects requires a range of
assumptions, from the future external demand for processed and unprocessed minerals through to the share of imports in the
operational and capital costs of smelters and, crucially, on the timing and scale of future investments in smelting capacity. As such,
any estimates are subject to considerable uncertainty.

A large number of smelter plans have been proposed, yet it is possible that not all the proposals that have been announced will be
built. Further, of those likely to be economically feasible, significant uncertainty persists regarding whether proposed smelters will be
operational by early 2014, especially given the long lead times required to construct smelters before commencing operations. Noting
this uncertainty, two potential scenarios may be considered, relative to a baseline where no export ban is enforced, to simulate the
potential impact of enforcing the ban on Indonesia’s trade balance, reflecting differences in the pace with which new proposed
smelting capacity comes on-line. In the first scenario all the proposed additional smelters that are considered realistic by a recent
Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI) study on this topic are built on schedule – these smelters are
due to become operational in 2014 and 2015. In the second scenario none of the new proposed smelters becomes operational within
the timelines set by the law and the export ban is enforced.

In the first scenario, where feasible smelters come online as anticipated by SEADI, the impact of the increase in processed mineral
exports on the trade balance is more than outweighed by the fall in unprocessed mineral exports, at least in 2014. Further, capital
imports to build the smelters would be expected to provide a further significant drag on the trade balance. In 2014 the ban is
projected to add an additional USD 6 billion to the trade deficit. However, from 2015, the ban would result in a relatively neutral
impact on the trade balance, relative to the baseline, as capital imports resulting from smelter construction start to tail off and gains
from higher value processed exports begin to offset the loss unprocessed mineral exports arising from the ban.

In the second scenario, where no new smelting capacity comes online, the fall in unprocessed mineral exports weighs heavily on the
trade balance, without any corresponding increase in processed mineral exports. The nominal value of lost export earnings increases
steadily each year from around USD 5 billion in 2014 to almost USD 8 billion in 2017, reflecting foregone increases in unprocessed
mineral exports over this period.

This simulation exercise demonstrates the potential significant downside risks to Indonesia’s trade balance from the ban’s
enforcement, particularly should new domestic smelting capacity be subject to significant delays, resulting in insufficient capacity to
process raw minerals onshore, with flow on impacts to mineral exports. Even in the comparatively more optimist scenario (i.e.
Scenario 1), where all smelters evaluated by SEADI as being economically feasible come online, the ban would still result in a
significant, negative shock to Indonesia’s trade balance of around USD 6 billion in 2014. Such a shock would add around 0.6
percentage points of GDP to Indonesia’s current account deficit in 2014 moving the projected current account deficit from 2.6
percent to 3.2 percent of GDP, all other things being equal. This would lead to increased external financing needs at a time when
global financing conditions become less favorable. In addition, to the extent that investors view enforcement of the ban as a further
negative signal of the quality of the domestic policy environment, this could affect portfolio and FDI capital flows (offsetting any
FDI inflows associated with any new smelting projects). Relatedly, it is important to note that the above simulations do not cover the
longer-term, potentially distortionary, implications of the ban on economic production structures nor cover a detailed assessment of
the ban’s underlying economic policy objectives or of its likely effectiveness in achieving these objectives.
*MEMR regulation 7/2012 required COW and IUP holders to formulate smelting plans, define minimum standards for domestic processing and
refining, and imposed a ban on the export of raw mineral ores within three months of the regulation (by May 2012). Partly due to lack of capacity, the
ban was subsequently pushed back by MEMR 11/2012 to January 2014. In the interim period from May 2012 to January 2014, COW holders have
been permitted to continue to export unprocessed minerals without additional restrictions. IUP holders have been permitted to continue exporting
unprocessed minerals provided they pay a 20 percent export tax and are able to renew monthly export permits.

Processing Requirements for Export”, USAID, 2013, under the SEADI project for the Indonesian Ministry of Trade

Domestic bonds and        The depreciating Rupiah, increase in short-term rates, and deceleration in output have taken
equities have             their toll on domestic bonds and equities which, after rebounding strongly from their late-
experienced renewed       August to early-September lows, have since October experienced renewed weakness. The
weakness in Q4            domestic bond market rallied strongly from mid-September until late October, but yields
                          have subsequently backed up again, returning long-term domestic interest rates to close to
                          their highest levels of the year (with the 10-year benchmark yield at 8.80 percent, an increase
                          of 350bp over the course of the year). Domestic equities initially bounced back strongly from
                          their late-August lows, but stock prices have subsequently softened, leaving the Jakarta
                          Composite Index down 2.6 percent for the year through 12 December. In October and
                          November, offshore investors remained net sellers of Indonesian equities, selling a net IDR
                          6.9 trillion worth of stocks over this period, compounding a period of sustained net selling
                          since the downturn in global risk appetite for EM assets, with a cumulative IDR 36 trillion
                          worth of Indonesian equities sold since the end of April. In contrast, offshore bond
                          investors have been significant net purchasers of bonds, with cumulative net purchases of
                          IDR 42.8 trillion worth of bonds since inflows resumed in early September (through 6
                          December), to take their holdings of total domestic government bonds to 32.5 percent

Nominal credit growth     Despite the tightening in monetary policy since June, bank lending growth has remained
remained strong           buoyant in nominal terms, up 22.2 percent yoy in October. However, it is important to note
through October,          that credit extension has been boosted by exchange rate effects, which has increased the
boosted by exchange       Rupiah value of foreign currency-denominated lending, which accounts for 15 percent of
rate effects, but has     bank credit outstanding; year on year growth in foreign currency lending in Rupiah terms has
come down in real         risen from 15 percent yoy in May to 24 percent yoy in October (Figure 17). Furthermore,
terms…                    real credit growth (deflated by contemporaneous CPI inflation) has continued to ease, to
                          12.8 percent yoy in October, from 18 percent yoy at end-2012 (Figure 18).

…and while residential    Although the most recent data point to strong growth rates, market reports now point to a
mortgage activity         tightening in property-related credit by some major banks, likely weighing on future property
accelerated in Q3         price growth. Growth in property-related credit rebounded to 30 percent year on year to
market reports point to   September, up from 20 percent in June, the fastest pace of growth since the introduction of
a tightening in           tighter loan-to-value (LTV) requirements for residential mortgages in July 2012. The recent
property-related credit   strength in property credit reflects a pickup in growth in residential mortgages, which
conditions…               account for 60 percent of total property related credit. These figures also suggest that macro
                          prudential measures to contain the pace of property lending have so far had a limited impact,
                          with Bank Indonesia having introduced further tightening in LTV ratios for residential
                          mortgages financing second and third homes in July 2013. Supported by strong property
                          lending, residential house prices continued to show robust growth through Q3; national
                          residential house prices were up 14 percent in the year to September, led by price growth in
                          smaller homes. Residential apartment price growth has eased modestly since late 2012, yet
                          remains strong at 30 percent yoy, as do rental prices for office space and sales prices of
                          industrial land.

…but credit growth is     Going forward, bank credit growth is expected to fall, to approximately 15 percent yoy in
likely to slow going      coming quarters according to World Bank projections. In October, broad money (M2)
forward…                  growth stood at 13 percent yoy, and the growth in time and savings deposits in particular
                          was 11.6 percent yoy, well down from end-2012 growth rates of close to 20 percent. The
                          aggregate loan to deposit ratio (LDR) stood at 88.9 percent in September, up from 84
                          percent at end-2012 and not far off the 92 percent ceiling of BI’s target LDR band, and
                          suggesting limited headroom for credit growth to continue to outstrip deposit growth.

                          result in a decline in the aggregate bank capital adequacy (CAR) ratio of 1.0 percent. A 20
                          percent decline in the value of government bonds would result in decline in the aggregate
                          bank CAR of 1.5 percent, with relatively larger CAR falls for state-owned and foreign banks,
                          given their relatively larger holdings of government bonds.

Non-bank financing        Beyond bank credit, access to other forms of financing has also tightened. Growth in finance
activity is also          company lending, which accounts for around 10 percent of total financial system assets, has
decelerating              slowed to 14 percent year on year to September 2013, from 32 percent growth a year earlier.
                          Non-bank lending is expected to weaken further going forward, in line with tighter domestic
                          credit conditions and higher offshore financing costs (with borrowings from foreign banks
                          accounting for 22 percent of total finance company liabilities, compared with 35 percent
                          comprising domestic bank borrowing). Corporate bond issuance has also fallen off sharply
                          since June, with issuance to end-November equivalent to only 15 percent of total issuance in

                    6. Public expenditure and tax revenue growth has slowed over 2013
The fiscal deficit        The Indonesian fiscal sector continues to be impacted by weaker international commodity
through November          prices and the depreciation of the Rupiah. Based on the outcome of the first eleven months
2013 was 50 percent       of 2013, the fiscal deficit for the full year is likely to be broadly in line with the revised 2013
larger than in the same   Budget projection, as the expected slight under-shooting of revenues is likely to be balanced
period last year…         by overall lower disbursement of expenditures (with subsidy spending in excess of the
                          targeted amount being offset by lower than targeted capital and material spending). During
                          January to November 2013, Indonesia recorded a fiscal deficit of IDR 163 trillion (or 1.7
                          percent of GDP), versus IDR 106 trillion in the same period last year. Revenue collection
                          experienced slightly higher growth over this period than in 2012, while expenditure growth
                          slowed relative to 2012 but showed higher disbursement rates (Table 5).

.. due to higher Budget   The major reason for the significantly higher fiscal deficit in the first eleven months of 2013
disbursement …            compared with the corresponding period last year was an increase in the disbursement of
                          allocated spending. This was especially the case for social spending (including the
                          completion of an unconditional cash transfer, Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat, BLSM,
                          compensation following the June increase in subsidized fuel prices) and capital spending,
                          even though social and capital spending recorded slower nominal growth overall for this
                          period in 2013 than in 2012. Budget execution rates in these areas were likely aided by the
                          fact that their allocations in the 2013 revised Budget projected modest nominal growth
                          relative to the revised 2012 Budget. Fuel subsidy spending over January-November recorded
                          a lower disbursement rate relative to the revised Budget allocation in 2013 than last year,
                          reaching 87 percent of targeted spending for this year. The likelihood is that actual fuel
                          subsidy spending in 2013 will again overshoot the revised Budget allocation (with November
                          fuel subsidy disbursement still to be added to the above figures, in addition to December).
                          Electricity subsidies have recorded slightly faster nominal yoy growth in 2013 than last year,
                          despite the phased tariff increases in 2013, and a marginally higher disbursement relative to
                          the revised Budget. However, this may reflect differences in payment schedules rather than a
                          real annual increase in spending.

… while revenue              Total revenue collection trends in the first eleven months of 2013 were broadly similar to
collection relative to       those in the same period of 2012, in terms of realization of the revised Budget target,
the Budget target was        although nominal yoy growth was slightly higher. This resulted from a moderation in growth
at a similar level to last   for tax revenue collection, to 9 percent yoy from 13.9 percent yoy in 2012, on the one hand,
year                         and a slight improvement in non-tax revenue collection on the other hand. International
                             trade taxes contracted over their year-ago level, particularly because of a decline in export tax
                             collection, consistent with subdued exports, as discussed in Section 4. Income tax collections
                             from the oil and gas sector have slowed down, whereas natural resource revenues from oil
                             and gas accelerated, with this pattern likely attributable to timing differences in the collection
                             of these two revenue types. Despite relatively robust private consumption, VAT collection
                             in the first eleven months of 2013 recorded substantially slower nominal yoy growth than
                             last year (13.6 percent against 28.5 percent respectively), as well as a lower realization against
                             the annual target. Since around 40 percent of Indonesian VAT collection comes from
                             imports, the slowdown of imports has likely contributed significantly to this weakness.

                             debt were issued, increasing the Government’s reliance on Treasury bills with a duration of 1

Economic risks to the          While the baseline expectation is for Indonesia’s economy to continue to decelerate only

significant…                   and for the current account deficit to narrow in coming quarters, these projections are
                               subject to significant uncertainty. A further abrupt deterioration in external financing
                               conditions is a particular ongoing risk, in light of Indonesia’s sizable external financing
                               needs. Such deterioration could be triggered by international market developments, or
                               specifically due to domestic economic and policy developments. This would spill over
                               negatively into real economic activity by placing further upward pressure on interest rates,
                               downward pressure on asset prices and the Rupiah, and could result in localized corporate
                               sector stresses with damaging effects on private sector confidence.

…particularly to the           Indonesia’s GDP forecasts are particularly sensitive to the investment outlook, which

also weaken more than          particularly if coupled with more asset price volatility, take their toll by eroding confidence,
anticipated…                   household income and corporate profitability. This would be a material drag on growth,
                               given that private consumption accounts for approximately 55 percent of total expenditure.

…and there is a                Overall, therefore, risks are skewed towards weaker domestic demand than in the base case.
material risk of GDP           Even mildly weaker domestic demand growth than currently anticipated (e.g. a reduction of
growth for 2014 falling        0.5 percentage points in private consumption and investment) could reduce GDP growth to
below 5 percent                below 5 percent. A more severe moderation in domestic demand (with private consumption
                               and investment growth dropping by 1 percentage point relative to the baseline), for example
                               due to an intensification of external financing constraints, could feasibly lead to GDP
                               growth in 2014 of below 4.5 percent (Table 7).

                               balance sheets by raising the Rupiah value of external debt (particularly if there are currency

                         Indonesia is therefore not to focus on import suppression through regulatory measures, but
                         rather to increase exports, and to secure more and higher quality external financing,
                         particularly FDI.

…highlighting the        Moving into 2014 and beyond, the recent, necessary focus on near-term macroeconomic
need for more policy     stability, should continue to be augmented with more steps to support a virtuous cycle of
reforms to support       strong investment, including foreign investment, and output growth. To do so, an emphasis
exports and FDI          on supporting exports to ensure that the increased international competitiveness generated
inflows…                 by the weaker Rupiah is not lost, on increasing investment efficiency, and on supporting,
                         and enhancing, FDI inflows, is needed. While FDI, in nominal terms, has so far proved
                         resilient, it is underpinned by three factors which have all come under varying degrees of
                         recent pressure: Indonesia’s huge natural resource base (undercut by generally softer global
                         commodity prices), the large and growing domestic market (undercut somewhat, at least in
                         the near-term, by headwinds to domestic demand), and Indonesia’s potential as a regional
                         production hub in Asia (undercut by regulatory uncertainties and skills and infrastructure
                         gaps). Box 2 examines the recent uneven progress on improving Indonesia’s investment
                         climate. More progress towards addressing these challenges can pay off not only in higher
                         sustainable growth in the medium-term, but also for managing near-term risks as well, by
                         supporting local and foreign investor confidence in Indonesia’s future trajectory and hence
                         external financing inflows.

…and a continued         In the fiscal sector, fuel subsidies remain a major source of fiscal risk, dent the ability of the
emphasis on              flexible exchange rate to absorb shocks (given the significant impact of a depreciation in
improving the quality    increasing fuel subsidy costs), and divert spending away from more efficient uses, including
of spending, including   needed public investment in infrastructure, social protection and health programs, for
through energy           example. As described in the October IEQ, the World Bank estimates that a 10 percent
subsidy reform           depreciation of the Rupiah increases the fiscal deficit by 0.3-0.4 percentage points of GDP,
                         largely by raising fuel subsidy costs. This stresses the importance of further reforms, such as
                         implementing a rule-based approach to determine subsidized fuel prices in such a way as to
                         limit the Government’s fiscal exposure to higher Rupiah-denominated fuel prices, while at
                         the same time improving the safety net for those least able to cope with shocks, including to
                         fuel-related prices.

Box 2: Update on the policies to improve the investment climate in Indonesia
As of the writing of this report, the implementation of the components of the August economic policy package designed to accelerate
investment has been further delayed. Three of four committed actions are outstanding: (1) expediting and simplifying investment
licensing; (2) expediting revision of the “Negative Investment List” (DNI) to make the Indonesian economy more open to foreign
investment; and (3) expediting agro-based investment programs (crude palm oil, cocoa, rattan) and metallic minerals (bauxite, nickel,
and copper) by providing tax holidays and tax allowances as incentives. For example, the mooted reduction of the required number
of licenses in the oil and gas sector from sixty-nine to eight licenses has not yet been implemented, and there are concerns that the
change will be limited to the grouping of the licenses without meaningful simplification of the procedures and time to obtain those
licenses. The revision of the implementing regulations on tax incentives, and the implementation mechanisms, are still to be
completed.
The Government continues to give conflicting messages on the progress of the DNI revision. Early in November, the Government
announced that a revised DNI was almost ready and repeated its commitment to open additional sectors to foreign investment by
opening up Private-Public Partnerships (PPPs) in infrastructure and relaxing foreign participation in several sectors (such as
pharmacies, specialized hospitals, and transport). This announcement was widely criticized by different parties in the media*, arguing
that the Government is failing to protect the national interest. Domestic business interests have also voiced their support for the
protection of selected sectors from foreign competition. The Government subsequently sought to soften the earlier announcement
by declaring that the discussion is far from final and reaffirming their commitment to protect the national interest. The discussion on
how these interests are to be balanced in a revision of the DNI continues at this time.
The protracted attempts to update the negative investment list (DNI) are indicative of a broader debate in Indonesia on the relative
importance of openness to international trade and investment for supporting Indonesia’s economic growth prospects . Despite the
Government’s announcement that updating the DNI was a policy priority, based on the latest progress, it is not clear whether the
upcoming DNI revision will in fact make it more investor-friendly and thus improve the investment climate, as intended in the
August policy package. With a national election approaching in 2014, it remains to be seen how much influence nationalist,
protectionist sentiments will exert on economic policy formation in the coming months.
Going forward, strengthening the quality of the policy formation process, for example through improving coordination mechanisms
and consultative processes and enhancing regulatory reform processes (through “whole of government” approaches and regulatory
reviews) is critical to ensure that policy uncertainty is minimized, to support the FDI inflows that help to cover Indonesia’s external
financing needs, and to ensure that Indonesia benefits as fully from FDI as it should. Strengthened policy formation processes would
also better address the legitimate concerns of Indonesians that policies be made in the broader public interest, while enabling the
Government to weigh the general public interest more effectively against more narrow business interests and requests for protection
that do not benefit the economy overall.
On a positive note, on October 25, the Government launched an ambitious policy package to improve the ease of doing business.
The announced action plan consists of seventeen actions across eight “Doing Business” areas (aligned to eight of the ten indicators in
the World Bank Group’s “Doing Business” country rankings) and is expected to be implemented by February 2014. To ensure the
implementation of this policy package, and in a signal of good coordination towards making progress on these reforms, the
Government has established a joint monitoring team with different government agencies, including the Presidential Working Unit for
Control and Supervision on Development (UKP4). The private sector has responded favorably to the announcement of the
(domestically focused) policy package, emphasizing that the reforms are urgently needed. Indonesia currently ranks 120 (out of 189
economies) in the World Bank Group’s Doing Business 2014 rankings, a slight improvement over the past few years. However, this
performance is below the regional (East Asia and Pacific) average and peer countries’ performance: Philippines, China, Thailand, and
Malaysia ranked 108th, 96th, 18th, and 6th respectively. Indonesia’s overall performance is only slightly better than India and
Cambodia.

approved by                 Budget for 2014. The approved Budget is non-expansionary and does not include any major
Indonesia’s House of        revenue or expenditure reform, except potential electricity tariff adjustment. The Budget
Representatives             projects an overall fiscal deficit of 1.7 percent of GDP (Table 8). Total revenues are
projects a deficit of 1.7   projected to reach IDR 1,667.1 trillion, an 11.0 percent increase from revised 2013 projected
percent of GDP, but         revenues—revised down slightly from IDR 1,662.5 trillion in the Government’s August

downside risks to the       trillion, a 6.7 percent increase from the projection for 2013 and a small 1.8 percent increase
revenue and                 from the initial proposal for 2014. There are, however, significant downside risks to the

The most significant        On the revenue side, the projected 11.0 percent increase in revenues comes from both tax
increase on the revenue     revenues (up 11.5 percent from those projected for 2013), and non-tax revenues (up 10.4
side is higher projected    percent from 2013, significantly higher than the 1.0 percent increase in the Government’s
sales tax/VAT receipts      August proposal). The tax-to-GDP ratio is projected to move up only slightly to 12.3
                            percent. The single most significant increase in revenues is of the sales tax/VAT, which sees
                            a 16.3 percent increase from the 2013 revised Budget level (although this is below the
                            August Budget proposal of a 22.5 percent increase). While election-related spending in 2014
                            may buoy sales tax receipts by lifting consumption spending, the evidence from the previous
                            two national elections on the possible magnitude of the effect is unclear given the differing
                            economic conditions. In addition, expected underachievement of the sales tax/VAT in 2013
                            (collection through November 2013 reached 77.9 percent of the revised 2013 Budget target)
                            contributes to the World Bank’s caution regarding the approved Budget projections.

The Government plans        On the expenditure side, a key feature of the 2014 Budget is a 28.6 percent reduction in the
to further increase         spending on electricity subsidies relative to 2013 (IDR 71.4 trillion in 2014 from IDR 100.0
electricity tariffs in      trillion in 2013). On October 1, PLN (PT Perusahaan Listrik Negara, the state-owned
2014…                       electricity company) introduced the final installment of 2013’s electricity price hike.
                            Electricity tariffs have been raised by 4.3 percent each quarter of 2013, to reach a total of
                            about a 15 percent annual increase, relative to 2012. The price adjustments have not affected
                            households with consumption of 450 to 900 VA. However, the Government has also set
                            aside an IDR 10.4 trillion contingency budget for electricity subsidies in 2014. The
                            parliament has agreed to the Government’s proposal to increase, electricity tariffs in 2014
                            for certain categories of industrial and commercial users to the cost recovery level, but the
                            detailed proposal is reportedly still being discussed . The Government is also planning to
                            remove electricity subsidies for large industrial customers, but the timing of this is still being
                            discussed.

                          trillion, IDR 10.8 trillion higher than projected under the revised 2013 Budget, reflecting
                          primarily the higher projected Rupiah market price of fuel, offsetting the impact of June’s
                          subsidized fuel price increase. Energy subsidy spending therefore remains a significant part
                          of total spending (Figure 22), at 15.0 percent of total government spending under the 2014
                          Budget (relative to 17.0 percent projected for 2013) or 22.6 percent of central government
                          spending.

Personnel spending is     The 2014 Budget also projects a 12.9 percent increase in personnel spending (from IDR
projected to rise         233.0 trillion in 2013 to IDR 263.0 trillion), reflecting a planned 6 percent increase in basic
significantly…            salaries and a 4 percent increase in pensions, and the ongoing bureaucratic reform process in
                          the fourteen line ministries (through which the line ministries will receive additional funding
                          to increase basic salaries). Material expenditures in 2014 are projected to increase by 6.4
                          percent compared to the target in the revised 2013 Budget, despite a planned decrease of
                          operational spending. Social spending is budgeted to increase by 13.9 percent, to IDR 91.8
                          trillion in 2014, including spending on the new social security system (SJSN, Sistem Jaminan
                          Sosial Nasional) in the amount of IDR 19.9 trillion. The phasing out of the temporary cash
                          transfer (BLSM) at the end of 2013, however, limits the increase in overall social spending.

…while capital            Capital spending is targeted to reach IDR 184.2 trillion, down 2.2 percent from the revised
spending is targeted to   2013 allocation. This is a notable development given the previous sizeable annual increases
reach a modest 1.8        in the budget allocations to capital spending, although raising disbursement rates would
percent of GDP            allow room for larger increases in actual nominal spending than in the budget allocation.
                          Relative to GDP, this targeted level of spending is only 1.8 percent, the same level as in
                          2012. Though this level of capital spending appears relatively modest comparing to the
                          pressing needs to address Indonesia’s infrastructure gaps, budget execution challenges have
                          been the main constraints in delivering infrastructure projects.2

The World Bank            The World Bank projects that the fiscal deficit in 2014 will be 2.1 percent of GDP, based on
projects a somewhat       less favorable macroeconomic assumptions to those in the Budget (Table 8). Given the
larger deficit of 2.1     uncertain effect of the elections on boosting consumer spending, and the projected further

                               total nominal revenues will grow by 9.7 percent relative to 2013, which is below the
                               Government’s nominal growth target of 11 percent. In addition, the weaker Rupiah puts
                               further pressure on expenditures, especially through fuel subsidies; as highlighted in the
                               October 2013 edition of the IEQ. As a result, a reduction in the total cost of fuel subsidies is
                               not expected to be achieved in 2014 compared with 2013 despite the June 2013 increase in
                               subsidized prices, as anticipated savings have been eroded by higher Rupiah-denominated
                               fuel prices. Depending on the trends in international fuel prices and the exchange rate, the
                               possibility of overshooting the target in 2014 cannot be ruled out.

The Medium-Term                The approved Budget for 2014 also includes an updated Medium-Term Budget Framework
Budget Framework               (MTBF) over the period 2015-2017, which projects a move to an overall budget surplus by
projects reaching              2016 (Table 10) and a further decline in debt-to-GDP to 23 percent. The Government
overall surplus by             expects to continue with the net negative flow of official foreign financing. This expected
2016…                          fiscal outlook is supported by an optimistic economic growth target range moving above 7
                               percent of GDP in 2015 and beyond, coupled with a stable inflation rate (3-5 percent) and
                               an exchange rate of up to 10,000 Rupiah per USD. Oil production is expected to increase

                               gradually during the next three years, though projections are downgraded from those in the
                               MTBF in the 2013 Budget (1,010 - 1,030 thousand barrels per day in 2016). Total nominal
                               revenues are expected to grow by 13 percent on average between 2015 and 2017, while
                               expenditures are planned to fall gradually as a share of GDP, from almost 18 percent of
                               GDP to slightly over 16 percent by 2017.

…a target which may            In light of the recent moderation in economic growth and the World Bank’s base case
prove difficult to             expectations, the macroeconomic projections in the updated MTBF appear difficult to
achieve                        achieve. In addition, the move to a budget surplus of 0.2 percent of GDP by 2016 will likely
                               be very difficult, as it requires a reduction of spending by 2 percentage points, and an
                               increase in revenues of 1 percentage point, of GDP relative to the 2013 revised Budget
                               figures. The latter may be feasible, but a 2 percentage point reduction in spending would be
                               a challenge given limited discretionary space, except if achieved through reducing subsidies,
                               which would require major reform. Given Indonesia’s development needs, working towards
                               improving the spending mix while increasing the level of revenue-to-GDP share may be
                               preferable to reducing total spending in order to achieve a positive fiscal balance.

Contributing factors to            There are a number of reasons for slowing poverty reduction. One important factor is that
this slowdown are that             as poverty in Indonesia approaches 10 percent, the remaining poor households are further
the remaining poor are             and further below the poverty line (Figure 24), meaning that higher consumption growth is
increasingly harder to             required in order to maintain the annual rate of poverty reduction as in the past. At the same
reach, and that                    time, the poor and vulnerable have participated less in recent economic growth than

Box 3: BLSM, Susenas and measuring poverty
With higher food and non-food prices due to the rise in subsidized fuel prices in June 2013 expected to adversely affect poor and
vulnerable households in the short term, the Government of Indonesia prepared a compensation package totaling IDR 29.05 trillion
or about 74 percent of the total fuel subsidy savings. It included two main components: (a) the Special Compensation Program
(Program Kompensasi Khusus), and (b) the Social Protection Acceleration and Expansion Program (Program Percepatan dan Perluasan
Perlindungan Sosial, P4S) (see the June 2013 IEQ for further discussion). A key component of the P4S was an unconditional cash
transfer (Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat, BLSM) in the amount of IDR 150,000 per household per month for a duration of
four months, provided to 15.5 million households in two payments.

The BLSM was intended to prevent a temporary increase in poverty due to the temporary increase in poverty basket inflation as a
result of the increase in subsidized fuel prices. The World Bank projects that instead of an increase to 12.1 percent poverty in
September 2013, which would have occurred without the BLSM, poverty will have continued to fall. The extent of that fall, as
measured in the September SUSENAS (the national socio-economic survey conducted by BPS, from which poverty estimates are
made) depends on a number of factors. In particular, the timing of BSLM disbursements, and how this money is used, will have a
significant effect on how much BLSM affects measured poverty.

The SUSENAS consumption module asks households detailed question about food and non-food consumption. For various food
commodities consumption over the last week is asked for, and for non-food commodities the survey asks for consumption over the
last three months. SUSENAS was conducted over September 2013. The first tranche of benefits was disbursed in July and August. If
this was spent on food, it would not be counted in SUSENAS, as it did not happen in the week before the survey. If this was spent
on non-food, then it would be counted as occurring in the last three months, but could be reported with recall error by respondents.
If the money was used instead for debt repayment or savings, then it would not be captured by the survey at all, which asks only
about consumption. The second tranche was disbursed in September, at the same time as SUSENAS was conducted. Whether the
money was received before the survey will determine whether it is picked up by the survey.

What does past experience with BLSM’s predecessor (Bantuan Langsung Tunai, BLT) tell us about how households respond? In its
2012 Social Assistance Program and Public Expenditure Review series, World Bank analysis reports that the money was generally consumed
within one week of receipt (meaning the timing of the disbursements relative to the survey matters considerably), and that it was
generally spent on basic necessities – food, as well as non-food items such as clothing or education expenses. The 2008-09 experience
of the BLT saw a greater amount spent on education, as the disbursement was just before the beginning of the school year, whereas
in 2005-06 more was weighted towards food. With the two disbursements in 2013 being just after the beginning of the school year,
covering Ramadan, and leading up to Lebaran, households are likely to have consumed more and saved less, but whether this was on
food or non-food is unclear.
Note: For further analysis of the BLT experience see World Bank. 2012. Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT) temporary unconditional cash transfer.

The use of the BLSM              This year has been characterized by slowing growth and higher inflation. In particular, the
unconditional cash               year-on-year increase in the poverty basket price index (a measure of the price of a basket of
transfer to compensate           goods and services commonly consumed by the poor) in the third quarter of 2013 was 8.8

households for June’s            increase in the cost of living for the poor likely to have been higher than increases in
fuel price increase will         household earnings or wages, the September 2013 poverty rate would have been expected to
likely prevent a short-          increase. Applying the macroeconomic outcomes to a household micro-data model of
term increase in the             poverty in Indonesia, and abstracting from the impact of the compensation package
September 2013 poverty           associated with the subsidized fuel price increase, the September poverty rate is projected to
rate                             have been 12.1 percent, a 0.4 percentage point increase on September 2012 (and 0.7 points
                                 on March 2013). However, the poverty rate should benefit in the short-term from the
                                 temporary impact of the BLSM payments in the middle of the year, which saw two
                                 payments of IDR 300,000 to 15.5 million households in July/August and September. As a
                                 consequence, the temporary increase in inflation is likely to be offset by the temporary
                                 increase in income for poor and vulnerable households, and the World Bank projects that
                                 the September poverty rate will indicate a fall in poverty. Whether this decline is small or
                                 substantial depends on the timing of the disbursements, how the money is used, and when
                                 household consumption is surveyed (see Box 3).

However, the                The temporary BLSM payments will not affect the longer-run poverty trend, as they lasted
Government’s target         for only four months. With poverty as of March 2013 at 11.4 percent, even if the rate of
poverty rate of 8-10        poverty reduction returns to 1 percentage point per year, the Government’s 2014 target of 8-
percent in 2014 is likely   10 percent (RPJM 2009-14) would be missed. Moreover, slowing growth (projected by the
to be missed…               World Bank to be 5.1 percent year-on-year to March 2014) and high inflation (7.2 percent
                            year-on-year to March 2014) mean achieving even a 1 percentage point reduction in the year
                            to March 2014 is unlikely. The World Bank’s poverty model projects the March 2014
                            poverty rate to be 11.0-11.1 percent (0.3-0.4 points lower than March 2013), indicating a
                            further slowing of poverty reduction.

…although depends in        However, the expansion of long-term social assistance which began in the third quarter of
part on the uptake of       2013 (see following discussion) could affect this outcome. In addition to the temporary
the recent expansion of     BLSM, the Social Protection Acceleration and Expansion Program, P4S (see Box 3 and IEQ
long-term social            July 2013), also included a significant expansion in benefits of two long-term social
assistance programs         assistance programs – a conditional cash transfer program and a cash transfer program for
                            poor students Significant uptake of these programs (as well as the timing of disbursement –
                            see Box 3) could result in faster poverty reduction, and possibly mean the 2014 poverty
                            target may be met. However, significant uptake is more likely in the second half of 2014.

Continued poverty           Indonesia has historically spent less on social assistance as a percent of GDP (roughly 0.5
reduction will require      percent) compared to other countries in the region (1.0 percent) and middle-income
continued expansion of      countries in general (1.5 percent).4 While the recent expansion in long-term programs
social assistance…          mentioned is welcome progress, commitment to the ongoing growth of social assistance will
                            be required to help speed up poverty reduction. As importantly, getting implementation
                            right for these programs will also determine their effectiveness as poverty reduction tools.5.

…with the Government        The Conditional Cash Transfer program (Program keluarga Harapan, PKH) was expanded
recently significantly      from 1.1 million beneficiary households to 2.4 million in 2013, with a further expansion in
expanding its               2014 to 3.2 million planned. At the same time, average benefit levels will increase from
conditional cash            IDR 1.4 million to IDR 1.8 million per year per household. This increase in benefits is likely
transfer program…           to improve appreciably the adequacy of program benefits in off-setting the costs of health
                            and educational services for poor families.

…and cash transfer          Similarly, eligibility among poor students for cash transfers (Bantuan untuk Siswa Miskin,
program for poor            BSM) will almost double in 2013 from 8.7 million to 16.6 million beneficiaries. However, its
students                    effect on poverty will depend on the uptake of the program by students in poor households.
                            The benefit levels will also significantly increase: primary school (SD) benefits will increase
                            from IDR 360,000 to IDR 450,000 per year per student, while junior secondary (SMP)
                            benefits will increase from IDR 550,000 to IDR 750,000 per year per student.

The Government also         Other permanent social assistance programs were also modified under P4S, but only on a
scaled up temporarily       temporary basis, which is likely to imply only modest impacts on poverty reduction in the
the Raskin rice subsidy     long run. Under the Rice Subsidy for the Low-Income Group program, (Subsidi Beras bagi
for low-income group        Masyarakat Berpendapatan Rendah, or Raskin), beneficiary households were able to purchase an
program, although this      additional 15 kg of rice per month for three months (June, July, and August), at heavily
continues to face           subsidized rates. This second allotment was in addition to the original allocation of 15 kg of
delivery challenges         rice beneficiaries were eligible to purchase per month. However, due to challenges in the
                            Raskin delivery system, at-risk households were likely only able to purchase much less
                            subsidized rice than has been allocated to them through the compensation program. This
                            affects the de facto benefit households receive through the Raskin program, and lessens
                            program benefits and impact. (See the World Bank’s 2012 Social Assistance Program and Public
                            Expenditure Review for a longer treatment of Raskin delivery challenges).

                 1. The labor market in Indonesia: recent achievements and challenges
Indonesia has been         Indonesia’s labor market has shown a continuous recovery since the mid-2000s, after the
successful at creating     downturn following the 1997/1998 East Asian financial crisis, and its performance in terms
jobs, now its              of increase in employment rate has been among the strongest in the East-Asia Pacific region.
expanding labor            Indonesia’s success in generating employment is explained mainly by sustained economic
market has to address      growth, a favorable economic environment, and a rapidly expanding service sector. This has
several challenges…        led to a gradual increase in service sector jobs and formalization of the economy, particularly
                           in urban areas, largely through the increase in paid dependent employment. Despite these
                           encouraging developments, Indonesia faces challenges in creating more and better jobs as
                           the country continues its structural transformation (i.e., the movement of workers from
                           poorly productive to highly productive activities). This section provides an overview of the
                           recent achievements in Indonesia’s labor markets and outlines the main challenges faced.

…such as expanding         Specifically, three main challenges should be addressed. First, the largest economic sectors in
employment growth in       terms of employment are still low value added, and job creation since 2001 has been driven
higher productivity        by the expansion of low productivity sectors. Second, the informal sector remains large,
sectors and to address     employing more than 50 percent of total workers, with informal jobs paying lower wages,
still high levels of       providing less stability and not giving access to benefits. Third, investments in higher
informality and            productivity sectors are hampered by the limited availability of skilled workers. If such
shortages of skilled       challenges remain unaddressed, there is a risk that the recent welfare gains might be
workers                    undermined, with a consequent slowdown in poverty reduction and increase in inequality.

Indonesia’s labor force,   According to the most recent data available from the February 2013 Sakernas labor force
the 4th largest in the     survey, out of a population of 175 million people aged over 15, Indonesia’s total labor force
world, reached 121         was 121 million, of which 114 million are employed (Figure 26). Since February 2006, the
million workers in early   labor force participation rate to the total working age population increased slowly but
2013 and employment        steadily, rising from 66.7 percent to 69.2 percent, while, over the same period, the share of
is expanding…              the employed to the working age population rose faster, from 59.0 percent to 65.1 percent,

                              reaching its mid-1990s levels. Consistently, between 2006 and 2012, the elasticity of
                              employment to (real value-added) growth6 has reached 0.56 (meaning that a 1 percent
                              increase in real value added translates into a 0.56 percent increase in employment, on average
                              across sectors, over the period), against 0.47 registered between 2001 and 2005, and 0.79
                              registered in the early 1990s, with an average estimated elasticity equal to 0.5 between 1990
                              and 2012 (and not significantly different from 0 during the 1998-99 crisis). In addition to
                              such a positive employment trend, the total unemployment rate has been continuously
                              declining (from 10.4 percent in February 2006 to 5.9 percent in February 2013). The
                              aggregate unemployment rate, however, remains a relatively less telling labor market
                              indicator in Indonesia, as in other similar middle-income countries, given the high level of

in employment rates            associated with the rise in formality, with 72 percent of jobs created in urban areas being
persist                        formal. The increase in formalization can be also explained by the rise in the number of
                               salaried employees (or dependent workers), which contributed to almost 70 percent of total
                               job creation (Figure 30). At the geographic level, although some convergence of Provincial
                               level employment rates towards the national level can be observed over the last decade,
                               important differences can still be registered between areas with high employment rates (over
                               75%) such as Bali and Papua (whose performance is likely to be explained by the natural
                               resources extraction industries boom, in particular palm-oil), and districts with persistently
                               low employment rates (slightly above 55%) such as North Sulawesi and Aceh.

                                 7 According to the new definition of informality adopted by BPS since 2001, informal workers are

                                 defined according to a combination of characteristics related to the “Status of employment" and
                                 “Occupation“. “Occupation” includes 9 categories: Professional, Technical and Related Workers,
                                 Administrative and Managerial Workers, Clerical and Related Workers, Sales Workers, Services
                                 Workers, Agricultural & Forestry Workers Fishermen & Hunters Production, Transportation and
                                 Unskilled Workers, Others. “Status of Employment” includes 7 categories: Own Account, Employer
                                 assisted by temporary worker(s), Employer assisted by permanent worker(s), Employee, Casual
                                 worker in agricultural sector, Casual worker in non-agricultural sector, Unpaid family worker.
                                 Informal workers are defined as: all unpaid family workers; all casual workers and own-account (or
                                 self-employed) workers, except those working as Professional, Technical and Administrative and
                                 Managerial Workers, Clerical and Related Workers; employers assisted by temporary worker(s) in
                                 agriculture and other occupations. The main change with respect to the old definition, is that before
                                 2001 there was no “casual worker” category in the Sakernas, so casual workers in agriculture and
                                 construction were included in the formal sector as salaried employees.

Employment growth                 The flip side of the above encouraging labor market developments, however, is that low-
occurred mostly in low-           labor productivity sectors (with labor productivity defined as value added divided by the
value-added, low-                 number of workers), with a lower share of workers with tertiary education, still dominate
skilled sectors                   employment, and that employment creation has been mainly concentrated in low-
                                  productivity, non-skill-intensive sectors. Of the total employment growth seen over 2001 to
                                  2012, 30 percent occurred in community, social and personal services (where 6.9 million new
                                  jobs were created), and 28 percent in wholesale, trade and retail (5.7 million). Manufacturing
                                  contributed only to 16 percent of total growth (3.3 million), slightly above construction (14
                                  percent, corresponding to 2.9 million new jobs). The negative correlation between
                                  employment growth and productivity growth between 2001 and 2012 (Figure 31), seems to
                                  suggest that job creation has not been fully productivity enhancing, and that there is room
                                  for improving the efficiency of labor reallocation from agriculture to industry and services
                                  and from low to high productive activities both within and across sectors.

                                  down to trade and retail, is marked, again reflecting differences in skill intensities.

                          b.    “Good jobs” rising, but many workers remain informal and vulnerable

Although “good jobs”            The presence of a large informal sector still employing more than 50 percent of total
are increasing, more            workers (70 percent in rural areas) remains one of the most serious challenges for the
than 50 percent of total        Indonesian labor market. Although the share of “good jobs” in total employment (defined
employment is still             here simply as the share of formal dependent employees) rose from 27.7 percent to 36.4
informal and                    percent between August 2001 and August 2012 (Figure 33), a large share of the employed
vulnerability remains           pool is still highly vulnerable, including nearly 18 million unpaid family workers and some
high for many workers           11.5 million casual workers (16 percent and 10 percent of total employment, respectively). In
                                addition, a decrease in the number of casual workers in agriculture has been offset by the rise
                                of casual workers in non-agriculture sectors, and although the number of employers with
                                permanent workers is increasing, those with temporary workers still represent 82 percent of
                                total employers. Finally, workers on own account (or self-employed in a strict sense), which
                                are more likely to be vulnerable and low-productivity, although declining in number, still add
                                up to some 18.5 million (17 percent of total employment). Vulnerable forms of work offer
                                less protection against risk and shocks, do not enable access to social benefits, and provide
                                lower income. For example, as of August 2012, casual workers and self-employed average
                                earnings amount to 48 percent and 65 percent of employees’ average wage, respectively,
                                compared to 45 percent and 75 percent as of 2001, which could explain part of the overall
                                rise in inequality seen in Indonesia over this period.

There is a high                 The incidence of vulnerable forms of employment shows a high variation across sectors and
variation in the share          provinces, also because of persistent non-compliance with Minimum Wages policies (see the
of vulnerable workers           December 2012 IEQ). Data constraints limit the possibility of assessing the impact on
across sectors and              employment of the spike in Minimum Wages levels across provinces in 2013, (in Jakarta, the
geographic areas                increase was over 40 percent). However, the Sakernas data show that as of 2012, the largest
                                employment sectors (Wholesale and retail trade, and Community, Social and Personal
                                Services ) exhibit high shares of workers paid below minimum wages: 50 percent and 45
                                percent respectively, which rise dramatically for informal workers (80 percent and 86
                                percent, respectively). These figures are even higher in agriculture, where nearly 80 percent
                                of all workers are paid below the Minimum Wage. At the provincial level, non-compliance is
                                above 60 percent in West Nusa Tenggara and West Sulawesi (over 75 percent for informal
                                workers), and close to or above 50 percent in other 12 provinces (including Jakarta and
                                Yogyakarta, and particularly high in Lampung, Aceh, South Sulawesi and South Kalimantan).

                           c. Coping with a largely unskilled labor force

Indonesia’s workforce            Nearly 50 percent of Indonesia’s workforce still possesses at most elementary education,
remains largely                  while only 6.3 percent has a university, or 4-year diploma, degree (Figure 34). This is despite
unskilled, with only 6.3         the substantial progress Indonesia made in increasing enrolment rates in secondary and
percent with tertiary            tertiary education for the youngest generations, and the rise in the share of the labor force

                                 and 2012. A low-skilled labor force represents a serious challenge for improving productivity
                                 and for meeting employers’ demands in a rapidly changing labor market, in particular given
                                 the low propensity of Indonesian firms towards providing training. As a result of this
                                 mismatch problem, a dramatic share, over 40 percent, of youth aged 15-24, remains out of
                                 education, training or work as of 2012 (Figure 35), without showing improving trends since
                                 2001, which can seriously undermine their possibility to find good jobs in the future.

                     a. A brief history of community-driven development in Indonesia

Indonesia’s flagship      The year 2013 marks fifteen years of implementation of the Indonesia National Community
community-driven          Empowerment Program (Program Nasional Pemberdayaan Masyarakat, PNPM), the largest
development program,      CDD program in the world. Since its initiation in 1998 as the Kecamatan Development
PNPM, was grounded        Program (KDP), PNPM has operated based on the tenet that the local community has the
in community capacity     capacity to identify, prioritize, select and implement development projects that best meet
…                         their needs in improving their well-being.9 This principle was informed by the first Local
                          Level Institutions Study (LLI1), carried out in 1996 by the World Bank.

…following a study        Reflecting the growing focus of the global development community on local institutions and
which found that while    social capital at that time, the LLI1 was conducted with the objective of understanding the
communities still had     role of local level institutions and social capital in the delivery of basic services and welfare
capacity for collective   improvement. The study – carried out in 48 villages in 3 provinces (Central Java, Jambi,
action to solve their     Nusa Tenggara Timur) – found that, despite the fact that Indonesia at that time was still
common problems,          under a highly centralized, authoritarian regime, local capacity – defined as the ability to
this was undermined       solve common problems collectively – remained strong in most of the study villages. This
by top-down               capacity, however, was constantly undermined by local governments, which delivered top-
government                down development projects that did not take into account specific needs at the local level.10
development policies      These findings paved the way for the design and implementation of the KDP, which
and projects that did     provided local communities with alternative open spaces for deliberating their development
not take into account     needs and resources to carry out chosen projects. Barely a year after KDP started, Indonesia
local needs               underwent massive political changes with the demise of the Suharto regime in 1998 and the
                          beginning of decentralization era in 2001

Democratization and       The dawn of democracy and decentralization raised the question of what impacts these
decentralization began    changes would have on local capacity and the relationship between the State and society. In
opening the space to      particular, would the opening up of political space bring better opportunities for the local
improve relationships     community to be involved in decision-making over development projects and thus improve

                           over development projects, although most projects still did not deliver satisfactory
                           outcomes. For example, incidents of protests against village heads increased, but without
                           typically precipitating any real or lasting changes. New elected village councils (BPD, Badan
                           Perwakilan Desa), which were tasked to hold village government accountable, began to
                           operate in some areas, although confusion over their functions and limitations in terms of
                           operational support somewhat limited their ability to perform.11 This perceived lack of
                           change, however, was not entirely unexpected considering that the study was conducted only
                           a few years after the economic and political turmoil of 1997/1998, and around the time of
                           the 2001 decentralization reforms.

…but have the changes More than a decade after the political shift in 1998, decentralization in 2001, and the
been sustained after  implementation of KDP/PNPM in over 60,000 villages, these changes were expected to
more than a decade?   affect local capacity. To better understand these changes, a third round of the LLI Study was
                      conducted in 2012, with the objective of tracing developments in local capacity since LLI2,
                      over a decade before, and to determine whether there had been shifts in the influence of
                      different community groups over government decision-making, project implementation, and
                      state resources at the district and village levels, and whether these shifts have any link with
                      changes in local capacity.

                      b. Understanding changes in local capacity since 2001

The LLI studies collect    In the LLI studies, local capacity is defined as the ability to solve common problems
data on the type and       collectively. To measure this, the studies collect and trace data on the type and number of
number of common           common problems existing in study villages and investigate whether those problems were
problems, if they were     addressed collectively and, if so, whether successfully. Villages are then grouped into three
addressed and, if so,      categories of capacity (high, medium, low) based on the frequency of collective actions and
whether successfully       degree of success in addressing problems. Box 4 provides an overview of the survey
                           methodology.

Communities report         In order to trace changes in capacity since LLI2, the LLI3 study first tabulated the numbers
fewer social problems      and type of problems found in study villages and then looked at how many problems have
in 2012 than in 2001,      been successfully solved collectively. The study finds that communities experienced fewer
but more economic          common problems compared to LLI2 and that the nature of the problems has shifted. In
and service delivery       particular, communities reported more economic and service delivery-related problems,
problems                   while social problems (such as gambling and drinking) were barely mentioned. There is also
                           an apparent increase in “overwhelming” problems that are difficult to solve at the local level
                           such as natural disasters and high prices of inputs for agricultural production.

Overall, the likelihood    The number of collective actions to solve common problems declined in all study areas. This
of a community             could partly be explained by the increasing number of “overwhelming” problems that are
successfully resolving a   beyond a community’s capacity to address. The degree of success in solving common
problem was                problems, the study finds, remains largely the same as in LLI2. These general patterns,
unchanged but there        however, mask the substantial variation in changes of capacity across surveyed villages. Of
was substantial            the twenty villages revisited in LLI3, almost half (nine) retain similar capacity. In particular,
variation in the           more than half of the high capacity villages, as classified by LLI2, have built on their earlier
changes in capacity        successes in addressing more recent problems, showing persistence. This suggests that high
across villages            capacity villages are resilient, even in the face of the political shifts faced during the past
                           decade.

Villagers’ own efforts     A quarter of surveyed villages (five) had increased their capacity. It is particularly
supported by reformist     encouraging that all but one of the villages with improved capacity were low capacity villages
village leaders have       in LLI2. Low capacity villages, by definition, have a history of not mobilizing collectively,
helped to improve          and their increased capacity appears to have been driven mostly by villagers’ own efforts,

                               engaging various mechanisms to hold village leaders accountable . Other factors that also
                               reinforce the community’s efforts in these villages are reformist village leaders who listen to
                               and work for villagers’ interests and, to a lesser extent, external agents such as non-
                               governmental organizations (NGOs), especially related to land and forest use disputes.

Persistent problems            About a third of villages (six) experienced a decline in capacity. These villages suffer from
with issues related to         persistent problems with issues relating to deteriorating natural resources, such as access to
deteriorating natural          drinking water and land disputes. There are also signs of reduced reciprocity (gotong-royong) in
resources, such as             these villages, signaling a decrease in social capital. Three of the villages that experienced
access to drinking             declines in capacity were villages that experienced a status change from village (desa) to urban
water or land disputes,        ward (kelurahan). This means that these villages no longer have elected village heads who are
exacerbated by non-            accountable to the villagers.12 In addition, most village heads in the remaining three villages
reformist leaders              are weak (unable to implement decisions), and having unresponsive leaders who do not
destroy local capacity         work in villagers’ interests is one of the main factors causing decline in village capacity.

districts in NTT represent Eastern Indonesia, which is more arid, less densely populated, and has lower than average incomes.
Village research sites were chosen to capture upland and lowland communities with varying access to the sub-district capital. In
LLI2, only 40 villages were revisited because TTS was at that time inaccessible for security reasons. In the latest, third, round of LLI,
20 villages were revisited for qualitative data collection while quantitative data collection was conducted in all 40 villages from LLI2.
Table 11 shows the comparison of key research aspects of the three rounds of LLI.

For the qualitative component of the studies, researchers conducted interviews with relevant key informants at district and village
levels, such as the district head (or secretary), officials from district offices (planning, rural/community development), district
parliament (DPRD, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah) members, NGOs/CSOs, village heads, representatives from community
empowerment bodies (BPM, Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat/LPM, Lembaga Pemberdayaan Masyarakat) and religious/adat/community
figures. The interviews helped collect data on, among others, problem solving; leadership, network and institutional profiles; as well
as projects profiles (including PNPM). The studies also conducted a series of focus group discussions (FGDs) with community
members. Topics of the FGDs included (1) land use, power relations, and natural resources threats, (2) production, consumption,
threats to survival and getting ahead, (3) Government role and relations, and (4) problem-solving.

For the quantitative component, the studies conducted a panel household survey, including modules on household characteristics and
consumption, household involvement/membership in organizations (formal and informal) and the benefits, common problems that
households faced in their areas, patterns of ownership of land and other resources, social interaction and trust, recent crises and crisis
resolution mechanism, village government (satisfaction, transparency and accountability).

                       c. Democratization, decentralization, CDD and local capacity…

Democratization has        With democratization, village heads are democratically elected by villagers. During the
enabled villagers to       Suharto era candidates had to obtain the approval of the district government to be able to
choose reformist, pro-     run and be inaugurated. Elections now take place periodically and candidates are not
community village          imposed by supra-village governments. Further, term limits, involving a maximum of two 6-
heads that support         year terms, for village heads have been enforced post-2001. The democratization also helps
local capacity…            reduce space for dynastic leadership, which was common in the past, and has broadened
                           candidate slates.

…and provided new          Free elections have made village heads more responsive to villagers’ interests and seen them
prominence for village     play a stronger role in solving identified collective problems. Strong village heads can be
heads, enabling them       more effective in dealing with external actors (e.g., investors) and supra-village governments
to play a bigger role in   to solve community problems. For example, one village head in the study area participated in
problem solving            a network of thirty village heads to have the repair of the provincial road passing their
                           villages approved just before the re-election of the incumbent governor, demonstrating a
                           strong organizational ability to obtain benefits from the district level. Another village head
                           mobilized his network, including working with regional and national NGOs, to reclaim
                           villagers’ land from concessions issued by the central government (although, unfortunately,
                           villagers also suspected that he disproportionately benefited from this effort).

Decentralization has       The strength of the village head position is increased further by the fact that decentralization
increased village          gives village heads direct access to district heads (bupati) and the district sectoral offices
heads’ access to           which manage large funds from the central government. Previously, this contact was
district-level             intermediated through the sub-district. However, in order to obtain funds (and projects)
resources…                 from the district, village heads have to be pro-active and have good networks, visiting
                           sectoral offices and the Parliament and actively seeking support for projects. Village heads
                           with limited networks have to rely on the formal process of annual development planning
                           (Musrenbang, Musyawarah Perencanaan Pembangunan) to obtain projects, a process which some
                           village heads see as an unproductive formality. This benefits village heads who can exploit
                           the additional direct, and sometimes informal, access provided by decentralization.

…but without control       Strengthening village heads does not, however, translate directly to strengthening the village
mechanisms, villagers      community, especially when control mechanisms are lacking to pressure village heads to
are unable to pressure     work for the community’s interests. These can be seen in villages with strong village heads
village heads to work      but low in capacity. Communities in these villages have not been able to capitalize on
for the community’s        changes in the political environment and demand that village heads work for the
interests                  community’s interests. These villages mainly rely on elections to oust unresponsive leaders at
                           the end of their terms. Higher capacity villages, however, are able to make village heads use
                           their stronger position to solve community problems and to hold village heads accountable
                           through mechanisms such as customary laws and traditions (adat) or the BPD that has
                           retained its original role as found in LLI2.

The weakening of the       The BPD was first mandated in Law 22 of 1999 on Regional Government, as a village

                           now Badan Permusyawaratan Desa, or village consultation council and the members are
                           appointed by consensus and essentially have no power over the village head. These changes
                           also reduce villagers’ ability to monitor the village head and to ensure that village
                           government is working for the broader collective interest, rather than for exclusive
                           individual or elite benefits.

                           The BPD as conceived in 1999 proved to be an effective accountability mechanism in the
                           subset of villages where the council had time to operate before it was weakened by the 2004
                           legislation. A small number of villages in Central Java for example, have retained the BPD’s

                           communities, the BPD and adat institutions have enhanced local capacity by channeling
                           villagers’ needs to officials and ensuring that village government is working to address
                           identified community priorities.

and corruption             example, the village head built a new, expensive village hall, the idea of which was conceived
                           in his first term but was blocked by the BPD in 2001. To finance the hall he used the village
                           development budget, reportedly coerced villagers into giving financial contributions, and
                           reportedly even denied poor households their subsidized rice to help pay for construction.

CDD projects work          The LLI3 study also sheds light on the influence of CDD programs on local capacity.
better in higher           Participatory projects could potentially be one means to improve local capacity by providing
capacity villages rather   space for collective decision-making to solve local problems and by increasing
than improving             accountability. However, while LLI3 villagers report higher satisfaction, more transparency,
governance in lower        and better maintenance for PNPM relative to other non-CDD projects, levels of
capacity villages          participation in village development planning have not increased overall. In particular, in
                           villages with lower capacity, CDD projects have not facilitated improvement in participatory
                           decision-making and governance. High-capacity villages, on the other hand, are better able
                           to take advantage of the open planning and decision-making in these projects to solve some
                           of their collective problems.

                      d. …and the importance of enhanced checks and balances at the village level

Stronger checks and        Overall, the LLI3 study suggests that local capacity in the sampled villages in Indonesia has
balances mechanisms        been largely maintained, with high capacity villages being able to capitalize on the
at the village level and   opportunities brought forth by changes in national policies. Some low capacity villages have
a better strategy in       been able to improve their capacity organically by addressing resource constraints and using
CDD projects is            existing control mechanisms to hold village government accountable. These villages have
needed to help support     also benefited from democratization, which allows villagers to elect reformist, pro-
local capacity             community village heads that work for villagers’ interests, and from decentralization, which
                           gives reformist village heads direct access to the district to obtain the support needed to
                           solve identified problems. However, some villages have experienced capacity declines, being
                           unable to address persistent problems related to deteriorating natural resources and to hold
                           village government accountable. In a number of cases, this decline in local capacity can be
                           ascribed to losing the ability to elect a village head because of a change of status from village
                           to ward. These findings strongly point to the need to strengthen checks and balances
                           mechanisms at the village level to help villagers hold village government accountable. Thus,
                           while CDD projects have assisted high and medium capacity villages in solving some of their
                           collective problems, more needs to be done to allow lower capacity villages to benefit from
                           the process as well.

INDONESIA ECONOMIC QUARTERLY
Investment in flux

March 2014
Preface
          The Indonesia Economic Quarterly (IEQ) has two main aims. First, it reports on the key
          developments over the past three months in Indonesia’s economy, and places these in a
          longer-term and global context. Based on these developments, and on policy changes over
          the period, the IEQ regularly updates the outlook for Indonesia’s economy and social
          welfare. Second, the IEQ provides a more in-depth examination of selected economic and
          policy issues, and analysis of Indonesia’s medium-term development challenges. It is
          intended for a wide audience, including policymakers, business leaders, financial market
          participants, and the community of analysts and professionals engaged in Indonesia’s
          evolving economy.

          The IEQ is a product of the World Bank’s Jakarta office. The report is compiled by the
          Macro and Fiscal Policy Cluster, Poverty Reduction and Economic Management (PREM)
          Network, under the guidance of Jim Brumby, Sector Manager and Lead Economist, Ndiame
          Diop, Lead Economist and Economic Advisor, and Ashley Taylor, Senior Economist. Led
          by Alex Sienaert and with responsibility for Part A, editing and production, the core project
          team comprises Arsianti, Magda Adriani, Masyita Crystallin, Fitria Fitrani, Ahya Ihsan, Elitza
          Mileva (Part A lead), Michele Savini Zangrandi and Violeta Vulovic. Administrative support
          is provided by Titi Ananto and Sylvia Njotomihardjo. Dissemination is organized by Nur
          Raihan, Indra Irnawan, Jerry Kurniawan and Nugroho Sunjoyo, under the guidance of Dini
          Sari Djalal.

          This edition of the IEQ also includes contributions from Yue Man Lee and Arvind Nair
          (Section B.1, mineral exports policy), Suryani Amin, Abigail Baca, Iwan Gunawan, Jossie
          McVitty and Saut Sagala (Bandung Institute of Technology)(Section B.2, urban disaster risk
          preparedness). Key input was received from The Fei Ming, Neni Lestari, Djauhari Sitorus
          and Carlos Pinerua. The report also benefited from discussions with, and in-depth
          comments from, Mark Ahern, Bill Wallace (Australia Indonesia Partnership for Economic
          Governance) and Roland Rajah (Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade). Peter
          Milne edited much of the report.

          Development/The World Bank, supported by funding from the Australian Government
          under the Support for Enhanced Macroeconomic and Fiscal Policy Analysis (SEMEFPA)

 Executive summary: Investment in flux




As Indonesia’s             Indonesia’s economy continues to adjust to weaker terms of trade and tighter external
economic adjustment        financing conditions, with the composition of growth tilting more towards net exports, and
to a changing global       economic growth slowing moderately. While this shift is positive for macroeconomic
environment                stability, it has to date been based primarily on tighter monetary policy and the depreciation
continues, further         of the Rupiah in 2013, the effects of which are continuing to play out. To further reduce
progress is needed on      Indonesia’s vulnerability to external shocks, to minimize the risks of a more marked cyclical
long-standing policy       slowdown in growth, and to convert the near-term macro adjustment into strong, sustained
priorities…                growth over the longer term, further progress on long-standing policy priorities is warranted.

…including                 Progress in three key areas can support both near-term macro stability and Indonesia’s long-
improvements in the        term economic prospects. First, there is a need to support domestic and foreign investor
quality of the             confidence. Recent policy and regulatory developments, including the partial ban on mineral
investment and trade       exports, have increased uncertainty, may weigh on investment across the economy, and
climate, fiscal reforms,   compound the usual difficulty of predicting policy ahead of elections. Given rising fiscal
and continuing to          pressures from slower revenue growth and higher fuel subsidy costs, the second priority is to
make progress on           broaden the revenue base and improve the quality of spending, notably by reducing energy
loosening the              subsidy expenditure. These measures would also increase available fiscal space for more
structural impediments     equitable, pro-growth spending. Third, credible progress is needed on addressing structural
to growth                  impediments to stronger and more inclusive growth, namely infrastructure and worker skills
                           gaps, and factor and product market constraints. The policy environment is naturally
                           constrained ahead of legislative elections in April and the presidential election in July.
                           However, in light of ongoing economic risks and Indonesia’s ambitious development
                           agenda, laying the groundwork for future reforms, minimizing policy uncertainty, and
                           making continued reform progress in some areas, should remain a priority.

Global economic            The global economy continues to strengthen gradually, led by the ongoing recovery in high-
conditions are also        income economies, notably the US and the Euro Area. This is broadly positive for emerging
shifting, bringing         market economies (EMEs) including Indonesia, since it means a general strengthening in
challenges for             trade flows. However, the price trajectories of many commodities, which together account
Indonesia                  for about two-thirds of Indonesia’s goods exports, remain subdued, and downward price

                          pressures may continue due to supply-side factors, and China’s continued rebalancing away
                          from credit-fueled investment. In addition, the pricing-in of a gradual withdrawal of
                          extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in the US is placing upward pressure on
                          global interest rates. Portfolio investment inflows to EMEs have slumped as investors assess
                          adjustment risks and longer-term relative growth prospects, with markets appearing
                          increasingly to differentiate amongst countries on the basis of domestic vulnerabilities.

Indonesia’s economic      Indonesia’s economy continued to rebalance in the fourth quarter of 2013, adjusting to
rebalancing continued     weaker terms of trade and external financing constraints through tighter monetary policy and
through the end of        currency depreciation. Net exports provided a significant boost to growth, due to a

                          imports. However, the basic balance, the sum of the current account balance and net FDI, is
                          projected to stay negative in the near term, implying that Indonesia will continue to rely on
                          potentially volatile portfolio and other investment inflows. Gross external financing needs
                          beyond current account financing also remain significant, with short-term external debt
                          standing at USD 56.7 billion as of December, according to Bank Indonesia (BI).
                          Consequently, Indonesia remains susceptible to any renewed tightening in external financing

fiscal pressures are       expected to remain soft in 2014, reflecting the moderation in economic, and import, growth,
increasing                 and the absence of significant new measures to boost revenue collections. On the
                           expenditure side, fuel subsidy spending continues to be poorly targeted, distortionary and to
                           impose high opportunity costs and fiscal risks. For example, higher Rupiah-denominated
                           fuel costs are projected by the World Bank to push up fuel subsidy spending to IDR 267
                           trillion in 2014 (2.6 percent of GDP) from IDR 210 trillion in 2013 (2.2 percent of GDP),
                           and above the original 2014 Budget allocation of IDR 211 trillion. Reform, such as a move
                           from a discretionary to rule-based fuel price adjustment, is clearly important and should aim
                           to reduce budget uncertainty and subsidy spending and to ensure that the poor and
                           vulnerable are protected from higher prices.

                           percent in 2015. By the end of the year, monthly CPI inflation is expected to fall just below

                           impact of the mineral export ban likely to delay the return of the trade balance to surplus,

                          challenges, has further weakened perceptions of Indonesia’s mining investment climate,
                          which is already rated one of the poorest in the world.

…with the mineral         Through the imposition of the partial ban and new export tax on unprocessed mineral
export ban policy         exports, Indonesia is seeking to boost domestic value-addition in the mineral sector. It is
expected to have a        hoped that this will lead to higher growth, employment and fiscal revenues. Whether these
significant, negative     outcomes will be achieved depends on the extent to which the policy can stimulate
near-term impact on       development of new smelting and refining capacity, on the degree to which increased
trade and fiscal          processing increases value-addition, and on achieving sufficient gains in export and fiscal
revenues                  revenues from processed minerals to offset losses from reduced unprocessed exports and
                          higher import requirements from building and operating smelters. International experience
                          highlights that such policies often fail to achieve their aims. Focusing on the short to
                          medium-term impacts, the World Bank estimates that there will be a negative impact on net
                          trade of USD 12.5 billion and a total loss in fiscal revenues (royalties, export taxes and
                          corporate income tax) of USD 6.5 billion from the current (as written, de jure) policy in 2014-
                          17, including a USD 5.5 to 6.5 billion drag on the trade balance in 2014 alone. While the
                          quantum remains uncertain, negative impacts of this order from the ban, along with the
                          broader economic issues the policy raises, suggest it is worthwhile to evaluate a wider set of
                          policy options to ensure that Indonesia benefits to the maximum extent possible from its
                          considerable mineral wealth in a socially and environmentally sustainable manner.

                          without threatening its long-term fiscal outlook. The difficulties lie in getting the reforms
                          implemented in a complex, and decentralized, institutional framework. But Indonesia, given

                          institutional capacity, poorly managed urbanization could act as a constraint on sustainable
                          and inclusive growth. Even more worrying, this could also expose Indonesians to undue

 A. Economic and fiscal update




                   1. A shifting global economy brings new challenges
Shift in global          The global economy continues gradually to strengthen, led by the ongoing recovery in high
economic conditions      income economies, notably the US and the Euro Area. This is broadly positive for emerging
brings opportunities     market economies (EMEs) including Indonesia, since it means a general strengthening in
and challenges for       trade flows. However, international developments also pose significant challenges. First , the
emerging economies,      shifting composition of global growth in favor of high income economies, China’s
including Indonesia      continued efforts to rebalance its economy away from credit-fueled investment, and supply-
                         side factors, mean that the price trajectories of many commodities, which together account
                         for about two-thirds of Indonesia’s goods exports, remain subdued. Second, the pricing-in
                         of a gradual withdrawal of extraordinarily accommodative monetary policy in the US and
                         other high income economies is placing upward pressure on global interest rates, and
                         portfolio investment inflows to EMEs have slumped as global investors assess adjustment
                         risks and longer-term, relative growth prospects.

The global economy       While recent global economic performance has been somewhat uneven, the overall pattern
remains on track for     has been one of increasing growth, and the outlook for most of Indonesia’s major trading
stronger growth…         partners is positive. GDP decelerated in the US and Japan in the final quarter of 2013, but
                         accelerated slightly in the Euro Area, and across high income economies as a whole,
                         industrial production picked up notably through the end of 2013. Weather disruptions in
                         early 2014 have complicated assessments of the momentum of the US economy, but the
                         most recent payrolls data and leading indicators suggest that its recovery continues, as is also
                         the case in the Euro Area. Looking ahead, the baseline scenario is for the global economy to
                         strengthen over 2014 and 2015, led by the expansion of high income economies (Figure 2).
                         Developing economies are expected to record trend-like growth, notably including solid
                         growth in China of close to the official growth target of 7.5 percent in 2014. Thus, the
                         international economic backdrop should continue to be broadly supportive for the demand
                         for Indonesia’s exports.

…and the terms of            Indonesia’s terms of trade have stabilized in recent months, consistent with a modest
trade have stabilized        strengthening in external demand due to a gradual pick-up in global economic activity. As
                             measured by average unit export and import values, the terms of trade troughed in August
                             2013 and have since picked up somewhat, though remaining approximately 30 percent
                             below the level when export prices peaked three years ago (Figure 3). This stabilization of
                             relative export and import prices has supported the trade balance and is broadly positive for
                             the economy, but there have been no signs of a broad-based lift in commodity prices.
                             Rather, price developments for Indonesia’s key commodity exports remain mixed so far in
                             2014, with natural gas prices rising 6 percent over the first two months of the year, but coal
                             falling approximately 10 percent, while palm oil and crude oil prices were broadly flat. The
                             price of Indonesia’s single largest mineral export product, copper (about 2.5 percent of total
                             export value), was little-changed through end-February.

Emerging market              Global benchmark interest rates have fluctuated in a fairly narrow range (e.g. US 10-year
economy financial            yields between 2.6-3.0 percent), following the start of “tapering” of quantitative easing
assets have                  measures by the US Federal Reserve last December. Against this backdrop, many emerging
underperformed               market currencies and equity markets have either lost ground or lagged the gains seen in
                             some high income economy markets; for example, the MSCI Standard EM equities index
                             weakened by 5.9 percent in US Dollar terms in 2014 through 13 March, against a flat S&P
                             500 index (of major US stocks). The underperformance of EME assets likely reflects
                             continued investor concerns over the required economic or policy adjustments and
                             potentially weaker growth prospects in the context of gradually normalizing monetary policy
                             in high income economies, and, ultimately, higher global interest rates. These are very
                             relevant concerns for Indonesia as well, but so far in 2014 Indonesian financial markets have
                             performed relatively strongly.

                   2. Fixed investment has led the economic adjustment
Indonesia’s economic         Indonesia’s economy continued to rebalance in the fourth quarter of 2013, adjusting to
rebalancing continued        weaker terms of trade and external financing constraints through tighter monetary policy and
through the end of           currency depreciation. Net exports provided a significant boost to real GDP growth,
2013, with fixed             reflecting a moderation in import volume growth and acceleration in exports. Fixed capital
investment moderating        formation maintained its below-average pace of growth, dampening import demand and
and net export volumes       accounting for a significant part of the growth adjustment. At the same time, consumption
rising                       spending remained resilient. The process of economic adjustment is expected to continue in
                             the short term, causing growth to moderate further over 2014. Over the medium term,
                             growth momentum is projected to pick-up somewhat, but the rate of growth is likely to stay
                             below 6 percent.

on-year growth in Q4               GDP accelerated over the same period, to 13.2 percent yoy, as a result of a rise in the GDP

                                   from 6.3 percent in 2012, owing to somewhat weaker domestic demand.

Recent high frequency          Several high frequency economic activity indicators, except retail sales, suggest a loss of
data are mixed but             momentum in domestic demand in the first month of 2014. Motorcycle sales, in particular,
consistent with a small        declined sharply by 11.3 percent yoy in January (or an increase of only 4.3 percent yoy if
election-related               smoothed over three months), possibly affected by prolonged flooding in Java (Figure 7).
increase in private            The HSBC Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) for Indonesia’s manufacturing sector, at 50.5
consumption                    in February, remains in marginally expansionary territory. However, BI’s survey measure of
                               retail sales increased significantly to 26.6 and 28.8 percent yoy in December and January,
                               respectively. The high retail sales readings point to a pick-up in private consumption
                               spending in the first quarter of 2014, likely supported by early campaign-related activity.

Relatively moderate            The baseline World Bank projections for Indonesia’s GDP growth remain unchanged at 5.3
output growth is               percent in 2014 (Table 2). Private consumption is expected to receive a temporary boost
projected over the             ahead of the April and July elections. Nevertheless, tighter credit conditions are likely to
medium term                    affect somewhat household spending in 2014. Similarly, investment growth is expected to
                               remain subdued in the short term on account of higher borrowing costs, lower commodity
                               prices and higher import costs driven by the weaker Rupiah. Export growth is projected to
                               rise gradually as external demand conditions improve (see Section 1). However, the
                               contribution of net exports to growth is expected to decline somewhat over the forecast
                               horizon as import growth recovers in line with the projected increase in domestic demand.

                   3. Core inflation has been gradually rising
Upward inflationary          Having risen sharply after the June 2013 increase in subsidized fuel prices, monthly
pressures have mostly        consumer price inflation declined substantially in the final months of 2013, but has recently
faded, except the pass-      increased again on the back of seasonal factors. At the same time, core inflation declined
through from Rupiah          towards the end of 2013 but has recently pushed higher, partly in delayed response to a
depreciation                 weaker Rupiah. In the short term, the lags in the pass-through effect to the economy of
                             earlier rate increases should keep inflationary pressures in check.

Seasonal factors              Consumer price pressures subsided in the second half of 2013, after the 33 percent average
pushed up headline            increase in subsidized fuel prices which took effect on June 22 (Figure 8). Weakening
inflation in recent           domestic demand contributed to the deceleration in monthly inflation. An additional factor
months…                       was the tighter financing conditions caused by foreign capital outflows in the second half of
                              last year and the increase in the Bank Indonesia’s (BI) policy rate from 5.75 percent in May
                              to 7.50 percent in December. In December 2013 and January 2014, at the height of the rainy
                              season, consumer prices rose again sequentially. In year-on-year terms, CPI inflation stood at

…while food price              Food price inflation continued to decline to 8.8 percent yoy in February 2014 from a high of
inflation continued to         15.1 percent yoy in August last year, during Ramadan. The lower food price pressures
ease…                          observed in recent months were caused by price deflation in some key foods such as red
                               chilies and onions in some cities in Sumatra and the eastern Indonesian regions, which
                               compensated for increases in the prices of foods such as rice, flour and beef. Heavy rains
                               since December and the disruption caused by the eruption of the Mount Kelud volcano in
                               East Java in February do not seem to have had a significant impact on national food price
                               inflation.

… but the gap between          In contrast, a weaker rice harvest on account of heavy floods in Indonesia has resulted in a
domestic and                   larger gap between domestic and international rice prices. In December 2013, comparable
international rice             international rice prices (represented by the Vietnam medium quality benchmark) were 41-52
prices has widened             percent cheaper than domestic wholesale rice prices, and the gap rose to 70-83 percent in
                               February 2014. Recent developments in the price gap were driven by three factors: falling
                               international rice prices due to over-supply of rice in the international market, increasing
                               domestic rice prices (up by 7.3-10.3 percent yoy), and the depreciation of the Rupiah against
                               the US Dollar.

Core inflation has             Core inflation, which excludes volatile items such as food and energy, declined in the fourth

of Rupiah depreciation         has increased from 4.0 percent yoy in June 2013 to 5.3 percent yoy in February 2014, its
                               highest monthly reading since June 2009. This was due in part to the pass-through to
                               domestic prices of the weaker Rupiah, which depreciated by 25 percent between May 2013
                               and January 2014 before appreciating by around 5 percent in February (Figure 8).

Headline inflation is          Looking forward, year-on-year headline inflation is expected to peak in the second quarter of
expected to fall just          2014. Afterwards, inflationary pressures are projected to decline on account of favorable
below BI’s target              base effects and weaker growth. By the end of 2014, monthly CPI inflation is expected to
ceiling by end-2014            fall just below the ceiling of the BI’s current target band of 3.5-5.5 percent yoy and to remain
                               there until end-2015. Core inflation is expected to follow broadly the same trajectory, as the
                               adverse effects of the exchange rate depreciation diminish. The risks to the base case
                               projections are balanced and are related to the likelihood of further Rupiah weakness and
                               future administered price increases, the size of the impact of higher election-related
                               spending, set against weaker domestic demand and credit growth.

                    4. Strong balance of payments performance in Q4, but risks lie ahead
Indonesia’s current            Indonesia’s balance of payments turned positive in the last quarter of 2014 after three
account balance                consecutive quarters of deficit, replenishing reserves (Figure 10). The strong performance
improved in Q4 but             was driven by a solid outturn in the goods trade balance, partly, but not only, on the back of
this was in part due to        increased mineral exports ahead of the introduction of the mineral export ban in January.
temporary factors              Import compression continued, with capital and intermediate goods imports leveling off and
                               consumption goods growing weakly. Government debt issuance and foreign private
                               borrowing, and repatriation of currency and deposits, helped finance the USD 4 billion
                               current account deficit. Despite the improvement in the last quarter of 2013, the basic
                               balance, defined as the sum of the current account balance and net direct investment, is
                               projected to remain negative in the near term, implying that Indonesia’s net external
                               financing will likely continue to rely on potentially volatile portfolio and other investment
                               inflows.

                                percent of the year-on-year fall in exports in the first month of 2014 (Figure 12). The value
                                of ores, slag and ash exports declined from USD 970 million in December 2013 to USD 290
                                million January 2014. The World Bank estimates export losses associated with the raw
                                mineral export ban, relative to a base line of no ban and no export tax, of USD 5.3-7 billion
                                for the full year. The impact of the mineral export ban is being compounded by delays in
                                issuing export permits for processed minerals. For further discussion of the mineral export
                                ban and its impact, see Section B.1.

Subdued capital and             Import compression has also been a clear recent feature of trade dynamics, although less so

improvement in the              capital and intermediate goods have been soft, with the former in particular averaging 16
trade balance                   percent lower than their year-ago levels in the second half of 2013. Consumer goods imports
                                have made virtually zero contribution to total import growth (Figure 13). Falling capital
                                imports are related to the marked slowdown in investment (see also Box 1). Little relief
                                appears in the oil and gas trade balance where, despite decreasing imports and slowly rising
                                exports, the deficit (of USD 1 billion in Q4) remained a sizable drag on the overall goods

inflows rebounded on            USD 9.2 billion in Q4, largely driven by flows in the “other investments” sub-account. Here,
significant private             repatriation of offshore assets increased to USD 1.4 billion, reversing the outflow of USD
borrowing and                   2.3 billion in 2013 Q3. Strong drawings of offshore loans by domestic corporates
repatriation of offshore        contributed to USD 4.1 billion of private sector other investment liability inflows, up from
capital                         an outflow of USD 133 million in Q3. Inbound FDI remained in line with the 3 year average
                                of approximately USD 4 billion per quarter. Pertamina’s acquisition of oil fields in Algeria
                                worth approximately USD 2.5 billion contributed to a reduction in net direct investment, to
                                USD 1.6 billion from USD 5.6 billion in Q3. As a result, the basic balance remained negative
                                despite the large current account deficit contraction. Net portfolio investment remained
                                broadly stable at USD 1.8 billion in Q4, helped by substantial net foreign purchases of
                                domestic government bonds (Figure 14). Conversely, equities saw persistent outflows in the
                                second half of 2013, before turning positive again in January.

Box 1: The determinants of Indonesia’s import demand: investment and exports are important
 Import volume growth in Indonesia declined significantly in 2013. Estimates from an error correction model (ECM) suggest that a
 significant part of the decrease in import demand can be explained by the considerable slowdown in fixed investment (which is
 consistent with the observed decline in capital goods imports) and the increase in the price of imported goods relative to domestic
 goods. Historically, household consumption has not been a significant determinant of import growth.

 As is standard practice in the literature, an ECM model can be used to study both the short- and long-term effect on real import
 demand of three demand components from the national accounts and relative prices, the latter defined as the ratio of the import
 deflator to the consumer price index (CPI). All variables are transformed into logarithms and the sample period is Q1 1993 – Q4
 2013. The results indicate that private consumption is not a statistically significant determinant of import growth (Table 4). In the
 short run, a one percent increase in investment adds around 0.5 percentage points to import demand. Similarly, a one percent rise
 in exports is associated with 0.6 percentage points import growth as imported goods are used in the production of exports (see the
 March 2012 IEQ for more details on the important role of imports in export value-added in Indonesia). The long-term effect of
 investment appears weaker, whereas that of exports remains strong. As expected, a rise in the price of imported goods relative to
 domestic goods results in lower import demand.

 A decomposition of the annual growth of real imports shows that the slowdown in exports explains a large portion of the decline
 in 2012, while the demand for imported inputs to export production is estimated to have contributed almost all import growth in
 2013. These findings suggest that import compression does not necessarily lead to an improvement in the trade balance, as it may
 be related to lower exports. The significant decline in investment growth, as discussed in Section 2, is also reflected in the
 composition of import demand in 2013. Finally, higher import prices, in part caused by the weaker Rupiah in 2013, have also
 negatively affected imports.

                               demand stemming from moderate fixed investment growth, has contributed to a slowdown
                               in credit growth. Moderating deposit growth and limited loan-to-deposit ratio (LDR)
                               headroom, especially for some smaller banks, indicate that weaker credit growth is likely to
                               persist in the near term.

…while currency        Turning to currency market conditions, there have been several positive developments in
market conditions have recent months. The Rupiah has strengthened by more than 6 percent from IDR 12,242 per
improved               US Dollar at the beginning of 2014 to 11,449 on March 10 2014. International reserves
                       increased from USD 95 billion in September 2013 to USD 100 billion in January 2014. In
                       addition, on March 6, 2014 Bank Indonesia and the Bank of Korea established a bilateral
                       currency swap arrangement for up to KRW 10.7 trillion (IDR 115 trillion) for an initial
                       period of three years. Finally, on February 19, 2014 the Association of Banks in Singapore
                       adopted the Jakarta Interbank Spot Dollar Rate (JISDOR) as the fixing for non-deliverable
                       forwards (NDFs), which followed the convergence of offshore and onshore Rupiah
                       exchange rates since October 2013. The move sends a positive signal of market confidence
                       in price transparency in the onshore spot foreign exchange market as overseen by Bank
                       Indonesia, and should facilitate currency hedging by foreign investors using NDFs,
                       potentially supporting portfolio inflows.

Credit growth has              Nominal bank credit growth has fallen from 23.1 percent yoy at the beginning of 2013 to
decelerated further…           21.6 percent in December. In real terms (deflated using CPI inflation), credit growth went
                               down from 18 percent yoy in January 2013 to 12.2 percent in December. Since foreign
                               currency-denominated credit accounts for 16 percent of total outstanding credit, the nominal
                               credit figures were inflated by the Rupiah depreciation seen during 2013. Hence, excluding

                               additional downward pressure on real consumption, as discussed in Section 2. At the same

                               75 percent of bank assets, the LDRs of smaller banks, i.e. those with asset size of less than

                   6. Much less fiscal room to maneuver in 2014
Fiscal pressure from       The Government’s 2013 fiscal deficit outturn was lower than projected, mostly due to
revenue moderation         shortfalls in expenditure disbursements rather than improvement in the revenue collection.
and fuel subsidy           Marked moderation in revenue growth is expected to continue in 2014, while on the
spending call for          expenditure side, fuel subsidy spending continues to impose significant fiscal pressure on the
further fiscal reforms     budget, emphasizing the importance of additional reform measures.

The provisional fiscal     According to the currently available unaudited figures, the 2013 Budget recorded a deficit of
deficit for 2013 was 2.2   IDR 209.5 trillion (2.2 percent of GDP), which was below the projected 2.4 percent in the
percent of GDP             revised 2013 Budget and the World Bank’s projections in the December 2013 edition of the
                           IEQ of 2.5 percent of GDP. The lower than projected budget deficit for 2013, despite
                           weaker than budgeted revenue growth, primarily reflects recorded expenditure disbursement
                           shortfalls relative to the revised Budget allocations.

Revenue collection and     Revenue collection reached only 95.2 percent of the 2013 revised Budget projection of IDR
nominal growth in 2013     1,502 trillion. This was mostly driven by the weaker realization of tax revenues at 93.4
was significantly below    percent of the 2013 target. In comparison with previous years, this was the lowest realization
that in previous           of the revised revenue target since 2006. Non-tax revenue collection was in line with Budget
years…                     projections, supported by strong oil and gas revenue outcomes resulting from the weaker
                           Rupiah. Overall, total revenues recorded only moderate nominal growth of 6.8 percent yoy
                           in 2013, well below average nominal growth of 16.5 percent over 2010-2012 (Figure 19).
                           Below-average growth was observed for all major types of revenues (Figure 20).

… while energy             By the end of 2013, total expenditure disbursements reached 95 percent of the revised
subsidy costs again        Budget plan of IDR 1,726 trillion, lower than the outcome of 96.3 percent in 2012.
overshot the revised       Nevertheless, the disbursement of the core spending categories, namely capital and social
Budget target              spending, increased compared with previous years, at 89.1 percent for capital (82.4 percent
                           in 2012) and 95.9 percent for social spending (87.9 percent in 2012). The improvement in
                           the disbursement rate of capital spending is notable, although the nominal growth rate of
                           capital spending was down slightly on 2013 at 18 percent (versus 23 percent in 2012).
                           Material spending disbursement was slightly lower in 2013 (85.5 percent of the plan) than in
                           2012 (87.0 percent of the annual target). Finally, 2013 saw another overshooting of the
                           revised Budget target for fuel subsidy spending, by IDR 10 trillion (5 percent more than
                           planned), to IDR 210 trillion. In addition, fuel subsidy obligations of IDR 40 trillion were
                           incurred towards the end of the year but not paid and therefore not included in the cash
                           based 2013 Budget outturn. These would take the accrued fuel subsidy expenses in 2013 to
                           IDR 240-250 trillion. The additional IDR 40 trillion, or about 20 percent of the fuel subsidy
                           budget, is likely to be paid in 2014. This represents about 0.3 percent of GDP and would
                           impose additional fiscal pressure on the 2014 budget.

In the absence of       Taking into account World Bank macro assumptions for 2014, previous trends, as well as
revisions, the 2014     the expected effect of the minerals export ban on revenues (see Section B1), the World Bank
budget deficit is       projects a fiscal deficit of 2.6 percent of GDP for 2014 (Table 5), more than the 2.1 percent
projected to be 2.6     of GDP deficit projected in the previous December IEQ. The revision is primarily a result
percent of GDP          of a downward-revision in the forecast for tax revenue collection. Lower tax revenues are
                        projected for two reasons: an expected slowdown in VAT collection due to lower private
                        consumption and import growth, and a reduction of the corporate income tax collection due
                        to the mineral export ban (see Section B.1). In addition to moderation in revenue collection,
                        the World Bank has revised up its projection of fiscal spending by 1.4 percent, mostly due to
                        higher expected energy subsidy spending at the exchange rate prevailing in Q1 through
                        March 7 (see Box 3 for a further discussion of fuel subsidy spending and reform options).

                        day (bpd), posing an additional fiscal risk, although likely to be offset to some degree by
                        exchange rate effects. The World Bank estimates that reduction of oil lifting of 10,000 bpd
                        would reduce revenue collection by IDR 3 trillion, mostly through non-tax revenues (about
                        IDR 2.4 trillion), all else constant. Given the continuing significant fiscal pressure from fuel
                        subsidies, amplified by the weakening of the Rupiah in H2 2013 that widened the gap
                        between regulated and market prices (Figure 21), the revised Budget may provide an
                        opportunity for fuel subsidy reform, building on last year’s price increase. The Government
                        is exploring the option of a fixed fuel subsidy per liter.2 An additional option is to set a fixed
                        total nominal subsidy cost limit, enhancing the Government’s ability to control spending;
                        Box 3 examines these options. Another rise in electricity tariffs for large businesses and
                        industrial groups has been approved by Parliament, likely effective in May.3

Gross financing for     As of March 10, 2014, 44.5 percent of gross security financing requirements for 2014 (IDR
2014 has been front-    370.4 trillion) had already been met, helped by the front-loading of external issuance,
loaded                  including a record-size tying USD 4 billion issue for an Asian emerging economy in January.

 Box 3: Following last year’s subsidized fuel price increase, more fuel subsidy reform is needed
  Substantial fuel subsidy overspending in 2013 highlights the need for further and sustained reform to reduce budget uncertainty
  and limit budget spending exposure, in addition to reducing the opportunity costs of such poorly-targeted and distortionary
  spending. Despite the 44 percent and 22 percent increase in subsidized petrol and diesel prices, respectively in June 2013, fuel
  subsidy spending again overshot the revised budgeted level on the back of subsequent Rupiah depreciation, accounting for nearly
  one fifth of central government spending or 2.2 percent of GDP. This experience shows that ad-hoc price adjustment cannot
  protect fuel subsidy spending from volatility in oil prices and the Rupiah exchange rate, and does not guarantee sustained fiscal
  gains.

  Fuel subsidy spending therefore continues to pose significant downside risks to the fiscal position in 2014, which remains highly
  sensitive through fuel subsidy costs to the exchange rate and crude oil price. The World Bank's baseline projections for fuel subsidy
  spending in 2014 assume an average US Dollar/Rupiah exchange rate of 12,000 and an Indonesian crude oil price of 105 USD per
  barrel. Thus, without reform, the fiscal deficit in 2014 is projected to reach 2.6 percent of GDP. If 2013 fuel subsidy payment
  arrears were to be carried forward to 2014 without a commensurate rolling over into 2015 of current year subsidy costs, the fiscal
  deficit may reach as high as 3.0 percent.

  For illustrative purpose, two reform scenarios are simulated to examine potential impact on fiscal deficit and saving that can be
  allocated for much needed development priorities such infrastructure and social security. Two scenarios are assumed to be effective
  in July 1st, 2014:

  Scenario I: assumes a similar nominal Rupiah per liter increase as in June 2013, of IDR 2,000 per liter for gasoline and IDR 1,000
  per liter for diesel. All else equal, this would reduce the fiscal deficit to 2.1 percent of GDP, generating a fiscal saving of about IDR
  45 trillion in 2014, and IDR 97 trillion in 2015. As discussed previously, this one-off price adjustment still exposes the budget to
  future exchange rate and international energy price volatility.

  Scenario II: assumes an increase in subsidized gasoline and diesel prices by closing the gap between current subsidized prices and
  market prices by half. This would mean a 30 percent and 50 percent nominal price increase for gasoline and diesel. Under this
  scenario, all else equal, the projected fiscal deficit in 2014 is 1.9 percent of GDP and the estimated fiscal savings are IDR 69 trillion,
  increasing to IDR 144 trillion in 2015.

  by closing half of the gaps to economic prices

  In addition to the above indicative scenarios, to reduce the amount and uncertainty of the fuel subsidy, the alternative fuel pricing
  policy should strive for simplicity, transparency and predictability to ensure better public understanding and easy implementation.
  A wide range of approaches have been tried in various countries. While all of them have advantages and disadvantages, there are
  two potential realistic options for the Indonesian context, which involve a move from discretionary to rule-based price
  adjustments:
      Option 1: Indexation (with threshold). Periodically moving prices through a pre-agreed rule. Under this option, prices can
       move both up and down. Domestic prices are reviewed on a periodic basis (monthly, quarterly, etc). A pre-agreed rule is
       used to set a new domestic price (or keep it the same), with reference to recent world prices.
      Option 2. Quarterly subsidy spending limits. Announce subsidy limits for the coming budget year by quarter, and then adjust
       prices in subsequent quarters when there is a breach in the target, which would limit the fiscal exposure of the Budget. The
       quarterly limits would be based on observed fuel consumption patterns and assumed prices, converted into Rupiah. This
       would allow adjustment of prices in the subsequent quarter based on the prior quarter’s total subsidy spending. The basis
       upon which this could be done would be transparent and rule-based, aiming to depoliticize the price adjustment process.

                           has recently improved, as highlighted above, but, nevertheless, a resumption of heightened
                           volatility in external financing conditions remains a risk, particularly as the US Federal
                           Reserve continues to “taper”. Similarly, the expected improvement in Indonesia’s trading
                           partner growth is supportive of exports, but there is still a risk of weaker than projected
                           external demand, in particular in relation to the trade impact of China’s economic
                           rebalancing. China’s economic trajectory may also further impact commodity prices,
                           decreases in which pose another external downside risk to the outlook.

…while uncertainty         Until now most of the macroeconomic adjustment in Indonesia has come from fixed
remains around the         investment, while private consumption has continued to grow at a robust rate. There is a risk
path of                    that slower credit and property price growth (see Section 5) and higher real interest rates,
macroeconomic              could have a more negative than anticipated impact on investment, including building
adjustment…                investment and construction (which have so far remained resilient), and consumption.
                           Further exchange rate depreciation or volatility may also weigh on the economy, by raising
                           the domestic prices of imported goods (both investment and consumption goods), the
                           Rupiah costs of foreign-currency debt on private and public sector balance sheets, as well as
                           through the fiscal burden of fuel subsidies (see Box 3). In addition to these downside risks,
                           the effect of the upcoming national elections on consumption, through campaign-related
                           spending, and on investment, through heightened policy uncertainty, is another risk factor.

... with vulnerabilities   The World Bank’s base case projections include a considerable improvement in Indonesia’s
rising considerably in     trade balance in 2014. However, this scenario is subject to several risks, all of which relate to
the export sector          the export sector. On the upside, Section 4 showed that non-commodity exports have not
                           yet responded to the more competitive exchange rate, and could therefore provide a positive
                           surprise if not held back by structural constraints. On the downside, recent policies limiting
                           the export of minerals, constraining foreign ownership, raising export taxes, and suppressing
                           imports are likely to reduce exporters’ margins, and may also weigh on future FDI.

The macroeconomic         While Indonesia’s economy continues to adjust in a favorable direction for safeguarding
stabilization of recent   near-term macroeconomic stability, driven mainly by monetary policy and helped by
months needs to be        Indonesia’s flexible exchange rate, some recent trade and investment policy and regulatory
reinforced by trade and   developments increase uncertainty and may weigh on investment, both domestic and
investment policy         foreign, and hence external financing and growth. With political noise increasing ahead of
certainty, and more       legislative elections in April, and presidential elections in July, it will be particularly important
fiscal reforms…           to minimize policy uncertainties, and to the extent to possible make continued progress on
                          strengthening Indonesia’s economic resilience and sustainable growth (as focused on in
                          Section C). However, recent policy and regulatory developments, including the partial ban
                          on mineral exports (as discussed next, in Section B.1), and also new trade and foreign
                          ownership laws, and the delay in implementing the revised negative investment list, are
                          having the opposite effect. More fiscal sector reforms to safeguard stability and enhance the
                          use of fiscal policy as a macroeconomic management tool, and support long-run growth,
                          also remain urgent.

B.Some recent developments in Indonesia’s economy




                   1. A closer look at Indonesia’s unprocessed mineral export ban
The recent ban on        Indonesia is rich in minerals and in the top ten countries in the world for proven reserves of
unprocessed mineral      copper, nickel, tin, bauxite and gold. Total mineral export value more than tripled from
exports has focused      USD 3 billion to USD 11.2 billion between 2001 and 2013, driven by historically high
attention on policy in   commodity prices and increasing production (Figure 23). Mineral exports constituted 6.2
Indonesia’s important    percent of total exports in 2013 with copper, nickel, tin, iron and bauxite the largest
minerals sector, with    contributors. By value, approximately forty percent of total mineral exports are currently
concerns over the        processed; all tin exports are processed, while most copper, nickel and bauxite exports are
ban’s near-term impact   unprocessed. The recent imposition of a partial ban and export tax on unprocessed mineral
on trade and fiscal      exports has triggered intense debate on its potential impact, and has important implications
revenues and its         for the overall mining sector and wider economic outlook. This Section examines the policy
longer-term economic     rationale, the estimated near- and medium-term trade and fiscal implications, and options
implications             for future policy discussions.

The 2009 Mining Law              The 2009 Mining Law (Undang Undang /2009) requires all mining business permit (Izin Usaha

but the first                    minimum standards for domestic processing and refining, and imposed a ban on the export
implementing                     of raw mineral ores within three months of the regulation (by May 2012). Three months
regulation was only              later, MEMR 11/2012 postponed the May 2012 export ban until January 2014. In the
issued in 2012                   interim period, producers were allowed to export unprocessed minerals, but IUP holders
                                 were subject to a 20 percent export duty.

The government                   On January 11, 2014, a day before the export ban was due to take effect, the Government
enacted a ban on                 announced a new regulation, GR 1/2014, which upheld the ban on unprocessed exports of
unprocessed mineral              nickel and bauxite but permitted the continued export of semi-processed ‘concentrates’ for
exports in January               the other minerals, including copper, until 2017. However, in an unanticipated development,
2014, although last              all producers, including CoW holders, are now subject to an export tax on unprocessed and
minute revisions                 semi-processed mineral exports as specified in Ministry of Finance (MoF) Regulation
exempted certain                 6/2014. The export tax rates, starting at 20-25 percent of sales revenues4 in 2014 and
minerals and imposed             increasing to 60 percent by 2016, have been described by the Government as a fiscal
an unanticipated                 instrument to compel companies to build smelters, rather than as a revenue generating tool5
export tax on them               (Table 8). It is assumed, in the scenario analysis below, based on an analysis of aggregate
instead                          profit margins for Indonesian mining companies6, that once the tax rate climbs to 40 percent
                                 companies will cease to export unprocessed minerals as it will no longer be profitable.

                              GDP growth and employment generation are clearly at the center of any country’s
                              development agenda, it is important to highlight that the above logic rests on a number of
                              key assumptions.

The ban may stimulate         First, that the ban will stimulate new investment in smelters and refineries. The extent to
few new investments in        which this is true depends on their economic viability and Indonesia’s share of global ore
domestic smelting and         production, both of which vary across minerals. For copper, lead and zinc, additional
refining, except for in       investments in processing appear unlikely to be economically viable in current conditions

economic viability and        processors are less compelled to invest as they can secure ore supplies elsewhere (Indonesia
global market power…          accounted for less than 2 percent of global production in copper, lead and zinc in 2012 and
                              does not have a major share of reserves for any of these commodities.11) Investments in
                              bauxite and iron ore are more likely to be viable if the raw ore can be accessed cheaply,
                              although bauxite refining is input-intensive (especially for energy), placing Indonesia at a
                              disadvantage compared to other countries such as China. If construction of smelters is not
                              viable in its own right, there will be pressure for government subsidies - mineral producers
                              have already started to call for government financial support to build smelters.12

                            Nickel smelters are likely to be the most viable, as Indonesia is the world's second largest
                            exporter of nickel ore13, and the largest supplier of low-grade nickel ore for Chinese Nickel
                            Pig Iron (NPI) producers14. The ban on export of nickel ore may prompt an increase in
                            smelter investment from Chinese NPI producers in Indonesia in the short term, provided
                            that the considerable energy requirements for a smelter are satisfied.15 However, in the
                            medium to long term, new NPI smelter investments in Indonesia may be limited if Chinese
                            NPI producers secure other low sources of low grade nickel ore, such as the Philippines16,
                            and Chinese stainless steel manufacturers substitute away from NPI.

…Increased mineral          A second key assumption is that increased smelting and refining will increase the share of
processing may not          value added in mineral exports. In reality, mineral processing is input, especially energy,
necessarily raise           intensive so the actual value-addition is far less than the difference in the market prices of
domestic value-             ore and processed minerals. For instance, copper downstream processing has three steps:
addition by as much         concentrating the mined copper ore to increase copper content from 3 to 30 percent;
given the high input        smelting concentrate into blister, which is 99 percent copper; refining blister into copper.
costs…                      About 96 percent of copper’s market value is derived from the first step of concentration,
                            and this is already done on mine site in Indonesia, with only 4 percent of final value
                            generated in copper smelting.17

… The overall impact        A third assumption is that increases in processed mineral exports will be sufficient to offset
on net trade and fiscal     lower unprocessed ore exports (for example, because there will be a gain from an increase in
revenues could be           unprocessed ore prices due to Indonesia lowering global supply). Higher net exports will, in
negative due to high        turn, lead to higher mineral tax revenues and royalties. However, as highlighted, apart from
import costs of             nickel, Indonesia does not have global market power to drive international mineral ore prices
building new                up by reducing its supply. Moreover, the substantial import requirements to build and
smelters…                   operate smelters could offset trade balance gains from increased exports, and the
                            construction costs, and later depreciation charges, of smelters will lower corporate profits
                            and hence income taxes (which constitute two-thirds of mining fiscal revenues). The overall
                            impact on net trade and fiscal revenues could therefore be negative, as discussed below.

… Some better jobs,     Finally, although increased domestic processing may well create some better quality jobs in
but unlikely to be more the sector, the number of new jobs is likely to be limited given that processing is very capital,
jobs in the sector      not labor, intensive. Net job creation (new processing jobs minus lost mineral production
                        jobs) due to this policy is uncertain, but could be negative. Mineral producers have already
                        stated that the reduction in unprocessed mineral exports from the ban will result in
                        thousands of job losses.18

                       c.   Estimating the short- to medium-term fiscal and trade impacts

The current de jure         This section presents the findings of the World Bank’s analysis of the impact of the
policy is likely to lead    unprocessed mineral export ban and tax in the period 2014-17. Overall, the World Bank
to both short and           estimates that there will be a negative impact on net trade of USD 12.5 billion and a total
medium-term negative        loss in fiscal revenues of USD 6.5 billion from the current (as written, de jure) policy during
impacts on Indonesia’s      this period. The negative impact is driven by the increase in imports of smelter/refining
trade balance and           equipment and the fall in unprocessed mineral exports, more than offsetting the potential
fiscal revenues             increase in processed mineral exports.

the near-term trade           already 100 percent processed, the results are driven by copper, nickel, bauxite and iron. In
and fiscal impacts            the model, baseline growth in unprocessed and processed mineral exports is linked to an
                              increase in Chinese import demand for commodities (as China is Indonesia’s main buyer of

                              available evidence this assessment of smelters achieving production by 2017 appears very
                              optimistic, given three factors: firstly, some of these investments are unlikely to be

                              19 The revenue model for export duties and taxes and royalties builds on the trade model as revenues
                                foregone (or extra revenue collected) is simply a function of projected changes in the value of mineral
                                exports multiplied by the export duty/tax/royalty rate. The collection of corporate taxes is a function
                                of company profits, and thus changes in corporate income tax revenues is driven by changes in sales
                                revenues, production costs and depreciation charges. In the absence of detailed information on
                                balance sheets of major companies, these are calculated on the basis of aggregate mineral sector
                                profitability numbers.

                                While the project was expected to commence production in 2014, Eramet announced an indefinite
                                delay in the final investment decision in February 2014 thus increasing the risk that the project will
                                not be completed by 2017. Therefore, the estimates presented are subject to the downside risk that
                                the Weda Bay project does not commence production in 2017.

Given the uncertainty              The analysis estimates the impact of the de jure policy, and two other scenarios, against the
regarding the                      base case of no unprocessed mineral export ban and no export tax:
implementation of the                De Jure Policy (Partial Ban with Export Tax): This scenario reflects a full

policy scenarios were                Full Export Ban Scenario: This was the original policy to be implemented from
analyzed                               January 2014: a ban on unprocessed exports for all minerals. This would also describe
                                       the de facto situation if significant unprocessed exports of minerals currently not
                                       banned are halted due to wrangling over the regulations, as is currently the case. It is
                                       assumed in the model that by 2016 the export tax is high enough to become binding
                                       with companies ceasing unprocessed mineral exports as it is no longer profitable to
                                       do so. Thus, the de jure policy scenario effectively becomes a full export ban from
                                       2016 onwards.
                                     Partial Ban, No Export Tax Scenario: This is an alternative policy scenario: a ban on
                                       nickel and bauxite, without the export tax on the remaining minerals. Compared to the
                                       de jure policy scenario, this scenario provides an estimate of the marginal effect of the
                                       export tax.

Under all scenarios,               Under all three policy scenarios in 2014-2015 there will likely be a significant negative impact
there is a significant             on net trade (Figure 29). The negative impact on net trade relative to the baseline in 2014 is
negative impact on the             estimated to be USD 5.3 billion under the de jure policy scenario and could be as high as
trade balance in 2014-             USD 7 billion under the full ban scenario. This compares to the World Bank’s current
15 and the impact                  baseline current account deficit projection of USD 24.4 billion or 2.9 percent of GDP in
remains negative                   2014, i.e. a sizeable contribution to external financing needs at a time of tightening external
through to 2017 under              financing conditions. The negative impact on net trade in 2015 is estimated to be between
the de jure policy and             USD 1.3 and USD 4.1 billion, depending on the scenario. Under the de jure policy and the
full export ban scenario           full export ban scenarios, the impact on net trade remains negative through to 2017, while
                                   under the scenario of a partial ban with no export tax the impact on net trade turns positive
                                   in 2017.

The negative trade                 The negative impact on net trade is driven partly by a decline in export earnings, with the
impact is driven by the            loss in unprocessed mineral export earnings associated with the ban or a fall in production
loss of unprocessed                due to the export tax offsetting the earnings from additional processed mineral exports until

Under the scenario that     Within the scenarios considered, a full ban on all unprocessed mineral exports generates the
some form of an             most negative estimated impact on net trade and fiscal revenues in the short to medium
unprocessed mineral         term. A partial ban on nickel and bauxite (minerals that have additional smelting capacity

likely to add significant   becomes binding (which is likely at a rate of 40 percent or above) the current de jure policy
pressures on                effectively becomes a full ban. Removing the export tax will reduce the negative impact, but
Indonesia’s trade and       even a partial ban without any export tax is likely to result in a negative impact on net trade
fiscal balances…            and revenues, compared with the base case, over the short and medium term. These negative
                            impacts come at a time when there remains considerable investor focus on Indonesia’s trade
                            balance and the performance of fiscal revenues has weakened.

... other policy options    The fact that a partial export ban, with no export taxes, results in the least negative net trade
should be evaluated,        and fiscal impact of the scenarios considered does not mean that it is good public policy.
looking at broader          Other policies, such as public infrastructure investments in energy, may be more effective in
economic impacts,           increasing domestic processing with lower efficiency costs. Given the likely sizeable negative
second-round effects        impact on trade and fiscal revenues of the ban, it is worthwhile to evaluate a wider set of
and overall efficiency      policy options. A thorough evaluation of a wider set of policy options requires deeper

losses                      economic impacts (on the wider external balances through exchange rate and investment
                            effects, on output and employment, and on corporate balance sheet effects due to possible
                            debt financing, and profitability); differentiating between the minerals as the economic
                            viability of processing differs across minerals; incorporating second-round effects on

                            through general equilibrium analysis. Although it is not covered in this piece, the negative
                            impact on the environment of mineral extraction and processing should also be taken into
                            account.

Box 4: International experience in promoting downstream mineral processing
 Policies to encourage downstream mineral processing are gaining popularity internationally and have taken various forms, from
 restricting exports of unprocessed commodities in one part of the value chain to providing subsidies for downstream processing
 and refining industries. For example, South Africa has imposed export controls on many unprocessed minerals and created
 financing programs to promote value-addition in mineral industries. Several other African countries have taken a similar path, such
 as Botswana in diamonds, Zambia in copper, Ghana in oil, and Mozambique in natural gas and coal. In Australia, tax incentives
 and energy subsidies have been used to promote the downstream steel industry.

 While the policy of promoting forward linkages in the mineral sector has gained popularity, there remains a considerable debate on
 its impact, with a recent cross-country empirical study failing to find positive effects in promoting value-addition in exports. Across
 a wide range of industries, shrinking transport costs have driven a general trend towards global fragmentation of supply chains.
 This trend is also seen in the mineral sector where only a very small number of countries that export unprocessed minerals also
 export the same processed minerals (Figure 29). Hausman et al (2007) investigate the efficacy of mineral downstream processing
 policies on improving value addition in exports using trade data for the period 1975–2000 for all countries and input-output data
 describing supply-chain linkages for 241 products. They find that increases in value added in primary commodities are not
 associated with increases in the share of value added in the country’s export basket in the medium to long term.

 Mining and mineral processing are distinct industries requiring different capabilities; a country with a major mining sector may not
 be able to move profitably into downstream processing. Hausman et al’s research highlights that the development of mineral
 processing capabilities in a country has historically been linked to comparative advantages in other factors (such as energy) rather
 than access to raw mineral ore. Key determinants of the location of smelters or refineries for many minerals revolve around the
 need for complementary inputs like low-cost power, access to land, pollution controls and other regulatory requirements, access to
 low-cost finance, external economies such as markets for by-products, and so on, rather than simply access to nearby minerals.

 Moreover, it is possible to enhance growth performance by focusing on mining and exporting of unprocessed minerals and using
 the associated revenues to make productivity-enhancing investments, with Chile’s experience in managing the copper industry a
 case in point. Chile is the world’s largest exporter of copper, accounting for over 40 percent of total global exports in 2012, and it
 also has the largest copper reserves in the world. Since the 1980s, Chile has not focused on processing copper within the country
 and exports the bulk of its copper as concentrate to China and India where it is smelted further (Figure 29); today copper still
 contributes 50 percent of Chile’s exports. Chile has focused on maximizing revenues from its copper concentrate exports and using
 the proceeds to build a strong human capital base. During this period (1982-2012), when there were also considerable political and
 institutional changes happening, Chile’s per capita income increased dramatically from USD 5,000 to USD 16,000 (in real 2005

East Asia-Pacific is        Disaster- and climate-related risks in East Asia and the Pacific will continue to rise due to

                            Section examines the challenge of making cities more resilient.

Many urban centers          Cities are traditional engines of development, concentrating businesses, knowledge,
are located in              technology, and diverse labor opportunities. However, many urban centers are located in
hazardous zones             hazardous zones: zones that lie at sites of agricultural surplus, such as fertile volcanic soils,
                            or in seismic fault zones, or along major trade and transportation routes, which align with
                            coasts and river systems that are prone to flooding, storm surges, and coastal erosion (Dilley
                            et al. 2005; see also Hallegatte 2011). The increasing concentrations of people and assets in
                            hazardous areas is the largest driver of disaster risk and the greatest challenge in building
                            resilience at global, national and local levels.30

Indonesia’s cities are      Indonesia is leading the rapid urbanization experienced across East Asia. With an average
among the most prone        annual urbanization rate estimated at 4.1 percent between 2000 and 2010, Indonesia is

risks…                      and Thailand (2.8 percent). This has made Indonesia one of the most urbanized countries in
                            Asia, with an urban population share of 54 percent in 2010. Projections of urbanization
                            suggest that this figure will increase to 68 percent by 2025. However, Indonesia has yet to
                            achieve the economic returns to urbanization of other countries. For every additional 1
                            percent that Indonesia urbanizes, it achieves just 2 percent of additional GDP, whereas
                            other countries in the region have achieved a 6-10 percent increase in GDP per 1 percent of
                            urbanization.31

                            all rank highly on climate hazard maps. Scenarios show that higher temperatures, changes in
                            precipitation patterns and rising sea levels could result in inundation of productive coastal
                            zones and more frequent weather-related disasters, which will have increasing negative
                            impacts on agriculture, and food and water supplies. Currently it is estimated that only 20
                            percent of local governments have committed sufficient funding towards infrastructure.
                            Meanwhile, recent studies emphasize the importance of aligning infrastructure development
                            and disaster and climate change impacts to build resilience in mid-sized cities.33

planning and controls      However, without strategically planned investments, policy interventions, and stronger
                           institutional capacity, poorly managed urbanization could act as a constraint to sustainable
                           and inclusive growth, and expose Indonesians to climate change and disaster risks.
                     b. A framework for building urban resilience
Three important steps      The World Bank has introduced a practical framework for building urban resilience in the
towards building urban     East Asia and Pacific region. Three approaches are essential and of particular relevance to
resilience include land-   cities in Indonesia.
use and infrastructure      First is risk-based Land-use and Infrastructure Investment Planning that identifies and
investment planning,             prioritizes investments to improve urban resilience over projected risks. When enacted
urban infrastructure             and enforced, land-use plans can control development in hazard-prone zones, facilitate
upgrading and urban              rescue operations, and provide sites for safe emergency evacuation centers.
ecosystem                   Second is Urban Infrastructure Upgrading. Slum settlements are often found in disaster-
management                       prone areas. The typical characteristics of urban slums (over-crowded, poorly-built
                                 structures, narrow streets or alleys, lack of basic services) make the urban poor more
                                 vulnerable to disaster risks. In order to formulate the appropriate strategy for improving
                                 urban settlements, locations prone to high risks need to be identified and existing assets
                                 in these areas upgraded. For the identified locations, one or more of the strategic urban
                                 upgrading instruments could be applied, such as: (i) applying zoning regulations in
                                 disaster-prone areas (e.g. allowable activities and building codes); (ii) implementing
                                 structural and non-structural instruments for mitigation and evacuation; and (iii)
                                 upgrading the slum’s infrastructure in accordance with the citywide spatial plan.
                            Third is Urban Ecosystem Management, which combines investment planning with
                                 ecosystem restoration. This is essential in reducing disaster risks triggered by
                                 development investments. A number of ecosystem management procedures are relevant
                                 to urban resilience, including watershed management (riverbank area management,
                                 water catchment area management, etc.), coastal zone management, environmental
                                 buffer zones, green infrastructure, and urban landscape design.

                              the geospatial information produced is acceptable as a formal basis for legal zoning.

Failure of local              Addressing disaster and climate risks in hazard prone areas with existing settlements and

allow disaster and          the story line of each city’s overall spatial structure and growth trends, the pattern of disaster
climate risks and           occurrence and the main affected areas, together with all existing urban investment being
corresponding               undertaken (Figure 32). The story line provides a snapshot of how the cities could consider
priorities for resilience   incorporating a resilience component in their public investment. For instance, Balikpapan is
to be clearly               prone to coastal flooding and is about to build a new coastal road. This investment could
identified…                 become part of a coastal zone redevelopment, integrating a water management feature, such
                            as lagoon retention with multi-functions for both flood control and tourism.

… and common                Common themes emerge across the cities, including issues of urban poverty with slum-
themes emerge across        dwelling populations, and traditional disaster risk management challenges for persistent

                            coastal zones and face difficult decisions to balance economic development and protection
                            of coastal ecosystems in these delicate environments. The rapid risk diagnostic highlights
                            opportunities for the six cities to respond to these challenges and start increasing resilience.

                    d. Building resilience with risk sensitive land-use zoning and infrastructure planning
Existing RTRWs form      Detailed spatial and infrastructure planning processes allow cities to incorporate risk
the basis for risk-      mitigation measures into existing practices. For instance, existing RTRWs that have
sensitive RDTRs          recognized disaster and climate risks, such as those in Balikpapan, Denpasar and Yogyakarta,
                         can be further translated into risk-sensitive RDTRs.

Balikpapan is            Balikpapan, under the current RTRW, is implementing several flooding countermeasures,
implementing several     including river normalization, drainage system development and maintenance, as well as
flooding                 construction of a small dam. Public investment has been allocated towards resilience
countermeasures          activities, such as river basin area revitalization, protected forest conservation and drainage
                         system improvements, both at the city and at the residential area level. Similarly, the city is
                         implementing zoning control measures, including strict construction permit issuance for
                         landslide-prone areas. These efforts could be consolidated into risk-sensitive land-use zoning
                         as the basis for investment planning in infrastructure, and the rehabilitation and protection
                         of green space and waterways.

Denpasar could           In Denpasar, risk-based infrastructure investment planning options include accelerating the
establish development    implementation of comprehensive flood and tsunami disaster mitigation by establishing
controls in flood- and   development controls in flood- and tsunami-prone areas. With many new hotel
tsunami-prone areas      developments occurring in the Sanur area, for example, the city government could use
                         building and site permits as an instrument to re-arrange the coastal layout to open more
                         evacuation access to the beach areas as part of its “Tourist-safe Denpasar” campaign.

Yogyakarta has           Yogyakarta, which is confronted with serious hazards from flooding, lahars, landslides and
planned for evacuation   earthquakes, has planned for evacuation sites in its RTRW. These have been identified
sites in its RTRW        throughout the city, including green spaces, city squares and sport centers. Planning
                         measures have restricted development in some zones along the river, with substantial
                         investments in flood, lahar, landslide prevention and control infrastructure. Upgrading
                         informal settlement along the river could be further used as a way to open a buffer zone to
                         mitigate flood impact, but also with multiple functions to develop “kampung walk” tourism
                         potentially benefitting the lower income population from the city’s large tourism market.

                        e.   Building resilience with urban infrastructure upgrading

Opportunities to build       Reclamation has become a popular choice for development in coastal cities. While often
resilience arise with        ambitious, such major urban projects present opportunities to build resilience via urban
major urban projects         infrastructure upgrading, for example where urban upgrading can be incorporated into land
                             reclamation, as in Makassar and Balikpapan.

Makassar can use its         Makassar has a significant number of slum areas including those located in riverbank and
plan to incorporate          tidal prone regions. The city has an ambitious plan for coastal reclamation along the Losari
slum upgrading and           beach, revitalization of the Tallo river tributaries and reclamation along its coastal delta. This
adopt water-sensitive        grand plan can account for resilience by incorporating slum upgrading and adopting the
development                  concept of water sensitive development, to ensure that adequate drainage and sanitation
                             systems are developed and risks are mitigated from coastal as well as inland flooding.

In Balikpapan a new          Balikpapan has six major slum villages containing floating wooden structures along the south
coastal road can be          and west coastal zones. These settlements are highly vulnerable to coastal hazards including
used to upgrade slum         rising sea levels. As the city is also working on a plan for coastal road development, which
areas                        includes reclamation, this project could also be used as the basis to carry out upgrading of
                             nearby slum neighborhoods, drainage improvements for flood mitigation, and revitalization
                             of water retention systems for both water supply and flood control.

                        f.   Building resilience with ecosystem restoration and management

Cities with rivers and       Both Makassar and Palembang demonstrate the importance of building resilience with
wetlands are more            improved ecosystem management and restoration, particularly relevant in Indonesian cities
dependent on the             with rivers and wetlands. In Makassar, urban ecosystem management is needed to revitalize
ecosystem and can            mangrove forests, as well as conserving forests and water catchment areas in the upstream
consider restoration         regions. The aim is to reduce sedimentation in estuaries, particularly the Tallo estuary, which
and conservation as a        has increased due to land conversion and resulting landslides. Ecosystem management may
development approach         offer a more effective land subsidence mitigation approach through the planting of
                             vegetation in recharge areas that would increase water reserve capacity along the coastal
                             areas in order to prevent seawater intrusion. In Palembang, flooding from the Musi river and
                             its tributaries is a chronic issue. In 2012, the city enacted a local regulation to control
                             development of the wetland. This regulation classifies areas for strict conservation and
                             regions available for farming, fishery, plantation, and settlement. Reclamation will provide
                             alternative retention pools and/or water storage to preserve the environmental balance and
                             maintain water quality and flood prevention. This effort could be further expanded to use
                             an ecosystem approach in land and real estate development along the Musi river.

                        g. Now is the time for Indonesia to prioritize urban disaster and climate risk resilience

It is time to invest in      As most Indonesian cities are about to embark on a process of detailed spatial planning in
risk-sensitive detailed      the next 1-2 years, there is an opportunity to seize the momentum to build urban resilience.
spatial plans                Applying rapid risk diagnostics have proven useful as a means to start the conversation on
                             risks and risk mitigation options with city leaders and stakeholders and in identifying the
                             most significant disaster and climate risks. The diagnostics have also identified practical risk
                             mitigation alternatives that cities can undertake through adjustments to on-going urban
                             investment programs.

                   1. Indonesia: Avoiding the trap
Indonesia’s                  Within the next two decades Indonesia aspires to generate prosperity, avoid a middle-
development goals            income trap and leave no one behind as it tries to catch up with high-income economies.
over the next 20 years       These are ambitious goals. Realizing them requires sustained high growth and job creation,
are very ambitious, but      as well as reduced inequality. Can Indonesia achieve them? The World Bank’s forthcoming
they can be achieved         Development Policy Review, titled “Indonesia: Avoiding the Trap” argues that the country
with the right growth        has the potential to rise and become more prosperous and equitable. But the risk of
strategy and a few high      “floating in the middle” is real. Which pathway the economy will take depends on: (i) the
priority structural          adoption of a growth strategy that unleashes the productivity potential of the economy; and
reforms                      (ii) consistent implementation of a few, long-standing, high-priority structural reforms to
                             boost growth and share prosperity more widely. Indonesia is fortunate to have options in
                             financing these reforms without threatening its long-term fiscal outlook. The difficulties lie
                             in getting the reforms implemented in a complex, and decentralized, institutional framework.
                             But Indonesia cannot afford to not try hard. The stakes—both in terms of the payoff from
                             reform and the cost of no reform—are high. “Indonesia: Avoiding the Trap” aims to
                             contribute to the crucial debate over Indonesia’s economic development policy priorities and
                             challenges, and this Section provides a brief summary of its key findings.

Four domestic and            Over the next decade, four domestic and external factors—which good policies can turn
external factors will        into powerful drivers of growth, or “pull factors”—will shape economic prospects. These

manufacturing exports      grow by almost 70 percent since 2005 (Economist Intelligence Unit, 2012). Meanwhile,
                           ongoing Yuan appreciation, with the real effective exchange rate up 30 percent since 2005, is
                           further eroding China’s competitiveness in manufactured goods. These pressures, combined
                           with slower overall economic growth as China rebalances, are likely to prompt investors to
                           look beyond China’s coastal areas. These dynamics offer ASEAN countries, including
                           Indonesia, an opportunity to attract more investments in their manufacturing industries.

But there are two key      However, while none of these potentially favorable factors will be captured without reforms,
risks                      there are two risks: a risk of a slowdown in long-term growth and a risk of growth not
                           becoming inclusive enough.

First, without             International experience shows that growth slowdowns can occur at all levels of income

of a growth slowdown       from 1981, when its GDP per capita stood at USD 3,939 (slightly above Indonesia’s GDP
in Indonesia               per capita today), it embarked in a prolonged relative growth slowdown, until 2004.34
                           Similarly, Mexico experienced more than 20 years of a prolonged growth slowdown past
                           1981 when its GDP per capita was USD 6,965. These experiences suggest that Indonesia
                           cannot take its solid growth performance for granted. In fact, this growth was driven by a
                           very favorable external environment: the commodity boom experienced in 2003-11
                           combined with low global interest rates since 2009 supported corporate revenues, household
                           incomes and government revenues, and led to a significant jump in domestic demand.35
                           Going forward, Indonesia can no longer count on any growth stimulus from external
                           factors. As mentioned above, since 2011, commodity prices have softened significantly. With
                           the normalization of US growth, the US Federal Reserve’s quantitative easing policy—which
                           led to low global interest rates—is being gradually unwound, increasing financing costs, with
                           knock-on implications for investment. As these external support factors fade, without
                           structural reforms, the material risk of a growth slowdown exists for Indonesia.

Second, there is also a    Even if Indonesia manages to avoid a prolonged growth slowdown, growth may not be

growth needs to be         Along with the poor, this group remains highly vulnerable to food price increases, health
fostered and not taken     shocks and natural disasters. One reason for the persistent vulnerability is that the poorest
as granted                 households experienced a small increase in real incomes compared with richer ones. In
                           2003-10, real growth of per capita consumption was 1.3 percent per annum for the poorest
                           40 percent of households, compared with 3.5 percent for the next 40 percent, and 5.9
                           percent for the top 20 percent (Figure 35). Moreover, an increasing amount of consumption
                           inequality in Indonesia is explained by differences amongst people in access to opportunities.
                           In 2002, 27 percent of child consumption inequality was due to differences in their gender,
                           the gender and employment status of the head of their household, their parents’ education,
                           and their region and location of birth. By 2012, this reached 37 percent. Thus going forward,
                           equitable growth needs to be fostered and not taken as granted.




                           34 A commodity-rich country similar to Indonesia, Brazil benefitted significantly from a commodity
                             boom in 2004-11. This favorable external factor explains parts of the strong growth recovery in that

                             well as the value of other assets purchased on the back of commodity incomes or wealth (real estate
                             properties, land and securities), significantly encouraged consumption and investment against these
                             assets and generated multiplier effects in the economy.

Indonesia can only                                       Given the opportunities and risks discussed above, and Indonesia’s aspiration of shared

also the only way to                                     over time, cross-country evidence shows that 92 percent of the differences in GDP per

wages                                                    productivity (IMF, 2013). Thus, for Indonesia’s GDP per capita to converge rapidly to high-
                                                         income economies, boosting economic growth through increasing labor productivity will be
                                                         crucial. A productivity-driven growth strategy is also important for Indonesia to reduce
                                                         vulnerability and enhance firms’ competitiveness. Indeed, the political pressure for
                                                         increasing wages is unlikely to weaken in Indonesia. In this context, the only way to
                                                         accommodate wage increases without jeopardizing competitiveness is to increase labor
                                                         productivity.

                                                         by regional standards. For instance, Malaysia’s average productivity per worker is more than
                                                         five times Indonesia’s. Average labor productivity in Indonesia is also lower than in
                                                         Thailand, the Philippines and China. Differences in productivity reflect the structure of
                                                         economies. In Indonesia, more than 50 percent of workers are in two low productivity

                                                         this weighs heavily on average productivity.

To increase aggregate      Aggregate labor productivity growth has two sources. First, productivity growth within
labor productivity         economic sectors, e.g., higher yields in agriculture thanks to the use of higher-yielding seeds.
Indonesia needs to         This type of “within sector” productivity growth typically results from greater use of capital
improve both               by workers (more modern machines and equipment), improvements in the quality of labor
productivity “within       (better trained workers), adoption of new technology and competition within sectors that
sectors” and facilitate    lead to a larger number of efficient firms. Second, aggregate productivity growth can be
the movement of            achieved by the movement of labor (and capital or other inputs to production) from low to
resources from low to      higher productivity growth sectors (a “structural-transformation effect”, McMillan and
high productivity          Rodrik, 2011). For instance, when workers leave agriculture and work in higher productivity
sectors                    sectors (e.g., as a result of investment in agriculture that increases yields), the aggregate
                           productivity of the economy increases. Policies that typically facilitate such movements are
                           improvements in transport infrastructure and labor market flexibility.

                           productivity to agriculture. Moving a worker from agriculture to the low-end services
                           subsectors (wholesale and retail trade and personal, social services and construction) leads to
                           a doubling of productivity on average. This movement has largely occurred over the past
                           decade and has been the key driver of poverty reduction. Seventeen of the 20 million jobs
                           created in 2001-11 occurred in services, mostly in the low-end segment. The next phase of
                           Indonesia’s structural transformation should seek to expand the movement of labor and job
                           creation in the manufacturing sector and high-end services.38 Despite the sharp decline in
                           manufacturing productivity growth in the past decade, the average productivity of workers in
                           manufacturing industries remains fully five times higher than that in agriculture.39 Job
                           creation in manufacturing and high-end services is clearly a recipe for increasing productivity
                           and reducing vulnerability in Indonesia.

                      c.   Policy priorities to support productivity growth: first, infrastructure

There are three priority   “Indonesia: Avoiding the Trap” identifies three priority areas to foster productivity-driven
areas: infrastructure,     growth: (i) closing the infrastructure gap; (ii) closing the skills gap; and (iii) improving the
skills and improving       functioning of product, labor and capital markets. These are long-standing, well-known
the functioning of         priorities, but progress in addressing them has been uneven. Decentralized decision-making
markets                    since the early 2000s has complicated and slowed implementation, especially in infrastructure
                           development and labor market functioning (such as minimum wage setting). Yet, there are a
                           few key policies that can make a big difference under each of these priority areas.




                           38 The skills requirement for entering the high-end services sector is however higher, implying that the
                             scope for job creation in manufacturing is much larger given the average levels of skills in the labor
                             force.
                           39 In the past decade, labor productivity growth in agriculture increased (driven by rubber, palm oil,

                             coffee and tea) and dropped to almost zero in manufacturing. The sharpest decline in labor
                             productivity growth occurred however in mining and quarrying.

Improving the quality     Improving the quality of public spending will be critical for infrastructure development and
of public spending will   infrastructure service delivery in Indonesia.40 Total infrastructure investment—that is,
be critical for           investment by the central government, sub-national governments, state-owned enterprises
addressing Indonesia’s    and the private sector—has remained at only 3 percent to 4 percent of GDP over the past
infrastructure needs      decade (Figure 36). This is far below the rates of above 7 percent of GDP before the 1997
                          Asian financial crisis and the 10 percent and 7.5 percent spent by China and India,
                          respectively. Scaling up infrastructure spending, both on new investments but also,
                          importantly, on operation and maintenance, rests on improving the quality of public
                          spending at the central and sub-national government levels.

Fuel subsidy reform       At the central government level, large fuel subsidy spending (2.6 percent of GDP and 21
would greatly help        percent of the central government budget after transfers to the regions and interest
towards better quality    payments) is almost double the spending on infrastructure, which stands at 1 percent of
spending                  GDP. Improving the quality of spending can be greatly supported by fuel subsidy reform. A
                          more-than-doubling of government-wide infrastructure spending (from 2.5 percent of GDP)
                          can come from reducing energy subsidies. Any such reallocation would need to be
                          accompanied by further improvements in the areas of budget planning and execution so as
                          to improve absorptive capacity and ensure the quality of infrastructure investment
                          management and implementation.

Sub-national              Sub-national governments spend more on infrastructure than the central government (1.5
governments need to       percent of GDP versus 1 percent of GDP). But sub-national governments could spend
be incentivized to        much more to improve roads, water and sanitation and health infrastructure (both in terms
spend less on             of new investments and maintenance) if their budgets were not tied up by excessive
personnel and more on     spending on personnel and if they could raise more revenues themselves. Over 40 percent of
infrastructure            sub-national government spending is on personnel and about 90 percent of their budgets
                          come from the central government (fiscal transfers). Improving the fiscal transfer system to
                          incentivize greater reallocation of spending to infrastructure requires moving to some form
                          of performance-based transfers and increasing the share of the transfers tied to spending on
                          sectors or areas of national priorities.41 For municipalities that meet fiscal prudence and
                          fiduciary risk criteria, alternative means of financing, such as PPPs, municipal bonds, and
                          intermediary financing can be promoted.

Four other                For increased spending to be effective in reducing the infrastructure gap, however, the
complementary             following complementary reforms will be needed: (i) stronger coordination within the central
reforms will also be      government and across levels of government; (ii) a reform of the government and state-
needed to reduce the      owned utility companies’ processes to enhance project selection and planning; (iii) an
infrastructure gap        effective implementation of the new land law; and (iv) strong partnership with private
                          domestic and foreign investors to bridge the funding gap.

The payoffs from          The growth payoff of greater investment in infrastructure is large. Under-investment in
improving                 infrastructure has been a substantial drag on Indonesia’s growth over the past decade.42 The
infrastructure            consequent slow growth in the infrastructure capital stock relative to the pace of economic
investment in terms of    and urbanization growth has contributed to serious capacity gaps, congestion problems and

                          40 Infrastructure development is not only about money. Land acquisition, coordination between
                            different levels of government and project selection process are all equally important constraints. The
                            Government is aware of this and is working on each of them. For instance a new land bill is under
                            discussion at the Parliament. This land bill is expected to facilitate access to land for public purposes.
                          41 Fiscal transfers to sub-national governments are dominated by a “block grant” component (DAU)

                            relative to transfers tied to special purposes. Block grant transfers are untied, facilitating excessive
                            subnational personnel expenditure, leaving little space for transfers that could be tied to front-line
                            service provider levels. In 2012, the DAU made up almost 60 percent of central government transfers
                            to subnational governments. The specific purpose grant (DAK), allocated to certain regions with the
                            aim of funding special activities of the region in accordance with national priorities, only cover 6
                            percent of these transfers and is highly fragmented (covers too many sectors).
                          42 If Indonesia’s real infrastructure capital stock had growth by 5 percent annually over 2001-11 versus

                            the actual growth rate of 3 percent it is estimated that annual real GDP growth would have been 0.5
                            percentage points higher. See the October 2013 IEQ for further details.

higher growth and           poor logistics performance, undermining productivity growth. Firm surveys show that
better access to            problems with transportation are among the worst business constraints for urban
services are significant    manufacturing firms while rural producers find themselves unable to compete with imports
                            in urban areas. Thus, clearly, connective infrastructure development can help leverage

                            of agriculture, rural non-farm industries and urban manufacturing sectors. Furthermore,
                            because one-quarter of urban populations and more than half of rural dwellers have poor
                            access to transport services, improving infrastructure is key in enhancing overall economic
                            and social well-being in Indonesia.

                       d. Policy priorities to support productivity growth: second, skills

Indonesia needs to          Enhancing the quality of education and the functioning of training centers will be crucial in
improve the quality of      closing Indonesia’s skills gap. Today, two-thirds of firms complain that finding suitable
education and the           employees for professional and managerial positions is either “difficult” or “very difficult”;
functioning of training     and almost 70 percent of employers in manufacturing report finding it “very difficult” to fill
centers if it is to close   skilled professional-level positions (engineers). There are two types of mismatch. Some
the skills gap.             sectors report insufficient graduates as the reason (for example, in textiles), whereas other
                            sectors complain about the skills of existing graduates (for example, in rubber and plastics).
                            Meanwhile, firms in Indonesia are much less likely to offer training to their employees than
                            in other countries in the region. Most existing training-providers are concentrated in low-
                            value-added areas (such as beauty salon and spa skills and basic computer skills). Finally, in
                            terms of the level of core academic skills, Indonesia compares unfavorably with other
                            middle-income economies and East Asian neighbors in learning assessments such as PISA.
                            For instance, 15-year-old students in Indonesia have learning levels far below their peers in
                            Vietnam, even though per-capita income is higher.

Indonesia has already       Public policy has so far focused on access to education and enrollment. Thanks to strong
made significant            government commitment Indonesia will probably boast one of the largest numbers of
progress in improving       college-goers in the world in years to come.43 Over the past five years, the labor force with
access to education         tertiary and secondary levels of education has increased by more than 1 million and more
and enrollment rates        than 2 million annually, respectively. If recent trends in enrollment continue, the number of
                            Indonesians with tertiary education can more than double in the next decade.44

Now it needs to focus       Thus, going forward the focus should be on equipping graduates and workers with the right
on a three-pronged          technical and employer-valued behavioral skills (discipline, reliability, teamwork and
strategy to improve the     leadership) to support/enable large investments in key sectors such as manufacturing. This
skills of the labor force   requires a three-pronged reform strategy. First, improve the quality of basic education to
                            build a stronger base of cognitive skills necessary to acquire the higher-level skills that will be
                            needed by the workforce. A single key measure that could support this is strengthening the
                            quality assurance system to ensure that quality assessments are followed-up and education
                            institutions have the incentive to implement corrective actions.

But it is essential to      However, even if the educational system could be perfected instantly, the first graduates
find short- and             would only join the workforce in about 10-20 years’ time. It is therefore essential to find
medium-term solutions       short- and medium-term solutions for the current skills constraints: the second and third
to the skills gap           prongs of the strategy are thus improving the relevance of feeders into the labor market
                            (technical and vocational education, and tertiary education) and upgrading the skills of the
                            existing workforce (reform of the training system). Improving the relevance of vocational
                            and tertiary education calls for (i) supplying students and graduates with more information
                            on labor market opportunities, and (ii) making the system more responsive to the market’s


                            43 This commitment is seen in the Constitutional mandate that 20 percent of the budget should be
                              allocated to education.
                            44 The Government’s objective is to provide universal access to senior secondary education through a

                              compulsory 12 years of education and to double enrollment in higher education by 2020. The share of
                              individuals with tertiary education in the labor force stood at 8 percent in 2012.

Developing skills will         The growth payoff of skills development is large, if difficult to quantify. Because more than

need to improve the            governing business conduct in many sectors have, in recent years, sent mixed signals to
way product, labor,            investors and increased uncertainty for businesses. For instance, a number of sector-specific
capital and land               laws and measures announced recently are either inconsistent with previous laws or create
markets function               confusion about the direction of reforms (e.g. conflicts between the horticulture law versus
                               the investment law). In the mining sector, irrespective of how the new regulation banning
                               exports of mineral ores is ultimately applied, the repeated policy shifts have increased
                               uncertainty (as highlighted in the preceding section). The new industry and trade laws
                               provide ministerial authorities with new, sweeping authority to intervene in the market,
                               increasing uncertainty and the cost of doing business.

                               45The land market is also very important for public and private investment. A comprehensive land law,
                                currently being discussed by the Parliament, is expected to address some of the key issues that have
                                constrained investments in recent years.

Strengthened policy       The upside in the investment climate area is that some of the uncertainty created by recent
formation should help     laws and regulations can be addressed by strengthening the quality of the policy formation
to improve the            process for economic policies and regulations. Some countries have done this by
investment climate        empowering ministries or government agencies to play a “policy integrator” function. A
                          strengthened and integrated policy formation process can help ensure that market
                          competition is fostered and anti-competitive practices are limited, and that the policy
                          environment supports inward FDI and frontier technology knowledge flows, and the
                          potential benefits they can bring. A strengthened policy formation should also better address
                          genuine concerns of Indonesians that the public interest be protected, and should enable the
                          Government to push back against more narrow rent-seeking activities and self-centered
                          business interests. This is all the more important given that Indonesian law courts, local
                          governments and politicians poorly in terms of the corruption perception index (for
                          example, in 2012, Transparency International ranked Indonesia 100 out of 183 countries
                          reviewed).

Revising the labor law,   Usefully complementing efforts to clarify rules for business conduct would be measures to
to make it more           ameliorate the functioning of labor and capital markets. Indonesia’s labor market presents an
flexible and inclusive,   insider-outsider feature, with a minority of workers formally protected and a large majority
would greatly support     of workers obliged to work in the informal sector. This divide reflects levels of employment
Indonesia’s structural    protection similar to several European countries (e.g. high level of severance pay) and
transformation            relatively high statutory minimum wages. In addition, the minimum-wage-setting process has
                          become uncertain in recent years although the recent introduction of a new formula indexed
                          on CPI inflation and productivity can help address this.46

                          Although the labor legislation does not apply to most workers (as there are many possible
                          exclusions for employers and the Government’s enforcement ability is limited), it impedes
                          productivity growth and structural transformation. For instance, workers’ entry into fully
                          formal sectors is restricted because employers in these sectors account for the high potential
                          cost of dismissal when making hiring decisions. As a result, most workers operate informally
                          or semi-informally, work on short-term contracts and are not trained as a long-term asset for
                          firms. Thus, workers leaving for instance farm or rural non-farm activities are stuck into
                          slightly higher but still low-productivity sectors and do not gain significant social mobility. A
                          revision of the labor law, in view of making it more flexible and inclusive, would greatly
                          support Indonesia’s structural transformation objectives. Such revision requires an
                          agreement between employers, workers and the Government. Similarly, the adoption of a
                          new minimum-wage-setting formula based on inflation and productivity by these parties
                          would support competitiveness and jobs.

Meanwhile,                As regards the capital markets, there is ample evidence that enterprises in Indonesia are
Indonesia’s capital       credit constrained (IMF, 2012)47. Firms, to a large extent, tend to rely more on retained
markets are thin,         earnings than on bank credit for the expansion of their activities, which in turn means that

investments               innovative firms that usually have negative cash flows in the early stages of operation, and
                          need bank or non-bank financing to grow and create high-quality jobs.

                          The credit constraint faced by firms reflects the lack of depth of Indonesia’s financial
                          market. The financial sector is dominated by banks (78 percent of assets) and its claims to
                          the private sector stand at only 35 percent compared with close to 100 percent on average

                          46 The minimum wage-setting process is complex. Negotiations and final agreements take place at the

                          province and sectoral level (and often at the district and subsector level), making communication and
                          compliance with new formula-based adjustments more difficult. More generally, ensuring the
                          compliance of firms and employers to minimum wage regulations is not easy, and requires monitoring
                          and coordination at the central level, between the Ministry of Manpower and relevant ministries for
                          effective implementation, as well as between central and local governments and relevant actors
                          (District Governors and Wage Councils).

intermediaries             recent years but still do not contribute significantly to the pool of domestic long-term
                           savings and investments.48 Public policy can however nudge the system towards greater
                           financial depth. For instance, the development of the corporate bond market appears
                           particularly constrained by strict investment requirements, high underwriting costs and
                           weaknesses in the execution regime. Besides this, international experience emphasizes the
                           role of building a credible legal system that allows for the effective enforcement of contracts
                           and property rights and provides investor protection. Financial contracts are defined and
                           made more or less effective by legal rights and enforcement mechanisms. From this
                           perspective, improving Indonesia’s legal system would facilitate the operations of markets
                           and intermediaries. This relates to improving the quality of the business environment more
                           broadly, as financial sector actors, just as investors themselves, need a minimum level of
                           certainty when making long-term financing decisions.

                      f.   What policy priorities to ensure that prosperity is shared more widely?

Policies need to ensure    Indonesia’s public policy challenge is not only to support policies that generate prosperity.
that prosperity is         Another challenge facing policymakers is that of sharing prosperity more widely. Indeed, a
shared more widely         large number of households classified as non-poor in terms of income/ consumption are
                           poor in many other dimensions, including access to decent housing, transportation, water,
                           sanitation, health and education. At the same time, despite Indonesia’s success in reducing
                           poverty, the slowing pace of progress in recent years and high vulnerability remain a
                           concern. Finally, Indonesia’s hard-fought poverty reduction outcomes are constantly under
                           threat, due to the country’s vulnerability to natural disasters such as earthquakes, tsunamis,
                           volcanic eruptions, floods, landslides and forest fires. The last part of “Indonesia: Avoiding
                           the Trap” discusses three key priority areas to address these challenges.

Access to key services     For the poor, the vulnerable and some in the middle-class, higher income and prosperity will

                           The hopes placed on decentralization reforms to improve public services have yet to
                           materialize and decisive reforms will be necessary to improve service delivery.
                           Priority reform options include: (i) clarifying missions, refocusing the bureaucracy to be
                           accountable for results; (ii) providing more resources to front-line services and less on
                           personnel and administration, which requires amending the central government transfer
                           system to increase the proportion of local governments’ budgets tied to specific sectors and
                           performance and; (iii) strengthening of community-driven programs and demand-side

                       g. The stakes are high: the payoffs to reform and the costs of no reform

If Indonesia can grow      The costs of no reform are as high as the potential rewards for well implemented reforms.
by 6.5 percent annually    First, the population of working age is projected to increase significantly in the next 10 years
it could create 12.4       before peaking as a share of the total population around 2025. Most of the additional 14.8
million new jobs by        million individuals that will join the population of working age by 2020 will seek jobs and
2020                       absorbing them will require fast economic growth. Based on the sensitivity of employment
                           to growth for the period 1990-2012, if Indonesia grows by 6.5 percent annually the country
                           would create 12.4 million new jobs by 2020. This compares favorably with the employment
                           creation if the country grows by only 5.0 percent per annum: 10.2 more million jobs by
                           2020. Thus, the difference between growing by 5.0 percent and 6.5 percent is a significant
                           2.2 million jobs over the eight years, which is significant.

 Ringkasan Eksekutif: Menanggapi berbagai tekanan




Menanggapi                Kuartal kedua tahun 2013 merupakan kuartal yang penting, dimana perekonomian,
peningkatan tekanan       kebijakan-kebijakan, dan pasar keuangan Indonesia mengalami penyesuaian terhadap
dan berbagai peristiwa    tekanan-tekanan yang telah meningkat selama beberapa kuartal terakhir dan terhadap
terbaru, kuartal kedua    perubahan lingkungan perekonomian global. Setelah mencatat pertumbuhan yang sedikit
tahun 2013 mencatat       lebih lemah dari perkiraan pada kuartal pertama, terdapat tanda-tanda bahwa permintaan
perkembangan yang         dalam negeri, terutama investasi, terus mengalami perlambatan. Pada sisi fiskal, kombinasi
signifikan dalam          penurunan pendapatan dan peningkatan belanja subsidi terus menekan keuangan
ekonomi, kebijakan,       pemerintah. Anggaran Pendapatan dan Belanja Negara Perubahan (APBN-P), yang
dan pasar keuangan di     menyertakan kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi yang telah lama ditunggu-tunggu, bersama
Indonesia                 dengan paket kompensasi yang menyeluruh untuk mengurangi dampak peningkatan harga
                          BBM bagi rakyat miskin, disetujui pada tanggal 17 Juni. Sementara itu, pasar keuangan
                          internasional bereaksi kuat terhadap prospek berakhirnya kebijakan pelonggaran kuantitatif
                          (quantitative easing) di Amerika Serikat (AS) pada kuartal-kuartal berikut, yang mendorong

                       dari perkiraan, terutama China. Faktor-faktor tersebut memicu tajamnya peningkatan
                       penjualan aset-aset negara berkembang dan gejolak pasar, termasuk di Indonesia. Sebagian
                       besar nilai tukar mata uang pasar-pasar berkembang mencatat depresiasi terhadap dolar AS,

                        Juni. Aliran keluar itu berkontribusi kepada penurunan ekuitas Indonesia sebesar 4 persen

Pemintaan luar negeri   Bank Dunia tetap memperkirakan peningkatan pertumbuhan ekonomi global yang stabil dan
diproyeksikan akan      bertahap pada kuartal-kuartal berikut. Hal ini mencerminkan proyeksi melambatnya kegiatan
meningkat dengan        ekonomi pada negara berpenghasilan tinggi, di mana pertumbuhan pada umumnya tetap
lambat pada kuartal-    lambat namun dengan tren yang menguat, yang terbantu oleh kokohnya pemulihan sektor
kuartal berikut         swasta AS dan prospek pertumbuhan ekonomi yang lebih kuat di Jepang, sementara kondisi
                        ekonomi di zona Euro masih tetap menantang. Jalur pertumbuhan negara-negara
                        berkembang juga tidak merata, tetapi diperkirakan akan sedikit menguat. Secara keseluruhan,
                        negara-negara mitra dagang Indonesia diproyeksikan akan mencatat pertumbuhan sebesar
                        3,4 persen pada tahun 2013, sama dengan pertumbuhan tahun 2012, dengan penurunan
                        sebesar 0,3 poin persentase dibanding proyeksi Triwulanan Maret 2013, yang mencerminkan
                        realisasi pertumbuhan kuartal pertama yang dibawah perkiraan, seperti yang terjadi di China.
                        Pertumbuhan para mitra perdagangan utama diproyeksikan akan meningkat menjadi 4,0
                        persen pada tahun 2014. Prospek pertumbuhan dunia yang masih lambat, dan penguatan
                        dolar AS selama gejolak pasar baru-baru ini, juga terus menekan harga-harga komoditas,
                        dengan harga komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia juga turun selama kuartal tersebut.

APBN-P telah            APBN-P 2013 dilakukan ditengah perlemahan kondisi pasar keuangan dan tanda-tanda
disahkan dan harga      perlemahan momentum pertumbuhan diantara beberapa negara berkembang lainnya.
BBM bersubsidi telah    Beberapa hal penting dari APBN-P yang disetujui oleh DPR termasuk revisi proyeksi belanja
dinaikkan               subsidi BBM (hingga Rp 200 triliun), dengan harga BBM bersubsidi akan segera dinaikkan,
                        dan paket kompensasi untuk mengurangi dampak harga kenaikan BBM terhadap rumah
                        tangga miskin. Defisit anggaran tahun 2013 telah direvisi naik sebesar 0,7 poin persentase
                        menjadi 2,4 persen dari PDB, karena penurunan proyeksi pendapatan nominal, sejalan
                        dengan antisipasi pertumbuhan PDB yang lebih lemah, dan jumlah belanja yang lebih besar
                        (termasuk untuk subsidi BBM, walau harganya baru saja ditingkatkan). Harga BBM
                        bersubsidi naik secara efektif mulai 22 Juni dengan peningkatan harga premium bersubsidi
                        sebesar 44 persen menjadi Rp 6.500 per liter dan harga solar bersubsidi naik sebesar 22
                        persen menjadi Rp 5.500 per liter.

Walaupun tetap tidak    Kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi yang signifikan merupakan sebuah reformasi yang besar,
pasti, penghematan      dan mengikuti hilangnya kesempatan penyesuaian harga pada tahun 2012. Dalam jangka
fiskal dari reformasi   pendek reformasi ini membantu membatasi peningkatan defisit APBN tahun 2013. Dalam
subsidi BBM             jangka panjang, reformasi itu menjadi bagian dari tanggapan yang dibutuhkan dalam
kemungkinan cukup       penyesuaian yang sedang berlangsung dalam perekonomian Indonesia – meningkatkan
besar                   permintaan terhadap impor energi karena kuatnya pertumbuhan dan penurunan produksi
                        minyak dalam negeri, dan, yang sangat penting, desakan untuk mengarahkan kembali belanja
                        fiskal secara lebih efisien dan merata untuk mendukung agenda pembangunan Indonesia.
                        Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa penghematan fiskal langsung dari peningkatan harga
                        BBM bersubsidi akan mencapai Rp 42 triliun pada 2013, dan meningkat menjadi Rp 85
                        triliun pada tahun 2014, yang merupakan tahun penuh pertama dengan harga yang baru.
                        Walau signifikan, perkiraan penghematan dasar (baseline) ini sangat tidak pasti. Peningkatan
                        harga energi global atau berlanjutnya perlemahan Rupiah dapat meningkatkan selisih antara
                        harga bersubsidi dan harga pasar, sehingga mendorong belanja subsidi menjadi lebih tinggi,
                        walau penyesuaian harga baru saja dilakukan. Dengan demikian, masih terdapat alasan yang
                        kuat untuk terus melanjutkan reformasi ini dengan meningkatkan fleksibilitas harga-harga
                        bersubsidi dan membawa mereka lebih dekat dengan harga pasar.

Peningkatan inflasi       Dampak paket reformasi subsidi BBM terhadap ekonomi makro diperkirakan akan dapat
yang bersifat             ditangani dan sebagian besar bersifat jangka pendek. Paket reformasi itu diperkirakan hanya
sementara merupakan       akan membawa dampak negatif jangka pendek yang kecil terhadap pertumbuhan, dengan
dampak utama              dampak negatif bagi daya beli kaum miskin akan diimbangi secara signifikan dengan paket
ekonomi makro dalam       kompensasi. Harga BBM yang lebih tinggi pada awalnya akan membawa dampak yang besar
jangka pendek             terhadap inflasi, dengan meningkatkan rata-rata inflasi tahunan pada tahun 2013 sebesar
                          sekitar 1,8 poin persentase menjadi 7,2 persen, dan memuncak pada kisaran 9 persen tahun-
                          ke-tahun (yoy) menjelang akhir tahun. Penyesuaian itu hanyalah peningkatan harga satu kali
                          saja, yang berarti bahwa dampak inflasi akan berangsur menghilang pada pertengahan tahun
                          2014, dengan asumsi bahwa perkiraan inflasi jangka panjang tidak terpengaruh dan kebijakan
                          moneter tetap cepat tanggap terhadap tanda-tanda tekanan harga putaran kedua. Bank Dunia
                          memperkirakan bahwa peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi akan menurunkan defisit neraca
                          berjalan sebesar 0,2 poin persentase dari PDB pada 2013, dibanding bila tanpa reformasi.
                          Dalam jangka menengah, dampak terhadap neraca luar negeri Indonesia akan sulit untuk
                          diukur namun akan tetap positif secara umum, dengan mendorong penggunaan BBM impor
                          secara lebih efisien dan dengan mendorong kepercayaan investor terhadap kebijakan dan
                          posisi fiskal Indonesia.

Prospek pertumbuhan      Pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia mengalami perlambatan pada kuartal pertama tahun 2013
telah melemah,           sebesar 6,0 persen yoy sedikit lebih lemah dari yang diperkirakan sebelumnya. Prospek
mendorong penurunan      ekonomi juga melemah, dengan semakin menurunnya harga komoditas dan adanya indikasi
proyeksi Bank Dunia      perlambatan pertumbuhan investasi yang lebih besar dibanding perkiraan awal. Menurunnya
terhadap pertumbuhan     kepercayaan konsumen sebagai antisipasi reformasi subsidi BBM, karena kenaikan inflasi
PDB 2013, menjadi 5,9    sementara, dan koreksi terhadap pasar saham/aset akhir-akhir ini, juga membebani
persen                   permintaan dalam negeri. Lambatnya pertumbuhan ekspor bersih diperkirakan akan
                         menghilang pada sisa tahun 2013, walau pemulihan ekspor diperkirakan akan lebih lemah
                         dan pertumbuhan impor diperkirakan akan lebih kecil, yang mencerminkan melamhnya
                         prospek investasi. Secara keseluruhan, Bank Dunia telah menurunkan proyeksi pertumbuhan
                         PDB-nya untuk tahun 2013 menjadi 5,9 persen, dari 6,2 persen seperti yang diproyeksikan

Indonesia dihadapi     sedikit melambat untuk tahun 2013, dan kembali meningkat pada 2014, terdapat risiko yang
pada berbagai risiko … tinggi terhadap perlambatan yang lebih besar. Risiko ini dapat didorong oleh perlemahan

                       signifikan, dengan pentingnya kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan komoditas terhadap
                       pendapatan dalam valuta asing, keuntungan dunia usaha dan kegiatan investasi.
                       Ketidakpastian yang akhir-akhir ini terjadi terhadap perkembangan ekonomi China juga

…yang menekankan         Peristiwa-peristiwa akhir-akhir ini dan prospek base case bagi kuartal-kuartal yang akan datang
perlunya kebijakan       menunjukkan bahwa penetapan kebijakan Indonesia tampaknya harus menyesuaikan kepada
ekonomi makro yang       kondisi ekonomi yang sedikit melemah, dan kemungkinan kondisi pembiayaan luar negeri
tetap tanggap terhadap   yang lebih sulit. Keputusan Bank Indonesia untuk meningkatkan BI Rate dan suku bunga
perubahan keadaan…       overnight pada awal bulan Juni, dan peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi, merupakan contoh-
                         contoh kebijakan untuk menyesuaikan diri terhadap dinamika keadaan, yang dapat
                         membantu mengamankan stabilitas makro, demi pertumbuhan di masa depan. Mengizinkan
                         kurs tukar Rupiah terus menyesuaikan secara bertahap juga dapat membantu, bila hal ini
                         dapat mendukung posisi eksternal Indonesia. Menjaga pendekatan yang fleksibel, dapat
                         diprediksi dan dikomunikasikan dengan baik dalam pembuatan kebijakan ekonomi makro,

…dan pentingnya          Peningkatan belanja sosial dalam APBN-P, sebagian untuk membantu melindungi keluarga
mengarahkan kembali      miskin dari dampak kenaikan harga BBM, cukup signifikan, dan rancangan paket kompensasi
belanja untuk            sosial menunjukkan pengambilan langkah-langkah yang penting menuju sistem jaminan sosial
kelompok yang paling     yang lebih menyeluruh, terintegrasi dan memiliki penargetan yang baik. Paket kompensasi
rentan, dimana paket     yang disetujui berjumlah Rp 29 triliun, atau sekitar tiga per empat dari perkiraan
kompensasi reformasi     penghematan subsidi BBM pada tahun 2013. Paket kompensasi itu terdiri dari dua
subsidi BBM              komponen utama. Pertama, Program Kompensasi Khusus, yang termasuk Bantuan
berkontribusi dalam      Langsung Sementara Masyarakat (BLSM) bagi 15,5 juta keluarga termiskin di Indonesia

                         dan peningkatan belanja bagi program-program infrastruktur. Kedua, di bawah Program
                         Percepatan dan Perluasan Perlindungan Sosial (P4S), belanja untuk program-program
                         bantuan keuangan bagi pelajar miskin dan Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH), mengalami
                         peningkatan. Bukti-bukti dari pengalaman Indonesia dalam pemberian bantuan tunai

                         bantuan yang memadai, tepat waktu dan efektif bagi perlindungan keluarga yang miskin dan
                         rentan sehingga setidaknya mereka dapat menghadapi pengaruh dari kenaikan harga BBM,

 A. Perkembangan Ekonomi dan Fiskal Terkini




                 1. Aset-aset pasar negara berkembang turun tajam dalam beberapa
                    bulan terakhir
Aset-aset emerging      Perkembangan pasar keuangan internasional pada kuartal kedua telah memberikan pengingat
market turun dengan     yang jelas akan kerentanan berkelanjutan di pasar negara berkembang (emerging market),
tajam, sebagai          termasuk Indonesia, terhadap cepatnya perubahan kondisi keuangan dunia. Prospek
penyesuaian terhadap    penurunan pelonggaran kuantitatif (quantitative easing) di AS, dan penilaian kembali terhadap
informasi baru tentang outlook pertumbuhan ekonomi relatif pada ekonomi-ekonomi berpenghasilan tinggi dan
pelonggaran kuantitatif berkembang utama, memicu penjualan besar-besaran aset-aset pasar negara berkembang.
(quantitative easing)   Imbal hasil surat utang pemerintah AS mulai meningkat dengan tajam pada awal bulan Mei,
dan outlook ekonomi     dengan surat utang acuan 10-tahun meningkat sebesar 80 basis poin menjadi 2,5 persen pada
dunia…                  akhir bulan Juni. Dari awal bulan Mei hingga akhir Juni, nilai ekuitas pasar berkembang
                        merosot sebesar 7 persen (seperti diukur dengan indeks MSCI EM dalam mata uang lokal,
                        (Gambar 1), dan imbal hasil obligasi dalam negeri dan selisih (spread) obligasi dolar AS
                        meningkat masing-masing sebesar 120 dan 70 basis poin (seperti diukur oleh indeks acuan JP
                        Morgan). Valuta komoditas dan pasar berkembang seperti mata uang Real Brazil, Rand
                        Afrika Selatan dan Dolar Australia turun sebesar 10 persen.

…dan Indonesia telah         Pasar aset-aset Indonesia telah mengalami koreksi pada beberapa minggu terakhir, seperti
menerima dampak              yang dialami oleh pasar negara berkembang lainnya. Sejak awal bulan Mei hingga akhir
yang signifikan…             kuartal kedua, saham – saham di Indonesia mencatat penurunan sebesar 4 persen, dan
                             investor asing beralih menjadi penjual bersih dengan nilai penjualan saham yang mencapai
                             lebih dari Rp 18 triliun (1,8 miliar dolar AS), yang secara efektif menghilangkan aliran masuk
                             modal yang cukup besar yang tercatat sebelumnya di tahun 2013 (Gambar 4). Kurva imbal
                             hasil (yields)surat utang Pemerintah telah meningkat dan mendatar secara signifikan, dengan
                             imbal hasil yang meningkat sebesar 150-220 basis poin sejak awal bulan Mei. Kepemilikan
                             obligasi Indonesia juga turun tajam dengan penyusutan sebesar Rp 14 triliun (1,4 miliar dolar
                             AS) sejak bulan April (Gambar 4). Derasnya modal keluar dari pasar-pasar saham dan
                             obligasi Indonesia pada beberapa minggu terakhir tampaknya sejalan dengan yang terlihat di
                             pasar negara-negara berkembang utama lainnya, yang juga mencatat aliran modal keluar yang
                             besar. Kinerja harga saham cukup sebanding, sementara kinerja obligasi dalam negeri tercatat
                             lebih lemah bila dibandingkan dengan kinerja beberapa negara pembanding Indonesia, yang
                             didasari ekspektasi meningkatnya inflasi sejak bulan Februari dikarenakan kenaikan harga
                             BBM bersubsidi dan naiknya defisit APBN 2013 yang mendorong tekanan naik bagi imbal
                             hasil.

                             dari angka tahun lalu, mendekati laju pertumbuhan yang paling lambat sejak tahun 2009.

                 2. APBN-P: kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi dan pelebaran proyeksi
                    defisit
APBN-P telah              Dengan latar belakang pelemahan pada pasar keuangan dalam dan luar negeri, DPR
disahkan dan harga        menyetujui APBN-P tahun 2013 pada tanggal 17 Juni. Bagian terpentingnya adalah
BBM bersubsidi telah      perubahan pada proyeksi belanja bagi subsidi BBM, yang berkaitan dengan peningkatan
dinaikkan                 harga BBM bersubsidi jangka pendek, paket kompensasi yang dirancang untuk mengurangi
                          dampak kenaikan harga BBM terhadap rakyat miskin, dan proyeksi peningkatan defisit
                          APBN untuk tahun berjalan, yang berasal dari penurunan proyeksi penerimaan nominal,
                          peningkatan jumlah belanja dan perlemahan antisipasi pertumbuhan PDB. Kenaikan harga
                          BBM diumumkan oleh Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral pada tanggal 21 Juni
                          (Permen ESDM No. 18/2013); mulai berlaku pada 22 Juni, dengan peningkatan harga
                          premium bersubsidi sebesar 44 persen menjadi Rp 6.500 per liter dan harga solar bersubsidi
                          meningkat sebesar 22 persen menjadi Rp 5.500 per liter.

Target defisit anggaran   Target defisit APBN-P 2013 sebesar 2,4 persen dari PDB, meningkat dari nilai sebelumnya
2013 kini 2,4 persen      sebesar 1,7 persen (Tabel 4). Perkiraan defisit yang lebih besar ini berasal dari menurunnya
dari PDB, naik dari 1,7   proyeksi penerimaan sebesar 2 persen, menjadi Rp 1.502 triliun, dan meningkatnya belanja
persen                    sebesar 3 persen menjadi Rp 1.726 triliun. Defisit primer diproyeksikan akan mencapai Rp
                          112 triliun (1,2 persen dari PDB), yang merupakan penambahan sebesar Rp 72 triliun
                          dibanding APBN 2013 sebelum perubahan. Proyeksi penerimaan yang lebih rendah
                          umumnya berasal dari penurunan perkiraan penerimaan pajak tahun 2013, yang diturunkan
                          sebesar 4 persen dari APBN awal menjadi Rp 1.148 triliun, di mana penyesuaian terbesar
                          terjadi pada proyeksi pajak penghasilan dan pajak perdagangan internasional, yang masing-
                          masing penurunannya sebesar 7,9 persen dan 17,5 persen. Penurunan proyeksi penerimaan
                          juga diikuti oleh penurunan pertumbuhan PDB dari 6,8 ke 6,3 persen. Proyeksi produksi
                          minyak untuk tahun berjalan juga diturunkan menjadi 840 ribu barel per hari (bpd) dari 900
                          ribu barel per hari. Namun demikian peningkatan harga minyak mentah sebesar 8 dolar AS
                          untuk rata-rata tahun 2013, menjadi 108 dolar AS per barel, akan meningkatkan penerimaan
                          yang berkaitan dengan penerimaan minyak sebesar hampir 7 persen dibanding APBN awal
                          tahun 2013.

Belanja meningkat         Pada sisi pengeluaran, belanja subsidi BBM diproyeksikan akan meningkat sebesar Rp 6,1
relatif terhadap APBN     triliun dibanding APBN sebelum perubahan sebesar Rp 193,8 triliun, walau harga BBM
sebelumnya karena         bersubsidi telah dinaikan. Hal ini mencerminkan bahwa tanpa reformasi, belanja subsidi
meningkatnya belanja      energi akan melampaui anggaran secara signifikan sebelumnya, yang menggambarkan
sosial dan subsidi        tekanan harga dan konsumsi BBM. Subsidi listrik ditargetkan mencapai Rp 100 triliun (Rp
energi                    19,1 triliun lebih besar dibanding APBN), sehingga keseluruhan belanja untuk subsidi energi
                          diproyeksikan akan mencapai 9,1 persen di atas APBN sebelum perubahan, sebesar Rp 300
                          triliun. Hal lain dari sisi pengeluaran adalah peningkatan belanja sosial sebesar Rp 7 triliun
                          menjadi Rp 81 triliun, yang sebagian berasal dari paket kompensasi yang dirancang untuk
                          mengurangi dampak peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi. Bagian B.1 membahas kebijakan
                          bantuan sosial yang baru ini secara lebih rinci.

Reformasi subsidi         Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa tanpa adanya reformasi, belanja untuk subsidi BBM
BBM berdampak             untuk tahun 2013 akan melampaui APBN 2013 sebesar Rp 25 triliun. Dengan adanya
positif namun kecil       reformasi ini, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa belanja subsidi BBM akan menjadi Rp
terhadap fiskal bersih    177 triliun – sedikit di bawah angka APBN-P yaitu Rp 200 triliun, yang disebabkan oleh
tahun 2013…               perbedaan asumsi ekonomi makro pada harga minyak, pertumbuhan PDB dan nilai tukar
                          (Tabel 4). Penghematan fiskal langsung untuk tahun 2013 dari kenaikan harga BBM
                          bersubsidi pada pertengahan tahun diperkirakan oleh Bank Dunia akan mencapai Rp 42,1

 Menanggapi berbagai tekanan                                                  Perkembangan Triwulanan
                                                                               Perekonomian Indonesia

                              sebesar Rp 29 triliun (atau 0,14 persen dari PDB). Manfaat fiskal utama dari reformasi
                              subsidi pada tahun 2013 adalah bahwa Pemerintah dapat menghindari kelebihan belanja yang
                              terlalu besar untuk subsidi BBM, yang akan memberikan tekanan tambahan terhadap defisit
                              fiskal yang kini telah semakin melebar dengan perkiraan perlemahan penerimaan.

…sementara                    Relatif terhadap skenario tanpa reformasi, “business as usual”, penghematan fiskal untuk
penghematan fiskal            beberapa tahun berikut dari kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi berjumlah cukup signifikan
pada tahun                    (Gambar 5). Menggunakan proyeksi ekonomi makro dasar (baseline) dan mengasumsikan kurs
selanjutnya, walaupun         tukar dan harga minyak yang stabil, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan belanja BBM bersubsidi
pada dasarnya tidak           akan turun menjadi Rp 148 triliun pada tahun 2014 dari Rp 177 triliun pada tahun 2013 dan
pasti, berjumlah              Rp 212 triliun pada tahun 2012. Hal ini merupakan penghematan setahun penuh sebesar Rp
signifikan dibanding          85,2 triliun pada tahun 2014 (0,8 persen dari PDB), dibanding bila harga BBM tidak naik.
skenario tanpa-               Penghematan relatif terhadap skenario tanpa reformasi diproyeksikan akan meningkat pada
perubahan                     dua tahun berikutnya (Rp 97,7 triliun pada tahun 2015, dan Rp 112,4 triliun pada tahun
                              2016). Namun perkiraan penghematan beberapa tahun kedepan ini sangat tidak pasti, karena
                              sangat bergantung kepada harga energi internasional dan nilai tukar Rupiah. Peningkatan
                              harga energi dunia atau depresiasi Rupiah yang berkelanjutan dapat memperbesar selisih
                              antara harga subsidi dan harga pasar, yang mendorong belanja subsidi ke tingkat yang lebih
                              besar.

Defisit anggaran        Defisit anggaran selama lima bulan pertama tahun 2013 tercatat mendekati Rp 26 triliun.
selama Jan–Mei 2013     Jumlah ini tidak umum di awal tahun; kecuali tahun 2012 yang mencatat defisit anggaran
berjumlah Rp 26 triliun sebesar Rp 4 triliun, saldo anggaran biasanya mencatat nilai positif untuk periode ini. Defisit
                        separuh tahun yang tidak umum ini disebabkan oleh lemahnya pertumbuhan penerimaan dan
                        tingginya belanja, yang menjadikan semakin pentingnya mengurangi belanja subsidi BBM.

Pengumpulan                 Jumlah penerimaan pada bulan Januari-Mei 2013 meningkat sebesar 10,1 persen (yoy),
penerimaan                  sedikit lebih tinggi dibanding periode yang sama pada tahun 2012 (8,3 persen), namun lebih
mengalami                   rendah dari tahun 2011. Relatif terhadap proyeksi tahunan, penerimaan pada lima bulan
perlambatan pada lima       pertama tahun 2013 adalah yang paling rendah pada beberapa tahun terakhir (pada 33,4
bulan pertama tahun         persen dari target penerimaan setahun penuh), walau dengan peningkatan yang signifikan
2013                        dalam penerimaan bukan pajak (yang hanya merupakan 23 persen dari jumlah penerimaan).
                            Perlambatan dalam pertumbuhan penerimaan ini tercatat diseluruh jenis pajak, sejalan
                            dengan penurunan pertumbuhan nominal PDB, dan perlambatan pada pertumbuhan
                            konsumsi secara khusus, seperti dibahas pada Bagian 4, dan juga lesunya ekspor dan harga
                            komoditas. Perlemahan dalam pertumbuhan pendapatan pajak umumnya didorong oleh
                            lambatnya penerimaan pajak penghasilan badan karena penurunan pertumbuhan nominal
                            PDB dan harga komoditas, dan juga karena pengaruh oleh peningkatan yang signifikan

Penyerapan APBN            Pada sisi pengeluaran, penyerapan APBN menunjukkan pola musiman pada umumnya
pada lima bulan            dimana pencairan yang relatif rendah di awal tahun, namun sedikit meningkat dibanding
pertama sedikit            tahun-tahun yang lalu. Pada akhir bulan Mei, 30,6 persen dari proyeksi belanja tahunan dari
membaik dibanding          APBN-P telah dicairkan, yang merupakan tingkat penyerapan tertinggi dalam beberapa tahun
tahun lalu tapi tetap      terakhir, dan bahkan bila belanja subsidi dikeluarkan dari perhitungan, pencairan anggaran
menghadapi tantangan       masih dianngap cukup tinggi bila dibanding tahun – tahun sebelumnya yaitu sebesar 30,4
                           persen. Namun demikian secara keseluruhan pencairan anggaran masih menjadi tantangan,
                           terutama dalam kaitannya dengan perubahan alokasi belanja (pemotongan anggaran) sebagai
                           akibat dari APBN-P yang dapat menambah kerumitan pelaksanaan anggaran untuk sisa
                           tahun 2013. Selain itu, tantangan yang masih berjalan dalam kaitannya dengan blokir DIPA
                           (tanda bintang) pada kuartal pertama masih menyebabkan penundaan belanja pada sejumlah
                           Kementerian negara.

Pembiayaan bruto       Kondisi pembiayaan, baik dalam maupun luar negeri, dengan peningkatan suku bunga global
telah meningkat secara sejak bulan Mei, makin mengetat sejak edisi Triwulanan terakhir. Mengikuti APBN-P dan
signifikan             peningkatan tambahan proyeksi defisit sebesar Rp 70,9 triliun, pembiayaan hutang bruto
                       untuk tahun 2013 diperkirakan akan meningkat sebesar Rp 52,6 triliun relatif terhadap
                       sasaran tahun 2013 sebelum perubahan, menjadi Rp 380,6 triliun, menurut Direktur Jenderal
                       Pengelolaan Utang (DJPU). Prospek penawaran tambahan hutang ini telah menjadi satu
                       faktor yang mendorong koreksi yang signifikan dalam pasar obligasi dalam negeri sejak
                       Februari, bersama-sama dengan antisipasi pengaruh inflasi dari reformasi subsidi BBM dan
                       kondisi pasar internasional; imbal hasil obligasi telah meningkat sebesar 150-200 basis poin
                       lintas kurva yield ke tingkat yang terakhir tercatat pada pertengahan tahun 2011 (lihat Bagian
                       3 untuk diskusi selanjutnya tentang perkembangan pasar keuangan). Hal ini menggambarkan
                       keadaan yang lebih menantang untuk penerbitan surat utang baru, dengan perlemahan pasar
                       primer menjelang akhir kuartal kedua dan penerbitan bruto sebesar 56 persen yang masih
                       tersisa untuk tahun 2013 per tanggal 25 Juni.2 Risiko-risiko pembiayaan pemerintah dari yield
                       yang lebih tinggi termitigasi dengan relatif rendahnya proporsi hutang dengan suku bunga
                       variabel pada jumlah persediaan hutang (sekitar 16 persen pada tahun 2012, menurut
                       perhitungan DJPU), dan Pemerintah memiliki cadangan dana dan pembiayaan darurat yang
                       dapat digunakan dalam hal terjadi dislokasi yang lebih buruk pada pasar obligasi.

Bank Dunia                 Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa keseluruhan pengumpulan penerimaan tahun 2013
memproyeksikan             akan sedikit lebih rendah dari proyeksi pada APBN-P (Tabel 4), yang merefleksikan proyeksi
bahwa defisit fiskal       PDB nominal yang lebih lemah begitu juga dalam harga-harga komoditas (seperti dibahas
tahun 2013 akan            pada Bagian 4), kondisi sektor sumber daya alam yang masih menantang, dan sedikit
mencapai 2,1 persen        pengaruh negatif bersih dari pengumpulan PPN dari peningkatan subsidi BBM. Bank Dunia
dari PDB, sedikit lebih    juga memproyeksikan bahwa keseluruhan pengeluaran akan berada sedikit di bawah APBN-
rendah dari asumsi         P, yang mencerminkan masih banyaknya tantangan dalam upaya pencairan anggaran
pada APBN-P                (terutama bagi belanja barang dan modal), dan juga belanja subsidi energi yang sedikit lebih
                           rendah karena asumsi harga minyak yang lebih rendah (106 dolar AS per barel dibanding
                           asumsi sebesar 108 dolar AS per barel). Pada akhirnya, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan defisit
                           APBN yang sedikit lebih kecil untuk tahun 2013 yaitu 2,1 persen dari PDB, dibanding target
                           APBN-P sebesar 2,4 persen.

 Menanggapi berbagai tekanan                                               Perkembangan Triwulanan
                                                                            Perekonomian Indonesia

                3. Pasar keuangan, valuta, dan kredit Indonesia: kuartal yang
                   bergejolak
Penurunan yang            Sementara penyesuaian yang cukup pada pasar keuangan Indonesia yang terjadi sejak bulan
belakangan terjadi di     Mei (Gambar 3), hal ini harus ditempatkan dalam konteks kinerja yang kuat secara umum
pasar keuangan, terjadi   pada lima bulan pertama tahun 2013. Saham-saham Indonesia mencatat prestasi yang kuat
setelah pembukaan         secara khusus pada paruh pertama kuartal tersebut, meningkatkan naiknya harga pada kuartal
yang kuat pada kuartal    pertama dengan berlanjutnya pertumbuhan keuntungan perusahaan lintas sebagian besar
kedua                     sektor dan kuatnya pembelian bersih ekuitas Indonesia oleh investor asing, yang mencapai
                          Rp 26 triliun (2,7 miliar dolar AS) dari awal tahun hingga pertengahan bulan Mei 2013, yang
                          dipimpin oleh sektor properti (yang naik sebanyak 57 persen) dan barang konsumsi (yang
                          meningkat sebesar 38 persen). Kinerja pasar obligasi lebih bercampur, dengan peningkatan
                          inflasi yang mendorong imbal hasil menjadi agak lebih tinggi, namun investor asing masih
                          menjadi pembeli bersih obligasi negara Indonesia sebesar Rp 33 triliun selama periode
                          tersebut.

Nilai tukar rupiah        Setelah melemah di bulan Maret dan April, dibantu dengan menguatnya pembelian bersih
terhadap dolar AS         saham dan obligasi dalam negeri oleh investor asing, dan dengan penerbitan obligasi negara
mengalami tekanan,        dan BUMN dalam dolar AS, kondisi likuiditas dolar AS di luar negeri kemudian mengetat
dan Bank Indonesia        karena aliran keluar modal portofolio yang besar. Cadangan devisa mencatat penurunan pada
telah meningkatkan        bulan Mei menjadi 105,2 miliar dolar AS walau telah menerima dorongan dari penerbitan
suku bunganya…            obligasi luar negeri yang cukup besar. Tekanan depresiasi valuta meningkat menjelang akhir
                          bulan Mei, yang mencerminkan percepatan aliran keluar portofolio, dengan kurs Rupiah di
                          dalam negeri turun hingga mencapai Rp 9,960 per dolar AS pada akhir Juni untuk pertama
                          kalinya sejak bulan September 2009, sementara suku bunga non-deliverable forward (NDF) asing
                          menembus 10,000 pada awal Juni. Bank Indonesia mengambil langkah yang mengejutkan
                          pasar pada tanggal 12 Juni dengan meningkatkan suku bunga Fasilitas Simpanan Bank
                          Indonesia (FASBI) sebesar 25 basis poin, menjadi 4,25 persen. Langkah ini diikuti dengan
                          peningkatan BI Rate sebesar 25 basis poin menjadi 6 persen pada tanggal 13 Juni –
                          peningkatan pertama sejak tahun 2011.

…tetapi Rupiah            Sementara Rupiah telah mengalami depresiasi secara berkelanjutan terhadap dolar AS secara
sebetulnya mengalami      nominal sejak pertengahan tahun 2011, mata uang Rupiah sesungguhnya mengalami apresiasi
apresiasi di 2013 bila    secara pembobotan perdagangan dan secara riil sejak awal tahun 2013. Apresiasi ini
dihitung berdasarkan      mencerminkan depresiasi valas yang belakangan terjadi terhadap negara – negara mitra
pembobotan                perdagangan utama (terutama Jepang, yang mana Rupiah mencatat apresiasi sebesar 10
perdagangan               persen terhadap Yen sejauh ini pada tahun 2013), dan laju inflasi Indonesia yang lebih tinggi
                          juga menekan kurs tukar riilnya menjadi lebih tinggi. Rupiah kini telah meningkat sebesar 3
                          persen secara pembobotan perdagangan dan sebesar 4 persen secara riil sejak awal tahun
                          2013. Karenanya, sejak awal tahun 2013 hanya terdapat sedikit penyesuaian riil kurs tukar
                          terhadap posisi luar neger Indonesia yang lebih lemah, yang menunjukkan bahwa gabungan
                          dari kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat dan berlanjutnya depresiasi Rupiah secara teratur
                          dapat merupakan langkah yang tepat.

Pertumbuhan kredit        Pertumbuhan kredit terus melambat pada kuartal kedua, dengan pertumbuhan kredit
bank telah menurun        nominal melambat menjadi 22 persen yoy pada bulan April, memotong pertumbuhan riil
belakangan ini,           (setelah terjadi) menjadi 15 persen yoy pada bulan April, laju terlambatnya sejak bulan
didorong oleh             Desember 2010. Pinjaman investasi memimpin moderasi tersebut, dengan penurunan
perlemahan pemberian      sebesar 24 persen yoy hingga bulan April, turun dari nilai tertingginya sebesar 30 persen pada
pinjaman investasi        bulan Juli 2012, sejalan dengan perlemahan pada kegiatan investasi riil (Gambar 7). Laju
                          pertumbuhan kredit konsumsi melemah menjadi 19 persen hingga bulan Maret, sementara
                          pertumbuhan dalam kredit modal kerja juga turut menurun belakangan ini. Indikator kehati-
                          hatian tingkat sistem perbankan tetap stabil selama tahun 2013, dengan kredit macet yang
                          bertahan pada kisaran 2 persen, sementara metrik profitabilitas bagi bank-bank Indonesia
                          masih bertahan kuat, termasuk relatif terhadap pembandingnya di wilayah yang sama.

Harga properti tempat         Walau dengan pelambatan laju pemberian pinjaman bank bagi properti rumah dan
tinggal meningkat             konstruksi pada beberapa bulan terakhir (Gambar 8), pertumbuhan harga properti telah
dengan laju yang              meningkat. Pertumbuhan harga properti secara nasional mencapai 11,2 persen selama tahun
tercepat selama dekade        berjalan hingga bulan Maret, laju tercepat selama dekade terakhir. Peningkatan harga dipicu
terakhir, sementara           oleh kuatnya pertumbuhan harga untuk perumahan dengan ukuran yang lebih kecil (dengan
properti komersial            luas tanah kurang dari 36 meter persegi), yang tidak disertakan dalam persyaratan uang muka
mencatat pertumbuhan          minimum (loan-to-value) yang lebih ketat yang mulai berlaku bagi kredit perumahan pada
yang lebih kuat               pertengahan tahun 2012. Survei BI terbaru tentang pasar properti rumah tinggal sekunder
                              Jakarta (tidak termasuk apartemen) juga menunjukkan pertumbuhan harga yang kuat, dengan
                              peningkatan harga sebesar 3,8 persen kuartal-ke-kuartal pada kuartal pertama bagi rumah-
                              rumah berukuran menengah dan sebesar 3,5 persen bagi rumah-rumah yang lebih besar,
                              suatu cerminan kuatnya pertumbuhan harga tanah di Jakarta.3 Sementara itu properti
                              komersial juga menunjukkan pertumbuhan harga yang mantap dan berlanjut, dengan harga
                              tanah industri di wilayah Jabodetabek meningkat sebesar 65 persen selama setahun hingga
                              kuartal pertama 2013, sementara harga sewa ruang kantor meningkat sebesar 15 persen pada
                              periode yang sama (Gambar 9). Pesatnya pertumbuhan harga yang sedemikian cepat pada
                              sektor properti membutuhkan pemantauan yang cermat namun seperti dicatat pada
                              Triwulanan edisi bulan 2013, paparan yang berkaian dengan properti di dalam sistem
                              keuangan tetaplah kecil dengan kredit yang berkaitan dengan properti berjumlah sekitar 14
                              persen dari jumlah kredit perbankan, dan sekitar 12 persen dari penerbitan obligasi
                              perusahaan pada perhitungan periode setahun hingga bulan Maret 2013.

                     4. Prospek ekonomi Indonesia mengalami penurunan
Prospek pertumbuhan            Laju pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia mengalami perlambatan pada kuartal pertama tahun
telah menurun...               2013 ke 6,0 persen tahun-ke-tahun, sedikit lebih lemah dari perkiraan, dengan dampak yang
                               tertunda dari menurunnya harga komoditas yang membebani investasi dan ekonomi
                               menghadapi terjangan dari pengaruh gejolak pasar keuangan dan peningkatan harga BBM
                               bersubsidi.

…yang mendorong                Bank Dunia telah menurunkan proyeksinya untuk pertumbuhan PDB tahun 2013 menjadi
Bank Dunia untuk               5,9 persen, dari 6,2 persen yang diproyeksikan pada Triwulanan bulan Maret 2013, sebagian
menurunkan proyeksi            besar disebabkan oleh prospek permintaan dalam negeri yang lebih lemah. Pertumbuhan
pertumbuhan PDB                investasi lebih lambat dari perkiraan, dengan pengaruh kepercayan yang berasal dari
tahun 2013 menjadi 5,9         antisipasi reformasi subsidi BBM dan koreksi pada pasar aset yang membebani permintaan
persen                         dalam negeri. Beban terhadap pertumbuhan dari ekspor bersih diperkirakan akan menurun
                               pada sisa tahun 2013, walau secara relatif terhadap proyeksi yang lalu pemulihan ekspor
                               diperkirakan akan melambat dan pertumbuhan impor diperkirakan juga akan lebih lemah,
                               yang mencerminkan perlemahan prospek investasi. Dampak bersih sektor rill dari usulan
                               reformasi BBM bersubsidi diperkirakan akan berjumlah kecil, dengan dampak negatif
                               terhadap konsumsi dan investasi dari peningkatan harga BBM akan sebagian besar diimbangi
                               dengan dampak positif terhadap pertumbuhan paket kompensasi. Namun dengan prospek
                               inflasi yang lebih tinggi, pengetatan lebih lanjut mungkin dibutuhkan yang makin
                               memperlambat laju pertumbuhan.

Pertumbuhan PDB riil           Kegiatan ekonomi Indonesia mengalami pelemahan pada kuartal pertama tahun 2013,
pada kuartal pertama           dengan penurunan pertumbuhan permintaan dalam negeri, terutama investasi (Gambar 10).
2013 terus mengalami           PDB riil meningkat sebesar 6,0 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada kuartal pertama, yang
pelemahan                      merupakan kuartal kesepuluh dengan pertumbuhan 6 persen atau lebih secara berturut-turut.
                               Hasil kuartal pertama lebih rendah dari pertumbuhan 6,1 persen tahun-ke-tahun yang
                               tercatat pada kuartal akhir tahun 2012, sementara ekonomi tumbuh 1,3 persen secara kuartal-
                               ke-kuartal dengan penyesuaian musiman, turun dari 1,7 persen pada kuartal keempat.
                               Pertumbuhan PDB nominal juga terus menurun, menjadi 8,7 persen tahun-ke-tahun, lajut
                               yang paling lambat dalam 9 tahun terakhir (Gambar 11). Perlemahan pertumbuhan nominal
                               umumnya disebabkan oleh penurunan tajam pertumbuhan deflator PDB, dengan penurunan
                               yang signifikan dalam harga ekspor dengan perlemahan harga-harga komoditas global
                               sebagai pendorong utama.

Konsumsi swasta          Pertumbuhan konsumsi masyarakat juga mencatat moderasi pada kuartal pertama,
mencatat perlambatan,    meningkat sebesar 5,2 persen tahun-ke-tahun, sedikit turun dari 5,4 persen tahun-ke-tahun

bahan pangan             bahan pangan, dengan peningkatan harga bahan pangan yang signifikan dalam kuartal itu
menurunkan daya beli     tampaknya membawa dampak yang negatif. Di sisi lain, konsumsi pemerintah menguat

                         sebesar 0,4 persen tahun-ke-tahun, yang sejalan dengan pelemahan pertumbuhan dalam
                         permintaan dalam negeri.

Diskrepansi statistik    Setelah berpengaruh besar kepada pertumbuhan pada sebagian besar tahun 2012, diskrepansi
dan persediaan tidak     statistik dan inventori menurunkan 0,1 poin persentase dari pertumbuhan tahun-ke-tahun
lagi menjadi bagian      pada kuartal Maret 2013. Sebagai akibatnya, perbedaan yang cukup besar antara pengukuran
pertumbuhan yang         pertumbuhan PDB dan penjualan riil akhir (yaitu jumlah pengukuran konsumsi masyarakat,
besar                    konsumsi pemerintah, investasi tetap dan ekspor bersih), yang dibahas pada edisi-edisi

                         pertumbuhan produksi, telah menyempit sesuai dengan pelemahan yang terjadi.

Pada sisi produksi,      Pada sisi produksi, sebagian besar pelemahan pada kuartal pertama didorong oleh sektor-
sebagian besar           sektor industri, sementara produksi perikanan, pertanian, peternakan dan kehutanan

terutama                 prestasi yang kurang, turun sebesar 0,4 persen dibanding satu tahun yang lalu. Sektor-sektor
pertambangan dan         industri lain terus mencatat kinerja yang kokoh, walau terdapat sejumlah penurunan kegiatan
penggalian               manufaktur, dengan pertumbuhan produksi sedikit menurun ke 5,8 persen tahun-ke-tahun,
                         dan dalam sektor konstruksi, dengan penurunan pertumbuhan produksi menjadi 7,2 persen
                         tahun-ke-tahun. Produksi sektor jasa secara agregat meningkat sebesar 7,6 persen tahun-ke-
                         tahun, masih sama seperti kuartal akhir tahun 2012. Terdapat sejumlah penurunan dari
                         perdagangan, hotel dan rumah makan, yang meningkat hanya sebesar 6,5 persen tahun-ke-
                         tahun, jauh di bawah 7,8 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada kuartal 4. Sektor ini, yang merupakan
                         sektor jasa terbesar, merupakan bagian yang besarnya hampir mencapai 15 persen dari PDB
                         nominal dan telah memoderasi kegiatan pertumbuhan ekonomi sejak akhir tahun 2011.
                         Namun kelemahan ini diimbangi oleh kuatnya hasil dari sub-sub sektor jasa lainnya, seperti
                         transportasi dan komunikasi (meningkat sebesar 10,0 persen tahun-ke-tahun) dan
                         kepemilikan keuangan dan jasa-jasa bisnis (meningkat sebesar 8,4 persen tahun-ke-tahun).

melambat belakangan      bersama-sama dengan moderasi pinjaman investasi seperti disinggung di atas, menunjukkan
ini…                     bahwa pertumbuhan investasi akan tetap lemah untuk jangka pendek. Impor barang-barang
                         modal semakin menurun selama lima kuartal berturut-turut pada April, dan telah menyusut
                         sebesar 22,5 persen tahun-ke-tahun. Penurunan penjualan semen, indikator utama dalam
                         kegiatan pembangunan, turun menjadi 13,1 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan Mei, lebih
                         rendah dibanding 16,8 persen pada bulan Maret dan turun secara signifikan secara
                         penyesuaian musiman berurutan (Gambar 15), yang menunjukkan berlanjutnya moderasi
                         dalam investasi pembangunan seperti terlihat pada kuartal pertama. Namun kuatnya
                         permintaan yang berkelanjutan dalam pasar properti rumah tinggal, yang mengakibatkan
                         peningkatan tajam dalam harga-harga properti seperti dibahas pada Bagian 3, akan memberi
                         sejumlah dukungan bagi investasi pembangunan ke depan. Sementara indeks PMI HSBC,
                         yang mencapai 51,6 pada bulan Mei, terus menunjukkan kondisi usaha yang meluas pada
                         sektor manufaktur, produksi industri menunjukkan tanda-tanda pelemahan momentum
                         secara penyesuaian musiman berurutan (Gambar 15). Indikator-indikator konsumsi
                         menunjukkan sejumlah pelemahan jangka pendek, dengan penjualan ritel meningkat sebesar
                         9,7 persen tahun-ke-tahun, jauh di bawah tingkat pertumbuhan yang mendekati 20 persen
                         tahun-ke-tahun menjelang penutupan 2012. Indeks kepercayaan konsumen terus menurun,
                         dengan indeks kepercayaan konsumen BI yang lebih rendah pada bulan April dan Mei,
                         tampaknya karena adanya dampak negatif yang berasal dari antisipasi akan pengumuman
                         reformasi subsidi Pemerintah. Namun sesuai dengan pengalaman yang lalu, belanja yang
                         berkaitan dengan pemilihan umum (pemilu) presiden tahun 2014 akan memberikan
                         dorongan konsumsi yang besar menjelang akhir 2013 hingga awal 2014.

Dampak bersih                      Kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi dapat menjadi kendala tambahan bagi investasi jangka
terhadap pertumbuhan               pendek, karena akan secara langsung menambah beban terhadap biaya transportasi, dan
dari reformasi subsidi             secara tidak langsung terhadap biaya barang-barang setengah jadi, sehingga meningkatkan
diperkirakan tidak                 biaya operasinal dan investasi. Di sisi lain, penurunan pemborosan dana bagi subsidi BBM
akan besar                         akan mendorong kepercayaan investasi terhadap posisi fiskal dan proses reformasi
                                   Indonesia. Peningkatan harga BBM juga diperkirakan akan membawa dampak negatif
                                   terhadap konsumsi masyarakat dengan penurunan daya beli. Namun paket kompensasi yang
                                   diusulkan (sekitar Rp 29 triliun), yang termasuk bantuan langsung yang signifikan kepada
                                   rakyat miskin, seperti dibahas pada Bagian B.1, akan mengimbangi sebagian dampak negatif
                                   terhadap konsumsi. Bagi rumah tangga yang lebih berada mungkin terjadi penurunan
                                   konsumsi secara sementara namun hal itu dapat termitigasi dengan peningkatan upah
                                   nominal seperti yang terjadi pada tahun 2008 ketika nominal upah pekerja manufaktur
                                   meningkat sebagai tanggapan atas kenaikan harga BBM dan peningkatan inflasi harga bahan
                                   pangan. Paket kompensasi Pemerintah juga menyertakan sejumlah belanja untuk infrastruktur
                                   dasar (sebesar Rp 7,25 triliun), yang akan membawa pengaruh meluas ke bagian-bagian lain
                                   ekonomi Indonesia.

Perkiraan                          Proyeksi Bank Dunia bagi pertumbuhan PDB untuk tahun 2013 adalah 5,9 persen, lebih

adalah 5,9 persen                  Konsumsi masyarakat diperkirakan akan menjadi pendorong utama pertumbuhan, yang
untuk tahun 2013 dan               didukung oleh belanja pra-pemilu menjelang akhir tahun ini, walau mungkin terdapat
6,2 persen untuk tahun             sejumlah pelemahan jangka pendek. Pertumbuhan investasi diperkirakan akan semakin
2014                               melambat, seperti ditunjukkan oleh berlanjutnya moderasi dalam kredit investasi dan
                                   semakin menurunnya belanja untuk barang-barang modal impor. Pertumbuhan yang kokoh
                                   dalam investasi pembangunan, yang didukung pesatnya pertumbuhan sektor konstruksi
                                   rumah tinggal, akan memberikan sejumlah pengimbang, karena konstruksi merupakan 85
                                   persen dari jumlah belanja investasi nominal. Pertumbuhan impor dan ekspor akan bersama-
                                   sama berada di bawah tekanan selama tahun 2013, dengan sedikit pelemahan dibanding
                                   pertumbuhan mitra perdagangan utama yang diproyeksikan sebelumnya, yang mendorong
                                   penurunan pertumbuhan ekspor, sementara pertumbuhan impor juga diturunkan, sesuai
                                   dengan prospek investasi yang lebih lemah. Untuk tahun 2014, pertumbuhan diperkirakan
                                   akan meningkat menjadi 6,2 persen, dengan meluasnya dampak pemulihan global, yang akan
                                   mendorong ekspor dan investasi.

                  5. Inflasi akan naik untuk sementara mengikuti kenaikan harga BBM
                     bersubsidi
Outlook inflasi           Langkah Pemerintah untuk meningkatkan harga solar sebesar Rp 1.000 per liter dan
didominasi oleh           premium sebesar Rp 2.000 per liter pada tanggal 22 Juni 2013 diperkirakan akan mendorong
peningkatan harga         peningkatan yang tajam pada inflasi IHK dan keranjang kemiskinan, dengan peningkatan
BBM bersubsidi…           yang lebih landai pada inflasi inti. Peningkatan tajam itu diperkirakan hanya akan bersifat
                          sementara dan akan berangsur-angsur hilang dengan berjalannya waktu. Pengelolaan yang
                          berhati-hati oleh Bank Indonesia akan membantu memastikan bahwa tidak ada peningkatan
                          perkiraan inflasi maupun hal yang mendasarinya secara terus-menerus. Berbeda dengan
                          kenaikan harga BBM sebelumnya, peningkatan ini terjadi pada saat inflasi sedang terkendali
                          dengan baik, dimana inflasi IHK yang mengalami moderasi sejalan dengan penurunan harga
                          bahan pangan serta inflasi inti berada pada tingkat relatif rendah dan stabil.

Peningkatan harga        Harga BBM bersubsidi yang Gambar 16: Proyeksi inflasi IHK, dengan dan tanpa

                         besar karena solar digunakan oleh bus-bus dan truk-truk untuk transportasi umum dan
                         perdagangan. Tahapan dari reformasi ini berarti bahwa dampak terhadap inflasi tahunan
                         akan berangsur-angsur menghilang pada kuartal September 2014, pada saat inflasi IHK

…namun inflasi inti      Tekanan harga diperkirakan akan terkendali, dengan dampak terhapdap inflasi inti yang lebih
diperkirakan akan        ringan. Hal ini karena inflasi inti tidak menghitung barang-barang yang harganya

                         oleh perusahaan-perusahaan untuk menetapkan harga yang baru. Inflasi inti diperkirakan
                         berada pada kisaran 0,5 poin persentase lebih tinggi pada 2013 dan 2014, dengan asumsi
                         bahwa tidak ada peningkatan proyeksi inflasi yang berkelanjutan (asumsi yang beralasan

Inflasi IHK mengalami Seperti disinggung di atas, peningkatan harga BBM terjadi ketika inflasi IHK sedang
perlambatan pada      menurun, yang didorong oleh penurunan inflasi bahan pangan, dan inflasi inti yang
bulan April dan Mei… terkendali. Inflasi IHK turun menjadi 5,5 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan Mei, sedikit
                      menurun dari 5,6 persen pada bulan April dan nilai tertingginya yang terbaru sebesar 5,9
                      persen pada bulan Maret. Inflasi keranjang kemiskinan juga mengalami moderasi, menjadi 6,6
                      persen pada bulan Mei dari 7,0 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan Maret. Selain itu, inflasi
                      inti tetap bertahan rendah dan stabil, pada 4,0 persen tahun-ke-tahun untuk bulan Mei, yang
                      menunjukkan bahwa tekanan harga tetap lunak (Gambar 17), dibantu dengantren harga emas
                      dunia yang mengalami penurunan. Sementara itu, inflasi keseluruhan ekonomi, yang diukur
                      oleh deflator PDB, terus bergerak di bawah nilai inflasi IHK pada kuartal pertama tahun ini,
                      turun menjadi 2,5 persen tahun-ke-tahun.

…yang disebabkan          Inflasi harga bahan pangan telah menurun pada beberapa kuartal terakhir, menjadi 11,1
oleh penurunan harga      persen tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan Mei, karena mulainya musim panen dan pelonggaran
bahan pangan              sejumlah pembatasan impor pada bulan Maret untuk bahan-bahan pokok, seperti bawang
                          merah dan putih. Inflasi bahan pangan telah meningkat dengan tajam pada 3 bulan pertama
                          tahun 2013, yang mencapai puncaknya pada 12,9 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan Maret,
                          dan mendorong peningkatan dalam inflasi IHK dan keranjang kemiskinan. Sementara
                          pningkatan sebagian disebabkan oleh peningkatan harga bahan pangan yang terjadi sebelum
                          musim panen raya, sedangkan peningkatan harga bahan pangan pokok terdorong oleh banjir
                          besar pada bulan Januari dan perubahan kebijakan perdagangan seperti dibahas pada
                          Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret 2013. Pelonggaran sebagian kebijakan itu menyebabkan
                          turunnya harga sejumlah bahan pokok, dengan harga bawang putih yang kini berada di
                          bawah harga pada bulan Desember tahun lalu (Gambar 18). Harga bawang merah juga
                          menurun, namun harga cabai belakangan ini mulai meningkat. Harga beras dalam negeri,
                          salah satu bahan pokok lainnya, mencatat penurunan pada beberapa bulan terakhir, walau
                          selisih antara harga dalam dan luar negeri tetap tinggi dan meningkat, karena panen besar
                          juga terjadi pada negara-negara produsen utama dunia yang menurunkan harga beras
                          internasional.

Pergerakan harga             Pertumbuhan harga pada ekonomi secara keseluruhan tetap lambat, dengan pertumbuhan

melambat, sejalan            tahun-ke-tahun pada kuartal ketiga 2011, ke tingkat saat ini pada 2,5 persen. Sebagian dari
dengan pelemahan             penurunan ini mencerminkan perlambatan inflasi konsumen, termasuk pelemahan yang
harga ekspor                 signifikan dalam harga-harga ekspor Indonesia dan sektor pertambangan dan penggalian.
                             Harga-harga ekspor lebih rendah sebesar 1,3 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada kuartal Maret,
                             sementara harga agregat produksi sektor pertambangan dan penggalian lebih rendah sebesar
                             1,4 persen. Penurunan harga ini bersamaan dengan penurunan yang signifikan dalam harga-
                             harga komoditas utama Indonesia sejak akhir tahun 2011. Terdapat sejumlah tanda-tanda
                             bahwa inflasi seluruh perekonomian dapat berbalik, dengan pertumbuhan berurutan deflator
                             PDB mulai meningkat pada beberapa kuartal terakhir. Selain itu, dengan harga-harga
                             konsumen yang merupakan porsi besar padai deflator PDB, inflasi deflator PDB juga dapat
                             terpengaruh oleh penyesuaian harga BBM. Sejalan dengan itu, inflasi deflator PDB
                             diproyeksikan akan meningkat menjadi 4,3 persen pada tahun 2013 dan 6,3 persen pada
                             tahun 2014.

Outlook inflasi              Depresiasi pada kurs tukar yang berlanjut dan peningkatan inflasi yang disebabkan reformasi
bergantung pada              subsidi BBM serta peningkatan upah minimum, merupakan penyebab utama bagi prospek
pergerakan kurs tukar        peningkatan inflasi. Sejauh ini, pengaruh dari peningkatan kurs tukar dolar AS/Rupiah
dan ekspektasi               terhadap harga-harga konsumen masih bersifat terbatas. Sebagian alasannya adalah ketika
inflasi…                     melakukan perhitungan bobot perdagangan, depresiasi valas ternyata hanyalah kecil (lihat
                             Kotak 2 pada Triwulanan edisi bulan Desember 2012), dan sesungguhnya kurs tukar efektif
                             telah mengalami apresiasi pada beberapa bulan terakhir, seperti dibahas pada Bagian 3.
                             Namun bila Rupiah mengalami pelemahan lebih lanjut, maka akan terdapat sejumlah risiko
                             kenaikan yang mendorong inflasi.

                       signifikan pada bulan Mei, dengan naik sebesar 14,5 basis poin yang mencerminkan
                       peningkatan yang besar pada seluruh komponen harga, terutama Transportasi, Komunikasi
                       dan Jasa Keuangan. Sebenarnya adalah biasa terjadi peningkatan yang besar dalam perkiraan
                       harga jangka pendek dengan semakin dekatnya bulan Ramadan, walaupun demikian
                       peningkatan ini lebih besar dari biasanya, yang diakibatkan oleh peningkatan harga BBM
                       bersubsidi. Selain itu, indeks perkiraan harga 6-bulanan meningkat sebesar 10,3 basis poin
                       pada bulan Mei, setelah penurunan selama dua bulan sebelumnya. Sejalan dengan
                       peningkatan dalam perkiraan konsumen, pengecer juga memperkirakan tekanan inflasi di

…dan membutuhkan          Dengan adanya kenaikan harga BBM dan kenaikan yang signifikan dalam upah minimum,
pemantauan                sangatlah penting untuk memantau ekspektasi inflasi dan perilaku penetapan harga selama
                          tahun 2013. Diperkirakan tidak ada peningkatan perkiraan inflasi yang berkelanjutan dari
                          reformasi subsidi BBM ini, karena kenaikan harga yang terjadi bersifat hanya satu kali saja.
                          Selain itu, walau tidak ada indikasi yang pasti bahwa kenaikan upah minimum regional yang
                          besar pada tahun 2013 yang akan secara signifikan mendorong harapan inflasi dan upah yang
                          lebih besar, tekanan upah mungkin menjadi semakin terasa dan mempengaruhi harga-harga
                          dengan berjalannya tahun 2013. Risiko kenaikan terhadap outlook inflasi yang diakibatkan
                          oleh peningkatan biaya ini dimitigasi dengan adanya penurunan permintaan dalam negeri,
                          yang akan membatasi pengaruh tahap kedua dari kenaikan harga BBM atau tekanan upah.

                          modal bersih ‘investasi lainnya’. Neraca dasar, atau jumlah saldo neraca berjalan dan FDI
                          bersih, turun dari 3,2 miliar dolar AS pada kuartal akhir 2012 namun tetap berada dalam
                          keadaan defisit, pada -1,9 miliar dolar AS, (Gambar 19), yang menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia
                          terus bergantung pada portofolio yang secara potensial lebih rentan gejolak dan aliran masuk
                          modal investasi lainnya untuk membiayai defisit neraca berjalan.

Neraca perdagangan        Jumlah impor mencatat kontraksi sebesar 1,6 persen tahun-ke-tahun pada kuartal pertama,
barang mencatat           sementara ekspor mencatat penurunan 6 persen tahun-ke-tahun. Namun data perdagangan
pemulihan pada            barang pada bulan April menunjukkan bahwa neraca perdagangan barang non-migas kembali
kuartal pertama           tergelincir ke keadaan defisit pada bulan April karena berlanjutnya pelemahan ekspor,
dengan pelemahan          sementara impor menguat (Gambar 20). Defisit perdagangan migas yang cukup besar telah
impor yang                menjadi ciri khas neraca luar negeri Indonesia sejak pertengahan tahun 2012 (Gambar 21),
mengimbangi               yang meningkat menjadi 3 miliar dolar AS pada kuartal pertama 2013 (dari 2,4 miliar dolar
berlanjutnya              AS pada kuartal akhir 2012). Hal ini mencerminkan penurunan penerimaan migas, bersama-
pelambatan ekspor         sama dengan permintaan dalam negeri yang umumnya kuat untuk impor energi. Ekspor
                          Indonesia terus dibebani dengan tidak adanya pemulihan harga global dari komoditas ekspor
                          utamanya. Harga patokan batu bara, ekspor terbesar Indonesia berdasarkan penerimaan,
                          telah melemah karena pelambatan pertumbuhan di Cina, yang merupakan pembeli terbesar
                          batu bara Indonesia, dan juga kemungkinan penetapan larangan impor batu bara berkualitas
                          rendah oleh Cina (Kotak 1).

 Menanggapi berbagai tekanan                                              Perkembangan Triwulanan
                                                                           Perekonomian Indonesia

Pada kuartal pertama,     Beralih ke neraca modal dan keuangan, defisit neraca keuangan dan modal sebesar 1,4 miliar
neraca modal dan          dolar AS pada kuartal pertama didorong oleh derasnya aliran keluar modal bersih ‘investasi
keuangan mencatat         lain’ sebesar 7,7 miliar dolar AS. Hal ini mencerminkan peningkatan penempatan dana di luar
defisitnya yang           negeri yang mengikuti peningkatan cadangan devisa antar bank-bank dalam negeri sebagai
pertama sejak kuartal     akibat dari langkah BI untuk secara langsung memenuhi kebutuhan valuta asing BUMN
ketiga 2011…              energi pada kuartal pertama. BI menurunkan intervensinya sewaktu tekanan terhadap Rupiah
                          menurun dari bulan Februari hingga akhir Mei, yang mengakibatkan penarikan dalam
                          simpanan valas swasta pada beberapa bulan terakhir, walau intervensi diperkirakan akan
                          kembali meningkat dalam beberapa minggu ke depan karena semakin meningkatnya tekanan
                          depresiasi Rupiah.

…dengan kuatnya           Derasnya aliran masuk modal portofolio sebesar 2,9 miliar dolar AS tercatat pada kuartal
aliran masuk modal        pertama, terutama mengalir ke dalam ekuitas. Aliran masuk portofolio bulanan tetap tinggi
portofolio dan            selama bulan April, yang didorong oleh kuatnya permintaan asing untuk obligasi pemerintah
pelambatan aliran         Indonesia, dengan aliran masuk modal bersih yang berjumlah 1,8 miliar dolar AS. Aliran
masuk FDI                 masuk penanaman modal langsung melambat menjadi 3,4 miliar dolar AS (dari 4,5 miliar
                          dolar AS pada kuartal akhir tahun 2012), sejalan dengan lebih lemahnya investasi dalam
                          negeri.

Aliran keluar modal       Namun seperti disinggung di atas, koreksi yang belakangan terjadi di pasar keuangan
portofolio investasi      Indonesia telah mencatat percepatan aliran keluar modal portofolio investasi asing sejak
asing yang besar          pertengahan bulan Mei. Secara bersama-sama aliran keluar modal investasi dalam ekuitas dan
tercatat pada beberapa    obligasi pemerintah telah berjumlah 3,6 miliar dolar AS sejak awal bulan Mei, dengan aliran
minggu terakhir           modal asing yang masuk ke ekuitas Indonesia membalik seluruh jumlah aliran masuk bersih
                          pada paruh pertama kuartal kedua menjadi datar pada kuartal itu, sementara jumlah aliran
                          masuk bersih ke obligasi pemerintah selama kuartal tersebut tetap positif pada 0,4 miliar
                          dolar AS, mengikuti aliran masuk modal yang sangat kuat pada bulan April.

Reformasi subsidi         Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa peningkatan dalam harga BBM bersubsidi akan
BBM diperkirakan          menurunkan pertumbuhan dalam jumlah impor BBM, mempersempit defisit neraca berjalan
akan memangkas            sebesar 0,1 hingga 0,2 poin persentase dari PDB, dibanding bila tidak ada reformasi BBM.
peningkatan impor         Walau lebih sulit untuk dikuantisir, penurunan subsidi BBM juga akan diterima secara positif
BBM                       oleh investor asing langsung dan portofolio di Indonesia, sehingga mendukung aliran masuk
                          modal untuk jangka yang lebih panjang. Namun peningkatan inflasi sementara yang
                          disebabkan oleh reformasi tersebut dapat menambah tekanan depresiasi terhadap Rupiah
                          untuk jangka pendek.

Defisit neraca berjalan   Melihat ke depan, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan defisit neraca berjalan akan mencapai
Indonesia diperkirakan    jumlah 25,2 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2013, atau 2,7 persen dari PDB. Hal ini
akan berada pada          menunjukkan perkiraan defisit neraca berjalan 2013 yang secara umum sejalan dengan tahun
tingkat yang sama         2012 secara bagian dari PDB, sebesar 2,7 persen dari PDB. Proyeksi ini mencerminkan
dengan tahun 2012         gabungan dari semakin meningkatnya ekspor dan penurunan pertumbuhan impor, termasuk
                          yang disebabkan oleh reformasi subsidi BBM. Neraca berjalan diproyeksikan akan
                          menyempit menjadi 2,1 persen dari PDB pada tahun 2014 dengan semakin pulihnya ekspor.
                          Keseluruhan neraca pembayaran diperkirakan akan mencatat defisit sebesar 4,8 miliar dolar
                          AS pada tahun 2013, melihat dari hasil realisasi kuartal pertama, antisipasi defisit neraca
                          berjalan setahun penuh, dan penurunan aliran masuk modal ke pasar-pasar berkembang
                          (emerging market) yang belakangan terjadi, termasuk ke Indonesia. Seperti disinggung pada
                          Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret 2013, pelemahan dalam dinamika neraca pembayaran
                          Indonesia dan tekanan depresiasi Rupiah yang berlanjut telah terjadi dengan latar belakang
                          peningkatan pembiayaan luar negeri bruto pada beberapa tahun terakhir, yang terutama di
                          dorong oleh peningkatan hutang luar negeri swasta bruto (lihat Kotak 2). Kemampuan
                          Indonesia untuk menjaga kuatnya aliran masuk FDI, menarik investasi modal portofolio
                          yang berpotensi volatil, dan mengelola penyesuaian yang dibutuhkan untuk menjamin neraca
                          dari posisi luar negerinya akan tetap menjadi fokus.

Kotak 2: Tingkat hutang eksternal tetap rendah namun risiko likuiditas telah meningkat
Tingkat hutang luar negeri Indonesia telah meningkat sejak tahun 2006, hampir mencapai dua kali lipat dari 133 miliar menjadi
257 miliar dolar AS pada bulan April 2013. Sejalan dengan peningkatan gejolak pasar yang tercatat selama periode itu dan sejak krisis
keuangan dunia tahun 2008-9, termasuk pada kuartal terakhir bagi pasar-pasar berkembang, peningkatan hutang luar negeri secara
absolut ini membutuhkan penelitian yang lebih cermat untuk mengukur kerentanan Indonesia terhadap kejutan yang berasal dari luar
negeri. Pada awalnya, perlu dicatat bahwa keberlanjutan posisi hutang luar negeri Indonesia adalah tanpa keraguan, menurun, sesuai
dengan laporan terakhir IMF (tahun 2012) Pasal IV, sebagai contoh, yang menemukan bahwa “…rasio hutang luar negeri Indonesia
diperkirakan akan terus menurun, dan tetap berada pada tingkat yang dapat dikelola, menurut semua skenario kejutan yang standar.”

Sementara jumlah hutang luar negeri (yang dimiliki oleh pihak asing) telah meningkat secara absolut, jumlahnya sebagai bagian dari
PDB mencatat tren yang menurun, dari 47,7 persen dari PDB pada tahun 2005 menjadi 29,7 persen dari PDB pada akhir tahun 2012
(Gambar 27). Penurunan tingkat hutang luar negeri ini didorong oleh penurunan tajam dalam hutang luar negeri pemerintah, yang
turun dari 28,4 persen menjadi 14,8 persen dari PDB. Sebaliknya, rasio hutang luar negeri sektor swasta telah menurun menjadi 12
persen pada tahun 2010 namun meningkat kembali menjadi 15 persen pada akhir 2012. Hutang swasta kini sebesar 50,2 persen dari
jumlah hutang luar negeri per akhir April, meningkat dari 40,3 persen pada tahun 2005.

Berlanjutnya peningkatan hutang swasta dari luar negeri pada beberapa tahun terakhir telah dipimpin oleh perusahaan-perusahaan
dari beberapa sektor, terutama yang bergerak dalam bidang pengeboran, listrik, gas dan air, dan keuangan, leasing dan jasa bisnis.
Pinjaman dari sektor keuangan, yang didorong oleh joint venture dan bank-bank asing, merupakan sebagian besar dari peningkatan
hutang tersebut. Hutang luar negeri sektor keuangan meningkat hampir tiga kali lipat, dari 12,9 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2006
menjadi 35,2 miliar dolar AS pada akhir bulan April 2013, atau 27,3 persen dari jumlah hutang luar negeri (Gambar 28), melampaui
hutang sektor manufaktur (yang turun menjadi 20,3 persen dari 32,4 persen dari bagian keseluruhan). Perusahaan-perusahaan dalam
pertambangan dan pengeboran merupakan sumber kegiatan paling aktif berikutnya dalam pinjaman luar negeri, dengan peningkatan
jumlah hutang empat kali lipat selama periode tahun 2006-2012 dan merupakan 16,8 persen dari jumlah hutang swasta dari luar negeri
per akhir bulan April 2013 (Gambar 28). Akhirnya, hutang luar negeri perusahaan-perusahaan pada sektor utilitas telah meningkat
dari 6,5 miliar menjadi 16,3 miliar dolar AS.

Metriks standar menunjukkan peningkatan risiko likuiditas yang berkaitan dengan posisi hutang eksternal Indonesia. Hutang luar
negeri jangka pendek (per jatuh tempo yang tersisa) telah meningkat secara signifikan sejak tahun 2006 dan kini menjadi 21,7 persen
dari jumlah hutang, naik dari 15,6 persen pada tahun 2006, yang umumnya disebabkan oleh peningkatan hutang luar negeri dari
sektor swasta, yang kini sebesar 72,6 persen dari jumlah hutang luar negeri jangka pendek, naik dari 59,4 persen pada tahun 2006.
Rasio hutang swasta luar negeri terhadap ekspor telah terus meningkat dari 9,9 persen menjadi 17,8 persen selama periode tersebut,
walau rasio ini juga terpengaruh oleh penurunan ekspor sejak tahun 2011. Hingga bulan April 2013, jumlah hutang luar negeri jangka
pendek setara dengan setengah dari jumlah cadangan devisa Indonesia (Gambar 27). Persyaratan pembiayaan jasa hutang luar negeri
Indonesia juga telah meningkat, naik sebagai bagian dari ekspor dari seperempat pada tahun 2007 menjadi lebih dari tiga per empat
pada tahun 2012 (Gambar 27) Juga terdapat peningkatan kebergantungan terhadap hutang dalam dolar AS, yang kini merupakan 88
persen dari jumlah hutang swasta dari luar negeri, dibanding hutang dalam yen Jepang. Karenanya, sementara sebagian perusahaan
menerima lindung nilai alami yang melekat pada dolar AS, seperti pada sektor pertambangan dan pengeboran, tingginya konsentrasi
hutang luar negeri dalam dolar AS dapat meningkatkan kerentanan yang lebih besar bila kurs tukar dolar AS mencatat apresiasi yang
tajam.

Sejumlah faktor-faktor memitigasi risiko-risiko yang dapat dihadapi Indonesia dari peningkatan penggunaan hutang luar negeri oleh
perbankan dan perusahaan. Pertama, pada sektor non-keuangan, sebagian besar pinjaman berasal dari perusahaan induk atau pemberi
pinjaman terafiliasi dan hutang antar perusahaan demikian dapat memiliki kerentanan yang lebih rendah terhadap risiko tidak
diperpanjangnya hutang, dan merupakan satu komponen dari kuatnya peningkatan aliran FDI ke Indonesia pada beberapa tahun
terakhir. Sesungguhnya data statistik resmi nampaknya mungkin merendahkan jumlah bagian hutang antar perusahaan dari jumlah
keseluruhan hutang luar negeri, karena hubungan antar perusahaan terafiliasi di dalam dan luar negeri tidaklah selalu transparan. Selain
itu, sejak tahun 2011, menurut Bank Indonesia, ketaatan akan persyaratan pelaporan hutang luar negeri juga telah meningkat,
memperjelas hutang swasta dari luar negeri di data statistik resmi dan mempersulit untuk menafsirkan peningkatan tren dalam
persediaan utang dan biaya jasa. Dengan berjalannya waktu, peningkatan yang berlangsung dalam cakupan statistika akan mendorong
peningkatan pemantauan dinamika hutang swasta Indonesia dari luar negeri, termasuk pada tingkat yang lebih mikro; 100 perusahaan
teratas dalam peringkat hutang luar negeri merupakan 65 persen dari tingkat paparan hutang secara keseluruhan.

                7. Risiko terhadap outlook tetap tinggi dari dalam dan luar negeri
Prospek pertumbuhan     Perkiraan dasar (base case) Bank Dunia bagi pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia adalah
menghadapi risiko…      pelambatan yang hanya kecil pada tahun 2013, dari 6,2 persen pada 2012 menjadi 5,9 persen
                        pada 2013, sebelum kembali meningkat pada tahun 2014. Risiko utama dari prospek ini
                        adalah terjadinya penurunan, dengan berlanjutnya pelemahan yang kecil dalam momentum
                        pertumbuhan dalam negeri dan Indonesia mengalami penurunan yang lebih besar.

…dengan reformasi       Peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi, sementara dibutuhkan secara fiskal dan merupakan
BBM bersubsidi          perkembangan yang positif dalam memenuhi sasaran pembangunan jangka menengah
membawa tantangan       Indonesia, membawa tantangan kepada pengelolaan ekonomi makro jangka pendek.
bagi pengelolaan        Peningkatan harga BBM pada awalnya akan mendorong peningkatan harga satu kali saja.
ekonomi makro jangka    Tekanan harga yang mendasari diperkirakan akan tetap terjaga, namun mungkin dibutuhkan
pendek…                 pengetatan moneter yang lebih erat bila peningkatan inflasi sementara menunjukkan tanda-
                        tanda perkiraan inflasi yang lebih tinggi, dan jika Rupiah tetap berada di bawah tekanan,
                        sehingga memperlambat laju pertumbuhan. Daya tahan konsumsi masyarakat, sumber
                        tunggal terbesar di dalam ekonomi, akan diuji pada sisa tahun 2013 dengan peningkatan
                        inflasi sementara tersebut.

…sementara              Melemahnya pertumbuhan investasi, yang dimulai pada pertengahan tahun 2012, tampaknya
pertumbuhan investasi   mencerminkan dampak tunda dari pelemahan harga komoditas sejak pertengahan tahun
terus melambat          2011. Kondisi sektor komoditas mempengaruhi investasi secara langsung, seperti terlihat dari
                        penurunan tajam dalam investasi asing dalam bidang transportasi, permesinan dan peralatan,
                        yang merupakan masukan utama dalam kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan komoditas.
                        Kekokohan permintaan komoditas secara tidak langsung juga mendorong permintaan
                        investasi dengan mempengaruhi pendapatan ekspor, konsumsi rumah tangga (melalui
                        penerimaan rumah tangga, terutama pada daerah-daerah yang mana produksi komoditas
                        merupakan hal yang penting), dan juga mempengaruhi ketersediaan pendanaan investasi
                        (melalui keuntungan perusahaan). Dengan rumitnya persyaratan perdagangan dan pengaruh
                        penerimaan tersebut, kecenderungan membengkaknya kebanyakan proyek-proyek investasi,
                        dan ketidakpastian yang mengelilingi harga-harga komoditas internasional, lintasan yang akan
                        dilalui oleh investasi sulit untuk diperkirakan dan merupakan sumber ketidakpastian dalam
                        proyeksi pertumbuhan. Selain itu, jika penurunan harga komoditas internasional terus
                        berlanjut, investasi dapat membawa beban yang lebih besar dari perkiraan terhadap
                        pertumbuhan.

Terdapat                Seperti dibahas pada laporan Bank Dunia tentang Prospek Ekonomi Dunia pada bulan Juni,
ketidakpastian baru     risiko yang mengikuti penurunan tajam dalam pertumbuhan ekonomi dunia, seperti yang
yang berkaitan dengan   timbul dari pembaruan tekanan pasar keuangan pada zona Euro, telah melemah sejak
permintaan luar         Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret 2013. Namun momentum pelambatan pada sejumlah ekonomi
negeri…                 berpenghasilan menengah dan penurunan tajam yang tercatat pada pasar-pasar berkembang
                        (emerging market) pada beberapa bulan terakhir menambah kepada ketidakpastian tentang jalur
                        lintasan ekonomi dunia. Penurunan lanjutan dalam harga komoditas dunia membawa risiko
                        penurunan yang khusus dan signifikan terhadap prospek ekonomi Indonesia.

berkelanjutan          bersubsidi, merupakan contoh-contoh kebijakan penyesuaian terhadap perubahan keadaan,
                       yang dapat membantu mengamankan stabilitas makro, untuk mendukung pertumbuhan ke
                       depan. Penyesuaian lanjutan terhadap kurs tukar Rupiah secara bertahap, sesuai dengan
                       perkembangan pada kondisi eksternal Indonesia, juga diperlukan. Menjaga pendekatan yang
                       fleksibel, tanpa kejutan dan dikomunikasikan dengan baik pada penyusunan kebijakan, dan
                       juga melanjutkan kemajuan dalam penerapan kebijakan dan peningkatan lingkungan

Walau masih terlalu   Kebakaran hutan dan gambut yang kini terjadi di Sumatra, yang menyebabkan asap tebal di

biayanya, asap yang   signifikan terhadap Indonesia yang berasal dari gangguan usaha, kehilangan produktivitas,
disebabkan oleh       pengiriman tenaga untuk menangani kebakaran (termasuk satuan khusus yang ditugaskan),
kebakaran hutan dan   dampak limpahan (spillover) ekonomi tambahan dari negara tetangga dan mitra perdagangan
gambut di Sumatra     yang terpengaruh, gangguan kesehatan dan degradasi aset hutan dan tanah. Jumlah biaya dan
adalah tambahan       risiko terhadap prospek ekonomi secara keseluruhan belum diketahui, namun diperkirakan
tantangan jangka      berada pada kisaran miliaran dolar. Peristiwa timbulnya asap pada tahun 1997/98
pendek                diperkirakan telah menimbulkan kerugian sebesar 9 miliar dolar AS bagi Asia Tenggara
                      (Applegate, 2006) dan 6,3 miliar dolar AS hanya untuk Indonesia (menurut Bank
                      Pembangunan Asia). Saat ini, dengan adanya industri pertanian dan pariwisata yang lebih
                      maju dan lebih padatnya populasi penduduk di daerah-daerah itu, kerugian ekonomi dapat
                      berjumlah lebih besar.

                      Dari sisi lingkungan hidup, kebakaran itu berpotensi menghapus sebagian besar kemajuan
                      yang baru-baru ini dicapai dalam mitigasi perubahan iklim di sektor kehutanan. Selain itu,
                      kebakaran dan asap tersebut menciptakan ketegangan dengan negara-negara tetangga yang
                      penting, mengganggu penyusun kebijakan dan menimbulkan publisitas internasional yang
                      negatif. Kenyataan bahwa hal ini merupakan kejadian musiman yang menimbulkan biaya
                      yang besar menyoroti tantangan pemerintahan yang signifikan dalam sektor sumber daya
                      alam. Walau penggunaan api telah dilarang (pada tahun 2001, Indonesia menetapkan
                      Peraturan Pemerintah [PP No 4/2001] yang melarang semua penggunaan api ke hutan dan
                      tanah), api masih dengan sengaja digunakan untuk membersihkan hutan, terutama pada
                      daerah-daerah konsensi perkebunan kelapa sawit dan tanaman industri. Penegakkan UU yang
                      ada dan praktik penggunaan tanah yang lebih baik membutuhkan usaha bersama dari
                      masyarakat dan sektor swasta, termasuk perusahaan perkebunan, yang kebanyakan berasal
                      dari Malaysia dan Singapura.

                1. Mencermati paket kompensasi subsidi BBM
Untuk menghindari        Pengurangan subsidi BBM diperkirakan akan meningkatkan inflasi, terutama yang didorong
dampak negatif dari      oleh peningkatan pada harga-harga BBM, bahan pangan dan biaya transportasi di seluruh
peningkatan harga        Indonesia, seperti dibahas pada sub-bagian 0 pada Bagian A. Karena biaya transportasi dan
BBM terhadap rakyat      bahan pangan merupakan bagian yang besar dari pengeluaran rumah tangga miskin dan
miskin, Pemerintah       rentan, peningkatan apapun pada biaya-biaya tersebut hampir pasti akan membawa dampak
akan berinvestasi pada   yang negatif. Proyeksi Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa, tanpa kompensasi, peningkatan
paket kompensasi         harga BBM (menjadi Rp 6.500 per liter untuk premium dan Rp 5.500 per liter untuk solar)
dengan jangkauan         akan memperlambat penurunan tingkat kemiskinan; tanpa kompensasi, tingkat kemiskinan
yang luas…               resmi akan turun dari 12 persen pada bulan Maret 2012 menjadi 10,5 persen pada bulan
                         Maret 2014, menunjukkan laju pengentasan kemiskinan yang lebih lambat dibanding
                         pencapaian pada beberapa tahun terakhir. Sebaliknya, dengan kebijakan kompensasi jangka
                         pendek berupa bantuan langsung tunai kepada rumah tangga miskin dan rentan selama
                         empat bulan, proyeksi menunjukkan bahwa penurunan tingkat kemiskinan akan lebih
                         signifikan, menjadi 9,4 persen pada bulan Maret 2014. Paket kompensasi yang disertakan di
                         dalam APBN-P diharapkan akan memainkan peran yang penting dalam membantu
                         Indonesia untuk melanjutkan penurunan tingkat kemiskinan walau dengan harga BBM
                         bersubsidi yang lebih tinggi, dan juga menjadi langkah perluasan yang signifikan dari
                         perlindungan sosial untuk jangka waktu yang lebih panjang. Bagian ini akan meninjau
                         masing-masing komponen dari keseluruhan paket kompensasi Pemerintah, dan menilai
                         sejauh mana program-program tersebut diharapkan akan memberikan bantuan yang
                         memadai, tepat waktu dan efektif untuk melindungi rumah tangga miskin dan rentan yang
                         paling tidak mampu untuk menghadapi dampak negatif dari kenaikan harga BBM.6

perlindungan sosial          dapat membantu dan mendukung upaya pengentasan kemiskinan yang sedang berlangsung –
pada jangka panjang          terutama dengan menargetkan rumah tangga yang paling miskin – dan menangani
                             kesenjangan yang meningkat.

                             Sebagai cerminan dari kedua jenis respon tersebut, Pemerintah Indonesia menyiapkan paket
                             kompensasi di dalam APBN-P 2013 yang belum lama ini disetujui oleh DPR. Paket yang
                             berjumlah Rp 29,05 triliun atau sekitar 74 persen dari jumlah penghematan subsidi BBM
                             tersebut memiliki dua komponen utama, yaitu: a) Program Kompensasi Khusus, dan b)
                             Program Percepatan dan Perluasan Perlindungan Sosial (P4S).

                                  dilakukan melalui program Beras Miskin (Raskin), Pemerintah memberikan tambahan
                                  45 kg beras bersubsidi kepada rumah tangga yang menerima BLSM. Pembagiannya
                                  dalam karung berukuran 15 kg sekali setiap bulan selama tiga bulan.

                       rentan dari dampak kenaikan harga BBM. Para penentang menganggap bahwa bantuan
                       langsung tunai tersebut dapat dengan mudah dipolitisasi dan digunakan sebagai alat bagi
                       partai-partai politik untuk mengumpulkan dukungan bagi pemilihan umum tahun 2014.
                       Selain itu, terdapat banyak kekhawatiran mengenai efektivitas penggunaan bantuan langsung
                       tunai untuk melindungi rakyat miskin. Para penentang menganggap program tersebut
                       tidaklah efektif; cenderung akan menimbulkan pemborosan, tidak sampai kepada mereka
                       yang memang membutuhkan perlindungan, mendorong kemalasan pada orang miskin atau
                       menciptakan kebergantungan yang lebih besar terhadap negara.

…namun penelitian      Penelitian mengenai pemberian bantuan langsung tunai di Indonesia dapat memberikan
menunjukkan bahwa      penjelasan terhadap debat terkait efektivitas program BLSM.7 Setelah peningkatan harga
bantuan langsung       BBM pada tahun 2005, Pemerintah meluncurkan program Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT),
tunai merupakan cara   yang memberikan dana kompensasi tunai dengan jumlah keseluruhan Rp 1.200.000 ke 19
yang efektif untuk     juta rumah tangga penerima, terbagi dalam empat kali pembayaran. Program itu dijalankan
memberikan             kembali pada tahun 2008 ketika harga BBM kembali dinaikkan, dan 18,4 juta rumah tangga
perlindungan yang      menerima kompensasi sejumlah Rp 900.000 yang terbagi dalam tiga kali pembayaran. Melalui
cepat                  penelitian yang dilakukan oleh Bank Dunia terkait implementasi dan efektivitas bantuan
                       langsung tunai di Indonesia tersebut, ditemukan bahwa:
                        BLT efektif untuk mencegah rumah tangga miskin dari pengaruh negatif. Dana bantuan yang
                            setara dengan sekitar 15 persen jumlah pengeluaran bulanan tersebut, cukup memadai
                            untuk mencegah rumah tangga yang ditargetkan dari keterperosokan yang lebih dalam.
                            Selain itu, terdapat pengaruh sampingan yaitu: program BLT turut menstimulasi
                            peningkatan belanja antar rumah tangga yang tidak menerima bantuan. Karenanya, Bank
                            Dunia memperkirakan bahwa tanpa BLT tahun 2008-09, tingkat kemiskinan akan
                            meningkat menjadi 15,8 persen pada bulan Maret 2009 dari 15,4 persen pada bulan
                            Maret 2008, dan bukan menurun menjadi 14,2 persen, seperti yang terjadi dengan
                            adanya program BLT.
                        Tidak terdapat bukti bahwa rumah tangga penerima menghabiskan dana BLT secara keliru. BLT
                            digunakan untuk membeli barang-barang pokok (terutama beras), biaya satu kali seperti
                            uang sekolah, pakaian yang dipakai untuk menyambut liburan Lebaran, atau biaya
                            transportasi. Belanja untuk rokok dan minuman keras tidak meningkat pada rumah
                            tangga penerima BLT dibanding dengan rumah tangga miskin yang tidak menerima
                            bantuan tersebut.
                        Juga tidak terdapat bukti bahwa BLT mendorong kemalasan atau kebergantungan. Para kepala
                            rumah tangga yang menerima BLT tidak memiliki kecenderungan yang lebih besar
                            untuk keluar dari pekerjaannya. Hal ini terutama disebabkan karena ukuran bantuan
                            yang tidak cukup besar, atau cukup lama, untuk mendorong tindakan berhenti dari
                            pekerjaan. Faktanya, rumah tangga penerima BLT memiliki kecenderungan yang lebih
                            besar (sebesar 10 persen untuk menemukan pekerjaan baru dan pindah ke tempat kerja
                            baru. Hal ini mungkin terjadi karena dana BLT digunakan untuk membayar ongkos
                            transportasi untuk mengakses pekerjaan yang lebih baik, namun dengan jarak yang lebih
                            jauh, atau untuk membayar jasa tempat penitipan anak.
                        Dana BLT diterima oleh hampir seluruh penerima sesuai daftar penerima bantuan, tetapi petugas
                            setempat semakin banyak melakukan “pungutan liar” dari para penerima. Bantuan dikirimkan
                            langsung dari Kementerian Keuangan kepada rumah tangga penerima bantuan melalui
                            kantor pos untuk mencegah kesalahan pengiriman. Namun terdapat laporan bahwa
                            setelah bantuan langsung tunai diterima, sejumlah petugas kantor pos dan petugas
                            daerah setempat meminta “ongkos”. Tingkat kejadian adalah 10 persen pada tahun
                            2005, dan 46-54 persen pada tahun 2008-09. Hal ini umumnya dilakukan untuk
                            mendistribusikan ulang bantuan kepada rumah tangga yang tidak termasuk di dalam
                            daftar (karena kesalahan penargetan atau alasan lainnya), memberikan subsidi untuk
                            transportasi kolektif, dan biaya pembuatan kartu identitas (KTP).

                              program BLT di Indonesia mengatakan bahwa bantuan tersebut mengikis semangat
                              kebersamaan sosial seperti yang umum terlihat pada kegiatan gotong royong. Sejauh ini
                              tidak ada penelitian yang membuktikan dengan jelas dampak positif maupun negatif dari
                              BLT.
                         Temuan-temuan itu menunjukkan bahwa bantuan langsung tunai bersifat efektif dalam
                         memberikan bantuan sementara untuk melindungi rumah tangga miskin dari guncangan
                         harga jangka pendek. Selain itu, mekanisme distribusi bantuan lebih langsung dan sederhana
                         dari program-program bantuan lain yang ada di Indonesia, walaupun langkah pelaksanaan
                         tetap menjadi isu yang penting agar bantuan dapat sepenuhnya efektif.

Namun luputnya           Namun demikian, BLT masih melewatkan banyak rumah tangga miskin dan rentan yang
sejumlah rakyat miskin   tidak disertakan ke dalam daftar penerima bantuan. Dengan cakupan sebanyak 18,5 juta
dari daftar penerima     rumah tangga, BLT ditargetkan bagi 30 persen rumah tangga paling miskin. Dari jumlah
bantuan menunjukkan      tersebut, seperti tercantum dalam laporan terbaru Bank Dunia, sekitar setengah tidak
kebutuhan akan           disertakan ke dalam daftar penerima bantuan, dan setengah dari seluruh bantuan diterima
metode penargetan        oleh rumah tangga yang tidak termasuk dalam 30 persen rumah tangga termiskin. Namun
yang lebih baik          bila metode penargetan tersebut dibandingkan dengan metode penargetan bagi program-
                         program bantuan sosial utama lainnya di Indonesia, BLT mencatat prestasi terbaik. Agar
                         efektif sebagai alat bantuan sosial, metode penargetan program harus menjamin bahwa
                         bantuan diterima oleh rumah tangga yang miskin dan rentan.

Namun, bantuan           Bantuan dalam bentuk barang, seperti beras bersubsidi melalui Raskin, adalah mekanisme
dalam bentuk barang      lain yang secara cepat dapat memberikan perlindungan kepada rumah tangga yang rentan.
terbukti kurang          Dalam penelitian sebelumnya, ditemukan bahwa program tersebut menghadapi banyak
terpercaya               tantangan pelaksanaan.8 Pada tahun 2010, rumah tangga penerima melaporkan bahwa
                         mereka membeli rata-rata 3,8 kg beras perbulan, jauh lebih kecil dari alokasi 13-16 kg beras
                         bersubsidi yang seharusnya diberikan kepada rumah tangga miskin dan rentan (berdasarkan
                         pengumuman Pemerintah). Sementara, sejumlah beras didistribusikan ulang lintas
                         masyarakat, hingga sebanyak 30 persen alokasi Raskin (menurut perkiraan antara bulan
                         November 2003 dan Januari 2004) lenyap antara titik-titik distribusi dan rumah tangga
                         pembeli Raskin; pada sejumlah daerah tingkat kehilangan ini mencapai hingga 75 persen.
                         Selain itu, harga Raskin bagi rumah tangga biasanya lebih tinggi dari harga yang ditetapkan.
                         Antara bulan November 2006 dan Januari 2007, rumah tangga penerima melaporkan bahwa
                         mereka membayar Rp 1.689 per kilogram untuk Raskin, sementara harga resmi adalah Rp
                         1.000 per kilogram. Upaya-upaya kini masih terus dilakukan untuk meningkatkan metode
                         penargetan, sosialisasi, dan pengiriman bantuan Raskin.

Penyempurnaan            Sejak tahun 2010, Sekretariat Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan Kemiskinan
metode penargetan        (TNP2K), dengan bantuan Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS), telah mengembangkan Basis Data

kemungkinan bantuan      penting untuk menjadi pencatatan tunggal untuk penargetan seluruh program, dibanding
untuk diterima oleh      penggunaan daftar-daftar yang terpecah yang digunakan oleh program-program yang
rumah tangga yang        berbeda seperti yang dilakukan sebelumnya.9 Sebagai hasilnya, rumah tangga miskin akan
tepat …                  lebih mungkin untuk menerima semua program yang berhak mereka terima, dibanding hanya
                         menerima sebagian saja. Selain itu, rancangan basis data (database) yang cermat, dan mengacu
                         kepada praktik-praktik terbaik internasional, akan memungkinkan banyak rumah tangga
                         miskin yang sebelumnya tidak termasuk ke dalam daftar, untuk diikutsertakan sebagai
                         penerima program bantuan.

                        seperti Jamkesda (jaminan kesehatan yang melengkapi Jamkesmas), menggunakan BDT
                        untuk melakukan koordinasi dalam memilih penerima bantuan dan menghindari tumpang-
                        tindih antar penerima.

                        Dengan peluncuran Program Kompensasi Khusus (P4S), Pemerintah memanfaatkan
                        kesempatan untuk menerbitkan Kartu Perlindungan Sosial (KPS) kepada 15,5 juta rumah
                        tangga paling miskin di dalam basis data tersebut. Kartu ini menjadi dasar penerimaan BLSM
                        dan tambahan bantuan Raskin dari program kompensasi, dan pemegang kartu juga berhak
                        atas perluasan program BSM di bawah P4S. Penggunaan kartu tunggal bagi berbagai
                        program menandai langkah awal yang penting menuju kerangka bantuan sosial terpadu di
                        Indonesia. Ini adalah pertama kali Indonesia melakukan koordinasi program bantuan sosial
                        dan penerimanya dengan menggunakan basis data tunggal, yang akan membuka jalan kepada
                        penyampaian bantuan yang terpadu di kemudian hari, dan juga untuk menerima keluhan
                        maupun pengaduan.

…dan memastikan         Selain itu, Pemerintah akan berkoordinasi dengan masyarakat setempat untuk menyertakan
bahwa daftar penerima   rumah tangga miskin yang kini belum terdaftar di dalam BDT. Penelitian lapangan terbaru
bantuannya selalu       oleh Pemerintah, Bank Dunia dan Abdul Latif Jameel Poverty Action Lab (J-PAL, dari
diperbaharui            Departemen Ekonomi, Massachusetts Institute of Technology) telah menunjukkan bahwa
                        keterlibatan masyarakat yang difasilitasi secara cermat dapat meningkatkan kualitas
                        penargetan, terutama dalam mengidentifikasi penduduk termiskin. Temuan-temuan itu
                        didapat dari percobaan yang terkendali, dengan menggunakan fasilitator yang terlatih.
                        Namun, keberhasilan penerapan metode-metode penargetan komunitas akan bergantung
                        pada perancangan dan pelaksanaan metode-metode yang dapat diperluas jangkauannya dan
                        dilakukan kembali pada berbagai komunitas di seluruh Indonesia. Jika berhasil, proses
                        penargetan komunitas tidak hanya akan membantu menemukan rumah tangga tambahan
                        untuk menerima bantuan, namun juga akan berkontribusi kepada rencana pembaruan dan
                        perluasan basis data pada tahun 2014, karena rumah tangga-rumah tangga tersebut akan
                        disertakan ke dalam proses sertifikasi ulang, yang merupakan keharusan agar BDT selalu
                        mencakup data dan informasi terkini.

                                  tangga pada tahun 2013 dan 3,2 juta rumah tangga pada tahun 2014. Pada saat yang

                             jangka panjangnya, Indonesia secara efektif menggunakan kesempatan ini untuk
                             meningkatkan dan mereformasi sistem bantuan sosial yang memang sangat dibutuhkan. Pada
                             tahun 2010, Indonesia menghabiskan hampir Rp 30 triliun untuk program-program bantuan
                             sosialnya, yang setara dengan 0,5 persen dari PDB. Angka itu termasuk rendah dibanding
                             negara-negara Asia Timur yang secara rata-rata menghabiskan 1 persen dari PDB, atau
                             negara-negara Amerika Latin yang secara rata-rata menghabiskan 1,3 persen dari PDB.
                             Walau masih terdapat kebutuhan untuk memperdalam investasi dalam perlindungan sosial di
                             saat Indonesia bertransisi ke sistem yang lebih mutakhir yang sesuai bagi negara dengan
                             penghasilan menengah, alokasi ulang penghematan subsidi BBM tahun ini merupakan
                             langkah yang signifikan ke arah yang tepat.

bantuan pendidikan di       bantuan sosial ini.10
Indonesia…
                            Peningkatan kecukupan bantuan BSM. Di masa lalu, bantuan tidaklah mencukupi bagi keluarga
                            miskin untuk mempertahankan agar anak-anaknya tetap mengenyam pendidikan. Umumnya,
                            jumlah bantuan setara dengan sekitar 30 persen biaya pendidikan yang harus dibayar oleh
                            keluarga penerima bantuan. Jumlah besaran BSM juga tidak mengikuti indeks inflasi;
                            karenanya para penerima melihat jumlah bantuan semakin tidak mencukupi seiring dengan
                            berjalannya waktu. Dengan meningkatkan bantuan melalui program P4S, maka terdapat
                            kemungkinan yang lebih besar bagi rumah tangga untuk dapat mempertahankan anak-
                            anaknya di sekolah demi menyelesaikan tingkat pendidikan dasar dan menengah pertama
                            sesuai dengan program wajib belajar.

                            Penyempurnaan penargetan bantuan BSM. Program P4S melanjutkan perombakan yang dilakukan
                            Pemerintah terhadap metode yang digunakan untuk menargetkan BSM. Seperti telah
                            dijelaskan di atas, Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan dan Kementerian Agama telah
                            bekerjasama dengan Sekretariat TNP2K dalam penggunaan BDT untuk menarget penerima
                            BSM. Sebelumnya, distribusi bantuan dilakukan oleh komite sekolah berdasarkan kuota
                            setempat namun tidak dikaitkan dengan tingkat kemiskinan daerah. Penargetan tersebut
                            mencatat kinerja yang buruk; seorang siswa dari kelompok 60 persen rumah tangga yang
                            paling mampu memiliki kesempatan yang setara untuk menerima bantuan seperti siswa dari
                            kelompok 40 persen rumah tangga yang paling tidak mampu.

                            Selain penggunaan BDT untuk menemukan siswa penerima bantuan, perubahan besar
                            mengenai mekanisme pencairan bantuan juga telah dibuat. Para siswa dari keluarga yang
                            berhak kini dapat membawa Kartu Perlindungan Sosial beserta dokumen pelengkap lainnya
                            ke sekolah untuk menerima bantuan tersebut. Dengan memberikan wewenang langsung
                            kepada para penerima, diperkirakan perluasan BSM melalui program P4S akan lebih
                            menjamin peruntukan bantuan yang lebih besar agar diterima oleh para siswa yang memiliki
                            risiko terbesar untuk putus sekolah.

…dan perlindungan           PKH adalah program perlindungan sosial yang telah terbukti efektif dalam menghadapi
sosial yang lebih efektif   kondisi kemiskinan yang sangat dan berkepanjangan. Evaluasi dampak program PKH yang
bagi rumah tangga           dilakukan oleh Bank Dunia pada tahun 2011 menemukan bahwa para penerima memiliki
sangat miskin yang          kecenderungan yang lebih besar untuk menggunakan layanan kesehatan setempat dan
ditargetkan oleh PKH        mengikuti perilaku hidup sehat seperti: layanan kesehatan pra-persalinan, persalinan pada
                            sarana kesehatan, layanan pasca-persalinan, imunisasi, serta pemeriksaan dan pemantauan
                            pertumbuhan bagi bayi dan balita.11 Namun, dampak program terhadap peningkatan
                            pendaftaran siswa dan lamanya bersekolah tidaklah signifikan secara statistik (kecuali pada
                            jumlah jam yang dihabiskan di sekolah, dengan peningkatan hanya lima persen di atas nilai
                            dasar atau baseline). Seperti halnya BSM, terkait dengan permasalahan implementasi PKH
                            yang dipaparkan dalam tinjauan Bank Dunia atas program-program bantuan sosial
                            Indonesia, reformasi yang akan dilakukan melalui program P4S juga diharapkan dapat
                            meningkatkan efektivitas program PKH.

                            Peningkatan kecukupan bantuan PKH. Tampaknya, dampak sepenuhnya dari program tidak
                            dapat direalisasikan karena besar bantuan PKH tidak sesuai dengan biaya yang harus
                            ditanggung oleh keluarga untuk mengakses layanan kesehatan dan pendidikan. Sebagai
                            contoh, besar bantuan memang mencukupi untuk menutup biaya pendidikan sekolah
                            menengah pertama selama satu tahun, namun jumlahnya hanya mencukupi kurang dari

                       ongkos layanan persalinan oleh bidan berkisar antara Rp 200.000 – Rp 800.000 (berdasarkan
                       penelitian SMERU tahun 2008), yang pada ujung tertinggi adalah setara dengan bantuan
                       PKH yang lalu bagi ibu hamil. Besar bantuan juga belum disesuaikan dengan inflasi, yang
                       telah mengikis nilai sesungguhnya dari bantuan tersebut seiring dengan berjalannya waktu;
                       hal ini mengakibatkan penurunan nilai riil bantuan sebesar 22 persen antara tahun 2007 dan
                       2010 (disesuaikan dengan menggunakan inflasi pada bundle konsumsi rakyat miskin).

                       Di bawah program P4S, jumlah minimum bantuan akan meningkat dari Rp 600.000 menjadi
                       Rp 800.000 per keluarga pertahun, dan jumlah maksimumnya akan meningkat dari Rp
                       2.200.000 menjadi Rp 2.800.000 (perhitungannya berdasarkan jumlah anak dan umur anak,
                       dan penyertaan ibu hamil atau menyusui di dalam suatu keluarga). Selain itu, dengan
                       menerima Kartu Perlindungan Sosial, keluarga penerima PKH secara otomatis memiliki
                       akses terhadap program BSM, BLSM dan alokasi Raskin. Ini merupakan pertama kalinya di
                       Indonesia dimana program-program terpisah dilaksanakan sebagai suatu sistem untuk
                       memberikan dukungan menyeluruh terhadap rumah tangga yang sangat miskin. Secara
                       bersamaan, bantuan ini akan memungkinkan mereka untuk mengakses layanan kesehatan
                       dan pendidikan dengan lebih baik, sehingga meningkatkan kemungkinan anak-anak mereka
                       dapat membantu diri mereka sendiri untuk keluar dari lingkaran kemiskinan.

                       2009 menyatakan bahwa mereka hanya menerima 39-50 persen dari besar bantuan yang
                       ditetapkan. Walau membutuhkan waktu untuk membangun sistem pelaksanaan yang efektif,
                       terdapat beberapa tindakan yang dapat segera diambil oleh pemerintah untuk memantau dan
                       meningkatkan pelaksanaan program-program P4S.

                          Pertama, fokus pada peningkatan kesadaran penerima bantuan akan jenis-jenis bantuan yang berhak
                           mereka terima sesuai paket kompensasi. Pada masa lalu, pelaksanaan program-program
                           bantuan sosial dirintangi oleh terbatasnya pengetahuan penerima bantuan tentang
                           program bantuan dan bagaimana mendapatkannya. Sebagai contoh, sebagian besar
                           pemegang kartu Jamkesmas yang diwawancarai tidak mengetahui jenis-jenis layanan
                           rawat jalan yang berhak mereka terima. Suatu percobaan yang dilakukan oleh J-PAL
                           bersama dengan Sekretariat TNP2K dalam inovasi pengiriman Raskin, menemukan
                           bahwa penerima bantuan menerima lebih banyak beras bersubsidi ketika mendapatkan
                           informasi mengenai berapa banyak beras yang berhak mereka terima melalui kegiatan
                           peningkatan kesadaran. Oleh sebab itu, bahan-bahan komunikasi dan strategi yang
                           disiapkan oleh Sekretariat TNP2K untuk P4S memainkan peran penting dalam
                           keseluruhan implementasi program, namun penggunaan bahan-bahan tersebut demi
                           meningkatkan kesadaran para penerima bantuan dan masyarakat secara umum masih
                           menjadi tanggung jawab utama dari lembaga pelaksana program.
                          Kedua, melaksanakan pemantauan program tepat pada waktunya untuk memperbaiki masalah-
                           masalah yang dijumpai selama implementasi dan menjamin akuntabilitas pelaksanaan P4S.
                           Pemantauan program umumnya dilakukan oleh lembaga pelaksana setempat dan
                           didelegasikan dengan dukungan teknis dan keuangan yang terbatas, tanpa adanya sistem
                           pemberian tanggapan untuk menyelesaikan masalah-masalah yang dijumpai. Program
                           P4S menghadirkan kesempatan untuk menguji inovasi dalam memantau pelaksanaan
                           program. Kemungkinan-kemungkinannya mencakup: pemantauan implementasi oleh
                           pihak ketiga (misalnya, jaringan universitas dan LSM, keduanya memiliki jaringan yang
                           luas dan terpercaya), pemantauan melalui pelaksanaan survei nasional yang dilakukan
                           oleh BPS, dan uji coba penggunaan teknologi bergerak (mobile), serta pusat-pusat
                           penerimaan keluhan. Sementara lembaga-lembaga koordinator di tingkat pusat, seperti
                           Sekretariat TNP2K dan Bappenas, akan memainkan peran yang besar dalam merancang

 Menanggapi berbagai tekanan                                    Perkembangan Triwulanan
                                                                 Perekonomian Indonesia

                    dan melaksanakan sistem pemantauan. Kerja sama antara lembaga pelaksana di tingkat
                    pusat dan pemerintah daerah juga merupakan hal yang sangat penting.
                   Akhirnya, melakukan evaluasi menyeluruh untuk menilai efektivitas program. Belajar dari
                    pengalaman ini, Pemerintah dapat memperbaiki rancangan dan kinerja program-
                    program perlindungan sosialnya dengan mempelajari hal-hal yang berhasil dan yang
                    gagal dilaksanakan. Jika memungkinkan, temuan-temuan hasil evaluasi dapat dikaitkan
                    dengan alokasi anggaran di masa yang akan datang dari lembaga-lembaga pelaksana
                    untuk mendorong penyempurnaan pelaksanaan program.

                  2. Tantangan Indonesia: pelaksanan Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional
                     yang baru
Indonesia sedang            Pemerintah Indonesia sedang dalam proses pelaksanaan Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional
melaksanakan sistem         yang baru. . Program-program SJSN bersifat wajib dan akan mencakup seluruh penduduk
jaminan sosial yang         Indonesia, termasuk pekerja sektor formal dan informal, dengan lima program jaminan,
baru…                       yaitu: jaminan kesehatan, jaminan pensiun (manfaat pasti), jaminan hari tua (iuran pasti),
                            jaminan kematian dan jaminan kecelakaan kerja – dan akan memberikan manfaat yang sama
                            kepada semua. Iuran-iuran program SJSN ditetapkan pada tingkat yang cukup untuk
                            membiayai pengeluaran, setiap dana jaminan sosial harus dapat membiayai dirinya sendiri
                            (self-sustaining). Dasar hukum sistem baru tersebut adalah UU No. 40/2004 tentang Sistem
                            Jaminan Sosial Nasional (UU SJSN) dan UU No. 24/2011 tentang Badan Penyelenggara
                            Jaminan Sosial (UU BPJS). Bagian ini memberikan tinjauan singkat akan pelaksanaan SJSN,
                            dengan fokus pada tantangan-tantangan utama dan faktor-faktor yang patut
                            dipertimbangkan demi keberhasilan penerapan sistem jaminan sosial nasional.

…yang dapat                 Sistem jaminan sosial nasional akan membantu menggerakkan peningkatan penghasilan
membawa banyak              bersih penduduk untuk memperkuat dan memperluas cakupan jaminan kesehatan,
manfaat bagi                memberikan proteksi ketika terjadi kematian dini dan kecelakaan kerja, sertamemberikan
masyarakat dan negara       jaminan pendapatan setelah keluar dari angkatan kerja. Program-program SJSN sejalan
                            dengan agenda pro-poor, pro-jobs, pro-growth pemerintah, dan akan berperan penting
                            dalam mendukung kebijakan-kebijakan ekonomi makro pemerintah, seperti diuraikan pada
                            rencana pembangunan jangka menengah maupun panjang. Mereka juga menjadi bagian dari
                            program-program untuk menjamin hak asasi dan martabat individu bagi seluruh rakyat
                            Indonesia. Dengan penerapan yang baik, program-program SJSN akan membantu
                            mengurangi kerentanan, memberi perlindungan terhadap kejutan ekonomi, mendorong
                            mobilitas kerja, menurunkan kemiskinan orang lanjut usia, membantu mengurangi
                            ketidaksetaraan, dan memobilisasi kelangkaan tabungan.

Pemenuhan visi SJSN         Keberhasilan sistem yang baru itu pada akhirnya akan bergantung kepada seberapa baik
bergantung pada             rancangan, penerapan dan pengelolaannya. Upaya Pemerintah untuk menerapkan sistem
keputusan dan               jaminan sosial nasional yang dirancang dengan baik, berkelanjutan secara fiskal, kokoh dan
tindakan yang akan          menyeluruh akan menjadi tantangan dan membutuhkan serangkaian tindakan-tindakan besar
datang                      dari Pemerintah dan BPJS agar dapat berhasil. Kerjasama antar kelompok kerja pelaksana
                            dari berbagai Kementerian akan diperlukan untuk memastikan persetujuan bersama akan
                            strategi yang luas bagi implementasi dan operasional sistem baru tersebut.

                       a. Menempatkan perubahan ke dalam konteks: dimana posisi Indonesia
                          sekarang
Cakupan jaminan             Indonesia kini memiliki skema jaminan sosial yang mencakup segmen-segmen pasar tenaga
sosial saat ini terpecah    kerja yang terpisah. Masing-masing skema dikelola oleh badan yang berbeda. Para pengelola
dan tidak lengkap…          ini merupakan BUMN pencari laba yang melapor kepada Kementerian BUMN dan diawasi
                            oleh berbagai Kementerian yang berbeda. Hanya sekitar 12 persen pekerja yang ikut serta
                            dalam programpensiun, dimana hampir semuanya berada di sektor formal, dan hanya 60
                            persen dari seluruh penduduk Indonesia yang terlindungi oleh asuransi kesehatan.

…dengan cakupan             PT Taspen mengelola program pensiun dan tabungan hari tua bagi pegawai negeri sipil (non-
bagi pegawai negeri         Kemhan/POLRI) dan pejabat negara, sementara PT Asabri mengelola program ASABRI
sipil, militer dan polisi   dan pensiun bagi anggota militer dan polisi serta PNS Kemhan/POLRI. Pegawai negeri sipil
                            dan pejabat negara beserta ahli warisnya (janda/duda/anak/orang tua) berhak menerima
                            manfaat pensiun seumur hidup (annuity) yang dibiayai melalui APBN dan dibayarkan melalui
                            PT Taspen (bagi PNS Non-Kemhan/POLRI) atau PT Asabri (bagi PNS Kemhan/POLRI)
                            sesuai peraturan perundang-undangan yang berlaku. Pegawai negeri sipil (Non-
                            Kemhan/POLRI) dan pejabat negara juga berhak menerima tabungan hari tua yang
                            dibayarkan sekaligus (lump sum) ketika memasuki masa pensiun dan uang duka
                            (wafat/tewas) sebelum dan sesudah pensiun. Adapun anggota militer dan polisi juga berhak

                         serta 9 program ASABRI yang berlaku juga bagi PNS Kemhan/POLRI yang dikelola oleh
                         PT Asabri.

…tetapi cakupan yang     PT Jamsostek memberikan jaminan sosial bagi pekerja sektor formal. Setiap perusahaan
terbatas bagi pekerja    wajib mendaftarkan dirinya dan para pekerjanya ke PT Jamsostek serta membayar iuran
sektor formal…           jaminan sosial ketenagakerjaan kepada para pegawainya. Sesuai UU No.3 Tahun 1992
                         tentang JAMSOSTEK, terdapat 4 program JAMSOSTEK, yaitu: Jaminan Pemeliharaan
                         Kesehatan, Jaminan Kecelakaan Kerja, Jaminan Kematian, dan Jaminan Hari Tua.

…dan cakupan yang        Sebagian besar pekerja sektor informal tidak memiliki jaminan sosial. Terdapat program uji
sangat terbatas          coba berukuran kecil bagi pekerja informal yang disponsori oleh Jamsostek yang antara lain
terhadap sektor          menyertakan program jaminan hari tua. Laju perluasan cakupan melalui program uji coba itu
informal dan kesehatan   sangatlah lambat. Jumlah anggota hanya mencapai 400.000 orang pada akhir tahun 2010.
                         Tingkat pergantian keanggotaan juga tinggi, karena para anggota bebas untuk masuk dan
                         keluar dari program itu kapan saja.

                         Dalam hal cakupan asuransi kesehatan, PT Askes hanya memberikan jaminan kesehatan
                         kepada pegawai negeri sipil, pejabat negara, pensiunan, dan veteran beserta keluarganya yang
                         mencakup 16.4 juta penduduk. PT Jamsostek memberikan jaminan pemeliharaan kesehatan
                         kepada sekitar 5.5 juta penduduk, sementara 10 juta lainnya diberikan oleh pemberi kerja
                         yang tidak memilih program jaminan pemeliharaan kesehatan Jamsostek dan memutuskan
                         untuk ikut pada programnya sendiri. Program bebas biaya Jamkesmas yang disponsori oleh
                         Kementerian Kesehatan memberikan jaminan kepada 86.4 juta penduduk yang miskin dan
                         rentan, sementara program-program Jamkesda (yang dibiayai oleh anggaran pemerintah
                         daerah dan pada umumnya melengkapi program nasional Jamkesmas) mencakup 32 juta,
                         walaupun beberapa diantaranya juga dicakup oleh Jamkesmas. Terakhir, sekitar 5 juta
                         individu membeli asuransi kesehatan swasta. Secara keseluruhan, jumlah yang tercakup
                         adalah 150 juta atau sekitar 60 percent dari jumlah penduduk.

Implementasi SJSN,       Implementasi program SJSN dimulai segera setelah penetapan UU BPJS pada bulan
yang dimulai dengan      November 2011. UU ini dapat mengurangi jumlah administrator (pengelola) jaminan sosial,
sistem kesehatan,        membawa struktur hukum dan tata kelola yang baru dan menyederhanakan sistem
sedang berjalan…         pengawasan, meningkatkan transparansi dan memberikan informasi publik yang lebih
                         terbuka. Sebagai tambahan, penerbitan keputusan Menko Kesra pada bulan Februari 2012
                         yang kemudian diamandemen pada bulan Maret 2012, telah menetapkan susunan birokrasi
                         dan tanggung jawab penerapan SJSN.

                         Sistem kesehatan SJSN akan dimulai pada 1 Januari 2014. Pemerintah telah mulai
                         menerbitkan peraturan pelaksanaan jaminan kesehatan. Iuran yang akan dipungut dari
                         masyarakat miskin, sektor informal dan formal masih dalam pembahasan. Manfaat paket
                         kesehatan bersifat menyeluruh dan mencakup hampir semua jenis internvensi medis yang
                         dibutuhkan. Hal ini sejalan dengan yang disyaratkan oleh UU SJSN. Paket tersebut juga
                         mempertahankan tingkat cakupan yang luas yang saat ini diberikan oleh program Jamkesmas,
                         yang memiliki paket manfaat tertinggi dibanding program lainnya di Indonesia saat ini.
                         Bahkan tindakan medis mahal seperti operasi jantung, transplantasi organ, hemodialisis, dan
                         pengobatan kanker juga termasuk dalam manfaat. Hal ini akan membawa tekanan yang besar
                         terhadap sistem kesehatan di Indonesia, karena akan membutuhkan waktu yang lama bagi
                         pemerintah untuk meningkatkan sisi penawaran – fasilitas, perlengkapan, alat-alat medis dan
                         tenaga medis profesional – untuk dapat memenuhi harapan permintaan terhadap layanan
                         kesehatan yang lebih canggih.

                         Program-program ketenagakerjaan SJSN – termasuk jaminan pensiun (manfaat pasti)jaminan
                         hari tua (iuran pasti), jaminan kematian dan jaminan kecelakaan kerja - akan dimulai
                         selambat-lambatnya pada tanggal 1 Juli 2015 dan karenanya masih berada dalam tahap awal
                         pengembangan . Peta jalan (roadmap) penerapannya diperkirakan akan segera diterbitkan.
                         Diskusi yang aktif tentang rancangan dan pembiayaan program-program ketenagakerjaan
                         SJSN, aturan investasi aset dana jaminan sosial dan aset BPJS juga telah dimulai.

kelembagaan              tidak berorientasi keuntungan yang akan beroperasi untuk melayani kepentingan peserta.

                         PT Askes dan PT Jamsostek – BPJS Kesehatan dan BPJS Ketenagakerjaan - bekerja dengan
                         aktif dalam transformasi mereka, dengan penekanan kepada kegiatan-kegiatan yang harus
                         selesai pada tanggal 31 Desember 2013. Termasuk diantaranya adalah rencana penutupan
                         kedua perusahaan, perhitungan kewajiban program, transfer aset ke BPJS yang baru dan
                         kepada dana jaminan sosial yang tepat, dan laporan keuangan awal bagi BPJS Kesehatan dan
                         BPJS Ketenagakerjaan. Juga terdapat pembicaraan tentang susunan tata kelola, prosedur
                         audit internal, pengawasan dan supervisi dari kedua lembaga baru tersebut.

                    b. Pertimbangan cakupan, biaya dan keberlanjutan fiskal
Cakupan universal        Sistem jaminan sosial nasional adalah upaya yang berani untuk mentransformasikan sistem
mendorong mobilitas      jaminan sosial Indonesia. Salah satu tujuan utamanya adalah mencapai cakupan
tenaga kerja dan         keseluruhan/universal – menyertakan seluruh penduduk ke dalam sistem baru itu tanpa
stabilisasi pembiayaan   membedakan apakah mereka bekerja di sektor formal maupun informal. Walau program-
program                  program baru akan dimulai pada tahun 2014 dan 2015, dan rencana pemerintah untuk
                         mencapai cakupan universal adalah pada tahun 2019, pengalaman internasional
                         menunjukkan bahwa tampaknya akan dibutuhkan waktu setidaknya satu dekade atau lebih
                         untuk memperluas cakupan hingga mencakup seluruh penduduk. Sebagai contoh, di Jepang
                         dan Korea membutuhkan waktu lebih dari 20 tahun untuk mencapai cakupan seluruh
                         penduduk. Namun demikian, bila berhasil dengan baik, maka semua orang akan turut serta
                         dan menerima manfaat dari program-program tersebut dan biayanya akan ditanggung
                         bersama secara merata untuk mencapai solidaritas sosial. Cakupan universal juga
                         memungkinkan pekerja untuk berpindah tempat kerja tanpa kehilangan jaminan mereka,
                         sehingga menciptakan pasar tenaga kerja yang lebih dinamis.

Sistem yang berhasil     Program-program SJSN akan memiliki perbedaan dalam rancangan maupun cakupan
membutuhkan manfaat      dibanding program-program yang ada dan akan menyertakan program pensiun manfaat
yang menarik pada        pasti. Terdapat dua cara pandang mendasar untuk merancang program-program SJSN.
harga yang wajar dan     Metode pertama – dari sudut pandang kebijakan sosial – adalah menentukan tingkat manfaat
terjangkau               yang diinginkan dan kemudian menghitung biaya dan tarif iuran yang dibutuhkan. Metode
                         kedua dimulai dengan penentuan tingkat jumlah yang mana pemberi kerja, pekerja dan
                         pemerintah bersedia dan siap berkontribusi dan kemudian prosesnya bergerak mundur untuk
                         menentukan tingkat manfaat yang terjangkau. Dalam praktiknya, cara terbaik adalah
                         menggunakan gabungan dari kedua metode untuk menghasilkan hasil yang optimal.
                         Tujuannya adalah menentukan gabungan manfaat dan kontribusi yang berarti namun
                         terjangkau bahkan ditengah keadaan yang kurang kondusif.

                         Proses penetapan manfaat dan penentuan iuran bagi program-program SJSN harus
                         memperhitungkan perbedaan karakteristik, kebutuhan dan kemampuan serta kerelaan
                         membayar dari pekerja sektor formal maupun informal. Program-program harus dirancang
                         dengan mengingat kebutuhan dan keperluan para pekerja, namun pada waktu yang
                         bersamaan tingkat iuran yang akan dipungut juga harus ditetapkan dengan tepat pada taraf
                         yang dapat diterima bagi para pekerja, pemberi kerja dan pemerintah. Iuran tersebut harus
                         terjangkau oleh para pekerja dan tingkat iuran tersebut harus tidak menciptakan beban yang
                         tidak beralasan bagi pemberi kerja. Pada akhirnya, pekerja dan pemberi kerja harus
                         memberikan kontribusi karena mereka ingin melakukannya, bukan karena paksaan. Tingkat
                         manfaat yang beralasan dan iuran yang moderat juga akan memungkinkan pemerintah untuk
                         membayar kaum miskin tanpa mengganggu posisi fiskal negara.

                         Program kesehatan SJSN merupakan ilustrasi yang baik dari tantangan-tantangan tersebut.
                         UU SJSN mensyaratkan paket kesehatan yang lengkap dan hal ini telah di masukkan dalam
                         aturan-aturan pelaksanaan. Tingkat iuran untuk kelompok miskin, sektor informal tetapi
                         tidak miskin, dan sektor formal masih didiskusikan, demikian juga metode yang akan

                          baru akan mulai pada 1 Januari 2014, akan membutuhkan waktu agar sistem dapat
                          memenuhi layanan seperti yang diharapkan. Beberapa tantangan yang dihadapi pemerintah
                          termasuk meningkatkan kesadaran peserta terhadap program dan persyaratan dan manfaat,
                          mengelola harapan peserta, membangun jaringan penyedia dan fasilitas publik dan swasta.
                          Semua kegiatan ini, dan juga kondisi penduduk yang menua (aging) akan meningkatkan
                          permintaan terhadap pelayanan kesehatan yang berkualitas dan modern. Akan menjadi
                          tantangan bagi pemerintah untuk memberikan layanan kesehatan yang menyeluruh ini
                          sementara menjaga biaya pada tingkat yang terjangkau bagi peserta.

Program-program           Dalam hal ini, penting untuk merumuskan dan menerapkan kebijakan-kebijakan dan
harus berkelanjutan       prosedur-prosedur untuk memastikan keberlanjutan fiskal dari dana jaminan sosial SJSN dan
secara fiskal dalam       bahwa risiko-risiko finansial dari program-program jaminan sosial dikelola dengan baik.
jangka pendek dan         Dibutuhkan analisis keuangan, perhitungan aktuaris yang rumit dan model-model komputer
panjang…                  yang mutakhir untuk mengkuantisir dampak finansial dari rancangan yang diusulkan dan
                          memastikan bahwa iuran memang mencukupi untuk membayar jaminan yang dijanjikan.

…dengan                   Alasan lain untuk keberhati-hatian dalam menetapkan iuran adalah bahwa UU SJSN tidak
pertimbangan              memperkenankan aset bersih dari satu dana jaminan sosial SJSN untuk digunakan sebagai
keberlanjutan pada        subsidi bagi defisit dana lainnya. Setiap dana harus memiliki iurannya sendiri dan bersifat
setiap dana…              mandiri. Walaupun BPJS dan dana pensiun bukan untuk keuntungan, dana asuransi sosial
                          mensyaratkan sejumlah aset bersih, ditetapkan pada tingkat yang cukup untuk menutupi
                          penarikan cadangan dan menutupi fluktuasi penarikan (claim). Tanpa ada aset bersih, dana-
                          dana jaminan sosial harus dibiayai oleh pemerintah untuk tambahan dana setiap saat ketika
                          penarikan (claim) lebih tinggi dari yang diperkirakan.

                          Jumlah aset bersih yang dibutuhkan berbeda untuk setiap dana, dimana resiko berlebihnya
                          fluktuasi penarikan (claim) lebih tinggi untuk beberapa dana dibanding lainnya. Sebagai
                          contoh, resiko tinggi claim lebih tinggi untuk dana kesehatan dari pada dana manfaat
                          kematian.

                          Walaupun tidak diharuskan oleh UU, sedapat mungkin, untuk dana manapun, iuran bagi
                          sektor formal, sektor informal yang tidak miskin dan sektor informal yang miskin, harus
                          dihitung dengan baik sehingga terdapat subsidi minimal antara ketiga kelompok tersebut.
                          Bila tidak, kelompok yang membayar terlalu banyak akan merasa tidak nyaman karena
                          terpaksa memberikan subsidi bagi kelompok yang membayar terlalu sedikit.

Program pensiun SJSN      Program pensiun SJSN membawa sejumlah tantangan tambahan karena biayanya akan
membawa tantangan         meningkat sejalan dengan waktu dengan jatuh temponya sistem pensiun sesuai dengan
yang khusus               peningkatan umur penduduk. Program ini harus diawasi, dikelola dan disesuaikan dengan
                          cermat, untuk menjaganya agar tetap berkelanjutan secara fiskal sesuai berjalannya waktu.
                          Program-program pensiun memiliki jangka waktu yang panjang. Para pekerja dapat mulai
                          membayar iuran pada umur 20 tahun, mungkin tidak akan pensiun selama 40 tahun berikut,
                          dan kemudian menerima manfaat selama 30 tahun selanjutnya. Karenanya, jangka waktu
                          untuk perencanaan, pembiayaan dan investasi sangatlah panjang. Rencana-rencana pensiun
                          membutuhkan beberapa dekade untuk mencapai kematangan yang penuh dan terkena
                          dampak secara signifikan oleh tren jangka panjang seperti semakin menuanya penduduk.
                          Karena alasan ini, model-model pensiun seringkali membuat proyeksi untuk 75 hingga 100
                          tahun. Khusus bagi pensiun, dampak jangka pendek dari peluncuran atau perubahan kepada
                          program umumnya sangat berbeda dengan dampak jangka panjang.

                      c. Pertimbangan administrasi, tata kelola dan kapasitas
Dibutuhkan sistem         Untuk mengelola program-program jaminan sosial dengan tepat, sangatlah penting untuk
administrasi yang kuat,   memastikan bahwa semua orang menerima nomor identifikasi yang unik dan tidak terdapat
terutama bagi nomor       nomor identifikasi yang sama. UU SJSN dan BPJS meminta setiap BPJS untuk bertanggung
identifikasi (ID) yang    jawab terhadap penetapan nomor ID yang unik kepada para anggotanya. Namun tidaklah
unik …                    masuk akal untuk menggunakan nomor ID yang berbeda-beda dalam program-program

                                                                                                 43

                                                                           Perekonomian Indonesia

                          kesehatan dan ketenagakerjaan, sehingga kedua BPJS itu harus saling bekerja sama untuk
                          menerbitkan nomor identifikasi yang dapt digunakan bersama oleh kelima program-program
                          SJSN.

                          Nomor ID yang unik akan setidaknya memiliki dua kegunaan yang berbeda. Nomor itu
                          memungkinkan para individu untuk memastikan identifikasi mereka ketika meminta layanan
                          atau menerima pembayaran. Nomor itu juga akan digunakan untuk melacak gaji individu,
                          layanan kredit dan catatan kontribusi dalam dana asuransi sosial. Nomor identifikasi yang
                          unik bagi para anggota SJSN dapat merupakan nomor yang sama untuk Nomor Induk
                          Kependudukan (NIK) atau bisa menggunakan nomor lain yang terkait dengan NIK.
                          Penilaian harus dilakukan untuk menilai kecukupan NIK dan potensi peningkatan yang
                          dapat membantu mendorong penggunaan administrasi program SJSN.

…dan bagi                 Pekerjaan administrasi penting lainnya adalah memungut dan mengkreditkan iuran dari
pemungutan iuran dari     seluruh pekerja dengan tepat. Sementara mekanisme pemungutan bagi pekerja sektor formal
pekerja sektor formal     telah ada di Indonesia dalam bentuk program jaminan sosial wajib Jamsostek, masih terdapat
dan sektor informal…      banyak penghindaran. Tingkat partisipasi dalam Jaminan Hari Tua (JHT) Jamsostek berada
                          di bawah 30 persen, sebagian besar disebabkan karena Jamsostek tidak memiliki kewenangan
                          untuk penegakkan.

                          Tidak seperti pekerja sektor formal, tidak ada mekanisme pemungutan iuran yang tersedia
                          bagi pekerja sektor informal. Dengan demikian sangatlah penting untuk segera menyusun
                          suatu model pemungutan iuran yang efektif bagi sektor informal. Bila tidak, maka partisipasi
                          yang berasal dari sektor sektor informal dapat dipastikan hanya akan mencapai tingkat yang
                          rendah. Hal itu akan membawa dua konsekuensi negatif. Pekerja sektor informal tidak akan
                          berhak untuk memperoleh manfaat dari program SJSN, dan stabilitas finansial sistem SJSN
                          akan menemui hambatan. Bila penghindaran bersifat meluas, hal itu akan membawa dampak
                          negatif terhadap solvabilitas keuangan dari program-program jaminan, karena hanya mereka
                          dengan risiko yang lebih buruk yang akan bergabung sementara mereka dengan risiko yang
                          lebih baik akan memilih untuk menghindar. Hal ini dikenal sebagai anti-seleksi atau seleksi-
                          negatif, dan akan sangat mudah mempengaruhi stabilitas keuangan dari skema jaminan sosial
                          tersebut.

…yang perlu di           Pemerintah harus mempelajari berbagai jenis mekanisme pemungutan yang mungkin dapat
lakukan pilot dan di uji diterapkan, meneliti pengalaman negara-negara lain dan melakukan uji coba pada pilihan-
                         pilihan yang mungkin bagi pemungutan iuran dari para pekerja sektor formal maupun
                         informal. Pemilihan strategi pemungutan iuran bersama-sama dengan rancangan program
                         yang tepat dan penegakkan yang efektif sangat dibutuhkan untuk menjamin stabilitas
                         program dan dukungan politik yang berkelanjutan. Salah satu bagian yang penting dari solusi
                         manapun adalah penggunaan sistem TI terpadu semaksimal mungkin untuk mengotomatisasi
                         administrasi, mengurangi kesalahan dan mengendalikan biaya.

Tata kelola dan           Tata kelola dan pengawasan sistem SJSN dan operasi BPJS yang baik sangatlah penting
supervisi yang            karena besarnya jumlah dana yang akan mengalir ke lima dana jaminan sosial SJSN dan peran
memadai dibutuhkan        penting yang dipegang oleh kedua BPJS di dalam sistem jaminan sosial. BPJS harus
untuk menjamin            bertanggung jawab untuk mengelola program-program SJSN dan melaksanakan tanggung
integritas sistem         jawab yang dipercayakan kepadanya dengan baik. Dibutuhkan tolok ukur kinerja dan sistem
                          pemeriksaan dan penyeimbangan untuk menjamin transparansi dan akuntabilitas sehingga
                          menjaga kepercayaan masyarakat atas sistem itu. Kedua BPJS harus melaksanakan program-
                          program demi kepentingan terbaik para pesertanya, dan keluhan para peserta harus didengar
                          dan segera ditangani. UU BPJS mengharuskan lembaga itu untuk membentuk satuan
                          pengendalian internal untuk menangani keluhan dan memberi tanggapan dalam suatu jangka
                          waktu tertentu.

                          Sesuai UU, pengawasan internal BPJS akan dilakukan oleh Dewan Komisarisnya dan oleh
                          bagian audit internal. Selain itu pengawasan eksternal akan dilakukan oleh Dewan Jaminan
                          Sosial Nasional (DJSN), Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) dan Badan Pemeriksa Keuangan
                          (BPK). Sangatlah penting untuk mendefinisikan dan memahami tugas-tugas dan tanggung

                         didokumentasikan secara tertulis.

Kapasitas pemerintah     Dibutuhkan manajemen risiko dan pengembangan kapasitas secara keseluruhan untuk
dalam mengelola risiko   memastikan bahwa program-program SJSN dikelola dengan baik. Kementerian Keuangan
dibutuhkan untuk         membutuhkan sistem TI dan sumber daya manusia untuk memantau status keuangan
melindungi integritas    program-program SJSN dengan baik dan membuat penyesuaian terhadap fasilitas rancangan
finansial sistem itu     dan tarif iuran untuk memastikan keberlanjutan fiskal jangka panjang. Para pegawai pada
                         lembaga-lembaga pengawas harus memiliki pengetahuan yang memadai dan menjamin
                         bahwa terdapat susunan yang efektif bagi pengendalian dan supervisi eksternal operasi-
                         operasi BPJS, dan departemen audit internal yang efektif di dalam BPJS. Jika hal itu tidak
                         dilaksanakan dengan baik, maka anggaran Negara dapat mengalami kerugian yang besar,
                         karena program-program akan kekurangan dana dan kekurangan itu harus ditanggung oleh
                         anggaran negara. Karenanya, penyusunan model komputer yang efektif dan kemampuan
                         manajemen risiko serta supervisi eksternal yang efektif harus menjadi perhatian utama bagi
                         pemerintah.

                    d. Komunikasi menjadi kunci sebagai bagian dari rangkaian proses
                         penerapan yang panjang
Sosialisasi yang tepat   Komunikasi yang efektif di dalam pemerintahan dan kepada masyarakat, media dan DPR
dibutuhkan untuk         merupakan hal yang penting demi kesuksesan program. Jika seluruh penduduk Indonesia
memastikan bahwa         memahami program-program dan manfaatnya, makan penduduk akan lebih menghargai
masyarakat memahami      program tersebut. Jika mereka mengetahui bagaimana menggunakan layanan yang menjadi
manfaat dan              hak mereka, memahami hak-hak dan tanggung jawabnya, dan mengetahui lembaga-lembaga
pentingnya sistem        yang bertanggung jawab untuk melaksanakan program-program tersebut, mereka akan lebih
SJSN                     mempercayai sistem dan akan lebih terdorong untuk turut serta tanpa paksaan, terutama bagi
                         pekerja pada sektor informal. Sementara partisipasi mereka di dalam program merupakan
                         suatu keharusan, penegakkan pembayaran akan merupakan hal yang lebih sulit. UU BPJS
                         bergantung kepada pekerja informal untuk mendatangi kantor BPJS terdekat untuk
                         membayar iurannya, sehingga sangatlah penting untuk meningkatkan kesadaran mereka
                         tentang manfaat-manfaat program tersebut.

                    e. Kesimpulan: perjalanan panjang menuju cakupan jaminan sosial yang
                       menyeluruh
Implementasi             Memastikan keberhasilan sistem akan membutuhkan perhatian kepada masalah implementasi
merupakan masalah        utama yang termasuk mendapatkan konsensus politis antara pemangku kepentingan;
yang rumit dan           pengembangan peta jalan dan pemantauan implementasi program; mengembangkan strategi
membutuhkan waktu        nasional dan memastikan dukungan program-program SJSN atas strategi tersebut;
dan konsensus            menentukan strategi pembiayaan; dan mengembangkan model-model finansial dan aktuaris
diantara pemangku        dan kemampuan pemerintah untuk memastikan keberlanjutan fiskal program-program SJSN.
kepentingan untuk        Seperti dibahas pada Bagian ini, perhatian khusus harus diberikan kepada fasilitas rancangan
penerapan sepenuhnya     program dan perhitungan kontribusi penggajian yang dibutuhkan. Sistem dan prosedur yang
                         dirancang dan diterapkan secara berhtai-hati akan dibutuhkan dalam penerbitan nomor
                         identifikasi yang unik, pemungutan iuran, pencatatan rekening setiap individu dan
                         pembayaran jaminan dengan baik dan tepat waktu. Semua hal itu harus didukung dengan
                         peraturan perundangan yang tepat, dan dengan pengembangan kesadaran dan penyuluhan
                         dari program tersebut (yaitu sosialisasi program).

                         Implementasi tampaknya akan menantang dan membutuhkan waktu yang lebih panjang dari
                         perkiraan untuk sepenuhnya mencapai sasaran yang ditetapkan. Namun program-program
                         baru itu, sekalipun diterapkan secara kurang optimal, masih merupakan peningkatan yang
                         signifikan dibanding sistem yang ada sekarang dan akan terdapat kesempatan untuk semakin
                         meningkatkan program-program tersebut dan sistem secara keseluruhan dengan berjalannya
                         waktu.

Masalah gizi           Pendapatan rumah tangga telah meningkat secara signifikan akhir-akhir tahun ini, namun
membawa risiko besar   sebagian dengan kesuksesan ini, Indonesia menghadapi sejumlah masalah gizi dengan tingkat
terhadap               kerumitan yang semakin meningkat, yang merupakan topik yang akan dijabarkan di bagian
pembangunan            ini.Dengan satu dari tiga anak-anak usia di bawah lima tahun mengalami hambatan
Indonesia…             pertumbuhan (lebih pendek daripada yang diharapkan untuk umur mereka), , yang tidak
                       hanya mengancam kapasitas angkatan kerja Indonesia, tetapi juga secara signifikan
                       meningkatkan kecenderungan mereka untuk tumbuh menjadi gemuk dan menderita penyakit
                       kardiovaskular pada usia yang lebih dewasa. Perubahan pola konsumsi dan gaya hidup yang
                       berkaitan dengan peningkatan urbanisasi memperburuk keadaan, seperti masalah kelebihan
                       nutrisi yang telah mempengaruhi sebagian besar orang dewasa. Tanpa tindakan yang segera
                       dilakukan, untuk mengatasi masalah buruknya gizi bagi ibu hamil dan anak, dan juga
                       menghadapi masalah kelebihan nutrisi pada anak-anak yang lebih dewasa dan orang dewasa,
                       maka prevalensi Penyakit Tidak Menular akan meningkat secara dramatis yang akan sangat
                       merintangi kemajuan ekonomi Indonesia untuk dekade yang akan datang.12

                         pangan jangka pendek dan dapat dikembalikan, tidak seperti hambatan pertumbuhan.
                         Kekurangan gizi dari mikronutrisi juga merupakan hal yang umum dan juga dapat
                         berkontribusi kepada kegagalan pertumbuhan dan juga disfungsi tubuh lainnya, seperti
                         anemia dalam kekurangan zat besi dan gondok pada kekurangan yodium. Kelebihan gizi
                         umumnya menunjukkan pengukuran bobot tubuh yang telalu tinggi dan obesitas, yang
                         disebabkan oleh konsumsi makanan yang lebih banyak dibanding kebutuhan, sehingga terjadi
                         penumpukan lemak tubuh. Obesitas dikenal sebagai penyakit pada orang dewasa dan
                         umumnya diukur dengan Indeks Massa Tubuh (Body Mass Index/BMI) yang merupakan berat
                         badan dibagi tinggi badan yang dikuadratkan.

Kelebihan gizi           BGM adalah masalah global yang mempengaruhi baik negara kaya maupun miskin: 25 persen
meningkat lebih cepat    penduduk dunia menderita kegemukan, sementara 17 persen anak usia pra-sekolah memiliki
dari penurunan           berat badan yang kurang dan 28,5 persen mengalami hambatan pertumbuhan, 40 persen
kekurangan gizi          perempuan usia subur menderita anemia dan sepertiga penduduk dunia masih mengalami
                         kekurangan yodium. Sebagian besar negara-negara berpenghasilan menengah bawah (lower-
                         middle income countries/LMICs) diperkirakan menghadapi BGM, dengan tingkat peningkatan
                         kelebihan berat badan yang melaju lebih cepat dibanding penurunan kekurangan berat
                         badan. Sementara tingkat obesitas dunia telah meningkat dua kali lipat pada tiga dekade yang
                         lalu, LMICs mencatat peningkatan tiga kali lipat hanya pada dua dekade.

Hambatan                 Hambatan pertumbuhan/kekerdilan memiliki konsekuensi yang signifikan dan beragam

lainnya                 ASEAN (Tabel 8). Dengan sepertiga anak-anak usia balita mengalami hambatan
                        pertumbuhan, Indonesia memiliki tingkat kekerdilan yang lebih tinggi dibanding negara-
                        negara lain yang lebih miskin seperti Vietnam dan Filipina, dan setara dengan negara-negara
                        yang jauh lebih miskin seperti misalnya Myanmar, Kamboja dan Laos. Tingkat penyusutan di
                        Indonesia juga termasuk tinggi, yang hanya di bawah Timor Leste, dan lebih tinggi dibanding
                        negara-negara ASEAN lain yang lebih miskin seperti Kamboja, Laos, Vietnam, Papua Nugini
                        dan Filipina. Namun Indonesia juga memiliki tingkat kelebihan berat badan yang paling
                        tinggi untuk anak-anak usia belianya, lebih buruk dibanding misalnya Malaysia, negara yang

Kelompok miskin lebih       Walau terdapat bukti yang menunjukkan peningkatan obesitas, kesalahan persepsi atas
besar terkena dampak        masalah tersebut cenderung menutupi urgensinya. Sebagai contoh, terdapat anggapan umum
kegemukan dan               pada banyak kalangan bahwa obesitas merupakan penyakit orang kaya saja. Hal itu tidak
kelebihan berat             berlaku di Indonesia. Riset Kesehatan Dasar (Riskesdas) tahun 2010 menunjukkan bahwa
                            walau kegemukan/obesitas memang meningkat dengan naiknya pendapatan, yang mencapai
                            puncaknya pada 32 persen pada kuintil kekayaan atas, kuintil kekayaan yang lebih rendah
                            juga turut terpengaruh (kira-kira 20 persen). Volume kegemukan yang terbesar terkonsentrasi
                            pada golongan penduduk dengan kekayaan yang lebih rendah, dan terkondisi dengan
                            lingkungan perkotaan yang mendorong gaya hidup obesitas. Penduduk dewasa yang paling
                            miskin dan yang juga paling terhambat pertumbuhannya merupakan pihak yang paling
                            lemah.

Penduduk Indonesia          Pandangan lain yang keliru terkait dengan sifat fisik obesitas, yang umumnya identik dengan
mungkin tidak sehat         tambun atau “gemuk”. Kegemukan atau obesitas merupakan masalah yang tidak selalu nyata
walaupun tidak              (hidden) di Indonesia, karena mereka yang tidak terlihat gemuk dapat memiliki kandungan
nampak “gemuk”              lemak yang tersembunyi di dalam tubuhnya. Hal ini sebagian disebabkan oleh keterbatasan
                            pertumbuhan pada 1.000 hari pertama, yang kemudian diikuti dengan percepatan
                            pertumbuhan pada usia kanak-kanak yang didukung oleh gaya hidup perkotaan. Selain itu,
                            bagi penduduk Indonesia, risiko kesehatan yang berkaitan dengan kelebihan lemak tubuh –
                            baik terlihat maupun tidak – dimulai dengan lebih rendahnya BMI dibanding bahkan bagian
                            lain di Asia, dan tentu saja lebih rendah dari standar internasional.18 Kenyataan bahwa
                            kelebihan lemak ini tidak selalu terlihat turut membantu peremehan urgensi masalah ini pada
                            penduduk daerah perkotaan yang semakin banyak malas bergerak.

                        c. Memahami penyebab BGM di Indonesia
Penyebab BGM                  Sementara penyebab BGM lintas perjalanan hidup orang bersifat rumit, suatu cara yang
terbagi ke dalam              berguna untuk menganalisis BGM di Indonesia adalah menggunakan pemetaan sistem
empat kelompok                obesitas yang dirancang oleh Foresight Project dari Inggris, yang mengelompokkan lebih dari
tematik                       100 variabel dalam empat bidang tematik: lingkungan kesehatan dan biologis; lingkungan
                              ekonomi dan pangan; lingkungan fisik dan badan; lingkungan sosial budaya.

Lingkungan kesehatan          Indonesia sedang berada dalam transisi demografi. Tingkat kematian karena penyakit
dan biologis: NCD             menular telah menurun, sepertinya disebabkan oleh kebijakan kesehatan yang diambil pada
telah menjadi                 tahun 80 dan 90an yang meningkatkan belanja sehingga meningkatkan distribusi pusat
penyebab utama                kesehatan diseluruh negera. Usia harapan hidup telah meningkat dan kini NCD menjadi
kematian                      penyebab utama kecacatan dan kematian di Indonesia, dengan CVD sebagai penyebab utama
                              kematian (30 persen dari seluruh kematian NCD, yang diikuti oleh kanker, penyakit
                              obstruktif paru-paru yang kronis dan diabetes).

Sistem kesehatan              Prasarana kesehatan masih tidak mencukupi dalam banyak hal. Cakupan sanitasi masih
memiliki kapasitas            mencatat laju perluasan yang lambat, dan parasit saluran pencernaan masih merupakan hal
yang rendah untuk             yang sangat umum. Sistem kesehatan juga tidak mampu untuk melakukan intervensi gizi
mendukung program             secara memadai, sebagian karena kurangnya pelatihan pekerja kesehatan tentang hal gizi dan
gizi                          rendahnya persepsi hambatan pertumbuhan dan obesitas/kegemukan sebagai suatu masalah,
                              atau dalam kaitannya dengan NCD. Hanya sedikit pusat kesehatan yang mengukur status
                              gizi secara rutin, dan sebagian besar tidak memiliki alat pengukuran yang dibutuhkan.
                              Komitmen Indonesia yang kuat untuk mencapai cakupan kesehatan umum (UHC) bagi
                              penduduknya, namun bersama dengan peluncuran inisiatif peningkatan gizi, memberikan
                              kesempatan yang sangat bagus untuk memperbaiki gizi.

Tekanan darah yang            Data survei menunjukkan peningkatan faktor-faktor risiko yang menjadi dasar pendorong
tinggi dan diabetes           CVD. Survei Riskesdas tahun 2007 menemukan bahwa satu dari sepuluh laki-laki dan dua
sangat umum dijumpai          dari sepuluh perempuan berusia di atas 45 tahun memiliki tingkat kolesterol yang tinggi.
pada orang dewasa             Diabetes juga mempengaruhi 6 persen dari penduduk dewasa, dan 19 persen menderita pra-
                              diabetes. Survei Kehidupan Keluarga menemukan prevalensi hipertensi yang tinggi, yang
                              lebih buruk pada perempuan dan meningkat sesuai usia, sedemikian besar pengaruhnya
                              hingga sekitar setengah dari orang dewasa berusia 45 tahun turut terpengaruh (Gambar 35).
                              Dua per tiga dari responden tidak mengetahui bahwa mereka menderita penyakit itu, dan 90

Lingkungan ekonomi     Peningkatan kekayaan nasional di Indonesia diikuti oleh penurunan tingkat kemiskinan dan
dan pangan             peningkatan ketersediaan pangan sebagai energi per kapita, umumnya berupa dua kali
menunjukkan            peningkatan konsumsi lemak. Pada empat dekade terakhir, ketersediaan beras umumnya
penurunan kemiskinan   bertahan tetap stabil, sementara energi yang berasal dari daging dan ikan meningkat dua kali
dan peningkatan pola   lipat, dari susu meningkat tiga kali lipat, dan dari gandum naik tujuh kali lipat. Secara
diet negara Barat      bersamaan, peningkatan perdagangan pangan dunia telah mendorong peningkatan impor
                       bahan pangan yang telah terproses di LMIC, yang umumnya beredar melalui jaringan pasar
                       swalayan dan perusahaan-perusahaan rumah makan siap saji multinasional. Daerah perkotaan
                       pada khususnya mencatat pengaruh yang besar dari gerai-gerai komersial baru tersebut.

Buruknya praktek       Terdapat sejumlah bukti yang meningkat bahwa pola konsumsi makanan pada usia dini akan
pemberian makanan      mempengaruhi kesehatan dan perkembangan pada usia selanjutnya. Sayangnya praktik
kepada bayi            pemberian makanan kepada bayi dan balita di Indonesia jauh dari mencukupi dan
berkontribusi kepada   berkontribusi kepada kekurangan gizi pada usia belia dan peningkatan risiko kelebihan gizi
kelebihan dan          pada usia yang lebih dewasa. Pola yang berbahaya itu termasuk penurunan tingkat pemberian
kekurangan gizi        air susu ibu (ASI) ekslusif, dan pemberian makanan pelengkap yang terlalu dini. Hanya 15
                       persen bayi mendapat ASI ekslusif selama 6 bulan seperti laporan tahun 2010 – setengah dari
                       32 persen yang dilaporkan pada 2007 dan lebih rendah dari 40 persen yang dilaporkan pada
                       2002. Penggunaan pengganti ASI masih umum digalakkan di pusat kesehatan, kepada tenaga
                       profesional di bidang medis, dan juga kepada para ibu.

Konsumsi pangan        Pola konsumsi pangan pada usia selanjutnya lebih sulit untuk dievaluasi, tetapi terdapat data
keluarga mencatat      yang menunjukkan peningkatan dalam asupan pangan, terutama dari daging, ikan, telur dan
lebih banyak           makanan olahan. Konsumsi sayur dan buah bertahan tetap rendah. Indonesia adalah negara
peningkatan dalam      pengkonsumsi mie instan terbesar kedua di dunia, dengan konsumsi yang mendekati 13,7
kuantitas dibanding    miliar bungkus pada tahun 2008, sehingga konsumsi tepung terigu meningkat menjadi 52g
kualitas               per orang pada 2008, membuat Indonesia sebagai salah satu dari lima negara pengekspor
                       gandum terbesar di dunia.

Peningkatan konsumsi   Peningkatan konsumsi makanan olahan tampaknya berkontribusi pada masalah obesitas di
makanan olahan         Indonesia seperti juga di seluruh dunia. Makanan olahan merupakan makanan yang padat
tampaknya              energi dan penuh dengan pangan olahan, gula dan lemak, dan juga dikenal sebagai pilihan
berkontribusi kepada   dengan biaya termurah bagi konsumen. Mereka juga membangkitkan tingginya tingkat
kelebihan gizi         glukosa yang berkepanjangan pada darah setelah konsumsi, sehingga berkontribusi kepada
                       akumulasi tambahan lemak tubuh secara bertahap. Makanan olahan yang paling banyak
                       dikonsumsi di Indonesia adalah mie instan yang dibuat dari tepung terigu dan digoreng
                       dengan minyak kelapa sawit.

Lingkungan fisik       Pengamatan akan lingkungan fisik Indonesia menunjukkan bahwa lingkungan daerah
semakin mendukung      perkotaan relatif tidak bersahabat bagi kegiatan fisik pejalan kaki. Dengan terbatasnya
penyebab obesitas      ketersediaan makanan yang sehat di kebanyakan lingkungan perkotaan, sehingga mereka
                       yang berpergian ke dan kembali dari sekolah dan tempat kerja tidak memiliki banyak pilihan
                       selain makanan siap saji di luar rumah. Saat ini, dan terutama karena rendahnya kesadaran
                       masyarakat tentang masalah BGM, sekolah-sekolah belum menjadi tempat untuk mencegah
                       obesitas anak. Perencanaan daerah perkotaan dan pemerintah daerah memiliki peran penting
                       dalam meningkatkan pilihan bagi kegiatan fisik pejalan kaki karena sebagian besar penduduk
                       tidak cukup banyak berolahraga untuk mencegah CVD (Gambar 36). Data survei Riskesdas
                       tahun 2007 menunjukkan anak-anak usia sekolah merupakan kelompok umur yang paling
                       tidak aktif bergerak.

Lingkungan sosial      Indonesia terus menjaga budaya tradisionalnya namun juga membenamkan dirinya ke dalam
budaya semakin         berbagai jenis media modern. Adat-istiadat tradisional mempengaruhi kekurangan gizi pada
mendukung obesitas     waktu anak dalam kandungan dan usia dini, dan norma-norma sosial mendorong sebagian
                       besar perempuan untuk menikah pada waktu usia muda: 25 persen dari seluruh perempuan
                       dalam usia subur menikah sebelum usia 18 tahun, dan 10 persen sebelum usia 16 tahun.
                       Umur ibu pada kelahiran pertama menjadi korelasi utama hasil kesehatan anak, dimana

                         dengan 39 negara lainnya. Indonesia juga memiliki peranan yang kuat dalam gerakan
                         kelompok pemimpin. Menekankan kepada kekurangan gizi kehamilan dan anak, Pemerintah
                         sedang mengembangkan kerangka kebijakan SUN dan pedoman perencanaanya. Indonesia
                         seharusnya menyusun kerangka SUN dengan mempertimbangkan cara untuk meningkatkan
                         tanggapannya terhadap masalah BGM dalam perjalanan hidup masyarakat. Kerangka
                         kebijakan BGM yang menyeluruh dibutuhkan untuk meningkatkan koordinasi antara
                         Kementerian pada empat pilar kebijakan: ketahanan pangan, keamanan pangan, gaya hidup
                         sehat dan gizi. Sebagian besar fokus bidang tersebut telah tercakup di dalam landasan SUN
                         yang diselenggarakan oleh Menko Kesra. Sejumlah kebijakan dan strategi tersebut telah
                         dipertimbangkan di dalam Rencana Aksi Nasional Pangan dan Gizi 2011-2015 yang disusun
                         oleh Bappenas. Selain itu, dengan penyusunan Rencana untuk 2016-2020, unsur-unsur lain di
                         dalam kerangka itu juga sedang dipertimbangkan.

Intervensi yang ada      Sebagian besar intervensi yang dibutuhkan telah diterapkan di Indonesia dan komitmen kuat
perlu ditingkatkan,      yang mendasari Rencana Indonesia untuk memberikan jaminan kesehatan umum dan
sambil mengatasi         Gerakan SUN mendasari kerja dasar untuk perbaikan gizi ke depannya. Walaupun sudah ada
kesenjangan              kemajuan dalam sejumlah bidang, tapi masih terdapat kesenjangan pada bidang lain. Sebagai
                         contoh, implementasi intervensi langsung pada usia dini, terutama ASI, masih perlu
                         ditingkatkan. Serupa dengan itu, walau terdapat kemajuan pada fortifikasi bahan pangan
                         dengan adanya nutrisi mikro, anemia kehamilan masih membutuhkan perhatian. Akhirnya,
                         program-program kesejahteraan sosial telah membantu menjamin ketahanan pangan bagi
                         kaum termiskin dari yang miskin, namun masih dibutuhkan penekanan yang lebih besar
                         terhadap kualitas dan kuantitas bahan pangan. Sekolah-sekolah merupakan tempat yang
                         sangat penting untuk mendorong gaya hidup sehat yang akan membantu memitigasi
                         pengaruh BGM, namun belum sepenuhnya digunakan bagi kepentingan ini. Para pekerja
                         profesional dalam bidang kesehatan membutuhkan pelatihan yang lebih baik dalam hal gizi,
                         sehingga hambatan pertumbuhan akan dipandang sebagai masalah dan kegemukan/obesitas
                         diakui sebagai masalah untuk dicegah dan tidak hanya diobati.

                2. Reformasi birokrasi di Indonesia: kemajuan dan tantangan
Indonesia telah          Jumlah Pengawai Negeri Sipil (PNS) di Indonesia adalah salah satu yang terbesar di dunia,
mencanangkan proses      dengan jumlah kurang lebih 4,7 juta orang. Namun demikian, pelayan publik yang diberikan
reformasi birokrasi      maish belum sebanding dengan jumlah PNS yang ada. Untuk menghadapi masalah ini,
yang ambisius yang       Pemerintah Indonesia telah mencanangkan secara resmi perubahan yang lebih mendasar,
dimulai pada tahun       yang dikenal dengan nama Reformasi Birokrasi (RB), yang dimulai oleh Kementerian
2006                     Keuangan (Kemenkeu) pada 2006. Tujuan reformasi tersebut adalah untuk
                         menyederhanakan proses bisnis, memperbaiki kebijakan dan praktik manajemen sumber
                         daya manusia dan menurunkan korupsi pada Kementerian Keuangan. Sejak saat itu, agenda
                         RB telah di perluas di kementrian dan institusi pemerintahan lainnya. Pada 2012, sekitar 56
                         kementerian dan lembaga (K/L) terlibat dalam RB, yang akan diperluas ke 22 K/L lainnya di
                         2013 dan 2014.

Ciri utama dari          Salah satu ciri utama dari konsep RB, seperti dirancang oleh Kemenkeu, adalah pemberian
reformasi ini adalah     tambahan tunjangan RB yang dikaitkan kepada jenis pekerjaan. Evaluasi jabatan dilaksanakan
penambahan               dan deskripsi pekerjaan baru disusun, sesuai dengan kerumitan, cakupan dan
tunjangan berdasarkan    pertanggungjawaban pekerjaan tersebut. Berdasarkan evaluasi tersebut, ditetapkan tunjangan
analisis dan tingkatan   dengan jumlah yang beraneka ragam bagi setiap pekerjaan. Bagian ini akan mereview
pekerjaan                prakarsa tunjungan RB dan bukti-bukti akan dampak tunjangan RB terhadap kinerja. Bagian
                         ini juga akan membahas prioritas reformasi birokrasi yang sedang berjalan, khususnya
                         pentingnya restrukturisasi dan perampingan (right-sizing).

                       a. Dampak reformasi birokrasi
Tunjangan RB telah       Sementara tunjangan RB telah meningkatkan biaya atas gaji pada lembaga-lembaga yang
membawa perbaikan        turut serta dalam program RB, evaluasi independen, seperti Survei Integritas Sektor Publik
dalam praktik SDM...     tahunan yang dilakukan oleh KPK, menunjukkan bahwa RB juga membawa dampak positif
                         pada Kemenkeu, termasuk peningkatan proses penerimaan pegawai, dengan memastikan
                         bahwa pegawai yang diterima memang memiliki kualifikasi yang tepat. RB juga mensyaratkan
                         pembentukkan Assessment Center untuk menilai kompetensi pegawai yang ada dan potensi
                         promosi jabatan. Pelatihan menjadi lebih terfokus secara teknis. Hasil lain termasuk
                         peningkatan evaluasi kinerja dari para satuan unit dan individu, misalnya menggunakan
                         metodologi Balanced Scorecard. Praktik SDM modern tersebut berarti bahwa RB mendukung
                         profesionalisasi pegawai negeri yang dibutuhkan pada lembaga-lembaga utama.

…seperti ditunjukkan     Hasil yang positif tersebut terlihat dengan jelas pada survei penghasilan dan kinerja yang
oleh survei              dilakukan oleh MenPAN-RB dan Bank Dunia. Survei itu dilakukan pada tahun 2012 dan
penghasilan dan          melibatkan 4.000 PNS20, yang berasal dari empat belas Kementerian dan Lembaga Negara
kinerja terbaru          yang terbagi ke dalam empat kelompok: (1) mereka yang telah menerima tunjangan RB; (2)
                         mereka yang telah memperoleh persetujuan untuk menerima tunjangan RB; (3) mereka yang
                         baru mengajukan permohonan untuk program RB; dan (4) mereka yang belum mengajukan
                         permohonan bagi program RB. Tujuan survei itu adalah untuk menilai kemajuan pencapaian
                         Reformasi Birokrasi hingga saat itu.

…menunjukkan K/L         Survei tersebut menunjukkan bahwa pegawai K/L yang telah menjalankan reformasi
yang mengikuti RB        birokrasi lebih cenderung untuk menyatakan bahwa kolega mereka memberikan kontribusi
memiliki sistem          yang lebih besar dari yang diharapkan (Tabel 9). Keputusan peraturan dan promosi jabatan
perekrutan dan           pada K/L yang telah menjalankan RB tampaknya memiliki kemungkinan yang lebih kecil
promosi yang lebih       bagi hal yang tidak terduga dan bagi sikap pilih kasih. Selain itu, pegawai yang disurvei
baik                     menyatakan bahwa Kementerian dan Lembaga Negara dengan RB lebih mampu
                         menemukan calon terbaik untuk suatu pekerjaan dan menyaring pegawai berkualitas tinggi
                         secara lebih mudah.

                         20Pegawai berpangkat lebih rendah dalam konteks ini adalah PNS yang dikagorikan sebagai pegawai
                          yang memiliki pangkat/golongan IVA, IIID dan IIIA. Mereka yang berpangkat/golongan escelon 4
                          telah bekerja kurang lebih 8 tahun, sedangkan golongan III telah bekerja sekitar 8 – 13 tahun.

                         b. Keberlanjutan reformasi birokrasi
Pemerintah Indonesia            Reformasi Birokrasi saat ini telah mencakup aspek reformsi yang sangat luas bila
telah membuat                   dibandingkan dengan reformasi yang pertama kali dilaksanakan oleh Kemenkeu, terutama
kemajuan yang                   reformsi di kantor – kantor cabang dan pelayanan Kemenkeu di daerah, seperti yang dimilik
signifikan terkait              oleh Ditjen Pajak dan Ditjen Perbendaharaan. Laporan yang dikeluarkan oleh Kementerian
reformasi birokrasi …           Perencanaan dan Pembangunan Nasional/BAPPENAS dan MenPAN-RB menunjukkan
                                bahwa terjadi peningkatan akuntabilitas kementerian dan lembaga di tingkat pusat
                                (LAKIP),yang semula 83 persen pada 2011 naik menjadi 95 persen pada 2012.21 Lebih
                                lanjut, lembaga tingkat pusat yang menerima opini Wajar Tanpa Pengecualian (WTP)
                                terhadap laporan keuangannya dari BPK juga meningkat, dari angka 63 persen pada 2011
                                menjadi 77 persen pada 2012.

…tetapi usaha                   Walau reformasi birokrasi telah mencatat kemajuan yang signifikan, masih dibutuhkan upaya
berkelanjutan                   lanjutan untuk meningkatkan produktivitas sementara memastikan bahwa belanja untuk gaji
dibutuhkan untuk                pegawai negeri tetap terjamin. Hal ini sangat penting dalam peluncuran RB ke tingkat
meningkatkan                    nasional sejak tahun 2008, dan ke tingkat daerah pada tahun 2013. Selain itu, penjagaan
produktivitas dan               keberlanjutan reformasi itu sendiri juga merupakan hal yang tidak kalah pentingnya. Untuk
memastikan                      mencapai tujuan-tujuan tersebut, reformasi birokrasi harus terus ditingkatkan di Indonesia,
keberlanjutan gaji              membangun di atas implementasi RB yang sedang berjalan pada tingkat kelembagaan, dan
pegawai negeri...               juga mencakup modernisasi kebijakan-kebijakan nasional. Secara khusus, selain Reformasi
                                Manajemen Belanja Pegawai dan Reformasi Peringkat Jabatan dan Gaji,22, terdapat tiga
                                bidang prioritas lain yang dapat dipertimbangkan oleh Pemerintah Indonesia.

.. termasuk                     Pertama, peningkatan kebijakan yang berkaitan dengan pengendalian, rancangan organisasi,
modernisasi organisasi          ketenagakerjaan dan perampingan dapat bersifat efektif. Kurangnya fleksibilitas karena
dan right-sizing…               peraturan nasional dan proses pemeriksaan, berdasarkan pada peraturan MenPAN-RB yang
                                belum direformasi tentang susunan organisasi dan pegawai, kini membatasi cakupan
                                restrukturisasi dan reformasi. Guna reformasi pengendalian pendirian dan modernisasi
                                restrukturisasi organisasi dan kebijakan right-sizing (ukuran yang sesuai/perampingan) adalah
                                membuat anggaran personil menjadi bagian dari anggaran kegiatan atau sub-program, dan
                                membuat manajer anggaran untuk bertanggung jawab atas hal – hal yang terkait dengan
                                personalia dan atas belanja kepegawaian. Hal ini akan memberikan pengendalian yang lebih
                                baik atas ukuran dan biaya pelayanan sipil, dan bagi fleksibilitas yang dibutuhkan untuk
                                meningkatkan efisiensi dan mendapatkan nilai yang lebih baik untuk dana yang dikeluarkan.
                                Secara khusus, akan dibutuhkan kebijakan dan mekanisme bagi perampingan untuk
                                menghasilkan dampak.

…reformasi kerangka      Kedua, reformasi kerangka peraturan nasional dan penetapan kelembagaan pusat bagi
peraturan nasional…      penyusunan kebijakan, peraturan dan pengelolaan pelayanan sipil. Gunanya adalah untuk
                         meningkatkan fleksibilitas pada tingkat kelembagaan dan untuk memodernisasi dan
                         memperkuat kapasitas bagi penyusunan kebijakan pelayanan sipil pusat yang berkaitan, dan
                         pada saat yang bersamaan memindahkan tanggung jawab bagi implementasi peraturan dan
                         kebijakan pelayanan sipil kepada lembaga-lembaga pelaksananya. Akhirnya, pemerintah pusat
                         (MenPAN-RB, BKN) harus menyediakan kebijakan, memberikan panduan dan memantau
                         implementasi, namun implementasinya harus menjadi tanggung jawab pihak kementerian
                         dan lembaga itu sendiri.

…dan reformasi      Bidang prioritas ketiga adalah reformasi pensiun dan THT (Tabungan Hari Tua)23. Sasaran
pensiun dan THT PNS pada bidang ini adalah memodernisasi kebijakan pensiun yang ada dengan memindahkannya
                    dari sistem sekarang yang sudah usang ke sistem yang modern, manfaat pasti dengan sistem
                    pembayaran sesuai kebutuhan. Proses reformasi tersebut harus melibatkan keadilan dan
                    berbasis ekuitas dari analisis yang cermat dan dengan pengaturan peralihan yang memadai.

Restrukturisasi dan      Prakarsa restrukturisasi dan right-sizing menjadi prioritas bagi pemimpin yang berwenang
right-sizing             dalam reformasi birokrasi, MenPAN-RB, hingga berakhirnya masa pemerintahan sekarang.
merupakan prioritas      MenPAN-RB telah meminta enambelas kementerian dan lembaga pemerintah untuk
bagi Pemerintah dalam    melakukan tinjauan internal untuk meringkas struktur keorganisasian mereka. Seluruh
jangka pendek…           kementerian dan lembaga yang terpilih akan menyerahkan rencana restrukturisasi/
                         perampingannya pada bulan September 2013 sesuai perintah dari Wakil Presiden. Dalam hal
                         ini MenPAN-RB menunggu bagaimana kementerian/lembaga negara dapat menurunkan
                         jumlah dan susunan eselon I dan II di dalam organisasi mereka.24 Beralih ke agenda
                         reformasi untuk jangka waktu yang lebih panjang, MenPAN-RB memiliki rencana untuk
                         menerbitkan buku putih baru tentang struktur organisasi Pemerintah, bersama-sama dengan

Restrukturisasi          Restrukturisasi pada badan-badan Indonesia menghadapi kendala peraturan dan operasional
lembaga-lembaga          yang khusus. Kerangka peraturan pegawai negeri yang berlaku, berdasarkan UU No 8/1974
pemerintah               (diamandemen oleh UU No 43/1999), merupakan kodifikasi dari konsep pegawai negeri
menghadapi kendala       Orde Baru dengan pendekatan yang sentralistik dan sangat terinci, yang terinspirasi oleh
peraturan dan operasi    praktik militer yang kaku bagi para kementerian dan lembaga negara. Prinsip utamanya
                         adalah “one size fits all atau satu pengaturan cocok untuk semua”.

Banyak lembaga           Di dalam sistem ini, susunan organisasi layanan sipil dan penetapan pegawai adalah
terkendala oleh          berdasarkan pertimbangan simetris dan bukan operasional, dengan penekanan kepada
terpecahnya tugas-       perimbangan jumlah unit dan sub-unit dan sejumlah posisi pada setiap tingkatan, dan bukan
tugas dan pengambilan    berdasar akan apa yang dibutuhkan secara operasional. Karenanya, badan-badan negara
keputusan, dan juga      menanggung masalah fragmentasi atas tugas-tugas dan juga kewenangan pengambilan
redundansi dan           keputusan, karena hal-hal itu terbagi kepada sejumlah besar sub-unit yang telah ditentukan
kelebihan pegawai        sebelumnya. Akibat lain dari peraturan yang berjalan adalah kelebihan pegawai pada sebagian
                         besar lembaga, yang menunjukkan redundansi secara kuantitatif (jumlah unit dan sub-unit
                         yang terlalu banyak dan terlalu banyak jabatan) dan kualitatif (petugas dengan kualifikasi yang
                         tidak tepat).




                         23 Program pensiun pegawai negeri dan Tunjangan Hari Tua (THT) merupakan program-program
                           pensiun yang berdiri sendiri, yang memberikan tunjangan hanya kepada pegawai negeri dan berbeda
                           dari program pendapatan pensiun yang mencakup segmen-segmen lain dari angkatan kerja. Program-
                           program pensiun dan THT disponsori oleh pemerintah dan dikelola oleh PT Taspen, suatu BUMN
                           yang dibentuk untuk tugas tunggal tersebut.

Perlunya perampingan      Selain pentingnya restrukturisasi, terdapat dua pendorong utama lain bagi perampingan.
di dorong oleh            Pertama, tunjangan RB akan membawa dampak fiskal yang signifikan. Belanja pegawai
mempertahankan            bertumbuh dengan cepat dibandingkan dengan kategori belanja yang lain, didorong oleh
kebutuhan staf untuk      peraturan pemerintah terkait penggajain dan juga kurang jelas dan transparannya
peningkatan pelayanan     produktivitas yang dihasilkan serta oleh tunjangan RB25. Masalah ini secara parsial dapat
sipil                     dipecahkan dengan pengurangan pegawai. Kedua, terdapat jumlah pegawai negeri dengan
                          prestasi kerja yang rendah yang tidak memiliki pengetahuan, keterampilan dan kemampuan
                          untuk memberikan layanan yang ditingkatkan yang sedang dikerjakan oleh RB, yang mana
                          perampingan dapat menjadi strategi akhir yang dapat diterima secara sosial maupun politis.

… yang membutuhkan        Perampingan yang berhasil membutuhkan proses transisi yang efisien dan efektif dari
definisi organisasi,      susunan “sebagaimana adanya saat ini” menjadi susunan “yang akan menjadi” atau
penghentian pegawai       “perampingan ke ukuran yang tepat”. Terdapat tiga proses dasar: mendefinisikan struktur
dan penerimaan            organisasi yang baru, tingkat pekerjaan dan kepangkatan; memberhentikan pegawai yang
pegawai baru              tidak memiliki tempat pada susunan yang baru; dan mengangkat pegawai dan mereka yang
                          baru diterima ke dalam jabatan-jabatan di dalam struktur yang baru.

                    d. Menyederhanakan lembaga pemerintah
Penyederhanaan            Terdapat sejumlah “jendela” hukum dan peraturan perundangan untuk pemberhentian
pemerintahaan             pegawai yang berkelebihan. UU pokok kepegawaian (Pasal 23, UU No 43/1999)
mungkin saja,             memperkenankan pemberhentian karena “perampingan organisasi pemerintah” – namun
khususnya melalui         tampaknya terdapat keengganan untuk menggunakan peraturan ini, dan sejumlah
pensiun…                  ketidakpastian tentang pelaksanaannya, karena peraturan pelaksanaannya masih belum
                          dijumpai. Pilihan yang lebih memungkinkan adalah pensiun – baik dengan batas usia pensiun
                          normal pada usia 56 tahun, atau menggunakan aturan bagi pensiun dini yaitu usia setidaknya
                          50 tahun dengan masa kerja setidaknya 20 tahun (UU Pensiun No 11/1969).

… tetapi                  Terdapat sejumlah kendala bagi keberhasilan pemberhentian kelebihan pegawai yang efektif
kebergantungan pada       secara biaya. Kebergantungan kepada pensiun dini akan memberi beban tambahan yang
pensiun dini akan         cukup besar kepada dana pensiun pegawai negeri, yang sebetulnya juga siap untuk menerima
membebani pensiun         reformasi mendasar. Sementara biaya pensiun masa depan pada usia pensiun normal pada 56
pegawai negeri            atau 60 tahun seharusnya telah disertakan ke dalam perhitungan model reformasi pensiun,
                          tambahan yang signifikan dari pensiun dini pada usia 50 tahun (yang memang jarang
                          dijumpai) belum disertakan. Sementara pembiayaan untuk tambahan investasi ini
                          menimbulkan suatu tantangan, penting untuk dicatat bahwa tambahan ini hanyalah
                          peningkatan kewajiban pensiun satu kali saja, dan bukan merupakan rencana peningkatan
                          biaya secara terus menerus.

Dibutuhkan                Tanpa panduan dari MenPAN-RB tentang penyusunan program-program pesangon,
pengembangan              terdapat risiko bahwa skema yang khusus bagi suatu lembaga akan menyebar, dengan syarat-
panduan pesangon          syarat dan ketentuan yang berbeda-beda. Demi kepentingan politis dan ekuitas akan
untuk seluruh lembaga     beralasan bahwa pegawai negeri dapat mengharapkan setidaknya paket pesangon yang baik
                          seperti tawaran terbaik yang pernah diberikan sebelumnya – sehingga dinamika “leveling up”
                          yang mahal tampaknya akan terjadi tanpa adanya standar yang berlaku bagi Pemerintah
                          secara keseluruhan. Pengaturan pada tingkat Kementerian juga rentan akan bahaya moral,
                          karena perancang aturan akan memiliki hubungan yang lebih dekat dengan para calon
                          penerima pesangon dan dapat tergoda untuk memilih pengaturan yang lebih mahal (“jabat
                          tangan emas”), dibanding penggunaan alternatif pensiun berdasarkan umur dengan biaya
                          yang lebih murah.

Masalah ‘diterima         Walau dengan kerangka peraturan yang rinci dan tidak fleksibel untuk menentukan struktur
bekerja kembali           organisasi dan bagi perencanaan tenaga kerja, kepegawaian negeri Indonesia tidak memiliki
(revolving door)’ dapat   pengendalian yang efektif untuk mencegah masalah “diterima bekerja kembali (revolving
di hindari dengan         doors)”. Dengan peningkatan fokus atas kualitas belanja, Pemerintah saat ini memberikan

 Menanggapi berbagai tekanan                                              Perkembangan Triwulanan
                                                                           Perekonomian Indonesia

memperkenalkan           perhatian lebih kepada keefektifan dari operasinya dan kepada apakah pembelanjaannya
insentif untuk           dilakukan secara lebih efisien (least cost). Fokus atas reviu pembelanjaan akan berbeda –
menurunkan jumlah        berbeda namun bisa saja reviu dimaksud akan melihat apakah kementerian dan lembaga
pegawai                  memiliki jumlah dan bauran staf yang tepat untuk mengerjakan tugas yang harus diemban –
                         dengan kemungkinan opsi perampingan. Kecuali kalau memang ada kontrol yang ketat atas
                         jumlah staf – idealnya dengan sistem SDM berdasarkan posisi yang mampu
                         mengintegrasikan masalah struktur, fungsi khusus dan staff – kemungkinan besar “revolving
                         doors” akan menghalangi usaha – usaha pengurangan pegawai..

                    e. Pengangkatan pegawai untuk struktur baru
Secara internasional,    Tren internasional bergeser kepada sistem pengangkatan dan promosi pegawai yang terbuka
tren mengarah menuju     dan berdasarkan prestasi, namun hal ini masih menemui keterbatasan yang signifikan di
sistem pengangkatan      Indonesia. Badan-badan negara memiliki tingkat delegasi kewenangan yang tinggi untuk
dan promosi yang         mengisi jabtan dengan pegawai mereka sendiri. Namun untuk hal ini berlaku pembatasan
terbuka dan              pada jabatan-jabatan tertentu untuk kepangkatan tertentu26, sehingga terdapat kemungkinan
berdasarkan prestasi     adanya halangan bagi pegawai terbaik untuk diangkat bagi jabatan tersebut.27. Sesungguhnya
                         PNS bekerja di dalam sistem yang tertutup, dengan penerimaan pegawai dari luar hanya
                         diperkenankan pada pangkat pemula. Sementara penerimaan dari luar kepegawaian negeri ke
                         pangkat yang lebih tinggi tidak diperkenankan (Pasal 12 UU No 43/1999 tentang Pokok-
                         Pokok Kepegawaian, pasal 12), pemindahan antar lembaga negara dapat dilakukan, walaupun
                         sistem pelaksanaannya masih belum jelas; tidak ada pasar internal untuk penerimaan dan
                         pemindahan antar kepegawaian negeri. Adanya pasar seperti itu akan memungkinkan
                         pegawai negeri dengan kualifikasi yang tepat dan keterampilan yang sesuai untuk merespon
                         insentif yang ada saat ini berupa tunjangan kinerja yang berbeda-beda, atau berupa
                         penempatan pada lintas Badan atau Lembaga Negara.

                    f.   Kendala dan pilihan reformasi bagi right-sizing
Restrukturisasi dan      Seperti dijelaskan pada pembahasan di atas, sejumlah kendala dalam bidang hukum,
perampingan              peraturan dan kemampuan merintangi implementasi proses perampingan utama secara
menghadapi sejumlah      efektif pada kepegawaian negeri Indonesia. Hal ini menimbulkan kebutuhan bagi reformasi
kendala dalam bidang     lanjutan yang dibangun di atas kemajuan signifikan yang telah dicapai, seperti penggunaan
hukum, peraturan dan     tunjangan jabatan khusus, yang telah digunakan di dalam reformasi birokrasi di Indonesia.
kapasitas                Sejumlah unsur-unsur utama, seperti yang dibahas pada catatan ini, dapat dilihat pada Tabel
                         10, bersama-sama dengan usulan reformasi tingkat tinggi. Keberlanjutan kemajuan pada
                         bidang ini sebagian akan bergantung pada penetapan RUU Aparatur Sipil Negara yang kini
                         masih dalam tahap penyusunan.

 Ringkasan eksekutif: Penyesuaian berlanjut




Perekonomian             Pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia sedang melambat, dibebani oleh dampak kumulatif dari
Indonesia sedang         perlemahan harga-harga komoditas utama yang telah berlangsung sejak tahun 2011 oleh
mengalami                pengetatan kondisi keuangan dalam dan luar negeri, dan oleh tantangan kebijakan.
penyesuaian yang         Bersamaan dengan itu, kebutuhan pendanaan eksternal telah meningkat, sebagian karena
cukup berarti,           melebarnya defisit neraca berjalan. Laju penyesuaian perkembangan-perkembangan ini telah
didorong oleh            meningkat dalam beberapa bulan terakhir. Bersama dengan peekonomian berkembang
perlemahan neraca        utama (emerging market economies/EMEs) lainnya, pasar keuangan Indonesia mencatat gejolak
eksternal…               yang cukup besar, dengan nilai tukar Rupiah yang mengalami depresiasi yang cukup besar
                         terhadap dolar AS. Pengaturan kebijakan juga tanggap terhadap penyesuaian ini, misalnya
                         dengan adanya pengetatan kebijakan moneter.

…yang membawa            Berdasarkan berbagai perkembangan tersebut, proyeksi Bank Dunia untuk pertumbuhan
perlambatan              Indonesia tahun 2014 telah diturunkan menjadi 5,3 persen – masih relatif kokoh, tetapi suatu
pertumbuhan dan          penurunan yang cukup berarti dalam prospek ekonomi jangka pendek. Penyesuaian ekonomi
peningkatan fokus        yang sedang berlangsung saat ini juga membawa risiko-risiko penurunan laju pertumbuhan
terhadap kebijakan       yang lebih besar, dan berlangsung lebih lama, dengan tidak adanya dukungan dari pendanaan
                         internasional berbiaya rendah dan permintaan yang kuat terhadap komoditas. Hal ini
                         menunjukkan pentingnya keberlanjutan penyesuaian kebijakan ekonomi makro, melanjutkan
                         upaya yang sedang berjalan untuk meningkatkan daya saing dan laju pertumbuhan ekonomi
                         berkelanjutan, dan memberikan perlindungan untuk kaum rentan dari dampak perlambatan
                         pertumbuhan dan kejutan ekonomi dimasa depan.

Gejolak pasar            Beberapa bulan terakhir telah mencatat gejolak pasar keuangan internasional yang cukup
keuangan internasional   berarti, yang dipicu oleh prospek normalisasi kebijakan moneter secara bertahap di Amerika
telah menjadi            Serikat. Aliran investasi portofolio dan biaya pendanaan hutang dan investasi di EMEs,
perhatian, walau         termasuk Indonesia, mencatat reaksi yang secara tiba-tiba terhadap kenaikan tajam suku
pertumbuhan dunia        bunga AS. Pada saat bersamaan, dan merupakan salah satu kontributor terhadap gejolak
saat ini semakin         pasar yang belakangan terjadi, adalah penguatan umum kinerja perekonomian maju dengan
mendukung…               berlanjutnya proses pemulihan.

tertekan, kecuali         pengecualian utama harga minyak mentah dunia bagi Indonesia. Indeks harga dolar AS yang
minyak bumi …             diboboti ekspor untuk enam komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia (yang mencapai hampir
                          setengah dari seluruh jumlah ekspor) turun sebesar 8 persen pada tahun berjalan 2013 hingga
                          akhir bulan Agustus, yang merupakan 35 persen lebih rendah dari nilai puncaknya setelah
                          tahun 2008/09 di bulan Januari 2011. Harga minyak mentah Brent, sebaliknya, meningkat
                          sebesar 7 persen dari bulan Januari 2011 ke Agustus 2013, dan umumnya mencatat
                          pergerakan yang datar selama tahun 2013. Perbedaan antara harga energi dan non-energi
                          dunia ini menjadi pendorong yang penting dari perlemahan neraca perdagangan Indonesia
                          sejak tahun 2011, dan memberikan tekanan tambahan terhadap posisi fiskal Pemerintah.

… yang membawa            Pertumbuhan ekonomi global akan terus meningkat, dengan para mitra perdagangan utama
tantangan terhadap        Indonesia akan bertumbuh sebesar 3,4 persen pada 2013, sama dengan tingkat pada 2012
neraca eksternal          tetapi mncerminkan kenaikan pada paruh kedua 2013, dan naik menjadi 3.9 persen pada
Indonesia                 tahun 2014. Namun dalam proyeksi dasar, harga-harga komoditas diproyeksikan tidak
                          bergerak menjadi lebih mendukung nilai tukar perdagangan(terms of trade) Indonesia. Lebih
                          lanjut, dengan pasar keuangan dunia terus menyesuaikan diri terhadap dampak penurunan
                          akomodasi moneter di negara maju, gejolak aliran modal, dan biaya pendanaan eksternal,
                          tampaknya akan tetap bertahan tinggi, baik bagi Indonesia maupun EMEs lainnya.
                          Penyesuaian ekonomi dan kebijakan Indonesia terhadap melemahnya neraca eksternal, yang
                          kini sedang berlangsung, tampaknya akan tetap menjadi pusat perhatian.

Pertumbuhan               Pelemahan permintaan memainkan peran yang penting dalam menggerakkan neraca berjalan,
melambat di triwulan      dan kebutuhan pendanaan eksternal secara keseluruhan, seiring dengan kondisi-kondisi
kedua, walaupun           pendanaan eksternal yang lebih ketat. Ekonomi Indonesia telah melambat sejauh ini di tahun
demikian Indonesia        2013, dengan pertumbuhan investasi menjadi penyebab utama. Pertumbuhan ekonomi pada
mencatat defisit neraca   triwulan kedua mencapai 5,8 persen, berada di bawah angka 6.0 persen untuk pertama
berjalan yang cukup       kalinya sejak tahun 2010. Walau permintaan dalam negeri mulai melemah, faktor-faktor
lebar                     musiman, bersama-sama dengan berlanjutnya perlemahan dalam penerimaan ekspor,
                          berkontribusi kepada pelebaran yang mengejutkan dalam defisit neraca berjalan triwulanan
                          Indonesia menjadi 4,4 persen dari PDB. Data-data tersebut, dan reaksi-reaksi investor yang
                          telah menyeimbangkan kembali portofolio mereka lebih condong kepada aset-aset
                          perekonomian berpenghasilan tinggi, memberikan tekanan yang besar terhadap Rupiah
                          menjelang akhir bulan Agustus. Tekanan itu berkontribusi terhadap keputusan Bank
                          Indonesia untuk meningkatkan suku bunga lebih lanjut, sehingga kenaikan BI Rate sejak
                          bulan Juni telah mencapai 150 basis poin, dan juga mengumumkan aturan kehati-hatian
                          kebijakan makro (macro-prudential) tambahan untuk menurunkan pertumbuhan kredit dan
                          kebijakan baru untuk mendukung likuiditas transaksi valas, yang telah berkurang.

Pertumbuhan PDB           Sejalan dengan perkembangan-perkembangan yang terjadi, pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia
diproyeksikan akan        diproyeksikan akan mengalami perlambatan yang lebih besar menjadi 5,3 persen pada tahun
melambat dan defisit      2014, turun dari 5,6 persen pada tahun 2013(Tabel 1). Proyeksi ini menurun dibandingkan
neraca berjalan akan      dengan proyeksi pada Triwulanan edisi bulan Juli 2013 dengan penurunan pertumbuhan
sedikit menyempit         menjadi 5,9 persen untuk 2013 dan naik menjadi 6,2 persen pada tahun 2014. Defisit neraca
pada tahun 2014…          berjalan diproyeksikan akan tetap besar, walau dengan sedikit penyempitan, menjadi 2,6
                          persen dari PDB pada tahun 2014. Setelah didorong naik secara sementara oleh peningkatan
                          harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni, inflasi diperkirakan akan mencapai puncaknya secara
                          tahunan pada triwulan terakhir tahun 2013, dan dengan tidak adanya kejutan dorongan biaya
                          (cost-push) yang cukup berarti, inflasi akan turun ke rata-rata 6,7 persen yoy pada 2014.

                          perkembangan ka arah yang positif, dan kemungkinan pemulihan ekonomi global yang lebih
                          baik dari yang diperkirakan sampai akhir 2014, dapat meningkatkan propek pertumbuhan
                          Indonesia dan dapat mendukung posisi neraca eksternal, asalkan Indonesia dapat
                          memanfaatkan kesempatan menguatnya perdagangan global dan pergerakan investasi.

…menekankan               Pengaturan kebijakan fiskal dan moneter Indonesia akan terus memainkan peran utama
pentingnya                dalam memfasilitasi penyesuaian yang sedang berlangsung dan meminimalkan risiko-risiko
berkelanjutan             terkait. Namun terdapat pilihan yang sulit yang harus diambil (trade-off) antara tujuan
fleksibilitas kebijakan   meredam laju inflasi, mendorong pertumbuhan, dan menyesuaikan defisit neraca berjalan ke
ekonomi makro untuk       lingkungan pendanaan yang lebih ketat. Kebijakan moneter menghadapi tantangan dalam
memfasilitasi             menyesuaikan suku bunga dan kurs tukar untuk memberi perlindungan terhadap
penyesuaian jangka        peningkatan tekanan inflasi dengan meningkatnya tekanan biaya (seperti pengaruh lanjutan
pendek…                   depresiasi kurs atau kenaikan upah) sementara memfasilitasi perbaikan neraca eksternal,
                          tanpa terlalu menghambat pertumbuhan ekonomi dan perlemahan posisi neraca pemerintah
                          dan swasta. Sejalan dengan sedang berlangsungnya pembahasan APBN 2014 dengan DPR,
                          kebijakan fiskal menghadapi tantangan perlambatan pertumbuhan penerimaan dan
                          peningkatan biaya pendanaan hutang nominal, yang semakin menekankan pentingnya upaya
                          meningkatkan kualitas belanja dan penerimaan. Menjaga kehati-hatian posisi fiskal secara
                          keseluruhan, terkoordinasi dengan pengetatan kebijakan moneter, dapat membantu
                          menanggulangi tantangan ini. Bertolak dari kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni,
                          reformasi lebih lanjut dari sistem subsidi energi yang tidak efisien dan distortif dapat
                          memainkan peran penting dalam membebaskan belanja untuk pengeluaran pembangunan
                          utama, seperti untuk infrastruktur dan kesehatan, dan juga membatasi timbulnya risiko fiskal
                          yang besar dari gejolak kurs tukar valuta atau kejutan harga minyak dunia.

…menurunkan               Dengan adanya ketidakpastian dari perlambatan momentum pertumbuhan, dan kondisi
ketidakpastian melalui    pendanaan eksternal yang bergejolak dan umumnya mengetat, menjaga komunikasi yang
komunikasi dan            kuat terhadap perubahan kebijakan dan menitikberatkan pada implementasi dapat membantu
perencanaan darurat…      mendukung tingkat kepercayaan. Kebijakan juga memainkan peran untuk memitigasi
                          dampak negatif skenario-skenario yang lebih buruk, jika risiko-risiko tersebut terjadi.
                          Pemerintah telah berupaya meningkatkan kesiagaan krisisnya dalam beberapa tahun terakhir.
                          Mekanisme pemantauan dan tanggapan sudah disiapkan untuk memfasilitasi tanggapan yang
                          fleksibel terhadap gejolak pasar yang besar. Pemerintah memiliki dana fiskal darurat senilai 5
                          miliar dolar AS bila terjadi penurunan kondisi pembiayaan yang signifikan, sementara Bank
                          Indonesia baru-baru ini telah mendapat tambahan pertukaran (swap) bilateral dalam dolar AS.

meningkatkan laju        mendukung laju pertumbuhan dan pembangunan yang lebih cepat. Depresiasi Rupiah yang
pertumbuhan              kini terjadi akan memberikan dorongan jangka pendek terhadap daya saing, namun
berkelanjutan            dampaknya hanya akan bertahan bila tidak dipengaruhi oleh tekanan harga dalam negeri,
Indonesia                seperti yang berasal dari kenaikan upah, dan jika kebijakan-kebijakan dan investasi
                         ditempatkan untuk meningkatkan fleksibilitas dari sisi penawaran ekonomi. Dengan
                         demikian upaya-upaya untuk meningkatkan daya saing dan lingkungan peraturan dapat
                         membantu meringankan tekanan pendanaan eksternal jangka pendek dengan memberi
                         stimulus kepada ekspor dan mendorong penanaman modal asing langsung (FDI) dan juga
                         membantu meningkatkan kesempatan kerja dan pertumbuhan ekonomi jangka panjang.

Paket kebijakan          Sebagai tanggapan terhadap meningkatnya tekanan pasar keuangan, dan bersamaan dengan
Pemerintah yang          tekanan kebijakan moneter yang disinggung sebelumnya, pada tanggal 23 Agustus 2013
diumumkan pada 23        Pemerintah mengumumkan suatu paket kebijakan yang berisi aturan-aturan yang bertujuan
Agustus berisi aturan    untuk memperbaiki neraca berjalan, menjaga daya beli dan memfasilitasi pertumbuhan,
yang bertujuan untuk     membatasi tekanan inflasi, dan menjaga aliran investasi. Sejumlah aturan termasuk
mendukung ekspor         pemberian usulan untuk meningkatkan kepastian dalam dunia usaha dan mencabut
dan investasi, namun     kebijakan-kebijakan perdagangan yang bersifat intervensionis. Namun rincian dan penerapan
implementasi akan        peraturan-peraturan itu, dan kontribusinya dalam mencapai penyesuaian yang dibutuhkan
menjadi kuncinya         pada neraca eksternal, masih belum terlihat. Sementara kepentingan politis dalam
                         penyusunan kebijakan menjelang pemilu tampaknya akan semakin meningkat, juga terdapat
                         kesempatan bagi penguatan reformasi dalam jangka pendek, dengan adanya potensi biaya
                         dan konsekuensi bila tidak melakukannya dengan kondisi perekonomian saat ini.

Dalam jangka pendek,     Upaya-upaya untuk meningkatkan konektivitas internasional Indonesia memiliki peran yang
peningkatan              sangat penting dalam meningkatkan daya saing ekspor Indonesia dan mendorong investasi.
konektivitas             Salah satu tantangan praktis utama untuk meningkatkan konektivitas internasional Indonesia
internasional, seperti   adalah menurunkan waktu tunggu (dwell time) pada pelabuhan Indonesia yang paling utama,
pada kinerja logistik    Tanjung Priok (yang menangani lebih dari dua per tiga perdagangan internasional Indonesia),
pelabuhan Tanjung        yang telah meningkat hampir dua kali lipat bagi peti kemas yang tiba di pelabuhan itu sejak
Priok, pintu gerbang     awal tahun 2011, menjadi rata-rata lebih dari sepuluh hari pada bulan Agustus. Sejumlah
utama Indonesia,         langkah-langkah penting telah diambil untuk mengatasi keadaan itu. Tambahan reformasi
dapat memberikan         peraturan dan peningkatan prosedural dapat semakin menurunkan waktu proses hulu,
dorongan peningkatan     misalnya dengan meningkatkan penggunaan jalur kepabeanan khusus dan proses kepabeanan
daya saing               secara paralel, dan juga memberikan insentif bagi penyerahan dini surat pemberitahuan
                         impor barang dan meningkatkan kinerja sistem Indonesian National Single Window.

Tingkat dan kualitas     Seperti telah disadari oleh Pemerintah, perbaikan infrastruktur fisik dapat memecahkan salah
belanja infrastruktur    satu kendala terhadap daya saing dan laju pertumbuhan Indonesia secara berkelanjutan.
tetap menjadi penentu    Infrastruktur yang lebih baik juga dapat meningkatkan hasil pembangunan, seperti di bidang
utama bagi kinerja       kesehatan dan pendidikan, dengan meningkatkan aksesibilitas. Data terbaru yang dihimpun
perdagangan dan          Bank Dunia menunjukkan bahwa tambahan investasi terhadap stok infrastruktur di
pertumbuhan jangka       Indonesia belum mencukupi sejak krisis keuangan Asia, menyebabkan stok infrastruktur
panjang                  menurun dibandingkan total stok investasi dan ekonomi. Dalam jangka waktu 2001-2011,
                         simulasi awal menunjukkan bahwa jika pertumbuhan tahunan stok infrastruktur naik menjadi
                         5 persen, dibanding tingkat perkiraan aktuil sebesar 3 persen, dapat meningkatkan
                         pertumbuhan PDB tahunan rata-rata menjadi 5,8 persen, atau 0,5 persen di atas rata-rata
                         aktuil, sehingga nilai nominal PDB pada tahun 2011 lebih tinggi sebesar 5 persen. Sementara
                         hasil tersebut peka terhadap asumsi-asumsi yang digunakan, mereka tetap menunjuk akan
                         perlunya meningkatkan kuantitas dan kualitas investasi publik. Melanjutkan kenaikan alokasi
                         anggaran infrastruktur dapat berperan, namun keberlanjutan fiskal dan persaingan untuk
                         pendanaan program prioritas juga sangat menekankan pada efisiensi, termasuk memastikan
                         kelancaran operasional dan pemeliharaan infrastruktur yang ada, dan usaha selanjutnya
                         meningkatkan pengelolaan investasi publik. Memperbaiki ketersediaan dan kualitas data di
                         bidang ini yang dapat memberikan masukan untuk kebijakan juga sangat dibutuhkan.

Kinerja pendidikan       Hal penting lainnya bagi pertumbuhan, yang juga merupakan sasaran pembangunan utama,
juga sangat penting      adalah modal manusia Indonesia – ilmu pengetahuan dan keahlian penduduknya. Dalam
bagi pembangunan,        lima belas tahun terakhir, Indonesia telah meluncurkan paket reformasi pendidikan yang
yang membutuhkan         menyeluruh yang dirancang untuk meningkatkan akses dan kualitas. Komponen utama dari
lebih banyak perbaikan   proses reformasi adalah pendelegasian kewenangan pendidikan dasar kepada pemerintah dan
dalam tata kelola        sekolah-sekolah di daerah, dan sehingga peningkatan dalam tata kelola dapat memainkan
pemerintahan daerah      peran yang penting dalam meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan dasar dan menjamin bahwa
                         para murid dapat meninggalkan sekolah dengan bekal keterampilan yang memadai. Survei

                         yang dilakukan pada tahun 2009 dan 2012, menunjukkan bahwa kualitas tata kelola
                         pemerintah daerah merupakan faktor yang penting untuk meningkatkan kinerja pendidikan
                         di daerah, sehingga sangatlah penting untuk terus menangani kendala-kendala tata kelola
                         utama, dan untuk meningkatkan koordinasi dan integrasi pendanaan pemerintah pusat

 A. Perkembangan ekonomi dan fiskal terkini




                    1. Gejolak pasar internasional dengan meningkatnya biaya pendanaan
                       eksternal
Gejolak pasar          Gambaran eksternal bagi Indonesia, dan ekonomi pasar berkembang (emerging market
keuangan internasional economics, EME) lainnya, telah didominasi oleh gejolak pasar keuangan internasional, dan
telah mengemuka …      peningkatan biaya pendanaan eksternal, yang dipicu oleh prospek normalisasi bertahap
                       kebijakan moneter di AS. Antara awal bulan Mei (dengan kuatnya spekulasi bahwa Bank
                       Sentral AS akan memangkas program pembelian obligasinya) dan awal September (ketika
                       dugaan pasar bahwa Bank Sentral AS akan mulai “mengurangi” pembeliannya pada bulan itu
                       mencapai puncaknya), imbal hasil (yield) obligasi negara AS 10-tahun yang menjadi tolok ukur
                       meningkat sebesar 135 basis poin, menjadi sedikit di bawah 3 persen, yang merupakan
                       tingkat tertinggi sejak bulan Mei 2011. Sebagai tanggapannya, biaya pembiayaan hutang dan
                       ekuitas bagi EME, termasuk Indonesia, naik tajam (Gambar 1), dan aliran modal keluar
                       mulai terlihat.

…walau kondisi            Perkembangan pasar juga mencerminkan berlanjutnya penguatan pertumbuhan pada
ekonomi negara-           perekonomian negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi. Zona Eropa bangkit dari resesi
negara berpenghasilan     panjangnya pada triwulan kedua, dan ekonomi Jepang dan AS meningkat dengan laju yang
tinggi mulai              kokoh. Data triwulan ketiga menunjukkan bahwa keadaan positif itu terus berlanjut, dan
membaik…                  peningkatan diperkirakan akan terus berlanjut, dengan perekonomian negara-negara
                          berpenghasilan tinggi melanjutkan pemulihannya dari krisis keuangan dunia tahun 2008/09
                          dan dampak paska krisis tersebut. Pemulihan yang masih berlangsung ini dapat mendukung
                          ekspor Indonesia, baik secara langsung (karena hampir sepertiga ekspor dikirimkan ke Zona
                          Eropa, Jepang dan AS) dan secara tidak langsung, melalui pengaruh dari permintaan global
                          dan harga ekspor Indonesia. Namun prospek dari mitra-mitra perdagangan Indonesia
                          menunjukkan gambaran beragam.

…yang menambah             Penjualan besar-besaran di pasar saham dan valuta lebih besar terjadi di negara EME yang
gambaran beragam           membutuhkan pembiayaan neraca berjalan yang cukup besar, terutama Brasil, Turki, Afrika
terhadap ekonomi           Selatan, India dan Indonesia. Namun sebagian dari tekanan jual yang dialami pasar-pasar
negara-negara              berkembang hingga awal September dapat disebabkan oleh dampak harga dari mengecilnya
berkembang utama …         perbedaan pertumbuhan antara ekonomi berpenghasilan tinggi dan berkembang, yang
                           mencerminkan percepatan pertumbuhan pada ekonomi berpenghasilan tinggi seperti yang
                           didiskusikan dan perlambatan pada ekonomi berkembang. Hal ini, bersama-sama dengan
                           perkiraan akan semakin berkurangnya likuiditas global, memberikan gambaran kombinasi
                           yang menantang bagi banyak EME, dan prospek mitra perdagangan utama Indonesia yang
                           merupakan negara berkembang, memang beragam. China (yang menjadi tujuan dari sekitar
                           11 persen ekspor Indonesia, dan pendorong utama harga komoditas dunia) tampaknya
                           berada pada jalur yang tepat untuk mencapai sasaran pertumbuhan resminya sebesar 7,5
                           persen pada tahun 2013, sedikit lebih rendah dari 7,8 persen pada tahun 2012, sementara
                           pertumbuhan telah merosot secara signifikan di India (yang merupakan 7 persen dari jumlah
                           ekspor Indonesia dan merupakan pasar utama bagi produk-produk ekspor tertentu, seperti
                           batu bara dan minyak sawit).

…sementara harga-          Secara umum harga-harga komoditas internasional telah melemah pada beberapa bulan
harga komoditas non-       terakhir, yang dipengaruhi oleh menguatnya nilai dolar AS, dengan pengecualian utama
energi terus menurun       adalah harga minyak dunia (yang terpengaruh oleh kekhawatiran konflik di Syria). Indeks
                           harga ekspor dalam dolar AS untuk enam komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia (yang
                           merupakan hampir setengah dari seluruh jumlah ekspor) turun sebesar 8 persen pada tahun
                           2013 hingga akhir bulan Agustus, menjadi 35 persen lebih rendah dari puncaknya paska
                           tahun 2008/09 yang terjadi pada bulan Januari 2011 (Gambar 2). Harga minyak mentah
                           Brent, sebaliknya, naik sebesar 7 persen dari bulan Januari 2011 hingga Agustus 2013, dan
                           relatif datar selama tahun berjalan. Perbedaan tren antara harga energi dan non-energi dunia
                           sejak tahun 2011 ini sangat berbeda dari korelasi yang biasanya lebih dekat, dan merupakan
                           satu aspek utama dari penurunan neraca perdagangan Indonesia secara signifikan sejak tahun
                           2011 (lihat Bagian 3), dan menambah tekanan fiskal dengan adanya pengeluaran untuk
                           subsidi energi.

Pertumbuhan dunia         Bank Dunia terus memperkirakan peningkatan ekonomi global, dengan peningkatan para

tinggi ditengah gejolak   seringkali saling berkaitan masih terus bertahan, baik untuk kenaikan maupun penurunan.

pendanaan luar negeri     negara berpenghasilan tinggi dan berkembang dengan semakin menyusutnya likuiditas
                          internasional. Dengan pasar keuangan yang terus menyesuikan terhadap implikasi penurunan
                          akomodasi moneter di AS, gejolak investasi portofolio dan tingkat biaya pendanaan
                          tampaknya akan tetap tinggi, bagi Indonesia maupun EME lainnya.

                    2. Ekonomi Indonesia diperkirakan akan terus melambat di 2014
Pertumbuhan ekonomi       Seperti dialami oleh banyak EME utama lainnya, ekonomi Indonesia telah melambat selama
telah melambat sejauh     tahun 2013, karena terbebani oleh perlemahan momentum investasi. Pertumbuhan pada
ini pada tahun 2013       triwulan kedua mengalami penurunan menjadi 5,8 persen, tercatat pertama kali di bawah 6,0
dan diperkirakan akan     persen sejak tahun 2010. Bank Dunia telah menurunkan proyeksi pertumbuhan PDB-nya
terus berlanjut           untuk tahun 2013 menjadi 5,6 persen, turun dari proyeksi sebesar 5,9 persen pada
                          Triwulanan edisi bulan Juli 2013, dan juga menurunkan proyeksi pertumbuhan tahun 2014
                          menjadi 5,3 persen dari 6,2 persen. Penurunan yang cukup besar untuk tahun 2014
                          mencerminkan prospek yang lebih lemah dari permintaan dalam negeri, dengan penyesuaian
                          ekonomi terhadap lebih ketatnya kondisi pendanaan dan lebih rendahnya harga komoditas.
                          Sementara harga ekspor, terutama bagi komoditas, diperkirakan akan tetap lemah, volume
                          ekspor diperkirakan akan terus mencatat peningkatan yang tipis dengan semakin pulihnya
                          laju pertumbuhan di negara-negara perekonomian maju. Pertumbuhan impor tampaknya
                          akan terus menurun tipis, sejalan dengan prospek dari permintaan dalam negeri dan dampak
                          (tertunda) dari depresiasi Rupiah. Karenanya, tidak seperti tahun 2012, ketika ekspor bersih
                          menghambat pertumbuhan, kali ini ekspor bersih akan menambah pertumbuhan tahun 2013
                          dan 2014.

triwulan kedua…           dibanding pertumbuhan triwulan pertama sebesar 1,3 persen. Pada sisi pengeluaran,
                          penurunan pertumbuhan investasi yang berkelanjutan merupakan pendorong utama
                          moderasi yoy, walau terdapat beberapa kontribusi yang berasal dari konsumsi, dengan
                          pertumbuhan permintaan secara keseluruhan melemah menjadi 4,7 persen yoy, dari 5,0
                          persen yoy pada triwulan pertama. Ekspor bersih dapat mengimbangi sebagian moderasi yang
                          tercatat pada permintaan dalam negeri, dengan memberi tambahan kepada pertumbuhan di
                          triwulan pertama tahun 2013, karena pertumbuhan volume ekspor terus meningkat dan
                          melebihi peningkatan yang dicatat oleh impor.

                        1,8 persen yoy pada triwulan kedua, cukup jauh di bawah inflasi harga konsumen. Dengan
                        harga komoditas dunia dan nominal nilai tukar Rupiah yang diperkirakan tidak akan menguat
                        dalam skenario dasar, maka nilai tukar perdagangan, deflator PDB dan pertumbuhan PDB
                        nominal tampaknya juga akan tetap lemah dalam jangka pendek. Kejutan negatif nilai tukar
                        perdagangan, yang dampaknya terus berlangsung terhadap perekonomian sejak akhir 2011,
                        akan terus membawa implikasi negatif yang signifikan bagi pertumbuhan penerimaan dan
                        profitabilitas, terutama pada sektor-sektor dan wilayah yang berkaitan dengan komoditas.

Pertumbuhan investasi   Pertumbuhan investasi yang lebih lemah merupakan pendorong utama perlambatan
terus melambat,         pertumbuhan PDB riil. Secara yoy, pertumbuhan investasi mengalami moderasi menjadi 4.7
seiring dengan          persen pada triwulan tersebut, turun dari 5,8 persen pada triwulan pertama dan 12,5 persen
penurunan yang          satu tahun yang lalu (triwulan kedua tahun 2012). Ada beberapa peningkatan dalam laju
signifikan dalam        pertumbuhan triwulanan (menjadi 2,4 persen qoq dengan penyesuaian musiman), walau sulit
kegiatan yang           untuk menarik kesimpulan dari pergerakan triwulanan karena sifat investasi yang besar
berkaitan dengan        (lumpy). Hingga saat ini sebagian besar perlemahan pertumbuhan investasi terjadi pada
komoditas               permesinan dan transportasi (Gambar 4), seperti tercermin dari penurunan impor barang-
                        barang modal. Hal ini bersamaan dengan penurunan yang signifikan pada kegiatan yang
                        berkaitan dengan komoditas, terutama secara nominal, yang menempatkan tekanan turun
                        bagi penerimaan ekspor dan profitabilitas, yang membawa pengaruh terhadap penurunan
                        investasi dan produksi. Sebaliknya, pertumbuhan investasi gedung riil (85 persen dari jumlah
                        investasi) tetap kokoh namun dapat mendapattekanan tambahan kedepannya.

…dan investasi          Prospek investasi telah melemah sejak Triwulanan edisi bulan Juli. Biaya sejumlah faktor
diperkirakan akan       produksi (input) utama telah meningkat secara signifikan. Depresiasi Rupiah telah
semakin melemah,        menyebabkan kenaikan biaya impor, bagi barang-barang modal dan bahan bakar, dan upah
dengan pengetatan       minimum juga mencatat peningkatan yang besar. Seperti dibahas di bawah, kondisi
kondisi kredit          pendanaan dalam negeri telah mengetat dan, bagi perusahaan-perusahaan yang berhubungan
diperkirakan akan       dengan komoditas, cakupan pendanaan internal melalui laba yang ditahan perusahaan
membebani investasi     (retained earnings) telah dipengaruhi oleh penurunan harga-harga komoditas. Sejalan dengan
pergedungan             pengalaman historis, kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat diperkirakan akan memperkecil
                        kredit dan investasi, memberikan tekanan terhadap investasi, termasuk investasi terkait
                        pembangunan gedung (Gambar 5). Dengan pengalaman masa lalu yang menunjukkan
                        pengaruh peningkatan suku bunga terhadap kegiatan ekonomi baru terlihat beberapa
                        triwulan kemudian, maka dampak negatif terhadap kegiatan ekonomi, terutama investasi,
                        akan paling banyak terjadi menjelang akhir tahun 2013 dan memasuki tahun 2014. Dengan
                        adanya risiko investasi yang signifikan, seperti semakin ketatnya kondisi pendanaan ditambah
                        dengan perubahan atau ketidakpastian peraturan perundangan, terutama dengan semakin
                        tingginya tekanan siklus politis menjelang pemilu nasional, Kotak 3 menyoroti tingginya
                        sensitivitas prospek pertumbuhan PDB untuk tahun 2014 terhadap lintasan investasi.

                             konsumen BI pada bulan Juli and Agustus, memangkas peningkatan yang telah tercatat
                             selama 18 bulan terakhir. Tingginya suku bunga, ketatnya kondisi kredit, rendahnya tingkat
                             kepecayaan, dan dampak terhadap kekayaan/aset dari gejolak pasar keuangan yang
                             belakangan terjadi juga akan mempengaruhi konsumsi swasta. Namun belanja menjelang
                             pemilu wakil rakyat dan presiden pada tahun 2014 akan membawa sejumlah pengaruh
                             pengimbang bagi pertumbuhan konsumsi menjelang akhir tahun 2013 dan memasuki tahun
                             2014 (Gambar 6).

diperkirakan akan            telah menambah terhadap pertumbuhan yoy pada dua triwulan terakhir, dengan pertumbuhan
berkontribusike              ekspor yang melebihi impor (Gambar 7). Ekspor riil mencatat pertumbuhan yang positif,
pertumbuhan tahun            walaupun lemah, pada triwulan kedua (seperti terukur oleh neraca nasional), dengan
2013 dan 2014, setelah       peningkatan sebesar 0,8 persen qoq dengan penyesuaian musiman dan 4,8 persen yoy. Impor

                             2013 dan 2014 dengan volume ekspor diperkirakan akan mencatat sedikit pemulihan, sejalan

Pada sisi produksi,           Pada sisi produksi, moderasi pertumbuhan yoy pada triwulan kedua bersifat luas, dengan
sebagian besar                dampak terbesar kepada keseluruhan ekonomi yang berasal dari sektor pertanian dan
moderasi pertumbuhan          industri. Kegiatan pertambangan dan penggalian tetaplah lemah, dengan kontraksi sebesar
didorong oleh sektor          1,2 persen yoy, dan migas turun sebesar 4,7 persen yoy. Sektor-sektor industri lainnya
industri, terutama            umumnya mencatat kinerja yang kokoh, seperti manufaktur (naik 5,8 persen yoy) dan
pertambangan dan              konstruksi (naik 6,9 persen yoy). Sebagian besar sektor jasa terus mencatat kinerja yang baik,
penggalian…                   dengan transportasi dan komunikasi meningkat 11,5 persen yoy dan perdagangan, hotel dan
                              restoran naik sebesar 6,5 persen yoy, walaupun lebih rendah dibanding pertumbuhan sebesar
                              10 persen yang dicatat menjelang akhir tahun 2011.

…dan dalam skenario           Prospek ke depan diperkirakan pertumbuhan yang lebih lemah di sebagian besar sektor
dasar, perlambatan            karena pengetatan kondisi kredit dan harga komoditas global yang tetap lemah. Kinerja
yang luas lintas sektor       manufaktur yang terkait dengan non-komoditas tampaknya akan bercampur, dengan sub-
diperkirakan terus            sektor berorientasi ekspor yang didukung oleh peningkatan pertumbuhan dunia dan
berlanjut …                   depresiasi Rupiah. Namun dengan sejumlah industri manufaktur Indonesia yang bergantung
                              pada faktor produksi (input) dari impor, perlemahan kurs tukar akan meningkatkan sejumlah
                              biaya input, sehingga akan menghambat sejumlah kegiatan.

…seperti yang                 Indikator-indikator dengan frekuensi yang tinggi pada bulan Juli dan Agustus menunjukkan
diperlihatkan oleh            bahwa moderasi pertumbuhan akan terus berlanjut, walau masa Ramadan memperumit
sejumlah indikator            interpretasi dari data-data tersebut. Indikator pertumbuhan konsumsi sejalan dengan
kegiatan ekonomi              perlemahan pada triwulan ketiga, dengan turunnya kepercayaan konsumen secara signifikan,
frekuensi tinggi              dan penjualan sepeda motor, mobil dan ritel juga menunjukkan sejumlah perlemahan pada
                              bulan Juli dan Agustus (Gambar 8). Pertumbuhan produksi industri tetap lemah, hanya
                              sebesar 3,2 persen yoy pada bulan Juli. Penjualan semen, indikator utama investasi
                              pergedungan, juga melemah. Impor barang modal bulanan, komponen investasi yang
                              penting, tetap lemah selama bulan Agustus setelah penyesuaian musiman (Gambar 9).

                       perlambatan impor
Defisit neraca transaksi    Walau terdapat tanda-tanda perlambatan pertumbuhan pada triwulan kedua, defisit neraca
berjalan Indonesia          transaksi berjalan Indonesia melebar menjadi 9.8 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan kedua
melebar ke 4,4 persen       (Gambar 11), atau 4,4 persen terhadap PDB, dari 5,8 miliar dolar AS (2,6 persen dari PDB)
terhadap PDB di             di triwulan pertama. Ini merupakan nilai defisit triwulanan terbesar yang pernah tercatat.
triwulan kedua 2013         Saldo neraca berjalan umumnya menunjukkan penurunan musiman pada triwulan kedua,
akibat tekanan              dengan permintaan impor dan jasa hutang perusahaan swasta, dan aliran keluar modal
musiman dan                 repatriasi keuntungan pada sub-neraca penerimaan yang cenderung naik. Perlemahan
pengaruh harga yang         musiman tahun ini diperkuat dengan waktu jatuhnya bulan Ramadhan, yang membangkitkan
mendominasi                 kembali impor non-migas. Selain itu, perlemahan yang terus dialami harga-harga komoditas
pemulihan dalam             ekspor utama Indonesia memangkas peningkatan volumenya (Gambar 12), yang akibatnya

Permintaan impor naik       Impor barang-barang di bulan Juli hanya turun sebesar 0,8 persen yoy secara 3mma karena
mendekati Ramadhan,         kenaikan permintaan sebelum Ramadhan, namun kembali turun pada bulan Agustus dengan
namun dalam periode         penurunan sebesar 1,7 persen yoy 3mma (Gambar 13). Keseluruhan impor didorong oleh
yang lebih panjang,         kenaikan tajam impor BBM, yang naik sebesar 20,2 persen 3mma pada bulan Agustus, dan
telah melambat selama       barang-barang konsumsi, yang naik sebesar 6,3 persen yoy 3mma pada periode yang sama.
2013                        Namun impor barang setengah jadi non-bahan bakar (sekitar 52 persen dari jumlah impor),
                            dan terutama barang modal (sekitar 18 persen dari jumlah impor) tetap lemah.

Defisit perdagangan         Neraca perdagangan migas bulanan Indonesia sudah mengalami defisit sejak bulan Agustus
migas tetap menjadi         2012, dan terus menjadi penghambat besar bagi keseluruhan neraca perdagangan. Defisit
tantangan utama             perdagangan migas mencapai 2,4 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan kedua (mengecil dari 3,4
                            miliar dolar AS pada triwulan pertama), dan secara beruntun melebar dengan cukup tajam ke
                            1,9 miliar dolar AS hanya di bulan Juli (hal ini dipengaruhi oleh faktor-faktor musiman,
                            karena di bulan Agustus deficit menyempit menjadi 0,9 miliar dolar AS). Produksi minyak
                            mentah dalam negeri terus menyusut, menjadikan neraca minyak mentah memasuki zona
                            defisit. Sementara, terbatasnya kapasitas penyulingan minyak di dalam negeri mendorong
                            defisit perdagangan pengolahan minyak mencapai 5,4 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan kedua,
                            walau turun dari 6,2 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan pertama, berdasarkan laporan BPS.

Indonesia terus                  Aliran masuk neraca modal dan finansial meningkatkan menjadi 8,2 miliar dolar AS di
bergantung pada aliran           triwulan kedua dari defisit sebesar 0,3 miliar dolar AS di triwulan pertama. Akan teteapi,
masuk modal                      surplus aliran masuk modal tidak cukup untuk mengimbangi aliran keluar dari neraca
portofolio dan lainnya           berjalan, sehingga cadangan devisa mengalami penurunan sebesar 2,5 miliar dolar AS selama
untuk membiayai                  triwulan itu. Defisit neraca dasar (basic balance) Indonesia, yang merupakan penjumlahan dari
defisit neraca                   neraca transaksi berjalan dan aliran masuk penanaman modal langsung, meningkat menjadi
berjalan…                        6,5 miliar di triwulan kedua, dari 1,9 miliar dolar AS di triwulan akhir tahun 2012. Hal ini
                                 menambah ketergantungan pembiayaan pada inestasi portofolio (yang mencapai 2,5 miliar
                                 dolar AS di triwulan kedua) dan pada aliran masuk modal investasi lainnya (sebesar 2,3 miliar
                                 dolar AS). Aliran masuk investasi portofolio termasuk 3,0 miliar dolar AS dari penerbitan
                                 obligasi negara global, yang mengimbangi aliran keluar modal bersih yang signifikan dari
                                 obligasi dan saham dalam negeri Indonesia. Surplus dari investasi lainnya di triwulan kedua
                                 merupakan perubahan dari defisit sebesar 7 miliar dolar AS di triwulan pertama, yang berasal
                                 dari kuatnya aliran masuk modal untuk tabungan dan valas (sebesar 4,6 miliar dolar AS), yang
                                 sebagian mencerminkan kuatnya permintaan musiman valuta asing dari para nasabah bank
                                 untuk memenuhi hutang luar negeri dan repatriasi keuntungan, yang mendorong bank-bank
                                 untuk melakukan repatriasi tabungan di dalam negeri.

…sementara aliran                Aliran masuk penanaman modal asing langsung sebesar (PMA) sebesar 3,3 miliar dolar AS
masuk PMA secara                 pada triwulan kedua, menurun dari 3,9 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan pertama, karena lebih
umum tetap stabil                kuatnya aliran investasi langsung yang mengalir keluar negeri. Aliran masuk penanaman
                                 modal langsung ke dalam negeri, seperti diukur oleh neraca pembayaran, tetap bertahan
                                 stabil pada 4,2 miliar dolar AS (naik tipis dari 4,1 miliar di triwulan pertama), namun turun
                                 dari nilai rata-ratanya yang sedikit di bawah 5 miliar dolar AS yang tercatat pada tahun 2011
                                 dan 2012, masa ketika aliran masuk modal naik dengan cepat. Walau terjadi peningkatan
                                 diversifikasi sektoral dari aliran masuk PMA di triwulan dua, pola aliran masuk PMA secara
                                 keseluruhan berhubungan erat dengan pola pergerakan harga-harga komoditas dunia, yang
                                 tampaknya mencerminkan penyaluran penerimaan yang terkait dengan penerimaan kepada
                                 investasi pada sektor-sektor ekonomi lainnya di Indonesia (Gambar 14). Sebagai akibatnya,
                                 harga-harga komoditas dunia bersama-sama dengan ketidakpastian kebijakan dan politik
                                 menjelang pemilu tahun 2014, membawa risiko terhadap prospek aliran masuk PMA.

                          melemahkan permintaan impor BBM, sehingga menurunkan defisit neraca berjalan pada
                          kisaran 0,1 hingga 0,2 poin persentase terhadap PDB (berdasar perkiraan pada Triwulanan
                          edisi bulan Juli 2013). Tajamnya depresiasi nominal Rupiah yang belakangan terjadi – dengan
                          penurunan yang telah mencapai 20 persen sejauh ini pada 2013 – juga akan memberikan
                          sejumlah dukungan pada neraca perdagangan dalam rangka meningkatkan daya saing
                          eksternal Indonesia (walau secara persyaratan perdagangan penurunan itu lebih kecil, seperti
                          diperlihatkan pada Bagian 4 di bawah). Akhirnya, penerimaan ekspor diproyeksikan akan
                          meningkat berkat dukungan pertumbuhan mitra perdagangan utama, bersama-sama dengan

…namun kebutuhan          Kebutuhan pendanaan bruto Indonesia yang berasal dari luar negeri cukup besar, sementara
pendanaan bruto           yang timbul dari pemenuhan dan pembayaran kembali hutang luar negeri berukuran lebih
secara umum tetap         besar dari yang berasal dari defisit neraca transaksi berjalan. Pembayaran kembali hutang luar
besar, dan kondisi        negeri pada triwulan kedua mencapai 43,1 miliar dolar AS, sementara, seperti dibahas di atas,
pendanaan luar negeri     jumlah defisit neraca transaksi berjalan triwulanan sebesar 9,8 miliar dolar AS (Gambar 16).
telah mengetat            Kondisi pendanaan luar negeri yang lebih ketat dan depresiasi Rupiah menciptakan kondisi
                          yang lebih menantang dan lebih mahal bagi pembiayaan kembali hutang luar negeri yang ada,
                          di mana lebih dari setengahnya (atau 15 persen dari PDB) merupakan hutang luar negeri
                          sektor swasta. Hal ini terutama dialami oleh perusahaan-perusahaan yang tidak memiliki
                          akses terhadap lindung ulang (hedging) valuta alami (melalui penerimaan dalam dolar AS) dan
                          yang memiliki keterpaparan yang besar terhadap perlemahan harga-harga komoditas global.
                          Cadangan devisa resmi masih dalam kondisi lebih dari mencukupi kebutuhan pembiayaan
                          luar negeri jangka pendek Indonesia, walau rasio hutang luar negeri jangka pendek terhadap
                          cadangan devisa telah meningkat menjadi sekitar 50 persen dari 40 persen pada akhir tahun
                          2011. Namun yang lebih penting adalah bahwa risiko likuiditas luar negeri telah meningkat,
                          dengan rasio layanan hutang meningkat hingga 80 persen pada bulan Juni 2013, dari sekitar
                          30 persen pada pertengahan tahun 2011. Bank Indonesia memproyeksikan bahwa
                          pembayaran kembali hutang luar negeri di luar pembiayaan perdagangan, pinjaman bergulir
                          dan valas dan simpanan akan mencapai jumlah 32,6 miliar dolar AS selama bulan Agustus
                          hingga Desember 2013, yang mana 28,8 miliar dolar AS merupakan hutang swasta, dan
                          pembayaran kembali bruto sebesar 33,4 miliar dolar AS yang diperkirakan untuk periode

Defisit neraca transaksi      Secara keseluruhan, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan defisit neraca transaksi berjalan sebesar 29
berjalan diproyeksikan        miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2013, atau 3,4 persen dari PDB, lebih besar dari defisit 2,8 persen
mencapai 3,4 persen           dari PDB pada tahun 2012. Pada tahun 2014, defisit neraca transaksi berjalan diperkirakan
pada 2013 dan 2,6             akan menyempit menjadi 2,6 persen dari PDB, karena pelemahan kegiatan ekonomi yang
persen pada 2014…             diantisipasi menuju tahun 2014 akan memperkecil permintaan impor; sementara depresiasi
                              Rupiah yang belakangan terjadi dan peningkatan pertumbuhan para mitra perdagangan
                              utama Indonesia akan memberikan sejumlah dukungan kepada ekspor.

…dengan asumsi                Seperti biasanya, proyeksi saldo neraca transaksi berjalan sangatlah peka terhadap pola
kesulitan pembiayaan          permintaan dalam negeri dan harga komoditas non-minyak (bagi ekspor) dan biaya bahan
eksternal yang                bakar internasional (bagi impor). Pada saat ini, di tengah peningkatan keprihatinan akan
signifikan dapat              persyaratan pembiayaan eksternal para negara-negara berkembangutama, termasuk
dihindari                     Indonesia, suatu tambahan asumsi yang mendasari proyek dasar (baseline) di atas adalah
                              bahwa proses penyesuaian untuk memperketat kondisi pembiayaan eksternal tetaplah teratur.
                              Asumsi ini sangat bergantung pada perkembangan kebijakan dalam dan luar negeri dan
                              kaitannya dengan kepercayaan investor. Sejumlah perubahan kebijakan untuk mendukung
                              daya saing perdagangan dan investasi luar negeri dapat ditetapkan untuk jangka pendek (lihat
                              Bagian B.1 dan B.2). Namun peningkatan daya saing lainnya tampaknya akan mengambil
                              waktu yang lebih panjang, termasuk penanganan biaya dan kemacetan yang disebabkan oleh
                              buruknya infrastruktur Indonesia (lihat Bagian C.1). Dengan demikian, secara jangka pendek,
                              fokus yang lebih akan diberikan kepada penyesuaian permintaan impor, baik melalui
                              pertukaran belanja (karena depresiasi Rupiah meningkatkan harga-harga impor) dan tekanan
                              (dengan pengetatan kondisi kredit dan moneter dan impor yang lebih mahal menghambat
                              belanja diskresioner untuk barang-barang yang hanya memiliki sedikit barang pengganti atau
                              barang pengganti yang tidak sempurna pada jangka pendek). Moderasi permintaan domestik
                              dapat berperan dalam menurunkan tekanan neraca pembayaran, sehingga komunikasi dan
                              koordinasi kebijakan menjadi hal yang sangat penting, terutama dalam kaitannya dengan
                              peningkatan intensitas siklus politis, seperti dibahas lebih lanjut pada Bagian 7.

                                sebesar 8,6 persen hanya pada tanggal 19-20 Agustus saja. Setelah gejolak yang menyusul
                                (dengan peningkatan yang mengikuti penundaan “pemotongan stimulus AS” dan dibantu
                                dengan sejumlah besar pembelian kembali saham-saham perusahaan, dan diikuti oleh
                                perlemahan baru pada akhir bulan September), indeks menutup triwulan itu dengan
                                penurunan sebesar 10,4 persen, yang belum berubah hingga saat ini (mencerminkan kuatnya
                                peningkatan yang dicatat oleh indeks hingga bulan Mei). Investor asing menjadi penjual

                                saham selama triwulan tersebut. Sementara itu imbal hasil (yield) obligasi negara lima tahunan
                                dalam mata uang Rupiah meningkat sebesar 180 basis poin dari permulaan triwulan hingga
                                mencapai 8,24 persen pada tanggal 11 September, sebelum turun 40 basis poin pada akhir
                                triwulan itu menjadi 7,85 persen. Melihat pada gejolak harga-harga aset keuangan, tren yang
                                paling jelas pada sektor keuangan adalah depresiasi Rupiah dan pengetatan kondisi

Rupiah terus                    Mengikuti pergerakan yang tiba-tiba pada pertengahan hingga akhir bulan Agustus, Rupiah
terdepresiasi dan               terus mengalami depresiasi pada bulan September, turun menjadi Rp 11.593 per dolar AS

likuiditas dolar di             tahun 2012, ke tingkatan paling rendahnya sejak awal tahun 2009. Namun walau dengan
dalam negeri                    depresiasi nominal Rupiah yang cukup besar antara bulan Mei dan Agustus, nilai tukar efektif
                                riil (rata-rata tertimbang perdagangan) Indonesia per bulan Agustus hanya turun sebesar 4
                                persen dari rata-ratanya pada tahun 2010 (Gambar 17), yang mencerminkan penurunan
                                nominal terhadap dolar AS dari valuta-valuta sejumlah mitra perdagangan utama Indonesia
                                dan peningkatan inflasi dalam negeri. Penyesuaian nominal itu telah membentuk tantangan
                                bagi pasar valuta, dan bagi para perusahaan yang mengelola kewajiban eksternal. Likuiditas
                                dolar mengetat secara signifikan sejak awal bulan Juli, dan sekali lagi pada pertengahan
                                hingga akhir bulan Agustus (Gambar 18). Bank Indonesia telah mengelola laju penyesuaian
                                dalam Rupiah, dengan cadangan devisa menyusut menjadi 93 miliar dolar AS pada akhir
                                bulan Agustus 2013, setara dengan impor dan kebutuhan pembayaran hutang pemerintah
                                selama lima bulan. Nilai itu juga lebih rendah dari cadangan devisa yang tercatat pada akhir

                          lanjutan tingkat bunga sebesar 50 basis poin pada bulan Juli. Tingkatan itu tidak diubah pada

                          yang baru diumumkan. Setelah laporan statistik neraca pembayaran yang melemah untuk

                          kembali ditingkatkan sebesar 50 basis poin pada saat rapat kebijakan luar biasa yang diadakan

                          tanggal 12 September. Dengan demikian, BI telah meningkatkan suku bunga FASBI dan BI
                          Rate sebesar 150 basis poin sejak bulan Juni (masing-masing menjadi 5,5 dan 7,25 persen)

                          menjadi 4 persen (dari 2,5 persen) per bulan Desember. BI juga telah mengambil sejumlah
                          langkah-langkah fasilitasi manajemen likuiditas: memperkenankan obligasi pemerintah dan
                          Sertifikat BI untuk dihitung sebagai syarat giro wajib sekunder, dan memperkenalkan masa

secara agregat tetap      yang sebagian mencerminkan tingginya inflasi sementara yang disebabkan oleh peningkatan

                          umum pada 22 persen yoy sampai dengan Juli, naik tipis dari 21 persen di bulan Juni, dengan
                          pertumbuhan pinjaman investasi stabil di 34 persen pada bulan Juli, naik dari 23 persen pada
                          bulan Mei. Pertumbuhan kredit modal kerja turun menjadi 19 persen yoy pada bulan Juli, dari
                          sekitar 24 persen yoy di awal tahun 2013, dan pertumbuhan kredit konsumsi relatif stabil pada
                          20 persen yoy. Indikator agregat sektor perbankan tetap stabil, sementara kredit macet tetap
                          berada di bawah 2 persen, sementara tingkat keuntungan bank-bank Indonesia masih cukup
                          tinggi. Namun demikian, diluar catatan-catatan kinerja yang terjadi sekarang, sektor

                    5. Inflasi telah meningkat karena kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi
Inflasi IHK yoy              Pergerakan inflasi selama kuartal ketiga didominasi oleh pengaruh reformasi subsidi BBM
meningkat ke 8 persen        (Bahan Bakar Minyak) dan dampak musiman bulan Ramadhan. Keputusan Pemerintah
pada awal kuartal            menaikkan harga solar bersubsidi sebesar Rp 1.000 per liter dan harga bensin sebesar Rp
ketiga karena kenaikan       2.000 per liter memicu lonjakan tajam inflasi IHK (headline), mendorong inflasi yoy naik
harga BBM dan bahan          untuk empat kuartal berikutnya. Namun inflasi bulan-ke-bulan diperkirakan akan kembali
pangan                       stabil dalam jangka pendek, seperti pada reformasi harga BBM yang lalu, dengan peningkatan
                             suku bunga Bank Indonesia (yang baru diumumkan) dan pengetatan kondisi kredit yang
                             sedang berlangsung akan membantu mengurangi dampak putaran kedua serta harapan inflasi
                             (expected inflation). Gabungan dari pengaruh pembatasan perdagangan yang diluncurkan pada
                             bulan Oktober 2012 dan peningkatan permintaan selama masa Lebaran mendorong
                             peningkatan inflasi harga bahan pangan, terutama pada harga cabai, bawang merah dan
                             bawang putih. Sebagian dampak pembatasan perdagangan tersebut telah berkurang, dan
                             harga bahan pangan tampaknya mulai mengikuti tren menurun.

Kenaikan harga BBM           Kenaikan harga BBM diperkirakan menyumbang lebih dari setengah inflasi IHK bulan-ke-
bersubsidi                   bulan pada bulan Juli yang mencapai 3,3 persen (Gambar 22). Sebagai akibatnya inflasi IHK
diperkirakan                 meningkat hingga 8,6 persen yoy pada bulan Juli, dari 5,9 persen pada bulan Juni, dan kembali
berkontribusi hampir         merayap naik ke 8,8 persen pada bulan Agustus, sebelum menurun tipis ke 8,4 persen pada
setengah dari kenaikan       bulan September (Gambar 23). Harga-harga barang konsumsi inti telah sedikit meningkat
inflasi bulan-ke-bulan       menjadi 4,5 persen yoy pada bulan Agustus, dan 4,7 persen pada bulan September. Pada saat
pada bulan Juli…             kenaikan harga BBM yang lalu pada bulan Oktober 2005 dan Juni 2008, peningkatan harga
                             konsumsi inti kembali dengan cepat ke tingkat harga sebelumnya (Gambar 24). Namun
                             perubahan inflasi inti harus dipantau dengan jangka waktu yang lebih panjang, karena harga
                             BBM yang lebih tinggi dapat membawa pengaruh yang tertunda terhadap peningkatan harga
                             faktor produksi (input). Kenyataan bahwa harga BBM bersubsidi masih berada jauh di bawah
                             harga internasional juga berarti bahwa harga-harga yang tinggi saat ini sebetulnya sengaja
                             ditekan lewat pengaturan subsidi.

…sementara harga             Bersamaan dengan kenaikan harga BBM, harga-harga sejumlah bahan pangan juga
bahan pangan                 meningkat pada kuartal kedua tahun 2013, mengikuti pengumuman UU Pangan, yang
menyumbang                   ditetapkan pada bulan Oktober 2012 (Gambar 25). Sejumlah pembatasan perdagangan yang
tambahan sepertiga           berkaitan dengan UU Pangan telah diganti, termasuk kuota daging sapi yang diganti dengan
terhadap inflasi             tarif yang menyesuaikan dengan harga dalam negeri, untuk mendorong turunnya harga.
                             Namun bulan Ramadhan pada Juli-Agustus juga membawa pengaruh peningkatan harga
                             yang biasa terjadi. Kenaikan harga bahan pangan – beberapa bahkan meningkat hingga dua
                             sampai lima kali lipat dari harganya pada bulan Oktober 2012 – memberikan kontribusi
                             sebesar 1,1 poin persentase kepada inflasi bulan-ke-bulan (mom) pada bulan Juli. Harga
                             bahan-bahan pangan itu kini tampaknya berada pada jalur yang menurun, yang menunjukkan

Tekanan lebih lanjut        Depresiasi Rupiah yang akhir-akhir ini terjadi membawa risiko inflasi jangka pendek, melalui

Defisit fiskal hingga     Perlemahan yang terus terjadi dalam pertumbuhan PDB nominal, penurunan harga
bulan Agustus cukup       komoditas internasional, dan depresiasi nominal Rupiah, telah berdampak terhadap sektor
besar dibanding           fiskal Indonesia. Pada periode Januari-Agustus 2013, tercatat nilai defisit keseluruhan sebesar
periode yang sama         Rp 101 triliun, dibanding defisit sebesar Rp 35 triliun pada periode yang sama tahun lalu
pada tahun 2012…          (Tabel 4). Pertumbuhan penerimaan riil juga telah menurun, namun laju pencairan anggaran
                          secara keseluruhan menunjukkan sedikit perbaikan.
…karena penurunan         Delapan bulan pertama tahun 2013 mencatat moderasi pertumbuhan penerimaan yang luas,
penerimaan yang           yang mencapai 56 persen dari target untuk tahun 2013 selama periode Januari-Agustus.
bersifat luas …           Secara khusus, pajak pendapatan non-migas, yang merupakan sebagian besar pajak
                          pendapatan (sekitar 86 persen) dan hanya sedikit lebih rendah dari sepertiga jumlah
                          penerimaan, mencatat penurunan pertumbuhan yoy yang berarti (6 persen dibanding rata-rata
                          pertumbuhan sebesar 14 persen pada periode yang sama tahun 2010-2012). Pungutan pajak
                          pertambahan nilai (PPN) juga melemah (ke 13 persen dibanding rata-rata 22 persen pada
                          periode yang sama tahun 2010-2012). Pajak-pajak internasional, terutama bea ekspor,
                          mencatat kontraksi sebesar 13 persen yoy, disebabkan menurunnya harga komoditas yang
                          juga mempengaruhi penerimaan bukan pajak, baik dari migas dan sektor sumber daya
                          lainnya. Secara keseluruhan penerimaan bukan pajak pada delapan bulan pertama tahun 2013
                          hanya meningkat sebesar 3 persen yoy dibanding rata-rata sebesar 19 persen pada periode
                          yang sama pada tahun 2010-2012.
…sementara kinerja        Pada akhir bulan Agustus sekitar Rp 946 triliun, atau 55 persen dari jumlah anggaran belanja
eksekusi anggaran         pada APBN-P 2013, telah dibelanjakan, sedikit di atas tingkat pengeluaran pada periode yang
mencatat sedikit          sama pada tahun 2012 sebesar 54 persen pada tahun 2012. Pertumbuhan belanja pada
perbaikan…                delapan bulan pertama tahun 2013 mencapai 14 persen yoy, turun dari 23 persen pada tahun
                          2012. Pengeluaran subsidi energi tercatat sedikit di atas 30 persen dari total belanja tidak
                          termasuk transfer, mencapai 65 persen dari alokasi APBN-P 2013. Belanja modal tampaknya
                          mulai membaik, dengan bertumbuh sebesar 18 persen dibanding periode yang sama tahun
                          lalu. Namun pencairan belanja masih tetap condong ke akhir tahun, dengan hanya 32 persen
                          pencairan dalam delapan bulan pertama, walau tingkat itu sudah merupakan peningkatan dari
                          pencairan sebesar 29 persen pada delapan bulan pertama tahun 2012.

…dan sejumlah aturan        Untuk mengatasi sejumlah kendala pelaksanaan anggaran, Pemerintah telah mengambil

telah diluncurkan           baru (PP 45/2013) diterbitkan untuk menghapuskan syarat penunjukan kembali pejabat
untuk mengatasi             satuan kerja (satker) setiap tahun. Aturan ini memungkinkan para satker untuk mulai bekerja
tantangan pelaksanaan       pada awal tahun fiskal, sehingga mempercepat pencairan belanja; memperkenalkan
anggaran                    pengendalian komitmen yang, bersama-sama manfaat lain, akan membantu Kementerian
                            Keuangan dalam memantau jumlah dana yang dialokasikan oleh kementerian negara dan
                            mengambil tindakan dini bila terdapat penundaan dalam pelaksanaan; memungkinkan
                            pengadaan dini sebelum tahun fiskal dimulai, sehingga kontrak dapat ditandatangani lebih
                            awal pada suatu tahun fiskal, dan memberikan dasar hukum bagi penerusan anggaran ke
                            tahun berikutnya untuk kegiatan-kegiatan prioritas nasional dan kontrak tahun jamak.

 miskin dan rentan. Tiga program lainnya termasuk perluasan bantuan langsung tunai yaitu Program Keluarga Harapan (PKH) dan beasiswa, Bantuan
 untuk Siswa Miskin (BSM), dan peningkatan sementara alokasi beras untuk rakyat miskin, Beras Miskin (Raskin). Menurut PT POS, 94 persen dari
 alokasi tahap pertama sebesar Rp 4,7 triliun telah dicairkan. Sisa 6 persen yang belum dicairkan umumnya disebabkan oleh kesulitan dalam
 menemukan penerima yang dituju. Tahap kedua, yang dimulai pada tanggal 2 September telah mencapai 94 persen dari alokasi (per tanggal 1
 Oktober), yang menunjukkan distribusi yang relatif lancar. Untuk memperbaiki ketidaktepatan dalam daftar penerima, Pemerintah telah meningkatkan
 fleksibilitas dengan memperkenankan masyarakat pada tingkat desa untuk memeriksa dan mengubah daftar penerima bantuan melalui musyawarah
 kelurahan atau desa (muskel/musdes).
 Beralih ke gambaran yang lebih besar tentang kemiskinan, pada tanggal 1 Juli, Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) mengumumkan tingkat kemiskinan nasional
 pada bulan Maret 2013 adalah 11,4 persen. Angka ini merupakan penurunan sebesar 0,6 poin persentase dari 12,0 persen pada bulan Maret 2012.
 Tingkat kemiskinan pedesaan (14,3 persen) tetap hampir mencapai dua kali tingkat kemiskinan perkotaan (8,4 persen), namun terus menyusut dengan
 cepat, dari masing-masing sebesar 15,1 persen dan 8,8 persen pada tahun yang lalu. Garis rata-rata kemiskinan nasional telah meningkat sebesar 9,2
 persen dari Rp 248.707 per orang per bulan menjadi Rp 271.626, di dorong oleh peningkatan harga bahan pangan dan bukan pangan, lintas daerah
 perkotaan dan pedesaan. Variasi kemiskinan antar daerah sangat tinggi, misalnya tingkat kemiskinan di Maluku dan Papua pada 24,0 persen, adalah
 dua kali rata-rata nasional, sementara Kalimantan memiliki tingkat kemiskinan paling rendah 6,4 persen, atau sekitar setengah dari rata-rata nasional.
 Penurunan tingkat kemiskinan sebesar 0,6 poin persentase tahun ini kira-kira setara dengan penurunan sebesar 0,5 persen pada 2011 dan 2012.
 Penurunan ini meneruskan tren perlambatan laju penurunan kemiskinan pada beberapa tahun terakhir, dengan dua tahun terakhir mencatat
 penurunan yang paling kecil secara poin persentase dalam satu dekade, dengan pengecualian terjadinya peningkatan kemiskinan pada tahun 2006
 karena gejolak harga bahan pangan dunia. Seperti dibahas pada Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret 2013, perlambatan penurunan kemiskinan bukan tidak
 diperkirakan dengan kemiskinan mendekati 10 persen, karena penduduk miskin yang tersisa terletak semakin jauh di bawah garis kemiskinan, sehingga
 membutuhkan pertumbuhan konsumsi yang lebih cepat untuk menjaga laju pengentasan kemiskinan yang sama seperti diukur oleh tingkat kemiskinan
 yang resmi. Secara umum, tren ini, bersama-sama dengan perlambatan pertumbuhan ekonomi yang diproyeksikan untuk 2014 dan peningkatan inflasi,
 akan membatasi perkiraan pengentasan kemiskinan tahun 2014. Namun pencairan BLSM pada paruh kedua tahun 2013 tampaknya akan memitigasi
 tekanan naik pada tingkat kemiskinan. Sebagai akibatnya, kemungkinan pencapaian sasaran RPJM Pemerintah dalam mengentaskan kemiskinan
 menjadi 8 hingga 10 persen pada 2014 menjadi tidak jelas. Namun perluasan program jaring pengaman sosial jangka panjang yang sedang berlangsung
 – terutama BSM dan PKH – merupakan strategi yang penting untuk mempercepat laju pengentasan kemiskinan setelah 2014.

Bank Dunia                        Memperhitungkan realisasi selama periode Januari-Agustus, penurunan harga komoditas,

sebesar 2,5 persen dari           edisi bulan Juli (2,1 persen dari PDB) ke Rp 226 triliun (2,5 persen dari PDB) (Tabel 5).
PDB pada 2013 dan 2,3             Proyeksi penerimaan telah diturunkan sebesar 1,0 persen, dan proyeksi jumlah belanja
persen dari PDB pada              direvisi naik sebesar 1,4 persen (sebagian besar karena peningkatan proyeksi belanja subsidi
2014                              energi, walau harga BBM bersubsidi telah dinaikan pada bulan Juni, lihat Kotak 2). Untuk
                                  tahun 2014, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan defisit APBN sebesar 2,3 persen dari PDB, walau
                                  banyak hal jelas akan bergantung dari APBN 2014 yang akan disahkan DPR.

DPR                               persen dari PDB, namun Menteri Keuangan mengumumkan bahwa perkiraan terakhir defisit
                                  tahun 2014 dapat mencapai 2,02 persen dari PDB.7

                               sebesar 19 persen dibanding APBN-P 2013, yang mencerminkan reformasi birokrasi yang
                               masih berlangsung, dan peningkatan dalam gaji dasar dan pembayaran pensiun masing-
                               masing sebesar 6 persen dan 4 persen. Pemerintah menerapkan kebijakan anggaran mendatar
                               bagi belanja barang (flat policy), terutama bagi pengeluaran-pengeluaran yang berkaitan dengan
                               operasi, rapat-rapat dan perjalanan dinas. Belanja modal diusulkan akan meningkat sebesar 7
                               persen, menyiratkan peningkatan yang tidak begitu besar secara riil setelah pertumbuhan
                               belanja modal riil yang sangat kuat selama beberapa tahun yang lalu, walau memang dimulai
                               dari tingkat dasar yang rendah. RAPBN juga memperkirakan penerapan kebijakan-kebijakan

Depresiasi Rupiah              Depresiasi Rupiah sampai bulan September memberikan tekanan naik terhadap sejumlah
telah memperbaharui            pengeluaran pemerintah, terutama pengeluaran subsidi BBM (lihat Kotak 2). Dengan
tekanan terhadap               melemahnya Rupiah, belanja subsidi BBM bagi 2013 tampaknya akan meningkat sebesar Rp
meningkatnya biaya             21 triliun dibanding proyeksi pada Triwulanan bulan Juli. Karenanya, pada skenario dasar
subsidi                        (baseline), proyeksi penghematan bersih tahun 2013 (termasuk belanja untuk BLSM dan
                               program-program kompensasi) dari kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni 2013
                               sebesar Rp 13,1 triliun akan hilang, walau biaya subsidi lebih tinggi tanpa penyesuaian harga
                               ini. Perkembangan ini menyoroti risiko fiskal dari sistem subsidi tetap yang berlaku sekarang,
                               disesuaikan secara ad hoc berkala, terhadap perubahan kurs tukar atau harga minyak.

                                  Perkembangan ini juga menekankan urgensi dan pentingnya terus melanjutkan reformasi
                                  subsidi energi, seperti bergerak ke pendekatan yang lebih berdasar aturan, untuk membuat
                                  kemajuan berkelanjutan dalam meningkatkan kualitas belanja publik.

Kotak 2: Dampak fiskal dari perubahan kurs tukar Rupiah dan harga minyak
 Simulasi dapat dilakukan untuk melihat risiko langsung terhadap defisit anggaran yang berasal dari perubahan kurs tukar dan harga minyak
 internasional. Sebagai contoh, depresiasi Rupiah sebesar 10 persen terhadap dolar AS dibanding asumsi dasar (base case) Bank Dunia diperkirakan akan
 membawa pengaruh langsung pada peningkatan defisit fiskal sekitar 0,7 poin persentase dari PDB pada tahun 2013 dan 2014, masing-masing menjadi
 3,2 persen dan 3,0 persen. Hal ini jelas mengasumsikan bahwa tidak ada penyesuaian dalam tingkat belanja sebagai tanggapannya, suatu hal yang
 sangat mungkin terjadi dengan adanya aturan pembatasan defisit PDB nasional sebesar 3 persen. Kenaikan harga minyak mentah sebesar 10 persen
 dibanding kondisi dasar (baseline) diproyeksikan akan menambah sekitar 0,4 poin persentase dari PDB terhadap defisit fiskal baseline.
 Perkiraan kepekaan defisit fiskal yang cukup besar terhadap kurs tukar dan harga minyak mentah umumnya berasal dari sisi belanja, terutama karena
 peningkatan dalam biaya subsidi energi, transfer ke daerah dari bagi hasil migas, dan peningkatan belanja untuk pendidikan (dengan mandat bahwa
 belanja pendidikan harus merupakan 20 persen dari jumlah belanja). Walau dampak terhadap penerimaan tidaklah sebesar dampak terhadap belanja,
 proyeksi penerimaan nominal turut menerima dampak negatif; perubahan dalam kurs tukar mempengaruhi pungutan bea cukai dan PPN (bea impor
 maupun ekspor), sementara perubahan harga minyak mempengaruhi penerimaan melalui pajak pendapatan dari migas, PPN (melalui sensitivitas impor
 terhadap perubahan harga minyak, dan melalui peningkatan harga dan dampak perubahannya pada konsumsi swasta), bea cukai (bea ekspor maupun
 impor) dan penerimaan bukan pajak dari sumber-sumber daya alam.
 Hasil-hasil simulasi ini harus digunakan sebagai indikasi saja. Secara khusus mereka menekankan kepada dampak fiskal langsung tahap pertama dan
 tidak termasuk dampak tidak langsung melalui pengaruh ekonomi yang lebih luas dari kejutan itu. Selain itu, mereka membutuhkan sejumlah asumsi
 (karena ketebatasan data dan statistika), dan tidak memperhitungkan fungsi reaksi kebijakan terhadap kejutan tersebut, seperti misalnya pemotongan
 belanja lain atau kemajuan pelaksanaan reformasi-reformasi fiskal lainnya.

                    7. Penetapan kebijakan dan kemajuan reformasi yang berjalan dapat
                       memainkan peran penting sejalan dengan penyesuaian neraca eksternal
Perkembangan-             Dalam skenario dasar, laju pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia diperkirakan akan mengalami
perkembangan neraca       perlambatan dan kemudian stabil pada tingkat yang masih kokoh namun lebih sesuai dengan
eksternal membawa         defisit neraca berjalan yang lebih bekelanjutan di bawah kondisi likuiditas dunia yang lebih
risiko jangka pendek      ketat. Perkembangan ekonomi dan penetapan kebijakan, khususnya melambatnya
terbesar terhadap         pertumbuhan permintaan dalam negeri, peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi bulan Juni,
pertumbuhan…              pengetatan kebijakan moneter setelahnya, dan berlanjutnya depresiasi Rupiah, seluruhnya
                          bersifat kondusif dalam menjaga stabilitas makroekonomi, prasyarat bagi pertumbuhan dan
                          pembangunan. Risiko utama terhadap skenario dasar (baseline) ini adalah dengan
                          berlangsungnya penyesuaian, dan diproyeksikan berlanjut, meningkatnya tekanan
                          pembiayaan eksternal yang signifikan, misalnya karena perlemahan lebih lanjut yang
                          signifikan dalam harga komoditas ekspor utama atau dinamika investasi masuk bersih. Hal
                          itu akan membutuhkan penyesuaian yang lebih cepat melalui depresiasi lanjutan Rupiah yang
                          signifikan, sehingga memberi tekanan pada cadangan devisa, dan membutuhkan pengetatan
                          kebijakan moneter untuk menstabilisasikan neraca eksternal Indonesia, yang menurunkan
                          tingkat kepercayaan dan semakin menurunkan pertumbuhan (lihat Kotak 3 untuk
                          pembahasan tentang sensitivitas pertumbuhan melalui dampak investasi).

…yang menekankan          Pengaturan kebijakan fiskal dan moneter Indonesia akan terus memegang peran penting
pentingnya                dalam memfasilitasi penyesuaian yang kini berlangsung dan dalam meminimalkan risiko-
keberlanjutan             risiko terkait. Namun terdapat trade-off antara tujuan membatasi inflasi, mendukung
fleksibilitas kebijakan   pertumbuhan dan menyesuaikan defisit neraca berjalan kepada kondisi pendanaan yang lebih
makroekonomi untuk        ketat. Kebijakan moneter menghadapi tantangan dalam menyesuaikan suku bunga dan nilai
memfasilitasi             tukar valuta sehingga dapat memberi perlindungan terhadap tekanan inflasi dengan
penyesuaian jangka        meningkatnya tekanan biaya (seperti yang berasal dari pengaruh lemahnya mata uang atau
pendek…                   kenaikan upah) sementara memfasilitasi perbaikan neraca eksternal, dan tanpa terlalu
                          menghambat pertumbuhan ekonomi dan melemahkan neraca pemerintah dan swasta.
                          Dengan pembahasan RAPBN 2014 yang sedang dilakukan oleh DPR, kebijakan fiskal
                          menghadapi tantangan lemahnya pertumbuhan penerimaan dan peningkatan biaya
                          pendanaan-hutang, yang meningkatkan pentingnya memperbaiki kualitas belanja dan
                          mobilisasi penerimaan. Menjaga posisi fiskal yang berhati-hati secara keseluruhan,
                          berkoordinasi dengan pengetatan kebijakan moneter, dapat membantu menjawab tantangan
                          itu. Bertolak dari kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni, upaya reformasi lanjutan
                          terhadap sistem subsidi energi yang tidak efisien dan distortif saat ini dapat membantu
                          membebaskan belanja bagi pengeluaran pembangunan utama seperti infrastruktur dan
                          kesehatan, dan juga membatasi risiko fiskal terhadap gejolak kurs tukar valuta atau kejutan
                          harga minyak dunia.

…menurunkan               Adanya ketidakpastian yang berasal dari perlambatan momentum pertumbuhan, dan kondisi
ketidakpastian melalui    pendanaan eksternal yang rentan namun umumnya mengetat, menjaga komunikasi yang jelas
komunikasi dan            terhadap perubahan kebijakan dan penekanan yang kuat terhadap implementasinya dapat
perencanaan keadaan       membantu mendorong tingkat kepercayaan. Kebijakan juga memainkan peran dalam
darurat…                  memitigasi dampak negatif berbagai skenario, termasuk jika risiko-risiko terburuk terjadi.
                          Pemerintah telah melakukan berbagai upaya untuk meningkatkan persiapan menghadapi
                          krisis dalam beberapa tahun terakhir. Mekanisme koordinasi pemantauan dan tanggapan
                          telah dibentuk untuk mendukung tanggapan yang fleksibel terhadap dampak dislokasi pasar.
                          Pemerintah memiliki fasilitas pembiayaan fiskal darurat dengan jumlah sekitar 5 miliar dolar
                          AS yang dapat digunakan dalam hal terjadi penurunan yang signifikan dalam kondisi
                          pendanaan, sementara Bank Indonesia telah berupaya untuk mendapatkan tambahan jalur
                          pertukaran (swap) bilateral tambahan dalam dolar AS.

…dan terus                Tekanan yang belakangan terjadi terhadap neraca eksternal dan pertumbuhan menjadi
mendorong kemajuan        pengingat akan perlunya upaya lanjutan dalam meningkatkan diversifikasi ekspor dan dalam
reformasi untuk           meningkatkan daya saing ekonomi untuk mendorong laju pertumbuhan dan pembangunan

harga komoditas dunia, kurs tukar valuta, kondisi pendanaan luar
negeri, dan kondisi kredit dalam negeri. Sebagai contoh, pengetatan           4.5
lebih lanjut dalam kebijakan moneter dalam negeri akan menghambat
pertumbuhan investasi, sejalan dengan temuan IMF (2012) bahwa
peningkatan suku bunga riil sebesar 1 persen akan menyebabkan                 4.0
penurunan sebesar 0,2 persen dalam pertumbuhan investasi. Namun
analisis ini juga menemukan bahwa sebetulnya faktor yang memiliki
dampak paling signifikan terhadap investasi di Indonesia adalah gejolak
pada suku bunga jangka pendek, diikuti dengan gejolak kurs tukar          Catatan: Lintasan “tinggi” dan “rendah” mengasumsikan
valuta. Sebagai akibatnya, keberlanjutan gejolak pasar valuta dan         pertumbuhan investasi adalah 1 poin persentase lebih tinggi dan
keuangan yang belakangan terjadi memiliki potensi untuk membebani         lebih rendah dari baseline 2014. Skenario “sangat rendah”
investasi secara lebih signifikan. Penurunan lebih lanjut pada harga-     mengasumsikan bahwa investasi akan berada 2 poin persentase
harga komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia, yang mendorong penurunan          lebih rendah dari baseline 2014, perlambatan yang setara dengan
lebih lanjut dalam kondisi perdagangan Indonesia, dan kemungkinan         yang tercatat pada krisis keuangan tahun 2008/9
tanggapan kebijakan yang terpicu oleh perkembangan yang buruk pada        Sumber: BPS; proyeksi staf Bank Dunia
neraca luar negeri, juga akan menurunkan profitabilitas dan laba
ditahan, dan biaya dan ketersediaan pendanaan investasi.
Prospek pertumbuhan PDB tahun 2014 peka terhadap lintasan investasi (Gambar 27). Deviasi sebesar 1 poin persentase dalam pertumbuhan investasi
dari proyeksi dasar (baseline) tahun 2014 akan berakibat pada deviasi pertumbuhan PDB sebesar sekitar 0,3 poin persentase pada tahun 2014,
membawa pertumbuhan tahunan ke kisaran 5,6 persen (naik dari pertumbuhan baseline sebesar 5,3 persen), atau turun mendekati 5,0 persen. Dalam
skenario yang lebih buruk, dengan investasi melemah seperti yang terjadi pada waktu krisis keuangan dunia (sekitar 2 poin persentase lebih rendah dari
baseline), maka pertumbuhan PDB untuk tahun 2014 akan lebih rendah sekitar 0,6 poin persentase, pada kisaran 4,7 persen (Gambar 27).

                    1. Paket kebijakan Pemerintah yang diumumkan pada bulan Agustus
Menanggapi tekanan        Seperti dibahas pada Bagian A, tekanan pasar keuangan Indonesia meningkat pada
pasar, Pemerintah         pertengahan bulan Agustus, setelah pengumuman statistik neraca pembayaran triwulan
mengumumkan suatu         kedua yang menunjukkan defisit neraca berjalan yang lebih besar dari perkiraan, bersamaan
paket kebijakan pada      penurunan minat investor terhadap aset-aset pasar berkembang di seluruh dunia. Sebagai
bulan Agustus …           tanggapan, Pemerintah Indonesia mengumumkan suatu paket kebijakan (“paket”) pada
                          tanggal 23 Agustus, agar bisa menanggapi ketidakseimbangan eksternal Indonesia, dengan
                          mendorong ekspor dan membatasi impor, mempromosikan investasi untuk meningkatkan
                          kapasitas pada sisi penyediaan dan menaikkan produktivitas, serta menyediakan peluang
                          kerja selama kemungkinan melambatnya laju pertumbuhan ekonomi dalam jangka pendek.
                          Bagian ini memberikan tinjauan singkat tentang aturan-aturan yang telah diumumkan.
                          Sementara itu ringkasan akan tanggapan kebijakan diumumkan oleh Bank Indonesia dan
                          OJK disediakan dalam pembahasan bagian A.

… yang bertujuan          Paket kebijakan itu berfokus pada stabilisasi ekonomi dan perbaikan struktural dan berisi
untuk stabilisasi dan     empat pilar. Pertama, mendukung penanaman modal asing secara langsung (FDI) melalui
perbaikan struktural,     “penghilangan hambatan” proyek-proyek investasi strategis utama, menyederhanakan
yang disusun dalam        persyaratan perizinan, dan mempercepat revisi daftar negatif investasi. Kedua, aturan-aturan
empat pilar               itu hendak meningkatkan saldo neraca berjalan, dengan memberikan potongan pajak bagi
                          perusahaan-perusahaan berorientasi ekspor, meningkatkan bea masuk sejumlah barang
                          mewah, dan meningkatkan kapasitas biodiesel produksi dalam negeri ke dalam komposisi
                          BBM (untuk membantu mengurangi impor BBM). Ketiga, aturan-aturan itu bertujuan untuk
                          menjaga pertumbuhan ketenagakerjaan, termasuk potongan pajak bagi sektor-sektor padat
                          karya, pelonggaran sejumlah batasan pada kawasan-kawasan berikat, dan revisi terhadap
                          proses penetapan upah minimum. Keempat, aturan-aturan itu hendak menurunkan inflasi,
                          terutama dengan mengganti pembatasan impor dengan mekanisme berbasis harga untuk

                                                                               Perekonomian Indonesia

                      a.   Langkah-langkah untuk mendukung investasi asing langsung

Perubahan daftar        Implementasi awal dari aturan-aturan pendukung investasi memfokuskan pada percepatan
negatif investasi (DNI) revisi Daftar Negatif Investasi (DNI), yang menetapkan batasan bagi investasi asing pada
telah diumumkan…        bidang usaha di Indonesia. Revisi DNI telah dibahas oleh Pemerintah dan dibahas dengan
                        sektor swasta yang telah berlangsung sejak tahun 2013.

…yang mengikuti            Pemerintah telah mengumumkan bahwa revisi DNI akan mengikuti sejumlah prinsip-prinsip
sejumlah prinsip           pedoman. Pertama, DNI yang telah direvisi haruslah “ramah-investor”, sejauh
pedoman                    diperkenankan oleh UU yang ada (karena membatasi kewenangan Peraturan Presiden.
                           Sebagai contoh, UU Hortikultura membatasi kepemilikan asing di dalam usaha hortikultura
                           sampai 30 persen, batas yang akan disertakan ke dalam DNI yang baru). Kedua, perubahan-
                           perubahan DNI yang diusulkan oleh kementerian-kementerian yang memiliki efek
                           peningkatan pembatasan tidak akan diterima. Ketiga, klasifikasi industri akan
                           disederhanakan, dan peraturan pengawasan dari industri itu akan diselaraskan, untuk
                           mencegah duplikasi (misalnya, jika suatu sektor usaha kini diatur oleh dua kementerian, maka
                           harus dikurangi menjadi hanya satu kementerian, dengan peraturan yang paling tidak
                           mengikat yang akan berlaku). Prinsip-prinsip pemandu revisi DNI itu menunjukkan bahwa
                           DNI yang baru akan tetap membatasi kepemilikan asing yang berlaku, sesuai UU yang ada,
                           di sektor hortikultura, namun melonggarkan batas kepemilikan asing pada sejumlah kecil
                           bidang-bidang lain, terutama pariwisata, farmasi, industri dan transportasi.

Revisi DNI yang            DNI yang baru belum diumumkan atau diberlakukan, dan penundaan dalam finalisasi dan
“ramah–investor” akan      penerbitan DNI baru ini seharusnya dihindari, karena sebetulnya DNI yang baru itu akan
membantu                   memberikan kepastian tambahan terhadap batas kepemilikan asing di berbagai bidang.
mengurangi                 Secara umum, penekanan pada pedoman-pedoman untuk percepatan perubahan mendorong
ketidakpastian             kerangka investasi asing yang lebih terbuka. Secara prinsip, hal ini akan bersifat positif bagi
peraturan, walau masih     investasi asing. Selain perubahan DNI, masih terdapat ruang peningkatan bagi keseluruhan
ada tantangan yang         lingkungan peraturan perundangan untuk investasi asing. Prosedur perubahan yang lebih
besar, baik dalam          jelas bagi pembatasan investasi dan strategi komunikasi akan dapat membantu meningkatkan
strategi Pemerintah        kejelasan dan transparansi kebijakan tersebut. Selain itu, memastikan bahwa DNI akan
yang lebih luas…           menjadi daftar tunggal pembatasan investasi yang lengkap merupakan hal yang dibutuhkan,
                           karena sebelumnya DNI telah digantikan oleh aturan-aturan pembatasan investasi yang baru
                           yang diperkenalkan lewat UU sektoral, seperti UU untuk hortikultura dan pos, yang
                           menambah kerumitan dalam lingkungan peraturan perundangan.

…dan birokrasi             Langkah-langkah tambahan juga diambil untuk menyederhanakan birokrasi, dengan
investasi, dengan          meningkatkan efektivitas Pelayanan Terpadu Satu Pintu di Bidang Penanaman Modal
upaya untuk                (PTSP), dan memangkas jenis-jenis perizinan yang terkait dengan kegiatan investasi. Sebagai
menyederhanakan            langkah awal, Pemerintah akan menekankan terhadap penyederhanaan perizinan sektor yang
perizinan sedang           penting secara strategis, yaitu sektor minyak dan gas bumi (migas), dengan memangkas jenis
berjalan…                  perizinan investasi migas dari enam puluh sembilan yang ada sekarang menjadi delapan
                           kelompok perizinan. Kementerian Koordinator Perekonomian dan Unit Kerja Presiden
                           Bidang Pengawasan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan (UKP4) bekerja sama dalam
                           penyusunan rencana aksi untuk menerapkan upaya reformasi itu dalam waktu satu tahun.

…yang dapat                Penekanan terhadap penyederhanaan sistem perizinan investasi merupakan langkah yang
disertakan ke dalam        patut disambut, karena sistem yang ada sangatlah rumit, yang seringkali memaksa para
rencana reformasi          investor untuk memperoleh izin-izin dan otorisasi dari berbagai kementerian dan lembaga
lintas sektor yang lebih   negara. Namun dibanding mengambil pendekatan khusus (ad hoc) penyederhanaan perizinan
luas bagi lingkungan       bagi tiap sektor – dimulai dengan migas – pada akhirnya mungkin lebih efisien untuk
peraturan                  merencanakan, mengkomunikasikan dan melaksanakan persyaratan perizinan dan perubahan
perundangan                proses pada konteks rencana reformasi yang lebih besar, untuk meningkatkan lingkungan
                           peraturan bagi usaha di seluruh sektor (termasuk sektor yang memiliki investor dengan
                           ukuran yang lebih kecil dibanding sektor migas, yang melihat peraturan yang rumit sebagai
                           kendala yang lebih besar dibanding perusahaan besar pada industri migas).

                                                                               Perekonomian Indonesia

                      b. Langkah-langkah memperbaiki defisit neraca berjalan dan menjaga stabilitas
                         Rupiah

Langkah-langkah            Tekanan terhadap neraca berjalan datang dari gabungan antara perlemahan penerimaan
dalam bidang               ekspor dan kuatnya permintaan impor, seperti dibahas pada Bagian A. Paket ini bertujuan,
perdagangan terfokus       pertama, untuk mendukung ekspor dengan memberikan potongan pajak bagi sektor padat
untuk mendukung            karya (tekstil, alas kaki, perabotan, mainan anak dan panganan), dengan penurunan pajak
ekspor…                    pendapatan perusahaan sebesar 25-50 persen dari jumlah penghasilan terutang, bergantung
                           pada tingkat orientasi ekspornya. Potongan pajak itu bersifat sementara, berlaku untuk sisa
                           tahun pajak dari waktu berlakunya peraturan pelaksana (yaitu dari September hingga
                           Desember 2013), dan juga memperkenankan penundaan pembayaran pajak tanpa denda
                           hingga tiga bulan. Insentif seperti ini sulit untuk menilai dampak ex ante, dan pelaksanaan dan
                           biaya fiskal sebaiknya se transparan mungkin. Kedua, paket bertujuan mendorong ekspor
                           mineral dengan memperkenankan para eksportir yang memperoleh persetujuan untuk
                           menyerahkan revisi recana kerja tahunan demi meningkatkan volume ekspornya untuk tahun
                           2013. Dalam press release tanggal 29 Agustus, Wakil Menteri Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral
                           menekankan bahwa peraturan-peraturan di dalam paket itu hanya berlaku hingga bulan
                           Januari 2014. Pembatasan ekspor bijih mineral mentah (mulai berlaku pada bulan Januari
                           2014) tampaknya masih akan tetap dilaksanakan sesuai jadwal semula.

…dan menurunkan            Langkah-langkah untuk mengurangi permintaan impor terpusat pada impor BBM dan
jenis-jenis impor          barang mewah. Pertama, syarat penggunaan biodiesel sebagai bagian dari keseluruhan bahan
tertentu                   bakar meningkat, dengan tujuan untuk mengurangi kebergantungan terhadap bahan bakar
                           solar yang berasal dari fosil. Peraturan ini bersifat jangka panjang, dengan peraturan
                           pelaksanaan yang menetapkan bahwa peningkatan porsi biodiesel tahunan di dalam
                           gabungan bahan bakar akan terus berlangsung hingga tahun 2025, disesuaikan dengan
                           kelompok penggunanya. Tantangan pelaksanaan aturan ini, dan dampak yang lebih luas dari
                           kebijakan tersebut akan sangat penting untuk bisa diakses, misalnya di sektor lingkungan dan
                           pertanian. Kalau masih kurang yakin seberapa cepatnya peraturan ini bisa dilaksanakan atau
                           dampak terbesar apa yang diperoleh terhadap defisit neraca berjalan, karena mempunyai
                           potensi mendorong substitusi dari ekspor minyak kelapa sawit. Kedua, pajak barang mewah
                           tertentu, seperti impor mobil mewah dan barang-barang konsumsi bermerek dengan harga
                           yang tinggi, meningkat sebesar 25-50 persen. Peraturan ini, walau simbolis, tampaknya tidak
                           akan membawa dampak material terhadap keseluruhan permintaan impor, karena barang-
                           barang konsumsi yang termasuk dalam kelompok itu hanya memiliki porsi yang kecil (kurang
                           dari 10 persen) dari keseluruhan impor. Sebagai bagian dari peraturan pelaksananya, pajak-
                           pajak untuk sejumlah kelompok barang juga diturunkan, yang dapat sedikit mengimbangi
                           dampak keseluruhan dari peraturan itu terhadap permintaan barang-barang impor.

                      c.   Langkah-langkah untuk mendukung ketenagakerjaan

Fokus pada industri        Selain potongan pajak bagi perusahaan-perusahaan padat karya seperti yang dibahas di atas,
padat karya pada           langkah-langkah pendukung ketenagakerjaan pada dasarnya terdiri dari dua bagian. Pertama,
kawasan-kawasan            peraturan yang berkaitan dengan kawasan berikat memperoleh pelonggaran, misalnya
berikat…                   memperkenankan perusahaan-perusahaan yang berada di kawasan itu untuk menjual lebih
                           banyak hasil produksinya ke dalam negeri (dinaikkan dari 25 menjadi 50 persen), dan dengan
                           penambahan penggunaan sub-kontrak. Kawasan berikat adalah tempat terpusatnya pabrik-
                           pabrik manufaktur ringan yang padat karya, dan mereka menerima insentif sebagai imbalan
                           melakukan ekspor atas sebagian besar hasil produksinya. Walaupun aturan-aturan yang
                           diumumkan sebagai bagian dari paket bulan Agustus dapat terbukti bersifat positif bagi
                           ketenagakerjaan, pengalaman internasional menunjukkan bahwa aturan-aturan yang
                           membuka pasar dalam negeri kepada perusahaan-perusahaan di kawasan berikat juga dapat
                           membawa tambahan biaya dan tantangan peraturan, dan mempengaruhi insentif. Sebagai
                           contoh, karena perusahaan-perusahaan dikenai persyaratan pajak yang berbeda terhadap
                           porsi-porsi bagian produksinya yang berlainan, hal ini memiliki potensi menurunkan insentif
                           bagi perusahaan-perusahaan itu untuk melakukan ekspor).

…dan pada penetapan      Kedua, perubahan yang diusulkan terhadap mekanisme untuk menetapkan Upah Minimum
upah minimum             Provinsi (UMP) untuk mencegah pemberhentian tenaga kerja yang disebabkan oleh kenaikan
                         upah minimum yang terlalu tinggi. Usulan reformasi ini menguraikan mekanisme bagi proses
                         penetapan upah minimum yang lebih pasti, sederhana dan adil, yang bertujuan untuk
                         mendukung pemilik perusahaan, pekerja dan pencari kerja, dengan mendorong penggunaan
                         proses penetapan upah yang lebih berdasarkan bukti dan tidak dipolitisasi, demi kenaikan
                         upah tahunan yang lebih pasti dan mudah diperkirakan, dan dengan memperkenalkan
                         peningkatan dalam struktur pemerintahan/tata kelola yang menurunkan lingkup pembuatan
                         keputusan secara diskresioner.9

Reformasi proses dan     Reformasi proses penetapan upah minimum merupakan hal yang rumit. Negosiasi dan
pelaksanaan negosiasi    persetujuan akhir dilakukan pada tingkat provinsi dan sektor (dan seringkali hingga ke
upah minimum             tingkat kabupaten dan sub-sektor), yang lebih menyulitkan komunikasi dan kepatuhan
bersifat rumit…          dengan penyesuaian yang berdasarkan rumus. Secara lebih umum, penjaminan kepatuhan
                         perusahaan dan pegawai dengan peraturan upah minimum (baik dengan revisi atau tidak)
                         bukanlah hal yang mudah, dan membutuhkan pemantauan dan koordinasi pada tingkat
                         pusat, antara Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan kementerian-kementerian terkait demi
                         implementasi yang efektif, dan juga antara pemerintah pusat dan daerah dan para pelaku
                         yang relevan (Pemerintah Kabupaten dan DPRD).

…namun dapat             Penyesuaian berdasar formula, jika diterapkan, akan membuat peningkatan upah minimum
membawa dampak           yang akan datang menjadi lebih pasti dan mudah diperkirakan, dan lebih erat mencerminkan
positif terhadap pasar   perkembangan pasar tenaga kerja, dengan penyesuaian yang lebih baik terhadap kejutan.
tenaga kerja             Peningkatan tata kelola dan penegakan kebijakan pemantauan yang lebih ketat juga akan
                         meningkatkan kepatuhan kepada sistem tersebut. Kalau diterapkan dengan benar, reformasi
                         ini memiliki potensi untuk meningkatkan kepastian, kesederhanaan dan transparansi dalam
                         penetapan upah minimum, mendukung keadilan dan menyeimbangkan tarik-menarik (trade
                         off) dalam penetapan upah minimum, yang merupakan faktor harga yang sangat penting bagi
                         banyak pekerja dan dunia usaha, baik secara langsung maupun tidak langsung melalui
                         dampaknya terhadap penetapan upah lintas ekonomi secara luas.

                     d. Langkah-langkah untuk menurunkan inflasi

Pembatasan kuantitatif   Penurunan pajak barang mewah bagi sejumlah produk, seperti yang disinggung di atas, dan
impor pada sejumlah      juga penghapusan PPN bagi buku-buku pelajaran dan keagamaan, akan menurunkan harga
bahan pangan             produk-produk tersebut, namun kecilnya porsi bagian mereka pada indeks harga konsumen
digantikan dengan        membatasi dampak aturan itu terhadap tingkat harga yang lebih umum. Sebaliknya,
mekanisme                pembatasan perdagangan yang ditetapkan pada tahun 2012 membawa dampak yang sangat
berdasarkan harga        besar terhadap inflasi bahan pangan pada paruh pertama tahun 2013, sebelum mulai turun
                         sebagian. Sebagai bagian dari paket kebijakan, langkah-langkah tambahan sedang diambil
                         untuk menggeser pembatasan jumlah impor ke pengelolaan selisih antara harga dalam dan
                         luar negeri untuk daging sapi dan produk-produk hortikultura, yang akan meningkatkan
                         transparansi dan agak menurunkan risiko peningkatan harga yang tajam karena kelangkaan
                         barang impor. Paska pengumuman paket kebijakan tersebut juga terdapat sejumlah langkah-
                         langkah tambahan untuk melonggarkan pembatasan perdagangan, terutama bagi kacang
                         kedelai, dengan penundaan izin impor dan penghapusan (sementara) dari tarif 5 persen.
                         Namun, dengan adanya tantangan-tantangan dalam koordinasi kebijakan lintas kelembagaan,
                         masih harus terus dilihat apakah posisi perubahan kebijakan impor produk-produk tersebut
                         dapat diterapkan secara efektif.

                      e.   Menilai paket kebijakan
Pencapaian tanggapan       Tidak ada paket kebijakan optimal yang sudah siap pakai dalam menanggapi memburuknya
kebijakan yang optimal     kondisi pasar dan pergeseran kondisi ekonomi. Sebaliknya, para pengambil kebijakan di
terhadap perubahan         Indonesia menghadapi tantangan yang rumit, walau terdapat sejumlah aspek-aspek yang
kondisi ekonomi, dan       serupa dengan negara-negara ekonomi berkembang lainnya, seperti Brasil dan India (yang
ketika menghadapi          mana kondisi pendanaan eksternalnya juga mengetat, dan pertumbuhan telah melambat).
pasar yang bergejolak,     Sementara terdapat banyak potensi kebijakan , jangan dilupakan bahwa terdapat biaya
merupakan hal yang         implementasi dan potensi trade off yang harus dipertimbangkan. Sebagai contoh, menjaga
rumit                      kuatnya pertumbuhan ketenagakerjaan dan upah merupakan tujuan yang diinginkan, namun
                           penerapan langkah-langkah untuk mendukung ketenagakerjaan yang memberi stimulasi ke
                           ekonomi dapat berlawanan dengan moderasi pada pertumbuhan permintaan secara
                           keseluruhan yang mungkin dibutuhkan untuk mengendalikan defisit neraca berjalan.
                           Intervensi kebijakan juga dapat merintangi penyesuaian-penyesuaian lainnya, seperti dalam
                           harga relatif utama, yang dapat membantu menjaga keseimbangan dalam dan luar negeri, dan
                           membawa tambahan ketidakpastian bagi lingkungan peraturan perundangan.

Paket kebijakan            Sejalan dengan tantangan-tantangan yang kini dihadapi oleh ekonomi Indonesia, kebijakan-
Pemerintah tampaknya       kebijakan yang diumumkan oleh Pemerintah tampaknya memiliki fokus yang kuat pada
memiliki dampak            tingkat mikro. Seperti biasanya, sifat dan pemilihan waktu implementasi aturan-aturan yang
positif yang luas          diumumkan itu sangatlah penting dalam menentukan tingkat efektivitasnya dalam
terhadap ekonomi dan       pencapaian sasaran-sasarannya. Misalnya, peraturan yang berhubungan dengan daftar negatif
dapat dibangun lebih       masih perlu diselesaikan kira-kira enam minggu setelah paket ini diumumkan. Paket
lanjut…                    kebijakan itu juga harus dievaluasi dari sudut pandang strategi Indonesia yang lebih luas

                           jangka menengah. Dalam konteks ini, paket kebijakan itu harus dilihat sebagai bagian dari
                           proses reformasi dan implementasi kebijakan yang berjalan, yang dapat dikembangkan lebih
                           lanjut.

                           sama dengan pendalaman dan perluasan kerangka perlindungan sosial. Selain itu, Pemerintah
                           dapat secara proaktif meningkatkan kesiapannya untuk menghadapi perlambatan
                           pertumbuhan dengan menempatkan mekanisme pemantauan dan tanggapan yang sistematis
                           untuk memberikan perlindungan sosial sesuai dengan sasaran dan secara efektif. Penting
                           untuk memastikan bahwa posisi fiskal seperti yang diuraikan dalam anggaran tahun 2014
                           masih dalam pembahasan, tetap berhati-hati dan terkoordinasi dengan kebijakan moneter.
                           Dorongan yang kuat pada pengaturan penerimaan dapat mendukung hal itu dengan
                           membatasi kebutuhan pendanaan hutang, mengkonsolidasikan penguatan dalam neraca

                           pelaksanaan anggaran dapat membantu mendukung pertumbuhan. Sementara beberapa
                           langkah tersebut tampak seperti langkah-langkah jangka panjang, mereka dapat membawa
                           dampak positif jangka pendek dengan memberi sinyal tentang arah kebijakan dan lintasan

                            Indonesia yang belakangan terjadi. Bagian ini mengamati salah satu kuncinya, yaitu
                            tantangan-tantangan praktis dalam meningkatkan konektivitas internasional Indonesia –
                            menurunkan waktu tinggal peti kemas (dwell time) pada pelabuhan peti kemas internasional
                            utama Indonesia, pelabuhan Tanjung Priok.

                            dengan seketika. Namun dalam jangka pendek maupun menengah, perusahaan-perusahaan
                            di Indonesia dapat memetik manfaat yang signifikan dari keterbukaan akses terhadap bahan
                            masukan (input) internasional yang berkualitas pada tingkat harga pasar dunia.

                            panjang, keterlibatan di dalam jaringan produksi global ini akan memfasilitasi transfer
                            teknologi, yang pada gilirannya akan mendorong peningkatan produktivitas dan
                            pertumbuhan, dan juga kepada peningkatan permintaan bagi input domestik.10 Dengan
                            demikian, penjaminan bahwa proses impor barang-barang dapat dilakukan seefisien mungkin
                            merupakan hal yang sangat penting bagi pembangunan jangka panjang Indonesia.

                     c.   Apa saja tantangan utamanya?

Keterlambatan utama       Bertentangan dengan persepsi yang umum akan buruknya kinerja bagian Perizinan
waktu tinggal peti        Kepabeanan dan penyalahgunaan fasilitas pelabuhan oleh para importir, penelitian terbaru
kemas banyak terjadi      menunjukkan bahwa secara rata-rata 58 persen waktu tinggal peti kemas dihabiskan pada
pada tahapan hulu…        tahapan hulu (pra-Bea Cukai) (Gambar 32). Walau terdapat banyak sumber perlambatan
                          pada sepanjang proses impor, penempatan fokus terhadap peningkatan efisiensi pada
                          komponen hulu dapat membawa dampak yang signifikan terhadap keseluruhan rata-rata
                          waktu tinggal peti kemas di Tanjung Priok. Sumber-sumber utama perlambatan pada
                          komponen hulu adalah ketidakefisienan dari sistem 24/7, keterlambatan dalam penyerahan
                          surat PIB, dan rendahnya kinerja sistem Indonesian National Single Window (INSW).

…yang terkait dengan Sementara pelabuhan umumnya beroperasi “24/7” (yaitu layanan pelabuhan, termasuk bea
kelemahan pada sistem cukai, bank, terminal, pengemudi truk, angkutan barang, broker pabean dan pergudangan,
24/7…                 beroperasi di luar jam kerja normal dan pada akhir pekan), pada kenyataannya
                      ketidaksesuaian waktu memperpanjang waktu tinggal peti kemas hulu. Tingginya persentase
                      kapal yang tiba pada hari Sabtu dan Minggu, mencapai rata-rata 38 persen dari jumlah peti
                      kemas yang tiba dalam satu minggu (Senin hingga Minggu). Sebagian besar perusahaan
                      pengangkut barang, pelayaran dan bank tidak beroperasi pada akhir pekan atau di luar jam
                      kerja, sehingga menunda penyerahan surat PIB hingga hari Senin berikutnya, dan
                      memperlambat dimulainya proses perizinan. Dengan demikian, walau jumlah peti kemas
                      yang tiba pada akhir pekan lebih tinggi dibanding hari-hari kerja biasa, jumlah penyerahan
                      PIB per hari lebih rendah pada hari-hari di akhir pekan (Gambar 33). Layanan kepabeanan
                      juga hanya tersedia bila diminta pada akhir pekan atau setelah jam kerja, yang menambahkan
                      jumlah langkah yang dibutuhkan bila importir hendak mengeluarkan barang pada akhir
                      pekan.

                                            yang telah disetujui terlebih dahulu). Bergantung pada jalur risiko yang diberikan, importir
                                            akan menerima perlakuan yang berbeda untuk pemberian izin Kepabeanan, yang

                                            khusus, MITA Prioritas, memiliki waktu tinggal peti kemas yang relatif singkat (rata-rata
                                            selama 4 hari) namun jalur ini hanya mencakup 16 persen dari seluruh jumlah peti kemas dan
                                            merupakan kelompok yang kecil dengan anggota sebanyak 105 importir. Importir dengan

mengatasi keadaan
                         Sistem i-CaRe (integrated cargo release) yang baru diluncurkan di Tanjung Priok untuk
                         mengintegrasikan seluruh layanan pada komponen hilir, bertujuan untuk menghapus
                         interaksi tatap muka antara pengemudi truk dan petugas Bea Cukai di pintu gerbang. Proyek
                         percontohan diluncurkan pada TPK Koja pada bulan November 2012 dan juga dipadukan
                         dengan INSW. Pemerintah juga telah menetapkan Tempat Pemeriksaan Fisik Terpadu
                         (TPFT), yang memungkinkan Bea Cukai, Karantina dan BPOM untuk melakukan
                         pemeriksaan pada waktu yang bersamaan, sehingga memangkas pergerakan peti kemas dan
                         memungkinkan waktu pemeriksan fisik yang lebih cepat pada jalur kuning dan merah. TPFT

                    1. Memperkirakan stok aset tetap infrastruktur di Indonesia
Rendahnya investasi di    Selama bertahun-tahun investasi infrastruktur di Indonesia hanya mencapai sekitar 3 hingga
Indonesia telah           4 persen dari PDB, jauh di bawah tingkat investasi di atas 7 persen yang tercatat sebelum
berlangsung lebih dari    Krisis Asia tahun 1997/98 dan lebih rendah dibanding negara-negara tetangga seperti China,
satu dekade…              Thailand dan Vietnam, yang mencatat angka di atas 7 persen dari PDB.11 Kontribusi
                          Pemerintah terhadap investasi infrastruktur telah meningkat tajam secara keseluruhan,
                          didorong oleh pemerintah daerah, di tengah penurunan tajam investasi sektor swasta, dan
                          perlambatan investasi oleh BUMN, pada beberapa tahun terakhir. Akan tetapi, walau
                          Pemerintahberkomitmen untuk meningkatkan layanan dan belanja infrastruktur, tingkat
                          investasi infrastruktur secara keseluruhan masih belum kembali ke tingkat yang tercatat
                          sebelum tahun 1997/98 dan tidak mampu mengejar peningkatan kebutuhan.

…dengan implikasi         Menggunakan data baru tentang investasi infrastruktur yang dikumpulkan oleh Bank Dunia,
ekonomi yang patut        dan didasarkan hasil analisis data-data yang disajikan pada Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret
diteliti lebih lanjut     2013, bagian ini meneliti lebih lanjut masalah rendahnya investasi infrastruktur di Indonesia
                          dan juga implikasinya terhadap pertumbuhan. Secara khusus, bagian ini mencoba menjawab
                          dua pertanyaan ini: bagaimana tingkat investasi mempengaruhi akumulasi stok aset
                          infrastruktur yang ada; dan bagaimana jika akumulasi aset infrastruktur yang lebih cepat
                          mempengaruhi lintasan pertumbuhan Indonesia akhir-akhir ini?

                           melampaui tingkat yang
                           sebelumnya tercatat sebelum

                                                           pada Triwulanan edisi Maret 2013 dan perhitungan staf Bank Dunia
                           didorong oleh investasi
                           dalam bidang konstruksi, yang terutama terlihat pada peningkatan jumlah gedung-gedung,
                           perumahan dan pusat perbelanjaan.

…dengan penurunan          Seperti dirinci pada Triwulanan edisi bulan Maret 2013, penurunan investasi infrastruktur
yang bersifat luas dan     (terhadap PDB) bersifat luas termasuk pemerintah, BUMN dan sektor swasta. Investasi
lintas berbagai bidang,    sektor swasta mencatat penurunan yang paling tajam, sebesar 2,1 persen dari PDB, dari rata-
terutama sektor swasta     rata 2,3 persen dari PDB selama tahun 1995-97 menjadi kurang 0,4 persen dari PDB pada
                           tahun 2008-11. Penurunan tajam dalam investasi infrastruktur sektor swasta itu merupakan
                           suatu keprihatinan tersendiri, dengan semakin meningkatnya fokus kepada Kemitraan
                           Pemerintah-Swasta (KPS) untuk mendanai pembangunan infrastruktur Indonesia. Investasi
                           BUMN juga turun sekitar 1,8 persen dari PDB. Jumlah investasi pemerintah (baik pusat
                           maupun daerah) turun sebesar 0,9 persen dari rata-rata sebesar 3,3 persen dari PDB pada
                           tahun 1995-1997 menjadi 2,4 persen dari PDB selama periode tahun 2008-11 (Gambar 37).

Investasi infrastruktur    Secara harga konstan (menggunakan deflator investasi neraca nasional), investasi infrastruktur
Pemerintah, walau          selama tahun 2008-11 berjumlah sekitar sepertiga lebih rendah dibanding tingkat investasinya
turun terhadap PDB,        pada tahun 1995-97. Namun rata-rata investasi infrastruktur tahunan pemerintah (pusat dan
telah hampir pulih         daerah) dalam harga konstan telah kembali ke tingkat tahun 1995-97 pada tahun 2008-11,
secara riil, didorong      sementara tingkat investasi BUMN dan sektor swasta masih tetap bertahan lebih rendah 30
oleh investasi             persen dan 70 persen. Kontribusi sektor pemerintah terhadap investasi infrastruktur secara
pemerintah daerah…         keseluruhan telah meningkat, dipimpin oleh belanja pemerintah daerah untuk investasi jalan
                           daerah. Semakin pentingnya investasi pemerintah daerah mencerminkan dampak
                           desentralisasi fiskal pada tahun 2001 yang mana kewenangan belanja dan pembiayaan

                           diserahkan kepada pemerintah daerah. Sebelum desentralisasi, sekitar 80 persen dari investasi
                           infrastruktur pemerintah berasal dari pemerintah pusat, dan pemerintah daerah hanya
                           menyumbangkan 20 persen. Kini perbandingan ini telah bergeser menjadi 65 persen belanja
                           berasal dari pemerintah daerah sementara 35 persen berasal dari pemerintah pusat.

…dan juga                  Pemerintah menyadari tantangan-tantangan infrastruktur Indonesia dan telah bertekad untuk
peningkatan besar          mengatasinya melalui Rencana Pembangunan Jangka Menengah Nasional (RPJMN) dan
akhir-akhir ini pada       Masterplan Percepatan dan Perluasan Pembangunan Ekonomi Indonesia (MP3EI).
belanja pemerintah         Indonesia juga meluncurkan sejumlah prakarsa dan kebijakan, termasuk peningkatan
pusat, yang                anggaran yang signifikan bagi belanja modal dan penguatan kerangka kelembagaan dan
mencerminkan               kerangka peraturan perundangan bagi Kemitraan Pemerintah Swasta (KPS). Walau dengan
komitmen Pemerintah        peningkatan yang cukup besar dalam belanja modal secara nominal oleh pemerintah pusat,
untuk meningkatkan         kemajuan pelaksanaan investasi infrastruktur secara nyata di lapangan tetap berjalan lambat,
layanan infrastruktur      karena sejumlah tantangan koordinasi dan implementasi.12

                     b. Stok aset tetap infrastruktur Indonesia diperkirakan telah menurun dibandingkan
                        total stok aset…

Didorong oleh kuatnya      Seperti telah disinggung di atas, pertumbuhan investasi Indonesia secara agregat telah
pertumbuhan investasi      meningkat tajam dalam beberapa tahun terakhir, dengan pertumbuhan pembentukan modal
konstruksi, rasio stok     tetap bruto (PMTB) meningkat rata-rata sebesar 8 persen secara riil pada periode tahun 2001
aset tetap terhadap        dan 2011, secara umum didorong oleh konstruksi. Sebagai akibatnya, rasio keseluruhan stok
PDB Indonesia telah        aset tetap Indonesia terhadap PDB telah meningkat dari 1,7 kali PDB pada tahun 1995
meningkat pesat dalam      menjadi 2,1 kali PDB pada tahun 2011. Apakah stok aset infrastruktur, yang merupakan
beberapa tahun             masukan (input) utama dalam produktivitas dan pertumbuhan, juga mengikuti tren
terakhir                   keseluruhan ini? Bagian berikut akan membahas pertanyaan yang penting ini, termasuk
                           kemungkinan implikasinya terhadap pertumbuhan output.

Sebaliknya, perkiraan      Metode Persediaan Perpetual (Perpetual Inventory Method, PIM), bersama-sama dengan asumsi-
menunjukkan bahwa          asumsi yang diuraikan pada Kotak 4, dapat digunakan untuk memperkirakan tingkat
stok aset tetap            persediaan modal infrastruktur Indonesia. Perkiraan awal menunjukkan bahwa penurunan riil
infrastruktur sepertinya   tingkat investasi infrastruktur ditambah dengan tingkat penyusutan (depresiasi) asetdan
telah menurun              pertumbuhan ekonomi yang pesat tampaknya telah mengakibatkan penurunan tingkat stok
dibanding ukuran           aset infrastruktur dibanding ukuran ekonomi secara keseluruhan. Sebagai contoh, setelah
ekonomi (PDB) dan          penyusutan, rata-rata pertumbuhan riil stok aset infrastruktur antara tahun 1996 dan 2011
total stok                 adalah 3 persen, di bawah rata-rata pertumbuhan PDB riil sebesar 4 persen (termasuk pada
                           masa krisis tahun 1997/98). Laju pertumbuhan investasi infrastruktur juga tidak mengikuti
                           cepatnya pertumbuhan riil total stok, dengan nilai rata-rata sebesar 4,4 persen selama periode
                           tersebut (Gambar 43). Sebagai akibatnya, aset tetap infrastruktur Indonesia telah berangsur-
                           angsur menyusut dari asumsi nilai permulaan sebesar 28 persen dari total aset tetap pada
                           tahun 1995 menjadi 20 persen pada tahun 2011 (Gambar 36). Peningkatan dalam investasi
                           infrastruktur publik beberapa tahun terakhir hanya dapat memperlambat laju penurunan
                           relatif tersebut. Peningkatan dalam pertumbuhan keseluruhan investasi dalam dekade yang
                           lalu didorong oleh sektor konstruksi non-infrastruktur. Sementara perkiraan-perkiraan ini
                           memiliki berbagai keterbatasan, temuan-temuan umumnya kuat walaupun menggunakan
                           asumsi-asumsi yang berlainan (lihat Kotak 4).

layanan infrastruktur, yang merupakan hal yang penting bagi pertumbuhan dan hasil pembangunan, akan bergantung kepada kualitas dan efisiensi
investasi.
Metode Persediaan Perpetual (PIM) digunakan untuk memperkirakan jumlah stok aset infrastruktur, dengan memperkirakan nilai awal stok aset (tahun
1995 ketika data investasi infrastruktur tersedia) ditambahkan aliran investasi bruto dan dikurangi depresiasi (penyusutan). Berdasarkan pendekatan ini,
tingkat stok aset infrastruktur Indonesia pada tahun 2011 diperkirakan berada pada 49 persen dari PDB, yang mendekati rata-rata perkiraan McKinsey
Global Institute (2013) (selama 1992-2011, termasuk pembentukan aset pemeliharaan) untuk India sebesar 58 persen dari PDB (tahun 1992-2011)
namun di bawah negara-negara berpenghasilan menengah maupun tinggi yang mencapai 70 persen dari PDB.
Karena keterbatasan data, sejumlah asumsi telah dibuat untuk menyusun perkiraan stok aset. Pertama, mengikuti Van der Eng (2008) yang
memperkirakan tingkat persediaan modal di Indonesia antara tahun 1950 dan 2007, nilai awal stok aset diasumsikan sekitar 1,7 kali PDB pada tahun
1995 dan nilai awal stok aset infrastruktur diasumsikan 28 persen dari total stok aset (walau nilai awal dari stok aset infrastruktur dan total
menggunakan perkiraan Van der Eng, perkiraan tren dan tingkatan stok aset infrastruktur dan total untuk periode selanjutnya dalam analisis berbeda
karena perbedaan metodologi).
Kedua, tingkat penyusutan tahunan bagi aset-aset infrastruktur diasumsikan 5 persen, mengikuti asumsi Kementerian Keuangan untuk perhitungan
akuntansi pajak untuk gedung dan alat transportasi (Kementerian Keuangan, 2009). Nilai ini merupakan titik tengah dibanding tingkat penyusutan
tersirat sebesar 6,1 persen yang digunakan oleh Van der Eng untuk Indonesia, dan 3,5 persen yang digunakan oleh Arslanalp (2011) bagi negara-negara
berpenghasilan menengah.
Akhirnya, penting untuk dicatat bahwa penggunaan data investasi dapat menyebabkan penilaian yang terlalu rendah akan kontribusi belanja
pemeliharaan dalam memperpanjang usia suatu aset. Namun hal ini juga dapat diimbangi dengan kemungkinan penilaian yang terlalu tinggi dari asumsi
keterkaitan langsung (one-to-one) antara investasi infrastruktur dan akumulasi aset-aset produktif. Sebagai contoh, Pritchett (2000) menyatakan bahwa
kurangnya hubungan antara (aliran) belanja investasi dan akumulasi aset-aset produktif, terutama di negara-negara berkembang, yang disebabkan oleh
ketidakefisienan dan pemborosan.
Perkiraan stok aset infrastruktur bersifat peka terhadap asumsi-asumsi tingkat awal stok aset infrastruktur dan tingkat depresiasi (Tabel 7). Sebagai
contoh, jika stok aset infrastruktur awal tahun 1995 sebesar 33 persen dari total stok aset (5 poin persentase di atas angka dasar/baseline), maka rata-
rata pertumbuhan tahunan dari stok aset infrastruktur selama periode tersebut akan mencapai 2,2 persen, di bawah angka baseline, karena tingkat stok
aset awal yang lebih tinggi akan mengakibatkan tingkat depresiasi yang lebih besar dibanding aliran investasi baru, namun tingkat perkiraan pada akhir
periode (tahun 2011) akan menjadi lebih tinggi. Perbedaan asumsi-asumsi tingkat depresiasi juga mempengaruhi laju pertumbuhan dan tingkat stok
aset infrastruktur. Sebagai contoh, jika tingkat depresiasi yang digunakan lebih rendah sebesar 3,5 persen (di bawah nilai baseline yang 5 persen) akan
menghasilkan tingkat pertumbuhan rata-rata stok aset infrastruktur yang lebih tinggi, dan perkiraan tingkatannya dibanding total stok aset akan lebih
besar dari nilai baseline.

Lemahnya                      Stok aset, termasuk infrastruktur, mencerminkan kapasitas ekonomi untuk memproduksi
pertumbuhan stok aset         barang-barang dan jasa-jasa. Kualitas dan kuantitas persediaan aset infrastruktur – terutama
infrastruktur                 infrastruktur dasar seperti jaringan jalan, rel kereta api, jembatan, pelabuhan, bandara, listrik,
tampaknya telah               sarana telekomunikasi dan sistem air – merupakan input yang sangat penting bagi
menghambat kinerja            produktivitas dan daya saing ekonomi. Sebagian besar penelitian empiris menemukan
perekonomian                  korelasi yang positif antara persediaan aset infrastruktur dan output (Kotak 5). Karenanya, dan
Indonesia belakangan          sesuai harapan dari dampak perlemahan infrastruktur terhadap usaha dan rumah tangga
ini                           sehari-hari, pertumbuhan stok aset infrastruktur yang relatif rendah di Indonesia tampaknya
                              telah menghambat kinerja ekonomi Indonesia dalam satu dekade terakhir.

Analisa kontra-faktual        Analisa kontra-faktual yang sederhana dapat menunjukkan bagaimana lambatnya laju
yang sederhana dapat          investasi infrastruktur dapat mempengaruhi pertumbuhan di Indonesia, atau dengan kata
digunakan untuk               lain, manfaat potensial dari pencapaian tingkatan investasi infrastruktur yang lebih tinggi.
mengilustrasikan              Sebagai baseline, digunakan asumsi elastisitas output terhadap stok aset infrastruktur yang
potensi dampak bagi           tinggi sebesar 0,15, karena relatif rendahnya tingkat infrastruktur yang ada di Indonesia –
pertumbuhan dengan            peningkatan sebesar 10 persen dalam stok aset infrastruktur diasumsikan akan
peningkatan stok aset         mengakibatkan peningkatan sebesar 1,5 persen pada PDB. Seperti dibicarakan pada Kotak 5,
infrastruktur Indonesia       telah diketahui bahwa angka multiplier infrastruktur untuk pertumbuhan akan bervariasi
                              menurut jenis infrastruktur, namun karena keterbatasan data, analisis pemilahan ini tidak
                              dapat dilakukan. Untuk analisis skenario, digunakan dua skenario pertumbuhan stok aset
                              infrastruktur tahunan alternatif sebesar 5 dan 10 persen.

Untuk penyederhanaan, didalam simulasi diasumsikan elastisitas output terhadap stok aset infrastruktur sebesar 0,15, sejalan dengan temuan empiris
dari Ligthart dan Bom (2009). Pada satu sisi, nilai elastisitas yang relatif konservatif ini memperhitungkan keprihatinan akan lemahnya hubungan antara
investasi moneter, stok/persediaan aset fisik, dan layanan infrastruktur. Pada sisi lain, asumsi ini dapat memberikan perkiraan yang terlalu rendah akan
dampak eksternalitas positif dari akumulasi modal infrastruktur, misalnya dengan meningkatkan ketersediaan layanan pendidikan dan kesehatan.
Asumsi itu juga mengakui bahwa multiplier investasi infrastruktur bagi pertumbuhan akan bervariasi menurut jenis investasi infrastruktur. Sebagai
contoh, OECD (2009), dengan menggunakan pengukuran infrastruktur fisik per kapita, memperkirakan sejumlah multiplier bagi berbagai jenis
infrastruktur, seperti jalan (0,3 – 0,46), infrastruktur rel kereta api (0,39 – 0,53), jalan tol (0,42-4), listrik (0,39), infrastruktur kabel utama telepon (0,39
– 0,42), dan tingkat pelanggan telepon (0,34 – 0,45). Karena keterbatasan data, analisis pemilahan berdasar jenis infrastruktur ini tidak dilakukan untuk
Indonesia.

                                                                              Perekonomian Indonesia

…yang akan                Analisis empiris yang luas menunjukkan bahwa pertumbuhan PDB seringkali berkontribusi
berkontribusi kepada      terhadap pengentasan kemiskinan. Dengan distribusi konsumsi dan garis kemiskinan resmi
pengentasan               Indonesia – yaitu jumlah penduduk yang hidup pada kisaran 1 persen dari garis kemiskinan –
kemiskinan lebih cepat    pada beberapa tahun terakhir, untuk setiap peningkatan pendapatan kaum miskin sebesar 1
dan peningkatan hasil     persen, tingkat kemiskinan nasional turun sebesar 0,5 poin persentase. Dengan
pembangunan               menggunakan prinsip sederhana ini, dan sejumlah asumsi tentang tingkat pengaruh
                          pertumbuhan PDB terhadap pertumbuhan konsumsi rumah tangga miskin, pertumbuhan
                          stok aset infrastruktur yang lebih tinggi sebesar 5 persen (dibanding rata-rata aktuil sebesar 3
                          persen), akan menambah pertumbuhan konsumsi penduduk miskin sebesar 0,3 persen yoy,
                          dan juga menambah penurunan tingkat kemiskinan sebesar 1.5 poin persentase (tingkat
                          kemiskinan tahun ini akan menjadi 9,9 persen dibanding 11,4 persen saat ini). Jika
                          pertumbuhan stok aset infrastruktur mencapai rata-rata 10 persen, tingkat kemiskinan akan
                          turun sebesar 4,5 poin persentase selama periode tersebut, atau tingkat kemiskinan sekarang
                          akan menjadi 6,9 persen. Perkiraan ini hanya penyederhanaan dan dimaksudkan sebagai
                          ilustrasi. Penting untuk ingat bahwa tingkat pertumbuhan yang didukung oleh infrastruktur
                          yang dapat mendukung pengentasan kemiskinan dipengaruhi oleh banyak faktor, seperti
                          jenis infrastruktur, lokasi dan kondisi geografisnya, dan periode analisis.

Fokus berkelanjutan       Sejak krisis tahun 1997/98, Indonesia telah mengalami kesulitan untuk meningkatkan
untuk meningkatkan        pertumbuhan persediaan aset infrastruktur yang berkelanjutan. Sesungguhnya, walau terdapat
kuantitas dan kualitas    keterbatasan data yang besar, bukti-bukti awal menunjukkan bahwa persediaan infrastruktur
belanja infrastruktur     tidak bertambah secara signifikan selama periode itu, sehingga stok asetnya menurun
sangat penting bagi       dibanding total stok aset dan ukuran ekonomi. Dengan permintaan akan layanan
Indonesia untuk           infrastruktur yang lebih baik tampaknya akan terus meningkat, kebutuhan untuk semakin
mewujukan potensi         meningkatkan investasi infrastruktur telah terlihat dengan jelas. Karenanya, peningkatan
pertumbuhannya...         kuantitas dan kualitas investasi publik menjadi penting. Melanjutkan peningkatan alokasi
                          anggaran bagi pembangunan infrastruktur memang memiliki andil, melalui realokasi
                          anggaran, misalnya subsidi energi, dan mendukung perbaikan pengumpulan penerimaan.
                          Secara bersamaan upaya-upaya pemerintah seperti disebut dialam Bagian A, untuk
                          memperbaiki eksekusi anggaran dan pelaksanaan proyek haru terus dilanjutkan.
                          Keberlanjutan fiskal dan persaingan dalam permintaan bagi dana publik juga mendorong
                          penekanan yang kuat akan efisiensi, termasuk menjamin kelancaran operasi dan
                          pemeliharaan atas infrastruktur yang ada, dan secara lebih luas meningkatkan kualitas
                          pengelolaan investasi publik untuk menghasilkan infrastruktur publik prioritas yang
                          dibutuhkan oleh ekonomi. Selanjutnya, juga penting untuk mendukung kebijakan, aturan,
                          dan institusi seperti yang terkait dengan Kemitraan Publik Swasta, yang dapat menciptakan
                          lingkungan yang lebih baik untuk investasi swasta dalam infrastruktur .

…dan pengumpulan          Seperti telah dibahas, mengukur besaran investasi total dan infrastruktur Indonesia, stok aset
dan analisis data lebih   dan dampaknya terhadap pertumbuhan merupakan suatu tantangan karena rangkaian
lanjut akan membantu      keterbatasan data dan asumsi-asumsi yang dibutuhkan. Perkiraan dan simulasi yang disajikan
memberikan informasi      di atas merupakan langkah awal analisis ini. Peningkatan kualitas, ketepatan waktu dan
bagi pengambilan          cakupan data-data itu merupakan langkah yang penting untuk meningkatkan analisis ini dan
keputusan berkualitas     untuk memberikan informasi yang lebih baik untuk kebijakan berdasar bukti tentang
yang berdasar bukti       kebutuhan dan kinerja infrastruktur. Perluasan analisis ini juga dapat mendukung tujuan-
untuk mendukung           tujuan itu, misalnya, dengan mengaitkan perkiraan investasi dan stok aset dengan indikator-
pencapaian sasaran        indikator sektor riil, dengan memisahkan investasi dan stok/persediaan menurut jenis dan
tersebut                  daerah, dengan mengaitkan belanja untuk operasi dan pemeliharaan dengan perkiraan stok
                          aset, dan membuat penyesuaian untuk memperhitungkan kualitas investasi, dan dengan
                          mencermati secara lebih rinci akan keterkaitannya dengan hasil pembangunan, termasuk
                          pertumbuhan dan inklusivitas. Perkiraan akan biaya ekonomi dari lemahnya infrastruktur
                          juga akan dapat semakin memperkaya analisis ini. Di dalamnya termasuk tidak hanya biaya
                          ekonomi kemacetan lalu lintas tetapi juga biaya kesempatan (opportunity cost) dari tanggapan
                          sektor swasta, seperti pembelian kapasitas pembangkit tenaga untuk mendukung usahanya
                          atau penambahan jumlah truk-truk untuk mengatasi penurunan jumlah pengiriman yang
                          dapat dilakukan setiap hari oleh setiap truk karena kemacetan lalu lintas.

                    2. Tata kelola pemerintah daerah dan kinerja pendidikan
Tugas utama dari          Sistem pendidikan yang kuat dan serba guna merupakan hal yang penting bagi pembangunan
suatu sistem              jangka panjang setiap negara.13 Tugas utama dari sistem pendidikan adalah membekali
pendidikan adalah         angkatan muda dengan berbagai keterampilan yang mereka butuhkan untuk dapat
membekali angkatan        berpartisipasi sepenuhnya dalam kehidupan sosial, ekonomi dan politik. Pemberian
muda dengan               pendidikan dasar dengan kualitas yang baik kepada seluruh anak dapat meningkatkan
keterampilan yang         produktivitas, meninggikan laju pertumbuhan ekonomi dan mendukung landasan bagi masa
mereka butuhkan,          depan yang damai. Sebagai contoh, penelitian internasional terbaru menunjukkan bahwa
yang sangat penting       memastikan seluruh anak menyelesaikan sekolah dengan keterampilan dasar dalam baca-tulis
bagi pembangunan          dan berhitung dapat meningkatkan pertumbuhan yoy per kapita hingga satu poin
                          persentase.14 Manfaat seperti itu akan memberikan dampak positif yang signifikan terhadap
                          prospek pembangunan dan lintasan pertumbuhan jangka menengah di Indonesia. Bagian ini
                          membahas bukti-bukti yang berasal dari penelitian terakhir tentang peran penting yang dapat
                          disumbangkan oleh peningkatan dalam tata kelola pemerintah daerah bagi peningkatan
                          kualitas pendidikan dasar dan memastikan bahwa anak-anak meninggalkan sekolah dengan
                          keterampilan yang memadai.

Reformasi pendidikan      Dalam lima belas tahun terakhir, Indonesia telah menerapkan paket reformasi pendidikan
telah mendorong           yang menyeluruh yang dirancang untuk memperluas akses dan meningkatkan kualitas.
meningkatnya akses        Komponen utama dalam proses reformasi adalah pemindahan tanggung jawab atas layanan
sekolah tetapi            pendidikan dasar kepada sekolah dan pemerintah di daerah. Upaya reformasi ini, bersama-
peningkatan dalam         sama dengan peningkatan investasi pemerintah dalam jumlah yang tidak pernah diperkirakan
pembelajaran masih        sebelumnya, membawa peningkatan yang signifikan dalam akses pendidikan terutama bagi
belum terlalu besar       anak-anak dari kelompok yang paling miskin.15 Namun peningkatan dalam capaian atau
                          prestasi belajar masih tetap kecil dan anak-anak menyelesaikan sekolah dengan keterampilan
                          yang belum memadai dengan kebutuhan yang diminta oleh pasar tenaga kerja. Seperti pada
                          sistem pendidikan lainnya di dunia, peningkatan kualitas pendidikan dasar masih terus
                          menjadi tantangan utama.

Penguatan kapasitas       Penguatan kapasitas pemerintah daerah dalam mengelola sistem pendidikannya secara efektif
pemerintah daerah         merupakan hal yang penting dalam mendukung keberhasilan peningkatan kualitas
merupakan kunci           pendidikan. Kemampuan pemerintah daerah untuk memberikan layanan pendidikan dasar
utama untuk               yang berkualitas sangat bervariasi pada berbagai daerah di Indonesia. Identifikasi dimensi tata
meningkatkan kualitas     kelola utama yang mendasari penyelenggaraan layanan pendidikan yang efektif dapat menjadi
pendidikan                titik awal dalam upaya menangani kekurangan yang masih ada dan meningkatkan kinerja
                          pendidikan.

…dan kapasitas            Karena pemerintah daerah memegang peran utama dalam penyelenggaraan layanan dasar,
pemerintah daerah         kapasitasnya dalam mengelola sistem pendidikan menjadi penentu utama bagi kinerja.
dalam mengelola           Peluang pendidikan sangat bervariasi di berbagai kabupaten/kota di Indonesia; rata-rata nilai
sistem pendidikan         ujian nasional untuk tingkat dasar pada tahun 2009 dimulai dari 48 persen di Sumba Barat
merupakan penentu         Daya di provinsi Nusa Tenggara Timur, hingga 83 persen di Kota Mojokerto di provinsi
utama capaian             Jawa Timur. Faktor kemiskinan, geografis dan sosial-ekonomi lainnya dapat menjelaskan
pendidikan                sebagian dari variasi tersebut, namun hasil penelitian menunjukkan bahwa kualitas tata kelola
                          daerah juga memegang peranan yang penting. Secara khusus, hasil penelitian menunjukkan
                          catatan hasil pendidikan yang lebih baik di beberapa kabupaten/kota dengan sistem

Survei kualitas tata      Untuk menilai keadaan tata kelola pendidikan daerah, survei dilakukan di 50 kabupaten/kota
kelola pendidikan         (di sembilan provinsi) pada tahun 2009 dan 2012. Kabupaten/kota- yang turut serta dipilih
dasar telah dilakukan     oleh Kementerian Pendidikan dan Kebudayaan untuk ikut di dalam proyek Basic Education
di 50 kabupaten/kota      Capacity (BEC) (yang seperti dijelaskan pada Kotak 6, memberikan hibah dan bantuan teknis
pada tahun 2009 dan       kepada kabupaten/kota-kabupaten/kota terpilih). Survei itu bertujuan untuk:
2012…
                               1.   Memberi penilaian akan kapasitas kabupaten/kota dalam menyelenggarakan
                                    layanan pendidikan dasar
                               2.   Melihat keterkaitan antara tata kelola dan kinerja pendidikan di kabupaten/kota
                               3.   Menelusuri perubahan-perubahan yang belakangan terjadi dalam bidang tata kelola
                                    pendidikan

                          lain namun memiliki tingkat akses dan capaian pendidikan yang sebanding.

…dan menyertakan       Di dalam survei ILEG itu, tata kelola pendidikan dibagi menjadi empat dimensi utama untuk
pengukuran tata keloa mengukur efektivitas lembaga-lembaga pemerintah daerah yang berkaitan dengan
pendidikan yang diatur penyelenggaraan layanan pendidikan:
ke dalam lima             Transparansi dan akuntabilitas. Upaya pelaksanaan dan penetapan peraturan
kelompok utama…            perundangan oleh pemerintah daerah untuk mendukung tata kelola sektor pendidikan
                           yang transparan, akuntabel dan partisipatif.
                             Sistem pengendalian manajemen. Menilai sampai sejauh mana sistem yang ditempatkan
                              dapat menyertakan keputusan-keputusan yang dibuat oleh proses perencanaan tingkat
                              sekolah dan daerah ke dalam rencana kerja pendidikan tahunan tingkat kabupaten/kota.
                             Sistem informasi manajemen. Mengukur ketersediaan informasi yang berkualitas tentang
                              sistem pendidikan daerah yang dapat digunakan dalam proses perencanaan dan
                              pemantauan pendidikan.
                             Penggunaan sumber daya yang efisien. Mengamati apakah sistem telah ditempatkan
                              untuk merencanakan, menganggarkan dan memantau penggunaan sumber daya secara
                              efektif.
                          Komponen kelima, standar pelaksanaan layanan pendidikan, merupakan upaya untuk
                          mengukur tingkatan dan kualitas layanan pendidikan dasar dan menengah pertama di suatu
                          kabupaten/kota. Hal ini juga dapat digunakan untuk melihat keterkaitan antara dimensi tata
                          kelola dan kinerja pendidikan.

…yang menghasilkan       Untuk setiap dimensi, serangkaian indikator digunakan untuk mengevaluasi kualitas tata
lima sub-indeks          kelola daerah. Indikator-indikator yang digunakan diberi bobot sesuai sifat pengukurannya,
dengan pembobotan,       apakah untuk mengukur kesesuaian dengan peraturan, proses atau kinerja. Indikator kinerja
dan indeks ILEG          mendapat bobot terberat dan indikator peraturan menerima bobot yang paling ringan. Untuk
keseluruhan untuk        mengkaji kualitas tata kelola daerah, serangkaian indikator pada setiap bidang digabungkan
memberikan ringkasan     menjadi satu sub-indeks. Sebagai contoh, sub-indeks untuk transparansi dan akuntabilitas
pengukuran kualitas      merupakan rata-rata tertimbang dari sepuluh indikator. Sub-indeks-sub-indeks itu kemudian
tata kelola pendidikan   dihitung reratanya untuk mendapatkan indeks ILEG, yang merupakan pengukuran
daerah                   keseluruhan akan kualitas tata kelola pendidikan di daerah. Nilai indeks dimulai dari 0 hingga
                         100 persen dengan nilai yang rendah menunjukkan bahwa komponen tata kelola utama yang
                         mendorong kinerja pendidikan yang lebih baik belum berada pada tempatnya, sementara
                         nilai yang tinggi menunjukkan bahwa komponen-komponen tersebut telah tersedia.

dalam aspek-aspek         perbedaan yang besar. Pemerintah daerah menunjukkan kinerja yang baik dalam standar
utama tata kelola         pemberian layanan pendidikan yang diukur oleh survei itu. Namun beberapa kabupaten/kota

Terdapat sejumlah         Walau dengan kelemahan pada sistem informasi manajemen, dan dalam transparansi dan
peningkatan kualitas      akuntabilitas, seperti ditemukan oleh survei itu, terdapat sejumlah kemajuan (Gambar 40).
sistem informasi          Dalam hal transparansi dan akuntabilitas, terdapat peningkatan-peningkatan dalam upaya
manajemen                 pemerintah daerah untuk mendorong partisipasi masyarakat yang lebih besar dalam kegiatan
pendidikan dan proses-    pengambilan keputusan dan pengawasan. Sebagai contoh, antara tahun 2009 dan 2012
proses untuk              proporsi kabupaten/kota yang memperkenankan partisipasi masyarakat di dalam sesi

                          Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Daerah.

…namun kelemahan          Informasi yang akurat dan tepat waktu sangatlah penting bagi perencanaan dan pemantauan
tetap ada, dengan         sistem pendidikan daerah yang efektif. Pemerintah daerah mencatat sejumlah peningkatan
hanya sepertiga           kecil dalam bidang ini antara tahun 2009 dan 2012. Sebagai contoh, jumlah kantor
kabupaten/kota yang       pendidikan daerah yang memiliki prosedur dan protokol tertulis bagi pengumpulan dan
memiliki sistem untuk     pemeriksaan data sedikit meningkat pada tahun 2012 dibanding pada tahun 2009. Namun
mengumpulkan              hanya sekitar sepertiga dari seluruh kabupaten/kota yang telah memiliki sistem itu pada

                          yang dirancang untuk mengaitkan sumber daya kabupaten/kota secara lebih erat dengan
                          kebutuhan-kebutuhan yang terdapat pada sekolah-sekolah. Walau dengan kemunduran ini,
                          sejumlah aspek pengendalian manajemen mencatat peningkatan selama beberapa tahun
                          terakhir. Secara khusus, sistem manajemen aset tampaknya telah menguat dan jumlah

                          peraturan daerah tentang manajemen aset telah meningkat.

Perbedaan antara                 Faktor-faktor yang mendasari penurunan dimensi tata kelola yang berkaitan dengan
rencana dan realisasi            penggunaan sumber daya yang efisien ternyata lebih rumit. Bidang tata kelola ini lebih dekat
belanja menunjukkan              kaitannya dengan penilaian efektivitas dinas pendidikan kabupaten/kota dalam
kelemahan dalam                  merencanakan, menganggarkan dan memantau penggunaan sumber daya pendidikan.
penganggaran bagi                Indikator efektivitas yang utama dalam bidang ini adalah perbedaan antara rencana dan
pendidikan…                      realisasi belanja pendidikan. Indikator ini menurun dari tahun 2009 ke 2012; jumlah
                                 kabupaten/kota yang melaporkan perbedaan antara perencanaan dan realisasi belanja yang
                                 kurang dari 10 persen pada tiga tahun terakhir turun dari 46 persen ke 32 persen. Namun
                                 penyesuaian yang besar dalam perubahan anggaran sebagian disebabkan oleh perubahan di
                                 dalam transfer dari pemerintah pusat , yang berada di luar kendali pemerintah daerah.

                                 pendidikan) memulai proses perencanaan mereka, meningkat dari 44 persen menjadi 74
                                 persen. Peningkatan ini mencerminkan upaya-upaya terakhir oleh pemerintah pusat untuk
                                 memperkenalkan penganggaran berbasis kinerja dan kerangka kerja belanja jangka
                                 menengah.
Kotak 6: Pengaruh dana hibah untuk pengembangan kapasitas yang diberikan kepada dinas pendidikan daerah
 Program Basic Education Capacity(BEC) memberikan dukungan bagi seluruh kabupaten/kota yang menjadi sampel survei ILEG melalui bantuan teknis
 dan pemberian dana hibah pengembangan kapasitas daerah sebesar 255.000 dolar AS. Sementara jumlah dana hibah itu relatif kecil (secara rata-rata
 kurang dari satu persen dari rata-rata belanja pendidikan tahunan), dana itu dirancang untuk memperkuat tata kelola pendidikan lokal dan
 meningkatkan kinerja pendidikan.
 Sebelumnya diperkirakan bahwa pemerintah daerah akan menggunakan dana hibah pengembangan kapasitas itu untuk menangani bidang-bidang yang
 menjadi kelemahan, yang ditemukan oleh survei ILEG putaran pertama pada tahun 2009. Namun tampaknya bidang-bidang yang dinilai sebagai
 paling lemah menerima sumber daya hibah yang lebih rendah dibanding bidang-bidang yang paling kuat. Sebagai contoh, pada tahun 2009
 kabupaten/kota-kabupaten/kota telah mencatat peringkat yang relatif tinggi dalam sub-indeks ILEG bagi standar pemberian layanan pendidikan.
 Walau telah memiliki peringkat yang tinggi, bidang ini ternyata menerima bagian terbesar dari sumber daya hibah BEC. Tidaklah mungkin untuk
 secara langsung mengaitkan perubahan dalam kualitas tata kelola pendidikan daerah yang dilaporkan oleh survei ILEG dari tahun 2009 hingga 2012
 dengan upaya-upaya pengembangan kapasitas. Namun lemahnya penargetan sumber daya untuk pengembangan kapasitas tampaknya memainkan
 suatu bagian dalam gabungan peningkatan tata kelola yang dicatat oleh survei ILEG. Program-program yang mendukung pengembangan kapasitas
 yang akan datang harus disusun dengan menggunakan pengalaman yang didapat oleh program BEC, yang menunjukkan pentingnya dukungan dengan
 penargetan yang cermat, melintasi sektor-sektor tata kelola, dan menyesuaikan dukungan terhadap karakteristik setiap daerah.

                    d. Tanpa penanganan kendala utama tata kelola, kinerja akan sulit meningkat

Kinerja pendidikan       Hasil survei ILEG menunjukkan pentingnya kualitas tata kelola daerah dalam meningkatkan
kabupaten/kota tidak     kinerja pendidikan di daerah. Pada intinya, kinerja pendidikan daerah akan sulit meningkat
akan meningkat tanpa     tanpa adanya strategi-strategi untuk mengatasi kendala-kendala tata kelola utama yang
strategi untuk           disoroti pada bagian ini. Kemajuan yang dicatat dalam penguatan tata kelola pendidikan
mengatasi kendala tata   daerah pada empat tahun terakhir berjalan dengan lambat, walau dengan upaya-upaya untuk
kelola utama             memperkuat kapasitas daerah. Tantangan-tantangan utama harus ditangani terlebih dahulu
                         agar dapat meningkatkan tata kelola pendidikan di daerah.17

Dibutuhkan koordinasi    Sementara penguatan tata kelola daerah merupakan hal yang penting untuk mendukung
dan integrasi            kemajuan berkelanjutan pada sektor pendidikan, penting juga untuk memahami bahwa
pendanaan pemerintah     transfer pemerintah pusat dan program-program sektor pendidikan di tingkat pusat
pusat yang lebih baik    membawa sejumlah tantangan kepada tata kelola pendidikan di daerah. Sistem transfer dari
dalam perencanaan        pemerintah pusat yang berlaku menyebabkan insentif bagi belanja gaji yang lebih tinggi, yang
pendidikan di daerah     dapat mengganggu proses pengambilan keputusan yang mengakibatkan ketidakcocokan
                         antara kebutuhan sekolah dan alokasi daerah. Sementara pemerintah daerah menanggung
                         sebagian besar pendanaan bagi pendidikan dasar, pemerintah pusat masih memberikan
                         kontribusi yang signifikan. Untuk menurunkan risiko bahwa program-program pemerintah
                         pusat akan merintangi upaya-upaya daerah untuk meningkatkan pengelolaan dan tata kelola
                         sektor pendidikan, terdapat kebutuhan untuk meningkatkan koordinasi dan integrasi antara
                         program-program pemerintah pusat dan daerah. Termasuk didalamnya adalah upaya-upaya
                         untuk menjelaskan peran dan tanggung jawab dan terdapat kebutuhan yang jelas akan
                         peningkatan upaya untuk menyertakan program-program pemerintah pusat ke dalam proses-
                         proses perencanaan di daerah.

Ringkasan eksekutif: pertumbuhan melambat; risiko tinggi




   Melihat ke tahun 2014,     Kuartal akhir tahun 2013 telah mencatat penyesuaian ekonomi Indonesia yang masih
   Indonesia menghadapi       berlangsung terhadap terus melemahnya harga-harga komoditas dan kondisi pembiayaan
   perlambatan                eksternal yang lebih ketat, dan tekanan neraca pembayaran. Sejumlah kebijakan telah
   pertumbuhan dan            menanggapinya, terutama melalui kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat, depresiasi riil Rupiah
   risiko-risiko ekonomi      yang cukup besar dan belanja investasi dan pertumbuhan produksi (output) telah melemah.
   yang signifikan…           Perkembangan-perkembangan ini umumnya mendukung keberlangsungan stabilitas ekonomi
                              makro, termasuk membantu menurunkan defisit neraca transaksi berjalan, walaupun
                              dampaknya terus berlangsung, menambah ketidakpastian terhadap perekonomian domestik.
                              Pada saat bersamaan, lingkungan internasional juga bergeser, dengan pertumbuhan global
                              diperkirakan meningkat, membawa potensi perubahan kebijakan, terutama kebijakan
                              moneter Amerika Serikat, yang dapat meningkatkan tekanan pada posisi pembiayaan
                              eksternal Indonesia.

   …yang membutuhkan          Sejalan dengan melambatnya laju pertumbuhan, dan risiko-risiko yang dihadapi oleh
   fokus kebijakan tidak      ekonomi, ada kebutuhan yang kuat bagi Indonesia untuk semakin meningkatkan kemajuan
   hanya pada                 dari kebijakan yang berfokus pada makro seperti kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat,
   penyesuaian makro          penyesuaian kurs tukar dan tekanan impor, dengan reformasi yang lebih dalam untuk
   tetapi juga pada           mendorong kinerja ekspor dan mendukung aliran masuk modal investasi, terutama
   implementasi yang          penanaman modal langsung/FDI. Kemajuan dalam implementasi yang kredibel dari upaya-
   kredibel dari reformasi-   upaya tersebut dapat membantu membatasi kerentanan neraca pembayaran Indonesia
   reformasi investasi        terhadap kondisi pembiayaan global yang lebih ketat, atau lebih bergejolak, dan dapat
   jangka panjang dan         membantu mendukung siklus investasi yang kuat, termasuk investasi luar negeri, dan
   peningkatan ekspor         pertumbuhan produksi dalam jangka menengah. Dinamika politik tahun pemilu dapat
                              memainkan peran penting dalam pemilihan kebijakan tahun 2014 namun hal ini juga
                              menambah pentingnya komunikasi dan koordinasi yang jelas terhadap reformasi yang dalam,
                              baik dalam tahap perumusan dan pelaksanaan, dan pencegahan kesalahan pengambilan
                              kebijakan. Hal ini akan mendukung kepercayaan investor dalam dan luar negeri terhadap
                              prospek pertumbuhan Indonesia, dan aliran masuk pembiayaan luar negeri.

Kinerja ekonomi dunia    Kondisi ekonomi negara-negara ekonomi terbesar di dunia, dan mitra-mitra perdagangan
diperkirakan akan        utama Indonesia, masih tetap tidak merata. Pertumbuhan di AS telah mulai meningkat
semakin membaik          selama tahun 2013, sementara zona Eropa pada akhirnya berhasil keluar dari resesi yang
pada tahun 2014…         panjang walau dengan pemulihan yang lambat, sementara pertumbuhan di Jepang telah
                         melemah, namun masih tetap positif. Ekonomi Cina mencatat percepatan pada paruh kedua
                         tahun 2013, dan diikuti oleh India pada beberapa bulan terakhir, namun kegiatan pada
                         perekonomian negara berkembang utama lainnya, seperti Brasil, masih tetap lebih lemah.

                         ekonomi global, dengan semakin membaiknya negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi, yang
                         mendukung pertumbuhan perekonomian negara berkembang, terutama termasuk Cina, dan

…dan harga-harga         Secara umum harga-harga komoditas internasional telah meningkat pada beberapa bulan
komoditas telah          terakhir yang mengangkat indeks harga sepuluh komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia sebesar
stabil…                  3,8 persen sejak bulan Agustus (walau masih 2 persen lebih rendah pada tahun 2013 dan 22
                         persen di bawah nilai puncak terakhirnya pada bulan Februari 2011), yang dibantu oleh
                         peningkatan harga batubara, gas alam dan minyak sawit. Jika terus berlanjut, mulai stabilnya
                         harga-harga komoditas ini akan membantu memperlambat penurunan nilai tukar
                         perdagangan Indonesia yang telah mendorong sebagian besar penurunan dalam neraca
                         pembayaran. Namun, prospek dasar (baseline) dengan sedikit membaiknya pertumbuhan
                         dunia, bersamaan dengan kemungkinan pengetatan kondisi likuiditas dunia, dan tekanan
                         turun yang lebih terstruktur terhadap harga dari faktor-faktor sisi penawaran, tidak
                         mencerminkan peningkatan besar dalam harga komoditas untuk tahun 2014.

…namun risiko            Prospek internasional, walau membaik, masih mengandung ketidakpastian dan tantangan
kebijakan dan kondisi    kebijakan yang cukup besar. Di Eropa, jalannya pemulihan masih rapuh dan tampaknya tidak
keuangan internasional   akan merata karena tantangan pelaksanaan penurunan hutang dan kebijakan yang cukup
masih menjadi            besar. Di Asia, kecepatan dan ragam penerapan upaya reformasi struktural yang ambisius di
tantangan bagi           Cina dan Jepang, dan pemilu di India, akan mempengaruhi prospeknya. Di atas semua itu,
Indonesia                penetapan waktu dan kecepatan penghapusan bertahap dari program pembelian aset Bank
                         Sentral AS (yang disebut “tapering”) tidaklah pasti, namun menjaga risiko gejolak pasar dunia
                         dan kondisi pembiayaan eksternal yang lebih sulit tetap menjadi perhatian utama.

Penyesuaian ekonomi      Seperti yang disoroti pada IEQ edisi bulan Oktober 2013, perkiraan terjadinya penghapusan
dan kebijakan selama     bertahap oleh Bank Sentral AS, dan kondisi pengetatan pembiayaan luar negeri yang terkait,
tahun 2013 di            mulai bulan Mei, bersama-sama dengan pengaruh semakin rendahnya harga komoditas sejak
Indonesia cukup          tahun 2011, telah mendorong sejumlah penyesuaian ekonomi dan kebijakan di Indonesia
signifikan…              pada paruh kedua tahun 2013, yang sekarang masih berlangsung. Bank Indonesia (BI) telah
                         meningkatkan suku bunga BI Rate-nya sebesar 175 basis poin sejak bulan Juni, ketika
                         Pemerintah meningkatkan harga BBM bersubsidi sebesar rata-rata 33 persen. Rupiah telah
                         mencatat depresiasi sebesar 24 persen terhadap dolar AS selama tahun berjalan, terutama
                         sejak bulan Agustus, dan secara riil - tertimbang dengan mitra dagang - telah turun sebesar
                         12,5 persen dari nilai puncak terakhirnya pada bulan Mei hingga Oktober.

…dan pertumbuhan         Pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia telah melambat secara signifikan, menjadi 5,6 persen
telah melambat,          tahun-ke-tahun (yoy) pada kuartal ketiga, melanjutkan penurunan pertumbuhan selama lima

permintaan impor,        2012. Sebagian besar perlambatan didorong oleh perlemahan investasi, yang sedikit
terutama bagi barang-    meningkat menjadi 4,5 persen yoy pada kuartal ketiga, yang mencerminkan kontraksi
barang modal, dan        investasi peralatan dan permesinan dibandingkan tahun lalu. Perlemahan investasi
membantu                 mengurangi impor barang modal, nilai impor dolar AS lebih rendah sebesar 16,3 persen yoy
menstabilkan defisit     dari 3 bulan ke Oktober. Volume impor secara keseluruhan telah melemah dan mencatat
neraca transaksi         kontraksi yang signifikan pada kuartal ketiga. Volume ekspor juga mencatat kontraksi secara
berjalan                 berurutan pada kuartal ketiga, namun tidak sebesar kontraksi impor, sehingga selisih ekspor
                         bersih menambah secara signifikan kepada pertumbuhan produksi. Secara keseluruhan,
                         terdapat tanda-tanda bahwa neraca perdagangan Indonesia sedang bergeser menuju
                         stabilisasi dan mulai mempersempit defisit neraca transaksi berjalan secara keseluruhan.

Sejauh ini penyesuaian       Secara umum penyesuaian kurs tukar dan kebijakan moneter yang dilaksanakan pada tahun
ekonomi makro                2013 membawa pengaruh yang positif bagi stabilitas ekonomi makro, dengan depresiasi

bagi stabilitas, namun       penyesuaian itu menghabiskan biaya, dan dapat membawa resiko terutama dengan memberi
berbiaya besar…              tekanan kepada neraca pemerintah dan swasta melalui peningkatan nilai Rupiah dari hutang
                             luar negeri (terutama jika terdapat selisih penerimaaan dan pengeluaran valuta) dan mengikis
                             penerimaan karena lebih tingginya biaya pelunasan hutang dan biaya impor.

…dan sementara               Kebijakan penyesuaian moneter dan kurs tukar membawa beban bagi penyesuaian makro
APBN 2014 mengambil          jangka pendek. APBN 2014, yang disahkan DPR pada tanggal 25 Oktober, mempertahankan
sikap yang hati-hati,        sikap non-ekspansifnya, dengan memproyeksikan penurunan defisit fiskal menjadi sebesar
namun tidak                  1,7 persen dari PDB secara keseluruhan. APBN 2014 tidak memiliki rencana reformasi
mengandung reformasi         penerimaan atau pengeluaran besar apapun, walau terdapat penurunan alokasi subsidi listrik
fiskal besar apapun          sebesar 29 persen dibanding tahun 2013, yang mencerminkan rencana untuk melanjutkan
                             penyesuaian naik bagi tarif yang masih berlangsung. Dengan dampak positif kenaikan harga
                             BBM bersubsidi pada Juni 2013 diimbangi oleh perlemahan Rupiah, alokasi untuk subsidi
                             BBM direncanakan tetap signifikan pada 2014 sebesar IDR 211 triliun (atau 2 persen dari
                             PDB), atau naik IDR 11 triliun dibandingkan APBN-P 2013.

                             perkembangan kebijakan dan ekonomi dalam negeri. Selain risiko-risiko yang terkait dengan
                             pertumbuhan, juga terdapat risiko-risiko terhadap prospek fiskal. Sebagai contoh, Bank
                             Dunia memperkirakan bahwa depresiasi Rupiah sebesar 10 persen akan meningkatkan defisit
                             fiskal sebesar 0,3-0,4 poin persentase dari PDB, yang umumnya berasal dari peningkatan
                             biaya subsidi BBM (lihat IEQ edisi bulan Oktober 2013).

                          yang lebih kuat, misalnya, karena semakin terbatasnya pembiayaan eksternal atau pengaruh

merusak yang              pendapatan dan harga relatif dapat berguna untuk proses penyesuaian jangka pendek,
ditujukan pada            tantangan kebijakan sesungguhnya bagi Indonesia adalah tidak memfokuskan pada tambahan

                          Karenanya, terdapat kebutuhan yang jelas untuk membuat kemajuan lebih lanjut dalam
                          mendukung FDI, dengan mendorong revisi daftar negatif investasi (DNI) yang mendukung
                          investasi, yang menjadi inti dari paket kebijakan Pemerintah pada bulan Agustus yang kini

                          kebijakan investasi untuk meminimalkan ketidakpastian kebijakan. Pemerintah juga telah
                          meluncurkan paket kebijakan yang cukup berarti untuk meningkatkan kemudahan

                          dalam delapan bidang “Doing Business”. Kini tantangannya adalah melaksanakan paket itu
                          sesuai dengan jadwal waktu yang ambisius pada bulan Februari 2014, untuk memberikan
                          pesan yang positif kepada lingkungan dunia usaha dan komitmen dalam implementasi

…dan perbaikan            Depresiasi riil Rupiah selama 2013, dengan meningkatkan daya saing internasional, membuka

                  eksternal tetap ada
Kinerja pertumbuhan    Kondisi ekonomi di ekonomi terbesar dunia, dan para mitra perdagangan utama Indonesia,
negara-negara mitra    tetap tidak merata. Zona Eropa akhirnya keluar dari resesi pada triwulan kedua tahun 2013,
dagang utama           setelah mencatat kontraksi selama enam triwulan berturut-turut, namun pertumbuhan
Indonesia tetap        kembali melemah pada triwulan ketiga (ke 0,4 persen triwulan-ke-triwulan (quarter-to-quarter,
beragam menjelang      qoq) pada tingkat disetahunkan dengan penyesuaian musiman (seasonally-adjusted annualized rate,
akhir 2013…            saar), menunjukkan jalur pemulihan tidaklah mulus. Pertumbuhan juga melemah di Jepang
                       pada triwulan ketiga, menjadi 1,1 persen qoq saar, sementara, sebaliknya, pertumbuhan AS
                       menguat ke 3,6 persen qoq saar, yang mencerminkan bahwa ekonomi AS terus meningkat
                       dengan cukup stabil selama tahun 2013. Di antara ekonomi-ekonomi berkembang utama,
                       pertumbuhan di Cina meningkat ke 9,3 qoq saar, namun output di Brasil berkontraksi pada
                       triwulan ketiga dibanding triwulan kedua, sebesar 0,5 persen (dengan penyesuaian musiman)
                       dan pertumbuhan relatif lemah di India (4,8 persen tahun-ke-tahun (year-on-year, yoy), pada
                       triwulan ketiga) walau belakangan ini tampaknya pertumbuhan akan kembali menguat.

…namun permintaan      Melihat ke depan ke tahun 2014, pertumbuhan di negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi
global diperkirakan    diperkirakan akan tetap atau meningkat dari laju saat ini, dengan pemulihan Zona Eropa
akan sedikit membaik   yang masih rapuh diperkirakan akan berlanjut, dan ekonomi AS diperkirakan akan meningkat
pada tahun 2014…       dengan laju yang mendekati lajunya sekarang. Didukung dengan ekspansi ringan ini,
                       pertumbuhan negara-negara berkembang juga diperkirakan akan turut meningkat, dengan
                       ekonomi Cina meningkat sebesar 7,7 persen pada tahun 2014, dan pertumbuhan negara
                       berkembang selain Cina meningkat melampaui 4 persen pada tahun 2014, naik dari sekitar
                       3,5 persen pada tahun 2013. Sejalan dengan itu, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan pertumbuhan
                       para mitra perdagangan Indonesia secara rata-rata tertimbang akan meningkat menjadi 3,9
                       persen pada tahun 2014, naik sebesar 0,5 poin persentase dari tahun 2013. Dengan demikian,
                       pada base case , permintaan internasional akan meningkat secara moderat selama tahun 2014,
                       mendorong keberlanjutan ekspansi yang tidak besar bagi permintaan ekspor Indonesia.

 Pertumbuhan melambat,                                                            Perkembangan Triwulanan

…dan harga komoditas          Harga-harga komoditas internasional pada umumnya telah meningkat selama beberapa bulan
utama Indonesia               terakhir. Indeks harga tertimbang untuk sepuluh komoditas ekspor utama Indonesia dalam
mungkin akan stabil           dolar AS, yang merupakan sekitar setengah dari jumlah penerimaan ekspor, menurun pada
kembali, setelah              bulan September dan kemudian kembali meningkat menjelang akhir bulan November, berkat
mengalami penurunan           naiknya harga batubara, gas alam, dan minyak sawit (Gambar 1). Sebagai akibatnya,
selama dua tahun              penurunan tahun berjalan hingga bulan November menurun ke 2,5 persen dari 7 persen
                              pada bulan September. Namun indeks itu masih 22 persen lebih rendah dari nilai puncaknya
                              pada bulan Februari 2011, dengan harga-harga batubara (turun 40 persen), minyak sawit
                              (turun 37 persen), dan tembaga (turun 27 persen) yang mencatat kemunduran drastis dari
                              tingkat harganya pada tahun 2011. Bila tren peningkatan itu berlanjut, stabilisasi harga-harga
                              komoditas yang baru dimulai itu dapat membantu memperlambat penurunan kondisi
                              perdagangan Indonesia yang menjadi pendorong sebagian besar penurunan dalam neraca
                              eksternalnya. Namun, prospek dasar (base line) yang hanya melihat peningkatan kondisi
                              pertumbuhan dunia yang moderat selama tahun 2014, bersama-sama dengan kemungkinan
                              pengetatan kondisi likuiditas global dan faktor-faktor sisi penawaran yang lebih struktural
                              yang memberikan tekanan terhadap harga-harga, tidak memproyeksikan peningkatan besar
                              dalam harga-harga komoditas. Selain itu, seperti dibahas pada IEQ edisi bulan Oktober 2013,
                              kondisi perdagangan Indonesia masih menghadapi kenyataan bahwa harga minyak dunia,
                              yang mempengaruhi jumlah impor BBM yang cukup besar bagi Indonesia, masih tetap relatif
                              tinggi dibanding harga-harga komoditas bukan energi.

Namun ketidakpastian          Sementara perkiraan adanya sedikit peningkatan dalam pertumbuhan global pada tahun 2014
kebijakan yang terus          merupakan hal yang secara umum positif bagi Indonesia karena hal ini akan mendongkrak
berlangsung                   permintaan ekspor secara keseluruhan, prospek internasional masih diliputi ketidakpastian
membebani prospek             kebijakan-kebijakan besar, yang mempertahankan tingginya risiko skenario pertumbuhan
internasional…                global yang lebih buruk. Di Eropa, tingginya tingkat pengangguran (12 persen di Zona
                              Eropa), kesenjangan produksi (output gap) yang lebar, dan berlanjutnya kontraksi kredit
                              mendorong risiko deflasi, sementara reformasi yang selama ini telah menyedot sumber daya
                              dapat menyulitkan tercapainya reformasi yang dibutuhkan untuk mendorong pertumbuhan
                              struktural. Hal ini akan menambah kerumitan pemulihan ekonomi. Di Asia, laju dan
                              bagaimana penerapan upaya reformasi struktural yang ambisius di Cina dan Jepang, dan

…dan pembiayaan         Di atas semua itu, dampak terhadap pasar keuangan dunia dan pada akhirnya ekonomi riil,
eksternal dan kondisi   dan waktu, dari penghapusan bertahap program pembelian aset Bank Sentral AS (yang
pasar masih             disebut sebagai “tapering”) masih tidak pasti, yang menjadikan risiko gejolak pasar
menantang               internasional dan kondisi pembiayaan eksternal yang lebih sulit menjadi perhatian utama.
                        Yield AS tetap lebih tinggi dibanding sebelum rencana penghapusan pada bulan Mei, dengan
                        yield obligasi Pemerintah AS 10-tahunan sebesar 2,9 persen pada 11 Desember, naik dari 1,6
                        persen pada bulan April. Biaya pinjaman surat berharga negara dalam dolar AS untuk pasar-
                        pasar berkembang telah meningkat rata-rata sekitar 160 basis poin pada tahun 2013 (seperti
                        diukur melalui yield campuran dari JP Morgan Emerging Market Bond Index). Dengan upaya
                        Bank Sentral AS untuk melakukan normalisasi kebijakan moneter, kemungkinan naiknya
                        tekanan pada biaya pinjaman global untuk jangka yang lebih panjang, seiring dengan
                        terjadinya sejumlah gejolak pasar seperti yang terjadi pada upaya penghapusan pada bulan
                        Mei-Agustus, akan tetap menjadi perhatian. Dengan demikian, pasar-pasar berkembang,
                        termasuk Indonesia, menghadapi pengetatan kondisi likuiditas global, yang memberikan
                        tekanan naik terhadap beban pembiayaan eksternal mereka dan berpotensi mempersulit
                        kebergantungan kepada aliran masuk investasi portofolio bersih untuk memenuhi kebutuhan
                        pembiayaan eksternal.

                2. Walau konsumsi kuat, pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia melambat
Pertumbuhan ekonomi     Pengetatan kondisi pembiayaan eksternal, yang dimulai pada bulan Mei, telah menambah
Indonesia melanjutkan   transmisi bertahap dari rendahnya harga-harga komoditas sejak tahun 2011, yang mendorong
perlambatannya pada     sejumlah penyesuaian ekonomi dan kebijakan yang penting di Indonesia, dan membebani
triwulan 3…             pertumbuhan. Laju ekspansi ekonomi Indonesia telah melambat, suatu tren yang oleh Bank
                        Dunia diperkirakan akan berlanjut setidaknya hingga masa awal tahun 2014. PDB riil pada
                        triwulan ketiga meningkat 5,6 persen tahun-ke-tahun (yoy), yang menandai perlemahan
                        pertumbuhan selama lima triwulan berturut-turut secara tahun-ke-tahun, yang turun dari nilai
                        tingginya sebesar 6,4 persen pada triwulan kedua tahun 2012 (Gambar 3). Secara berurutan,
                        pertumbuhan pada triwulan ketiga melambat ke 5,0 persen triwulan-ke-triwulan dengan
                        penyesuaian musiman (qoq saar), turun dari 5,5 persen pada dua triwulan yang lalu dan nilai
                        tingginya sebesar 6,6 persen pada triwulan keempat 2012. Berlawanan dengan PDB riil,
                        pertumbuhan PDB nominal meningkat tajam, ke 12,1 persen yoy pada triwulan 3 dari 8,2
                        persen yoy pada triwulan 2, yang mencerminkan peningkatan dalam pertumbuhan deflator
                        PDB—pengukuran harga-harga yang paling luas dalam ekonomi—yang sebelumnya telah
                        jatuh ke tingkat yang sangat rendah. Hal ini sejalan dengan peningkatan tajam dalam harga
                        konsumen pasca kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni (Gambar 4), dan
                        tampaknya juga mencerminkan lebih tingginya harga impor yang berasal dari depresiasi
                        Rupiah.

…terutama               Pendorong utama moderasi pertumbuhan pada triwulan ketiga adalah investasi tetap, yang
mencerminkan            sedikit meningkat sebesar 2,6 persen triwulan-ke-triwulan dengan penyesuaian musiman (qoq
pertumbuhan investasi   saar) menjadi 4,5 persen lebih tinggi yoy. Pertumbuhan investasi, walau bergejolak lintas
yang lemah…             triwulanan, telah mencatat tren penurunan sejak nilai puncaknya sebesar 12,5 persen yoy pada
                        triwulan kedua tahun 2012 (Gambar 5). Investasi bangunan, yang merupakan 85 persen dari
                        jumlah nominal belanja investasi tetap, tetap kokoh, dan bahkan meningkat pesat sebesar 9,5
                        persen (qoq saar) pada triwulan ketiga. Perlambatan dalam investasi secara keseluruhan telah
                        didorong oleh komponen-komponen belanja investasi yang lebih kecil namun lebih
                        bergejolak. Belanja untuk barang-barang mesin, peralatan, dan transportasi dari luar negeri
                        (yang membentuk sebagian besar dari investasi tetap bukan bangunan) hampir datar pada
                        triwulan ketiga dibanding triwulan kedua, sehingga gerakannya jauh di bawah tingkatan
                        setahun yang lalu (dengan barang permesinan dan peralatan luar negeri turun sebesar
                        masing-masing 0,5 persen dan 8,4 persen yoy).

Sektor konstruksi tetap   Pada sisi produksi, penurunan pertumbuhan bersifat luas lintas sektor pada triwulan ketiga,
kuat pada triwulan 3,     namun sebagian besar terpusat pada manufaktur dan perdagangan, hotel dan rumah makan.

                          bergerak mendatar dibanding triwulan kedua menurut penyesuaian musiman, dengan
                          peningkatan produksi sebesar 1,6 persen yoy, namun hal ini menutupi tren yang berbeda pada
                          dua sub-sektor utama pertambangan: produksi minyak mentah dan gas alam masih tetap
                          lemah (turun 3,0 persen yoy), sementara produksi non-migas meningkat, naik sebesar 3,2
                          persen qoq saar, yang secara potensial mencerminkan peningkatan produksi menjelang
                          penerapan larangan ekspor mineral mentah pada bulan Januari 2014 (lihat Kotak 1).

…dan pertumbuhan               Bank Dunia memperkirakan pertumbuhan PDB Indonesia akan semakin melambat, menjadi
produksi (output)              5,3 persen untuk tahun 2014 menurut base case (Tabel 2). Permintaan dalam negeri
diproyeksikan akan             menghadapi keterbatasan tidak hanya dari kondisi pembiayaan yang lebih ketat, seperti
semakin melambat               dibahas lebih lanjut pada Bagian 5, namun juga keterbatasan yang secara potensial lebih
                               berjangka panjang karena harga-harga komoditas dan kondisi perdagangan yang kurang
                               mendukung dibanding tahun-tahun sebelumnya. Secara khusus, konsumsi swasta, andalan
                               ekonomi Indonesia, sejauh ini tetap kokoh, namun tampaknya akan menerima lebih banyak
                               tekanan, sehingga akan mengganggu pertumbuhan. Prospek investasi bergantung pada
                               investasi pergedungan—yang tengah dihadapkan pada kredit yang lebih ketat, penurunan
                               dana yang dapat diinvestasikan dari laba yang berkaitan dengan komoditas, dan peningkatan
                               biaya impor (seperti dibahas pada Bagian 4)—yang tampaknya juga akan melambat. Belanja
                               yang berkaitan dengan pemilu pada tahun 2014 tampaknya akan menambah permintaan
                               dalam negeri secara material, karena kegiatan yang berkaitan dengan kampanye akan
                               meningkatkan konsumsi swasta, walau hanya sementara, dan sebagian darinya dapat
                               tergantikan dengan belanja lainnya. Secara keseluruhan, risiko-risiko terhadap prospek
                               pertumbuhan condong kepada penurunan, seperti dibahas pada Bagian 7.

                   3. Inflasi IHK telah normal namun inflasi inti meningkat

Inflasi di tingkat       Harga-harga konsumen telah bergejolak selama tahun 2013, utamanya mencerminkan
konsumen bergejolak      pertama-tama dampak pembatasan perdagangan bahan pangan tertentu (yang kemudian
selama tahun 2013…       dilepaskan) dan dampak peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni. Namun
                         demikian dampak langsung dari peningkatan harga BBM kini telah memudar dan penurunan
                         inflasi bahan pangan telah terjadi pasca Idul Fitri, tekanan-tekanan inflasi yang mendasarinya
                         (seperti diukur melalui IHK inti) telah meningkat secara signifikan sejak bulan Mei. Ke
                         depannya, tantangan kebijakan moneter adalah untuk mengukur risiko berjalan tentang
                         pengaruh yang lebih tinggi dari kurs tukar valuta terhadap harga-harga konsumen (yang
                         sering disebut sebagai “inflasi impor”), dan perkiraan peningkatan harga, yang secara luas
                         diimbangi dengan perkiraan moderasi berkelanjutan dalam permintaan dalam negeri.

…namun momentum          Harga-harga konsumen sebagaimana diukur melalui indeks harga konsumen (IHK)
inflasi IHK telah        meningkat sebesar 5,5 persen dari Juni hingga Agustus, terutama karena peningkatan rata-
melemah karena           rata sebesar 33 persen dalam harga BBM bersubsidi mulai tanggal 22 Juni, dan juga dampak
pudarnya pengaruh        musiman bulan Ramadan, yang jatuh pada bulan Juli/Agustus 2013. Kenaikan tingkat harga
kenaikan BBM             yang tiba-tiba ini telah mendorong peningkatan harga hingga inflasi tahun-ke-tahun menjadi
bersubsidi dan bulan     8,4 persen pada bulan November. Namun momentum inflasi IHK telah berkurang sejak
Ramadan…                 bulan Agustus, dengan IHK umumnya mendatar secara bulan-ke-bulan selama periode
                         tersebut, karena peningkatan harga yang berkaitan dengan transportasi telah mendatar dan
                         harga bahan pangan telah kembali turun secara signifikan dari peningkatan yang berkaitan
                         dengan bulan Ramadan pada pertengahan tahun (Gambar 9).

Harga beras telah            Harga beras dalam negeri, komponen utama dari keranjang konsumsi rumah tangga miskin
sedikit naik, walau          di Indonesia, meningkat sebesar 5,1 persen yoy pada bulan November. Peningkatan yang
tetap berada cukup           relatif kecil ini disebabkan oleh produksi yang relatif baik. Perkiraan resmi peningkatan
tinggi di atas harga         produksi beras Indonesia untuk tahun 2013 adalah sebesar 2,6 persen setelah panen terakhir
internasional                tahun itu, menjadi 70,87 juta ton (44,6 juta ton setelah digiling), terutama mencerminkan
                             peningkatan lahan, karena hasil panen diperkirakan tetap setara dengan catatan hasil panen
                             yang tinggi pada tahun 2012 sebesar 5,1 ton per hektar. Sedikitnya peningkatan dalam harga
                             beras dalam negeri juga berkontribusi dalam semakin kecilnya selisih harga beras di
                             Indonesia dan jenis yang setara di pasar internasional (dari Thailand atau Vietnam). Catatan
                             rekor harga beras di Indonesia adalah 90-110 persen lebih tinggi (bergantung pada kualitas)
                             dibanding harga internasional pada bulan Juni, dan perbedaan itu turun menjadi 50-60
                             persen lebih tinggi pada bulan November. Penurunan selisih harga beras antara Indonesia
                             dan pasar internasional juga didorong oleh peningkatan dalam harga beras internasional
                             dalam denominasi Rupiah (termasuk peningkatan masing-masing sebesar 8 persen dan 29
                             persen untuk beras kualitas menengah dari Vietnam dalam dolar AS dan dalam Rupiah).

Namun kenaikan               Walau tidak adanya kenaikan dalam IHK merupakan indikasi yang menggembirakan bahwa
inflasi inti,                secara keseluruhan tekanan harga konsumen tetap terkendali, pola inflasi inti yang
menunjukkan bahwa            belakangan terjadi—yang tidak menyertakan barang-barang volatil seperti bahan pangan dan
masih dibutuhkan             BBM—menuntut kehati-hatian kita (Gambar 10). IHK inti meningkat sebesar 4,8 persen yoy

…terutama terkait            Salah satu sumber tekanan kenaikan inflasi inti sejak bulan Mei tampaknya adalah depresiasi
dengan tekanan               Rupiah yang, walau secara umum mendukung penyesuaian ekonomi Indonesia terhadap
pendorong biaya (cost        keterbatasan eksternal, juga mendorong tekanan inflasi yang diakibatkan biaya melalui harga
push) dari perlemahan        barang-barang impor. Dengan depresiasi Rupiah yang cukup signifikan sebesar 24 persen
Rupiah                       selama tahun berjalan, peningkatan inflasi inti sejauh ini masih relatif kecil. Namun, dengan
                             tidak adanya kontrafakta, perlu dipahami bahwa inflasi mungkin bisa lebih rendah lagi bila
                             tidak ada depresiasi Rupiah. Perlemahan Rupiah tampaknya juga akan terus mendorong
                             terjadinya inflasi dengan jeda waktu, karena importir dapat menyerap beban impor yang lebih
                             tinggi selama jangka waktu tertentu demi menjaga pangsa pasar, namun kemudian
                             mengalihkan beban peningkatan itu sebagai akibat dari terus terkikisnya keuntungan. Selain
                             itu, dengan sebagian besar penyesuaian Rupiah sejauh ini hanya terjadi sejak bulan Agustus,

                          masih terlalu dini untuk mengetahui apakah depresiasi Rupiah akan mempengaruhi inflasi.
                          Berdasarkan pengalaman, depresiasi Rupiah sebesar 10 persen diperkirakan akan menambah
                          sekitar 0,5 poin persentase terhadap inflasi pada suatu triwulan tertentu.

Pada skenario dasar ,     Pada skenario dasar (base case), tekanan inflasi diperkirakan akan tetap terkendali, sejalan
inflasi IHK               dengan prospek pertumbuhan yang lebih lemah, dengan inflasi IHK menurun secara
diperkirakan akan         bertahap melalui triwulan kedua 2014 ke kisaran 7,5 persen. Inflasi IHK lalu diperkirakan
tetap di bawah nilai      akan turun dengan tajam karena dampak dari perubahan harga BBM pada bulan Juni 2013
puncaknya, namun          mengubah jatuhnya dasar perhitungan triwulan ketiga 2014, mengikuti IHK yang akan
tekanan inflasi inti      kembali berada di bawah plafon angka sasaran BI pada 3,5-5,5 persen yoy. Namun, inflasi inti
tetap meningkat pada      diperkirakan akan terdorong naik pada beberapa bulan ke depan (menjadi sekitar 5,5 persen
paruh pertama tahun       pada triwulan pertama tahun 2014) karena kurs tukar dan kenaikan upah, termasuk dampak
2014                      dari upah minimum yang baru untuk tahun 2014 (termasuk peningkatan sebesar 11 persen
                          yang disetujui untuk DKI Jakarta). Risiko terhadap perkiraan inflasi skenario dasar (base case)
                          adalah seimbang, dengan prospek tergantung pada pengaruh dari depresiasi Rupiah,
                          penetapan upah minimum tahun 2014, dan faktor-faktor sementara seperti peningkatan
                          belanja pemilu pada triwulan pertama 2014, dibandingkan dengan tren pertumbuhan
                          permintaan dalam negeri yang lebih lemah dan lebih ketatnya kondisi keuangan.

                4. Defisit neraca transaksi berjalan Indonesia masih menjadi fokus, walau
                   impor melemah
Tekanan neraca            Defisit neraca transaksi berjalan Indonesia menunjukkan tanda-tanda menuju kestabilan pada

prospek ekonomi           signifikan (sebesar 3,3 miliar dolar AS pada tirwulan ketiga). Selisih ini menyoroti
Indonesia                 berlanjutnya ketergantungan Indonesia terhadap aliran masuk investasi portofolio yang
                          berpotensi untuk berubah arah dengan mudah, suatu potensi kerentanan yang tampaknya
                          tetap menjadi fokus utama bagi para pembuat kebijakan dan investor. Selain itu, walau beban
                          hutang luar negeri Indonesia secara keseluruhan tidak besar, pembayaran kembali hutang luar
                          negeri berjumlah signifikan, menambah risiko valuta dan pembiayaan kembali yang dihadapi
                          oleh Pemerintah dan sektor korporat dalam konteks ketidakpastian yang masih terus
                          berlangsung di pasar keuangan internasional. Pada skenario dasar (base case), saldo neraca
                          transaksi berjalan diperkirakan akan menyusut selama tahun 2014, namun kemungkinan
                          adanya perbaikan sedikit meningkat, dan biaya ekonomi dari penyusutan impor, menuntut
                          adanya keberlanjutan fokus kebijakan kepada peningkatan kinerja ekspor dan mendukung
                          investasi asing langsung (foreign, direct investment, FDI) sebagai sumber pembiayaan eksternal
                          yang berkualitas tinggi.

Defisit neraca berjalan   Pada triwulan ketiga tahun 2013, defisit neraca berjalan mencapai 8,4 miliar dolar AS, atau
Indonesia menyempit       3,8 persen dari PDB (Gambar 11), lebih rendah dari defisit 10 miliar dolar AS atau 4,4 persen
menjadi 3,8 persen dari   dari PDB yang tercatat pada triwulan kedua. Indikasi awal untuk triwulan terakhir tahun 2013
PDB pada triwulan 3       adalah bahwa penyempitan bertahap ini akan terus berlanjut, dengan kembalinya neraca
dari 4,4 persen pada      perdagangan barang bulanan ke surplus kecil (42 juta dolar AS) pada bulan Oktober, seperti
triwulan 2                diukur oleh BPS, walau dengan pergerakan yang begejolak.

Ekspor non-migas          Neraca perdagangan barang non-migas kembali mencatat surplus pada bulan Agustus setelah
mencatat penerimaan       mengalami defisit selama empat bulan berturut-turut, dan tetap bertahan positif pada bulan
yang melemah pada         Oktober (Gambar 12). Ekspor non-migas melambat selama triwulan ketiga, yang sebagian

menunjukkan tanda-        awal triwulan itu, dan dampak perlemahan liburan Idul Fitri terhadap ekspor. Dalam hal
tanda peningkatan         ekspor non-migas, penerimaan ekspor manufaktur turun sebesar 2,8 persen dibanding
memasuki triwulan 4…      penerimaan pada triwulan ketiga tahun 2012, sementara penerimaan ekspor non-manufaktur
                          (termasuk seluruh komoditas utama non-migas) turun sebesar 8,1 persen dibanding triwulan
                          ketiga tahun 2012. Indikasi-indikasi awal kinerja ekspor pada triwulan keempat cukup baik,
                          dengan penguatan ekspor lintas wilayah, dan penerimaan ekspor non-migas Indonesia
                          meningkat sebesar 2,5 persen yoy pada bulan Oktober, yang sepertinya terbantu dengan

                             dibahas pada Bagian 2, volume ekspor secara umum tampaknya juga tetap bertahan sesuai
                             dengan data triwulan ketiga terakhir yang tersedia, dengan peningkatan sebesar 5,3 persen
                             yoy, yang menunjukkan pengaruh penurunan penerimaan ekspor dari rendahnya harga-harga
                             dan mengisyaratkan kemungkinan kembali naiknya penerimaan ekspor pada triwulan-
                             triwulan mendatang bila harga komoditas menjadi stabil dan permintaan luar negeri terus
                             meningkat tipis. Namun, terdapat risiko yang signifikan terhadap ekspor, yang berasal dari
                             perdebatan akan pembatasan ekspor bahan mineral mentah, yang dibahas pada Kotak 1.

…sementara defisit           Sebagian besar perlemahan pada keseluruhan neraca berjalan Indonesia sejak akhir tahun
perdagangan migas            2011 disebabkan oleh jatuhnya surplus perdagangan non-migas, yang umumnya didorong
tampaknya relatif tidak      oleh penurunan harga-harga komoditas ekspor. Namun, neraca perdagangan migas bulanan
terpengaruh oleh             Indonesia juga menjadi beban besar terhadap keseluruhan neraca perdagangan, dan telah
peningkatan harga            menjadi defisit sejak bulan Agustus 2012. Defisit perdagangan migas mencapai 2,4 miliar
BBM bersubsidi               dolar AS pada triwulan kedua dan meningkat ke 3,9 miliar dolar AS pada triwulan ketiga,
                             yang diperbesar oleh peningkatan permintaan BBM terkait dengan musim liburan, namun
                             juga menunjukkan bahwa permintaan impor minyak telah relatif tidak sensitif terhadap
                             peningkatan tajam harga BBM bersubsidi yang dilaksanakan pada bulan Juni. Data bulanan
                             selanjutnya, untuk bulan Oktober, memang menunjukkan penurunan yang signifikan dalam
                             impor migas—dengan defisit migas menyusut sebesar 50 persen bulan-ke-bulan ke 750 juta
                             dolar AS—namun mengingat volatilitas data bulanan, informasi ini tidak cukup untuk
                             mengukur seberapa signifikan pengaruh dari dorongan impor BBM ini.

                             persen dari seluruh beban impor, selama 12 tahun hingga bulan Oktober) namun telah
                             mendatar sejak bulan Agustus pada tingkat yang serupa dengan satu tahun yang lalu. Impor
                             migas merupakan satu-satunya kelompok impor utama yang tetap bertahan tinggi selama
                             triwulan ketiga, namun, seperti disinggung di atas, nilainya pun mencatat perlambatan yang
                             signifikan pada bulan Oktober (Gambar 13).

ekonomi                          sektor yang paling banyak melakukan impor terdiri dari bahan-bahan khusus bagi produksi,

                                 tampaknya akan membantu melanjutkan penurunan beban impor (Gambar 14), namun juga
                                 dapat membawa implikasi bagi lapangan kerja dan penerimaan dari sektor-sektor tersebut.
                                 Selain itu, seperti diuraikan pada IEQ edisi bulan Maret 2013, terdapat komponen input
                                 impor yang cukup besar yang digunakan dalam produksi ekspor non-komoditas Indonesia.
                                 Lebih tingginya biaya input-yang-diimpor-ke-produksi—karena depresiasi Rupiah yang terus
                                 berlangsung atau kebijakan-kebijakan lain yang bertujuan untuk menekan impor—dengan
                                 demikian juga berpotensi untuk membebani daya saing ekspor, yang mengurangi nilai
                                 sejumlah manfaat dari depresiasi kurs tukar riil.

Indonesia tampaknya              Penyusutan impor telah terlihat, seperti diuraikan di atas, dan bahkan defisit perdagangan
akan tetap bertahan              migas yang telah terjadi sejak bulan Agustus 2012 memperlihatkan sejumlah tanda-tanda
                                 penyempitan. Walau baik untuk mengembalikan neraca eksternal Indonesia ke posisi yang
                                 berkelanjutan, namun tetap ada harga yang harus dibayar dari penyusutan impor tersebut,
                                 sementara laju peningkatan sejauh ini masih berlangsung perlahan. Hal ini berarti kerentanan
                                 pembiayaan eksternal tetap akan menjadi soroton untuk sementara waktu.

PDB pada tahun 2014        bertahan, walau menyusut menjadi 22,8 miliar dolar AS (2,6 persen dari PDB), yang
                           didukung oleh lemahnya pertumbuhan impor dan peningkatan tipis dalam permintaan
                           ekspor (Tabel 3). Namun, skenario dasar (baseline) ini tetap bergantung kepada dukungan
                           yang memadai dari kondisi pembiayaan eksternal, sejalan dengan kenyataan bahwa Indonesia
                           tampaknya akan tetap mempertahankan keadaan defisit neraca pembayaran dasarnya pada
                           tahun 2014. Hal ini semakin meningkatkan kebergantungan Indonesia terhadap aliran
                           investasi portofolio yang berpotensi bergejolak. Selain itu, risiko khusus lain bagi neraca
                           perdagangan adalah dampak dari pelarangan ekspor bahan mineral mentah, yang
                           dijadwalkan akan mulai berlaku pada bulan Januari 2014 (Kotak 1).

Kotak 1: Potensi dampak jangka pendek dari usulan larangan ekspor bahan mineral mentah terhadap neraca perdagangan
Indonesia
Menjelang tahun 2014, perhatian beralih ke potensi dampak usulan pelarangan ekspor bahan mentah, yang direncanakan akan berlaku mulai bulan
Januari 2014. UU Pertambangan tahun 2009 (UU 4/2009) mengharuskan semua pemegang izin usaha pertambangan (IUP) dan kontrak karya (KK)
untuk ‘memberikan nilai tambah’ pada produk-produk pertambangannya melalui pemurnian dan pengolahan dalam negeri dalam batas waktu
pemenuhan kepatuhan selama lima tahun. Awalnya, peraturan ini direncanakan untuk mulai diberlakukan pada bulan Mei 2012, namun usulan
larangan itu ditunda hingga bulan Januari 2014. Berdasarkan peraturan ini, pemegang IUP dan KK tidak diperkenankan untuk mengekspor bijih
mineral atau produk olahan, termasuk bijih besi, tembaga, nikel, timah dan bauksit, yang memiliki kandungan mineral di bawah batas minimum – yang
semuanya membutuhkan kapasitas peleburan (smelter).*

Pada saat penulisan laporan ini, rincian pelaksanaan usulan larangan tersebut masih dalam pembahasan. Sebagian mencerminkan keprihatinan akan
potensi dampak jangka pendek terhadap ekspor mineral Indonesia, tepat pada saat Indonesia sedang menghadapi tekanan pembiayaan eksternal yang
signifikan. Komoditas merupakan sebagian besar dari ekspor Indonesia, yang menurut nilainya mencapai sekitar dua per tiga ekspor barang
perdagangan. Ekspor mineral yang telah dan belum diproses saja mencapai 10,4 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2012, sekitar 5 persen dari jumlah ekspor.
Keseluruhan bagian dari ekspor mineral yang telah terproses di dalam ekspor mineral telah mencatat kenaikan, dari 40 persen pada tahun 2001
menjadi 52 persen pada tahun 2012.

Secara luas, terdapat tiga jalur perdagangan langsung yang mana larangan ekspor bijih mineral dapat berdampak kepada neraca perdagangan Indonesia.
Pertama adalah dampak negatif melalui penurunan ekspor mineral yang belum diproses. Pengaruh kedua bersifat positif terhadap ekspor bila terdapat
peningkatan volume mineral yang telah diproses. Pengaruh ketiga, melalui impor barang modal dan bahan setengah jadi untuk membangun dan
mengoperasikan fasilitas peleburan, akan memberikan dampak negatif terhadap neraca perdagangan. Dibutuhkan serangkaian asumsi untuk dapat
melakukan perkiraan atas pengaruh-pengaruh ini, mulai dari permintaan eksternal masa depan atas mineral mentah dan telah diproses hingga porsi
impor dari biaya modal dan operasional peleburan, dan yang terpenting, tentang waktu dan skala investasi yang diperlukan terkait dengan kapasitas
peleburan. Dengan demikian, perkiraan apapun yang dilakukan akan memiliki faktor ketidakpastian yang cukup besar.

Terdapat sejumlah besar usulan rencana fasilitas peleburan, namun kemungkinan tidak semua usulan yang telah diumumkan akan dibangun. Selain itu,
bagi usulan-usulan yang layak secara ekonomi, masih terus terdapat ketidakpastian apakah fasilitas peleburan yang diusulkan akan dapat mulai
beroperasi pada awal tahun 2014, terutama karena panjangnya waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk membangun fasilitas peleburan sebelum operasinya dapat
dimulai. Mengingat ketidakpastian ini, dua skenario potensial dapat dipertimbangkan, berkaitan dengan skenario dasar (baseline) di mana larangan
impor itu tidak diterapkan, untuk mensimulasikan dampak potensial penetapan pelarangan itu terhadap neraca perdagangan Indonesia, yang
mencerminkan perbedaan dalam laju mulai diterapkannya usulan kapasitas peleburan baru. Pada skenario pertama, seluruh usulan tambahan peleburan
yang dianggap realistis oleh penelitian terbaru dari SEADI (Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia) tentang topik ini dibangun sesuai jadwal
– fasilitas peleburan akan memulai operasi pada tahun 2014 dan 2015. Pada skenario kedua, tidak ada fasilitas peleburan yang beroperasi pada jadwal
waktu yang ditetapkan oleh peraturan dan larangan ekspor diberlakukan.

Pada skenario pertama, dengan fasilitas peleburan yang layak siap beroperasi sesuai antisipasi SEADI, dampak peningkatan ekspor mineral yang telah
diproses terhadap neraca perdagangan melebihi penurunan ekspor mineral mentah, setidaknya untuk tahun 2014. Selain itu, impor modal untuk
membangun fasilitas peleburan diperkirakan akan memberikan beban yang signifikan terhadap neraca perdagangan. Pada tahun 2014, larangan itu
diproyeksikan akan menambah 6 miliar dolar AS terhadap defisit perdagangan. Namun, mulai tahun 2015, larangan itu akan memberi dampak yang
relatif netral terhadap neraca perdagangan, relatif terhadap skenario dasar (baseline), karena impor modal yang berasal dari pembangunan fasilitas
peleburan akan mulai berkurang dan peningkatan dari ekpor bahan terproses dengan nilai yang lebih tinggi mulai mengimbangi penurunan dalam
ekspor mineral mentah yang disebabkan oleh larangan tersebut.

Pada skenario kedua, dengan tidak adanya fasilitas peleburan baru yang beroperasi, turunnya ekspor mineral mentah sangat membebani neraca
perdagangan, tanpa peningkatan apapun dalam ekspor mineral yang terproses. Nilai nominal dari turunnya penerimaan ekspor semakin meningkat
setiap tahun dari sekitar 5 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2014 ke sekitar 8 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2017, yang mencerminkan “hilangnya peningkatan”
ekspor mineral mentah selama periode tersebut.

Simulasi tersebut menunjukkan potensi risiko penurunan yang signifikan terhadap neraca perdagangan Indonesia yang berasal dari penerapan larangan
tersebut, terutama bila fasilitas peleburan baru di dalam negeri mengalami penundaan yang signifikan, yang mengakibatkan ketidakcukupan kapasitas
untuk memproses mineral mentah di dalam negeri, yang akan berdampak terhadap ekspor mineral. Dengan skenario yang relatif lebih optimistis
sekalipun (yaitu Skenario 1), dengan semua fasilitas peleburan yang layak secara ekonomi sesuai evaluasi SEADI dapat beroperasi, larangan itu masih
akan menyebabkan kejutan negatif yang signifikan terhadap neraca perdagangan Indonesia dengan besaran sekitar 6 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2014.
Kejutan seperti itu akan menambah sekitar 0,6 poin persentase dari PDB terhadap defisit neraca tranksaksi berjalan Indonesia pada tahun 2014 dan
akan menggeser proyeksi defisit neraca tranksaksi berjalan dari 2,6 persen ke 3,2 persen dari PDB, dengan asumsi hal-hal lain tidak berubah. Hal ini
akan mendorong peningkatan kebutuhan pembiayaan eksternal, sementara kondisi pembiayaan dunia sedang tidak mendukung. Selain itu, jika ditinjau
dari sudut pandang investor yang melihat pelaksanaan pelarangan itu sebagai sinyal negatif terhadap kualitas lingkungan kebijakan dalam negeri,
larangan itu dapat mempengaruhi aliran modal portofolio dan FDI (mengimbangi aliran masuk FDI manapun yang berkaitan dengan proyek-proyek
fasilitas peleburan baru manapun). Terkait dengan hal ini, perlu dicatat bahwa simulasi di atas tidak mencakup implikasi jangka yang lebih panjang yang
dapat bersifat distortif dari larangan tersebut terhadap struktur produksi ekonomi, maupun mencakup penilaian yang terperinci tentang tujuan
kebijakan ekonomi yang mendasarinya atau kemungkinan efektivitasnya dalam pencapaian tujuan-tujuan tersebut.

*Peraturan Menteri ESDM 7/2012 mengharuskan pemegang KK dan IUP untuk menyusun rencana fasilitas peleburan, menetapkan standar minimum bagi pemurnian dan
pengolahan dalam negeri, dan menetapkan pelarangan ekspor bijih mineral mentah dalam waktu tiga bulan sejak peraturan itu ditetapkan (per bulan Mei 2012). Sebagian
karena kurangnya kapasitas, pemberlakuan larangan itu kemudian ditunda dengan peraturan Kementerian ESDM 11/2012 hingga bulan Januari 2014. Pada masa jeda dari
bulan Mei 2012 hingga Januari 2014, para pemegang KK diperkenankan untuk tetap melanjutkan ekspor mineral mentah tanpa pembatasan tambahan apapun. Para
pemegang IUP diperkenankan untuk melanjutkan ekspor mineral mentah dengan membayar pajak ekspor sebesar 20 persen dan dapat memperpanjang izin ekspor bulanan.

pengetatan kredit yang   pertumbuhan tercepat sejak penetapan persyaratan uang muka (loan-to-value, LTV) yang lebih

Indikator agregat       Peningkatan suku bunga dan daya saing bagi simpanan, seiring dengan semakin ketatnya
risiko sektor           likuiditas, menyiratkan tekanan naik bagi biaya dana perbankan, yang akan mengakibatkan
perbankan tetap sehat   penyusutan margin bunga bersih, walau jumlahnya akan bergantung kepada struktur
                        pendanaan masing-masing bank dan kemampuan pemberian harga ulang bagi pinjaman
                        mereka. Namun metrik profitabilitas masih tetap kuat sampai akhir bulan Oktober, dan
                        indikator-indikator agregat sektor perbankan lainnya tetaplah stabil, dengan kredit
                        bermasalah (non-performing loan) masih di bawah 2 persen, kecukupan modal masih jauh di
                        atas standar minimum, dan metrik profitabilitas dalam posisi kuat. Selain itu, risiko sistemik
                        dari Rupiah yang lebih lemah dan suku bunga jangka panjang yang lebih tinggi tampaknya
                        tetap terkendali; uji daya tahan (stress test) Bank Indonesia yang diterbitkan pada Kajian
                        Stabilitas Keuangan bulan Maret 2013 menunjukkan bahwa depresiasi Rupiah sebesar 10
                        persen akan mengakibatkan penurunan dalam rasio kecukupan modal (Capital Adequacy
                        Ration, CAR) agregat bank sebesar 1,0 persen. Penurunan nilai obligasi pemerintah sebesar
                        20 persen akan mengakibatkan penurunan dalam CAR agregat bank sebesar 1,5 persen,
                        dengan penurunan CAR yang lebih besar untuk bank-bank BUMN dan asing, akibat
                        kepemilikan obligasi pemerintah yang lebih besar oleh bank-bank tersebut.

Kegiatan pembiayaan     Selain kredit bank, akses terhadap bentuk-bentuk pembiayaan lain juga telah mengetat.
non-bank juga           Pertumbuhan dalam pinjaman perusahaan pembiayaan, yang berjumlah sekitar 10 persen dari
melambat                seluruh aset sistem finansial, telah melambat menjadi 14 persen yoy pada September 2013,
                        dari pertumbuhan sebesar 32 persen satu tahun sebelumnya. Ke depan, pinjaman non-bank
                        diperkirakan akan semakin melemah, sejalan dengan kondisi kredit dalam negeri yang
                        semakin ketat dan beban pembiayaan luar negeri yang lebih tinggi (dengan pinjaman dari
                        bank-bank asing yang mencapai 22 persen dari seluruh kewajiban perusahaan pembiayaan,
                        dibanding dengan 35 persen pinjaman bank-bank dalam negeri). Penerbitan obligasi
                        perusahaan juga turun tajam sejak bulan Juni, dengan penerbitan hingga akhir November
                        hanya setara dengan 15 persen dari jumlah penerbitan pada triwulan akhir tahun 2012.1

                6. Pertumbuhan pengeluaran publik dan penerimaan pajak telah melemah
                   selama tahun 2013
Defisit fiskal hingga   Sektor fiskal Indonesia terus merasakan dampak dari melemahnya harga komoditas
November 2013           internasional dan depresiasi Rupiah. Berdasarkan hasil realisasi sebelas bulan pertama tahun
berjumlah 50 persen     2013, defisit fiskal selama setahun penuh tampaknya akan relatif sejalan dengan proyeksi
lebih besar dibanding   ABPN-P 2013, karena penerimaan yang diperkirakan akan berada sedikit di bawah sasaran
periode yang sama       tampaknya akan diimbangi dengan pencairan pengeluaran yang lebih rendah secara
tahun lalu…             keseluruhan (dengan belanja subsidi yang melampaui sasaran diimbangi dengan belanja
                        modal dan barang yang lebih rendah dari sasaran). Selama periode Januari hingga November
                        2013, Indonesia mencatat defisit fiskal sebesar 163 triliun rupiah (atau 1,7 persen dari PDB),
                        dibanding 106 triliun rupiah pada periode yang sama tahun lalu. Pengumpulan penerimaan
                        mencatat pertumbuhan yang sedikit lebih tinggi untuk periode ini dibanding pada 2012,
                        sementara pertumbuhan pengeluaran melambat dibanding 2012 namun tingkat pencairannya
                        lebih tinggi (Tabel 5).

…disebabkan lebih       Alasan utama dari defisit fiskal yang secara signifikan lebih besar selama sebelas bulan
tingginya tingkat       pertama tahun 2013 dibanding periode yang sama tahun lalu adalah peningkatan dalam
pencairan belanja…      pencairan belanja. Hal ini terutama terjadi untuk belanja sosial (termasuk selesainya
                        pelaksanaan kompensasi Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat (BLSM) pasca kenaikan
                        harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni) dan belanja modal, walau belanja sosial dan modal
                        mencatat pertumbuhan nominal yang lebih lambat secara keseluruhan untuk periode
                        tersebut pada tahun 2013 dibanding pada 2012. Laju pelaksanaan APBN pada bidang-bidang
                        itu tampaknya dibantu oleh kenyataan bahwa alokasinya pada APBN-P 2013
                        memproyeksikan pertumbuhan nominal yang relatif sedikit dibanding APBN-P 2012.
                        Belanja subsidi BBM selama Januari-November mencatat laju pencairan yang lebih rendah
                        relatif terhadap alokasi APBN-P tahun 2013 dibanding tahun lalu, yang mencapai 87 persen

                            dari sasaran belanja untuk tahun ini. Belanja aktuil subsidi BBM tahun 2013 kemungkinan
                            akan kembali melampaui alokasinya pada APBN-P (dengan pencairan subsidi BBM bulan
                            November masih harus ditambahkan kepada angka-angka di atas, selain juga angka bulan
                            Desember). Subsidi listrik telah mencatat pertumbuhan nominal yoy yang sedikit lebih cepat
                            pada tahun 2013 dibanding tahun lalu, walau dengan peningkatan tarif listrik secara bertahap
                            yang dilakukan pada tahun 2013, dan pencairan yang sedikit lebih tinggi dibanding APBN-P.
                            Namun, hal ini mungkin lebih mencerminkan perbedaan dalam jadwal pembayaran dan
                            bukan peningkatan belanja tahunan riil.

…sementara                  Tren realisasi penerimaan pada sebelas bulan pertama tahun 2013 umumnya serupa dengan
penerimaan dibanding        periode yang sama tahun 2012 terhadap target di APBN-P, walau pertumbuhan nominal yoy
sasaran APBN berada         sedikit lebih tinggi. Hal ini diakibatkan oleh, pada satu sisi, moderasi dalam pertumbuhan
pada tingkat yang           pungutan pajak, sebesar 9 persen yoy dari 13,9 persen yoy pada tahun 2012, dan peningkatan
sama dengan tahun           tipis dalam penerimaan bukan pajak di sisi yang lain. Pajak perdagangan internasional
lalu                        berkontraksi dibanding tahun yang lalu, terutama akibat penurunan dalam pungutan pajak
                            ekspor, yang sejalan dengan melemahnya ekspor, seperti dibahas pada Bagian 4. Pungutan
                            pajak pendapatan dari sektor migas telah melambat, sementara penerimaan sumber daya
                            alam dari migas meningkat. Pola ini tampaknya berkaitan dengan perbedaan waktu dalam
                            pungutan dari kedua jenis penerimaan tersebut. Walau dengan konsumsi swasta yang relatif
                            kuat, pungutan PPN pada sebelas bulan pertama tahun 2013 mencatat pertumbuhan
                            nominal yoy yang lebih lambat dibanding tahun lalu (masing-masing sebesar 13,6 persen
                            dibanding 28,5 persen), dan juga realisasi yang lebih rendah dibanding sasaran tahunan.
                            Karena sekitar 40 persen dari pungutan PPN Indonesia berasal dari impor, perlambatan
                            impor tampaknya berkontribusi secara signifikan terhadap perlemahan ini.

                               jumlah penerbitan terbatas dari hutang-hutang dengan tenor lebih panjang, yang
                               meningkatkan kebergantungan Pemerintah kepada surat hutang negara dengan jangka waktu
                               1 tahun atau kurang. Per tanggal 3 Desember, sejumlah 42,4 triliun rupiah surat hutang
                               negara telah diterbitkan selama tahun 2013, dibanding jumlah penerbitan surat hutang negara
                               sebesar 30,5 triliun rupiah pada tahun 2012. Namun, profil risiko hutang Pemerintah pada
                               akhir tahun 2013, seperti diproyeksikan oleh Direktorat Jenderal Pengelolaan Utang (DJPU),
                               Kementerian Keuangan RI, tetap kuat secara keseluruhan, dengan rata-rata waktu jatuh
                               tempo hutang pemerintah hanya turun tipis, ke 9,6 tahun (dari 9,7 tahun pada 2012). Selain
                               itu, hanya 15,7 persen dari jumlah hutang merupakan suku bunga variabel, walau paparan
                               valuta tetap signifikan dengan 44,6 persen dari jumlah hutang diproyeksikan oleh DJPU
                               dalam denominasi valuta asing pada akhir tahun 2013.

                              Hal itu akan menjadi penghambat yang nyata bagi pertumbuhan, karena persentase konsumsi
                              swasta mencapai sekitar 55 persen dari jumlah pengeluaran.

                       namun juga dalam pengelolaan risiko jangka pendek, dengan mendukung keyakinan investor
                       dalam dan luar negeri kepada jalur lintasan perkembangan Indonesia di masa depan dan
                       aliran masuk modal pembiayaan eksternal yang terkait dengannya.

…dan terus             Pada sektor fiskal, subsidi BBM tetap menjadi sumber risiko fiskal, melemahkan kemampuan
menekankan             kurs tukar yang fleksibel dalam menyerap kejutan (dengan dampak yang signifikan dari
peningkatan kualitas   depresiasi terhadap peningkatan beban subsidi BBM) dan mengalihkan belanja dari beragam
belanja, termasuk      pemanfaatan yang lebih efisien, termasuk investasi publik yang dibutuhkan dalam bidang
melalui reformasi      infrastruktur, perlindungan sosial, dan program kesehatan. Seperti disebutkan pada IEQ edisi
subsidi energi         bulan Oktober, Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa depresiasi Rupiah sebesar 10 persen
                       akan meningkatkan defisit fiskal sebesar 0,3-0,4 poin persentase dari PDB, sebagian besar
                       melalui peningkatan beban subsidi BBM. Hal ini menekankan pentingnya reformasi lanjutan,
                       seperti implementasi pendekatan berdasarkan aturan untuk menentukan harga BBM
                       bersubsidi sedemikian rupa agar membatasi eksposur fiskal Pemerintah terhadap
                       peningkatan harga BBM berdenominasi Rupiah, sementara pada saat yang bersamaan
                       meningkatkan jaring pengaman bagi mereka yang lebih tidak mampu untuk menghadapi
                       kejutan, termasuk yang berkaitan dengan harga-harga yang berhubungan dengan BBM.

Kotak 2: Perkembangan terbaru tentang kebijakan-kebijakan untuk meningkatkan iklim investasi di Indonesia
Pada saat laporan ini disusun, penerapan komponen-komponen paket kebijakan ekonomi bulan Agustus yang dirancang untuk
mempercepat investasi telah kembali ditunda. Tiga dari empat tindakan yang dijanjikan masih belum dilaksanakan: (1) mempercepat
dan menyederhanakan perizinan investasi; (2) mempercepat revisi daftar negatif investasi (DNI) untuk lebih membuka ekonomi
Indonesia bagi investasi asing; dan (3) mempercepat program-program investasi berbasis pertanian (minyak sawit mentah, kakao,
rotan) dan logam mineral (bauksit, nikel, dan tembaga) dengan memberikan pembebasan pajak dan keringanan pajak sebagai insentif.
Sebagai contoh, penurunan jumlah perizinan pada sektor migas dari enam puluh sembilan ke delapan izin belum dilaksanakan, dan
terdapat keprihatinan bahwa perubahan itu hanya akan terbatas kepada pengelompokan izin-izin itu tanpa ada penyederhanaan
prosedur sesungguhnya maupun penyingkatan waktu yang dibutuhkan untuk memperoleh izin-izin itu. Revisi peraturan pelaksanaan
untuk insentif pajak, dan mekanisme pelaksanaannya, masih belum selesai.
Pemerintah terus memberikan pesan-pesan yang saling berlawanan tentang kemajuan revisi DNI. Pada awal bulan November,
Pemerintah mengumumkan bahwa revisi DNI sudah hampir selesai dan menyatakan kembali komitmennya untuk membuka lebih
banyak sektor bagi investasi asing dengan membuka Kemitraan Publik-Swasta (KPS) dalam infrastruktur dan melonggarkan
partisipasi asing pada sejumlah sektor (seperti apotek, rumah sakit khusus, dan transportasi). Pengumuman ini menuai banyak kritik
dari berbagai pihak melalui media*, yang menyatakan bahwa Pemerintah telah gagal melindungi kepentingan nasional. Kalangan usaha
dalam negeri juga telah menyatakan dukungan mereka terhadap perlindungan sejumlah sektor dari persaingan dengan pihak asing.
Pemerintah kemudian mencoba memperlunak pengumuman itu dengan menyatakan bahwa pembahasannya masih jauh dari selesai
dan menegaskan kembali komitmennya untuk melindungi kepentingan nasional. Pembahasan tentang bagaimana kepentingan itu
dapat diseimbangkan dalam revisi DNI masih terus berlanjut.
Upaya yang berkepanjangan untuk memperbaharui DNI menunjukkan debat yang lebih luas di Indonesia akan relatif pentingnya
keterbukaan terhadap perdagangan dan investasi internasional untuk mendukung prospek pertumbuhan ekonomi Indonesia. Walau
Pemerintah telah mengumumkan bahwa pembaharuan DNI adalah prioritas kebijakan, namun berdasarkan kemajuan terakhir,
tidaklah jelas apakah revisi DNI yang akan datang benar-benar membuatnya menjadi ramah terhadap investor dan dengan demikian
meningkatkan iklim investasi, seperti dimaksud pada paket kebijakan bulan Agustus. Dengan semakin dekatnya pemilu tahun 2014,
masih perlu dilihat seberapa besar pengaruh sentimen nasionalis dan proteksionis terhadap penyusunan kebijakan ekonomi pada
bulan-bulan mendatang.
Ke depannya, penguatan kualitas proses penyusunan kebijakan, misalnya melalui peningkatan mekanisme koordinasi dan proses
musyawarah serta peningkatan proses reformasi peraturan perundangan (melalui pendekatan dan tinjauan peraturan “keseluruhan
pemerintahan”) merupakan hal yang sangat penting untuk memastikan bahwa ketidakpastian kebijakan dapat diminimalkan, untuk
mendukung aliran masuk FDI yang akan membantu menjawab kebutuhan pembiayaan eksternal Indonesia, dan untuk memastikan
bahwa Indonesia akan memperoleh manfaat sepenuhnya dari FDI. Proses penyusunan kebijakan yang lebih kuat juga akan dapat
menjawab keprihatinan penduduk Indonesia yang sahih secara lebih baik, yaitu bahwa kebijakan dibuat demi kepentingan masyarakat
yang lebih luas, sementara memungkinkan Pemerintah untuk menimbang kepentingan masyarakat luas secara lebih efektif terhadap
kepentingan dunia usaha yang lebih sempit dan permintaan akan proteksi yang tidak membawa manfaat kepada keseluruhan ekonomi.
Sebagai catatan positif, pada tanggal 25 Oktober, Pemerintah meluncurkan suatu paket kebijakan yang ambisius untuk meningkatkan
kemudahan melakukan usaha. Rencana aksi yang diumumkan terdiri dari tujuh belas tindakan bagi delapan bidang “Melakukan Usaha:
(disesuaikan kepada delapan dari sepuluh indikator pada peringkat negara “Doing Business” dari Bank Dunia) dan diperkirakan akan
dilaksanakan pada bulan Februari 2014. Untuk memastikan implementasi dari paket kebijakan ini, dan sebagai tanda koordinasi yang
baik dalam proses reformasi tersebut, Pemerintah telah membentuk suatu tim pengawas bersama dengan sejumlah badan
pemerintahan yang berbeda, termasuk Unit Kerja Presiden untuk Pengawasan dan Pengendalian Pembangunan (UKP4). Sektor
swasta telah menyambut baik pengumuman paket kebijakan itu (yang memfokuskan ke dalam negeri), suatu hal yang semakin
menunjukkan bahwa reformasi sangatlah mendesak dibutuhkan. Indonesia kini berada pada peringkat 120 (dari 189 ekonomi) dalam
peringkat Doing Business 2014 dari Kelompok Bank Dunia, suatu kemajuan kecil selama beberapa tahun terakhir. Namun prestasi ini
masih berada di bawah kinerja rata-rata regional (Asia Timur dan Pasifik) dan negara-negara pembanding: Filipina, Cina, Thailand,
dan Malaysia masing-masing berada pada peringkat 108, 96, 18, dan 6. Kinerja keseluruhan Indonesia hanya sedikit lebih baik dari
India dan Kamboja.

B. Beberapa perkembangan terkini perekonomian Indonesia




                 1. Tinjauan lebih dekat terhadap APBN 2014
APBN 2014 yang telah       Pada tanggal 25 Oktober 2013, Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat (DPR) Indonesia menyetujui
disetujui oleh DPR         APBN Pemerintah untuk tahun 2014. APBN yang disetujui tersebut tidak bersifat ekspansif
memproyeksikan             dan tidak pula menyertakan reformasi besar apapun dalam penerimaan maupun pengeluaran,
defisit sebesar 1,7        kecuali kemungkinan penyesuaian tarif listrik. APBN 2014 memproyeksikan defisit fiskal
persen dari PDB, tetapi    sebesar 1,7 persen dari PDB secara keseluruhan (Tabel 8). Jumlah penerimaan diperkirakan
terdapat risiko yang       akan mencapai 1.667,1 triliun rupiah, meningkat sebesar 11,0 persen dari proyeksi
signifkan terhadap         penerimaan tahun 2013—sedikit diturunkan dari usulan awal Pemerintah sebesar 1.662,5
proyeksi penerimaan        triliun rupiah pada RAPBN—sementara jumlah pengeluaran ditargetkan sebesar 1.842,5
dan pengeluaran            triliun rupiah, meningkat sebesar 6,7 persen dari proyeksi tahun 2013 dan kenaikan kecil
                           sebesar 1,8 persen dari RAPBN 2014. Namun terdapat risiko penurunan yang signifikan
                           terhadap prospek penerimaan dan pengeluaran akibat asumsi ekonomi makro yang optimis
                           dan kebutuhan pembiayaan fiskal yang meningkat. Asumsi ekonomi makro dan harga Bank
                           Dunia untuk tahun 2014 berbeda dengan APBN yang telah disetujui tersebut (Tabel 9),
                           dengan hasil proyeksi defisit Bank Dunia yang sedikit lebih besar pada 2,1 persen dari PDB.
                           Bagian ini melihat secara lebih rinci tentang prospek APBN tahun 2014.

Proyeksi defisit           APBN 2014 mengantisipasi penurunan tipis dalam rasio hutang terhadap PDB Pemerintah,
anggaran yang lebih        menjadi 23 persen dari PDB (Gambar 20), yang mencerminkan sasaran defisit APBN yang
kecil dibanding 2013,      tidak besar bersama-sama dengan asumsi pertumbuhan PDB sebesar 6,0 persen untuk tahun
membantu menjaga           2014 dan tingkat inflasi sebesar 5,5 persen. Faktor-faktor ini sebagian diimbangi dengan
posisi fiskal yang         dampak proyeksi depresiasi kurs Rupiah terhadap hutang luar negeri Pemerintah dalam
berhati-hati secara        rupiah. Pencairan dan pembelian kembali obligasi diproyeksikan akan meningkat menjadi
keseluruhan tetapi         156 triliun rupiah pada tahun 2014, naik dari 100 triliun rupiah pada APBN-P tahun 2013.
kebutuhan                  Karenanya, kebutuhan pembiayaan bruto dalam nominal diperkirakan akan meningkat pada
pembiayaan fiskal          tahun 2014 secara nominal (Gambar 21), menurun sedikit terhadap PDB ke 3,8 persen.
bruto tetap besar, yaitu   Kebutuhan pembiayaan sekuritas bruto diproyeksikan menjadi 362 triliun rupiah (3,5 persen
sekitar 3,8 persen dari    dari PDB), naik dari 330 triliun rupiah pada tahun 2013, di mana 80,7 persen dari nilai itu
PDB                        diperkirakan akan dipenuhi melalui penerbitan sekuritas dalam negeri.

Peningkatan sisi           Pada sisi penerimaan, proyeksi peningkatan penerimaan sebesar 11,0 persen berasal dari
penerimaan yang            sasaran penerimaan pajak (naik 11,5 persen dari proyeksi untuk tahun 2013), dan penerimaan
paling signifikan          bukan pajak (naik 10,4 persen dari 2013, yang merupakan revisi kenaikan yang signifikan
adalah kenaikan            dibanding kenaikan 1 persen dari proyeksi RAPBN bulan Agustus). Rasio pajak terhadap
proyeksi penerimaan        PDB diperkirakan sedikit meningkat ke 12,3 persen. Satu-satunya peningkatan yang paling
pajak penjualan/PPN        signifikan adalah pada pajak penjualan/ PPN, dengan peningkatan sebesar 16,3 persen dari
                           APBN-P tahun 2013 (walau ini di bawah tingkat RAPBN bulan Agustus dengan kenaikan
                           sebesar 22,5 persen). Sementara belanja yang terkait dengan pemilu pada tahun 2014 dapat
                           mendorong peningkatan pajak penjualan dengan meningkatkan belanja konsumsi, bukti-
                           bukti dari dua pemilu nasional yang lalu tentang kemungkinan besarnya pengaruh pemilu
                           tidaklah jelas karena perbedaan kondisi ekonomi. Sebagai tambahan, proyeksi lebih
                           rendahnya pajak penjualan/PPN pada tahun 2013 (realisasi hingga November 2013
                           mencapai 77,9 persen dari sasaran APBN-P 2013) berkontribusi kehati-hatian Bank Dunia
                           terhadap proyeksi penerimaan APBN 2014.

Pemerintah berencana       Pada sisi pengeluaran, ciri utama pada APBN 2014 adalah penurunan subsidi listrik sebesar
untuk kembali              28,6 persen dibanding tahun 2013 (71,4 triliun rupiah pada tahun 2014 dari 100,0 triliun
meningkatkan tarif         rupiah pada tahun 2013). Pada tanggal 1 Oktober, PLN melakukan kenaikan tarif listrik
listrik pada tahun         tahap akhir untuk tahun ini. Tarif listrik telah ditingkatkan sebesar 4,3 persen setiap triwulan
2014…                      selama tahun 2013, dengan jumlah kumulatif sekitar 15 persen kenaikan tahunan dibanding
                           tahun 2012. Penyesuaian harga itu tidak dikenakan bagi rumah tangga dengan konsumsi daya
                           yang rendah untuk golongan 450 hingga 900 VA. Namun, Pemerintah juga telah
                           menyisihkan 10,4 triliun rupiah dana cadangan untuk subsidi listrik tahun 2014. DPR telah
                           menyetujui peningkatan tarif listrik untuk pengguna industri dan komersial tertentu hingga
                           tingkat pemulihan biaya, namun rincian implementasinya masih dalam pembahasan.
                           Pemerintah juga merencanakan untuk menghapus subsidi listrik bagi pelanggan industri
                           besar, namun waktunya masih didiskusikan.

                        dan bibit (dari 48,3 triliun
                        rupiah pada 2013 ke 51,6 triliun Sumber: Kementerian Keuangan
                        rupiah pada 2014). Anggaran
                        pengeluaran untuk subsidi BBM pada tahun 2014 adalah sebesar 210,7 triliun rupiah, yang
                        merupakan peningkatan sebesar 10,8 triliun rupiah dari proyeksi tahun 2013, mencerminkan
                        proyeksi harga pasar BBM yang lebih tinggi dalam Rupiah, mengimbangi dampak dari
                        kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni. Dengan demikian, belanja subsidi masih
                        menjadi bagian yang signifikan dari jumlah pengeluaran secara keseluruhan (Gambar 22),
                        sebesar 15 persen dari pengeluaran Pemerintah dalam APBN 2014 (dibanding 17,0 persen
                        yang diproyeksikan untuk tahun 2013) atau 22,6 persen dari belanja Pemerintah pusat.

Belanja pegawai         APBN 2014 juga memproyeksikan peningkatan belanja pegawai sebesar 12,9 persen (dari
diproyeksi meningkat    233,0 triliun rupiah pada 2013 ke 263,0 triliun rupiah), yang mencerminkan rencana
secara signifikan       peningkatan gaji pokok sebesar 6 persen dan peningkatan pensiun sebesar 4 persen, serta
                        proses reformasi birokrasi yang terus berjalan dalam empat belas kementerian/lembaga
                        (dimana K/L tersebut akan menerima tambahan dana untuk meningkatkan gaji pokok).
                        Belanja barang diproyeksikan akan meningkat sebesar 6,4 persen pada tahun 2014 dibanding
                        sasaran pada APBN-P tahun 2013, walau terdapat rencana penurunan belanja operasional.
                        Anggaran belanja sosial meningkat sebesar 13,9 persen, menjadi 91,8 triliun rupiah pada
                        2014, termasuk belanja untuk Sistem Jaminan Sosial Nasional (SJSN) yang baru sebesar 19,9
                        triliun rupiah. Namun, penutupan Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat (BLSM) pada
                        akhir tahun 2013, membatasi peningkatan belanja sosial secara keseluruhan.

…sementara belanja      Belanja modal ditargetkan mencapai 184,2 triliun rupiah, turun sebesar 2,2 persen dari
modal hanya             alokasi pada APBN-P 2013. Perkembangan ini patut diperhatikan menimbang kenaikan
ditargetkan pada 1,8    tahunan belanja modal yang cukup tinggi dalam beberapa tahun terakhir , meskipun
persen dari PDB         peningkatan daya serap dapat meningkatkan realisasi belanja secara nominal daripada alokasi
                        anggaran. Secara relatif terhadap PDB, tingkat sasaran belanja ini hanya mencapai 1,8 persen,
                        tingkat yang sama seperti tahun 2012. Walau tingkat belanja modal ini tampaknya kecil
                        dibanding kebutuhan yang mendesak untuk mengatasi kesenjangan infrastruktur di
                        Indonesia, tantangan pencairan anggaran merupakan kendala utama dalam pelaksanaan
                        proyek-proyek infrastruktur.2

Bank Dunia                     Bank Dunia memproyeksikan besar defisit fiskal pada tahun 2014 akan mencapai 2,1 persen
memproyeksikan                 dari PDB, berdasarkan pada asumsi-asumsi ekonomi makro yang berbeda dari asumsi yang
defisit yang sedikit           digunakan untuk menyusun APBN (Tabel 8). Dengan dampak yang belum pasti dari
lebih besar pada 2,1           pengaruh pemilu dalam mendorong belanja konsumsi, proyeksi penurunan lebih lanjut dari
persen dari PDB untuk          harga minyak dunia, dan depresiasi Rupiah, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa jumlah
tahun 2014                     penerimaan nominal akan meningkat sebesar 9,7 persen dibanding 2013, lebih kecil
                               dibanding sasaran pertumbuhan nominal Pemerintah Indonesia sebesar 11 persen. Selain itu,
                               perlemahan Rupiah semakin menekan pengeluaran, terutama melalui subsidi BBM; seperti
                               disoroti pada IEQ edisi bulan Oktober. Akibatnya, penurunan jumlah biaya subsidi BBM
                               diperkirakan tidak akan tercapai pada tahun 2014 dibanding tahun 2013 walau dengan
                               peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni 2013, karena penghematan yang
                               diharapkan telah terkikis oleh harga BBM dalam denominasi Rupiah yang lebih tinggi.
                               Tergantung tren harga-harga minyak mentah dunia dan kurs tukar, terdapat risiko yang
                               signifikan bahwa belanja subsidi energi dapat melampaui anggarannya pada tahun 2014.

                              dalam APBN tahun 2013 (1.010 – 1.030 ribu barel per hari pada tahun 2016). Jumlah
                              penerimaan nominal diperkirakan akan meningkat sebesar rata-rata 13 persen antara tahun
                              2015 dan 2017, sementara pengeluaran direncanakan akan menyusut secara bertahap sebagai
                              bagian dari PDB, dari hampir 18 persen dari PDB menjadi sedikit di atas 16 persen pada
                              tahun 2017.

… sasaran yang                Sejalan dengan perlambatan pertumbuhan ekonomi yang belakangan terjadi dan ekspektasi
mungkin akan sulit            base case Bank Dunia, proyeksi ekonomi makro pada Kerangka Anggaran Jangka Menengah
untuk dicapai                 yang diperbarui tampaknya sulit untuk dicapai. Selain itu, pergeseran ke surplus anggaran
                              pada tahun 2016 sebesar 0,2 persen PDB akan membutuhkan pemangkasan belanja sebesar
                              2 poin persentase, atau peningkatan penerimaan sebesar 1 poin persentase, dari PDB.
                              Kemungkinan kedua lebih mungkin, sementara penurunan belanja sebesar 2 poin persentase
                              tampaknya akan menjadi tantangan dengan terbatasnya ruang diskresioner, kecuali bila
                              dicapai melalui pemangkasan subsidi, yang membutuhkan reformasi besar-besaran.
                              Mengingat kebutuhan pembangunan Indonesia, upaya memperbaiki proporsi belanja yang
                              disertai dengan peningkatan penerimaan terhadap PDB lebih mungkin dibanding
                              menurunkan jumlah belanja untuk mencapai neraca fiskal yang positif.

Faktor yang                   Terdapat sejumlah alasan penyebab perlambatan laju pengentasan kemiskinan. Satu faktor
berkontribusi terhadap        penting adalah bahwa dengan tingkat kemiskinan di Indonesia yang mendekati 10 persen,
perlambatan ini adalah        rumah tangga miskin yang tersisa terletak semakin jauh di bawah garis kemiskinan (Gambar
semakin sulitnya              24). Hal ini berarti dibutuhkan pertumbuhan konsumsi yang lebih tinggi lagi untuk
mencapai mereka yang          mempertahankan laju tingkat pengentasan kemiskinan tahunan seperti yang tercatat di masa
masih tergolong               lalu. Pada saat yang sama, kaum miskin dan rentan semakin tidak memiliki andil dalam

tidak meratanya               Setengah dari penduduk Indonesia yang paling miskin mencatat pertumbuhan konsumsi riil
pertumbuhan ekonomi           per kapita sebesar nol atau bahkan sedikit negatif antara tahun 2012 dan 2013, dibandingkan
                              pertumbuhan nilai mean konsumsi pada keseluruhan populasi sebesar 4 persen dan rata-rata
                              sebesar 7 persen bagi dua desil yang paling berada (Gambar 25). Sementara Kurva Insidensi

Kotak 3: BLSM, Susenas, dan pengukuran kemiskinan
Dengan peningkatan harga bahan pangan dan bukan pangan akibat peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni 2013 yang
diperkirakan akan berpengaruh buruk terhadap rumah tangga miskin dan rentan dalam jangka pendek, Pemerintah Indonesia
menyiapkan paket kompensasi berjumlah 29,05 triliun rupiah atau sekitar 74 persen dari jumlah penghematan subsidi BBM. Paket
tersebut terdiri dari dua komponen utama: (a) Program Kompensasi Khusus, dan (b) Program Percepatan dan Perluasan
Perlindungan Sosial (P4S) (lihat IEQ edisi bulan Juni 2013 untuk pembahasan lebih lanjut). Komponen utama dari P4S adalah
Bantuan Langsung Sementara Masyarakat (BLSM) sejumlah 150.000 rupiah untuk setiap rumah tangga per bulan selama empat
bulan, yang diberikan kepada 15,5 juta rumah tangga dalam dua kali pembayaran.

BLSM dimaksudkan untuk mencegah lonjakan kemiskinan sementara yang disebabkan oleh peningkatan sementara dalam inflasi
keranjang kemiskinan sebagai akibat dari naiknya harga BBM bersubsidi. Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa tanpa BLSM, tingkat
kemiskinan akan meningkat menjadi 12,1 persen pada bulan September 2013, namun berkat BLSM, tingkat kemiskinan akan dapat
terus menurun. Sejauh mana penurunan tersebut, seperti diukur lewat SUSENAS (Survei Sosial Ekonomi Nasional yang dilakukan
oleh BPS, yang menghitung perkiraan kemiskinan) bulan September, tergantung atas sejumlah faktor. Tepatnya, penetapan waktu
pencairan BLSM, dan bagaimana dana itu digunakan, akan berdampak signifikan terhadap seberapa besar pengaruh BLSM terhadap
kemiskinan terukur.

Modul konsumsi SUSENAS mengajukan pertanyaan yang terperinci kepada rumah tangga tentang konsumsi pangan dan bukan
pangan. Untuk berbagai komoditas bahan pangan, survei tersebut menanyakan konsumsinya selama satu minggu terakhir, dan untuk
komoditas bukan pangan, survei itu menanyakan tentang konsumsinya selama tiga bulan terakhir. SUSENAS dilaksanakan selama
bulan September 2013. Tahap pertama bantuan dicairkan pada bulan Juli dan Agustus. Jika bantuan itu digunakan untuk bahan
pangan, maka tidak akan tercatat pada SUSENAS, karena tidak terjadi pada minggu sebelum survei tersebut. Jika digunakan bukan
untuk bahan pangan, maka akan tercatat sebagai terjadi selama tiga bulan terakhir, namun dapat dilaporkan secara kurang tepat karena
hanya berdasarkan ingatan responden. Jika dana itu digunakan untuk keperluan lain seperti membayar hutang atau tabungan, maka
dana itu sama sekali tidak akan tertangkap oleh survei, yang hanya menanyakan hal-hal terkait dengan konsumsi. Tahap kedua
dicairkan pada bulan September, pada waktu yang bersamaan dengan pelaksanaan SUSENAS. Apakah dana itu diterima sebelum
survei akan menentukan apakah penggunaannya tertangkap oleh survei itu.

Pelajaran apa yang dapat dipetik dari pengalaman pendahulu BLSM, yaitu Bantuan Langsung Tunai (BLT), tentang tanggapan rumah
tangga? Dalam rangkaian laporannya pada tahun 2012 tentang Program Bantuan Sosial dan Tinjauan Pengeluaran Publik (Social
Assistance Program and Public Expenditure Review), analisis Bank Dunia menunjukkan bahwa dana bantuan umumnya dikonsumsi dalam
satu minggu setelah diterima (yang berarti waktu pelaksanaan pencairan dana relatif terhadap survei sangat berarti), dan bahwa
umumnya dana itu digunakan untuk kebutuhan dasar – bahan pangan, dan juga barang-barang bukan pangan seperti biaya pakaian
atau pendidikan. Pengalaman BLT pada tahun 2008-09 mencatat jumlah yang lebih besar yang digunakan bagi pendidikan, karena
pencairannya dilakukan menjelang mulainya tahun ajaran baru, sementara pada bantuan tahun 2005-06 lebih banyak digunakan untuk
bahan pangan. Dengan dua pencairan pada tahun 2013 dilakukan hanya sedikit setelah dimulainya tahun ajaran baru, mencakup bulan
Ramadan, dan menjelang hari raya Lebaran, para rumah tangga tampaknya akan lebih banyak mengkonsumsi dan mengurangi
penabungan, namun tidaklah jelas apakah konsumsinya akan untuk bahan pangan atau keperluan lainnya.

Penggunaan bantuan      Tahun ini memiliki karakteristik perlambatan pertumbuhan dan peningkatan inflasi. Secara
tunai BLSM sebagai      khusus, peningkatan indeks harga keranjang kemiskinan tahun-ke-tahun (pengukuran harga
kompensasi rumah        dari sekeranjang barang-barang dan jasa-jasa yang umumnya dikonsumsi oleh kaum miskin)
tangga miskin dan       pada triwulan ketiga tahun 2013 mencapai 8,8 persen, yang didorong oleh pengaruh
rentan terhadap         peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi dari bulan Juni. Dengan peningkatan ini, biaya hidup
kenaikan harga BBM      untuk kaum miskin tampaknya akan meningkat lebih tinggi dari peningkatan pendapatan
bulan Juni tampaknya    atau upah rumah tangga, dan tingkat kemiskinan bulan September 2013 diperkirakan akan
akan mencegah           meningkat. Dengan menerapkan hasil realisasi ekonomi makro terhadap model data-mikro
kenaikan tingkat        kemiskinan di Indonesia, dan dengan melakukan abstraksi terhadap dampak paket
kemiskinan jangka       kompensasi terkait dengan peningkatan harga BBM bersubsidi, tingkat kemiskinan bulan
pendek bulan            September diproyeksikan akan mencapai 12,1 persen, atau peningkatan sebesar 0,4 poin
September 2013          persentase dari September 2012 (dan 0,7 poin dari Maret 2013). Namun, tingkat kemiskinan
                        dapat menarik manfaat jangka pendek dari pengaruh sementara pembayaran BLSM pada
                        pertengahan tahun, dengan dua pembayaran sebesar 300.000 rupiah kepada 15,5 juta rumah
                        tangga pada bulan Juli/Agustus dan September. Sebagai akibatnya, peningkatan inflasi
                        sementara tampaknya terimbangi oleh peningkatan sementara dalam pendapatan bagi rumah
                        tangga miskin dan rentan, dan Bank Dunia memproyeksikan bahwa tingkat kemiskinan
                        bulan September akan menunjukkan penurunan dalam tingkat kemiskinan. Apakah tingkat
                        penurunan ini berarti atau tidak berarti akan bergantung pada penetapan waktu pencairan,
                        bagaimana dana itu digunakan, dan waktu pelaksanaan survei rumah tangga (lihat Kotak 3).

Namun sasaran tingkat   Pembayaran BLSM sementara tidak akan mempengaruhi tren kemiskinan untuk jangka
kemiskinan              waktu yang lebih panjang, karena BLSM hanya berlangsung selama empat bulan. Dengan
Pemerintah sebesar 8-   tingkat kemiskinan pada bulan Maret 2013 sebesar 11,4 persen, bahkan apabila laju
10 persen pada tahun    penurunan kemiskinan kembali ke 1 poin persentase per year, angka sasaran Pemerintah
2014 tampaknya tidak    sebesar 8-10 persen pada tahun 2014 (RPJM 2009-14) tetap tidak akan tercapai. Selain itu,
akan tercapai…          perlambatan pertumbuhan (diproyeksikan oleh Bank Dunia akan menjadi 5,1 persen tahun-
                        ke-tahun hingga Maret 2014) dan tingginya inflasi (7,2 persen tahun-ke-tahun hingga Maret
                        2014) menyiratkan bahwa pencapaian penurunan 1 poin persentase pada tahun yang berakhir
                        pada bulan Maret 2014 tidaklah mungkin. Model kemiskinan Bank Dunia memproyeksikan
                        tingkat kemiskinan pada bulan Maret 2014 akan menjadi 11,0-11,1 persen (0,3-0,4 poin lebih
                        rendah dari bulan Maret 2013), yang menunjukkan semakin melambatnya laju pengentasan
                        kemiskinan.

…walau sebagian akan    Namun, perluasan bantuan sosial jangka panjang yang dimulai pada triwulan ketiga tahun
bergantung pada         2013 (lihat pembahasan berikutnya) dapat mempengaruhi pencapaian tingkat kemiskinan.
perluasan program-      Selain BLSM yang bersifat sementara, Program Percepatan dan Perluasan Perlindungan
program bantuan         Sosial (P4S) (lihat Kotak 3 dan IEQ edisi bulan Juli 2013), juga menyertakan perluasan
sosial jangka panjang   manfaat yang signifikan dari dua program bantuan sosial jangka panjang – Program Keluarga
yang belakangan         Harapan (PKH) dan program Bantuan untuk Siswa Miskin (BSM). Pelaksanaan program-
dilakukan               program ini secara signifikan (serta waktu pelaksanaan pencairan – lihat Kotak 3) dapat
                        membantu mempercepat pengentasan kemiskinan, dan membuka peluang untuk
                        mewujudkan sasaran tingkat kemiskinan tahun 2014. Namun, pelaksanaan yang signifikan
                        tampaknya baru akan terjadi pada paruh kedua tahun 2014.

Pengentasan             Secara historis, belanja Indonesia untuk bantuan sosial sebagai persen dari PDB (sekitar 0,5
kemiskinan              persen) berada di bawah belanja negara-negara tetangganya (1,0 persen) dan negara-negara
berkelanjutan akan      berpenghasilan menengah pada umumnya (1,5 persen).4 Walaupun perluasan yang baru
membutuhkan             dilakukan pada program-program jangka panjang yang telah disebutkan di atas merupakan
perluasan bantuan       langkah maju yang cukup baik, tetap dibutuhkan komitmen terhadap peningkatan bantuan
sosial yang             sosial yang berkelanjutan untuk membantu mempercepat pengentasan kemiskinan. Sama
berkelanjutan…          pentingnya, pelaksanaan yang tepat bagi program-program tersebut juga akan menentukan
                        efektivitas mereka sebagai alat pengentas kemiskinan.5

Harapan-nya secara       Peningkatan jumlah bantuan ini tampaknya akan meningkatkan kecukupan bantuan program
signifikan…              dalam mengimbangi biaya layanan kesehatan dan pendidikan bagi keluarga-keluarga miskin.

…dan program             Serupa dengan hal tersebut di atas, jumlah pelajar miskin yang berhak menerima Bantuan
bantuan dana bagi        untuk Siswa Miskin (BSM) akan meningkat hampir dua kali lipat pada tahun 2013 dari 8,7
siswa miskin             juta menjadi 16,6 juta penerima bantuan. Namun, dampaknya terhadap kemiskinan akan
                         bergantung kepada penggunaan program tersebut oleh siswa di rumah tangga miskin. Besar
                         bantuan juga akan meningkat secara signifikan: bantuan bagi sekolah dasar (SD) akan
                         meningkat dari 360.000 rupiah ke 450.000 rupiah per tahun per siswa, sementara bantuan
                         untuk sekolah menengah pertama (SMP) akan meningkat dari 550.000 rupiah ke 750.000
                         rupiah per siswa per tahun.

Pemerintah juga          Program-program bantuan sosial tetap lainnya juga diubah menurut P4S, namun hanya
meningkatkan subsidi     untuk sementara, dan tampaknya hanya akan memberikan dampak yang kecil bagi
Raskin untuk             pengentasan kemiskinan pada jangka panjang. Dengan program Subsidi Beras bagi
sementara bagi           Masyarakat Berpendapatan Rendah (Raskin), rumah tangga penerima berhak membeli
kelompok                 tambahan 15 kg beras per bulan selama tiga bulan (Juni, Juli, dan Agustus) pada harga yang
berpenghasilan           sangat disubsidi. Alokasi kedua ini menambah alokasi awal sebesar 15 kg beras yang dapat
rendah, walau program    dibeli setiap bulan. Namun, karena tantangan yang dihadapi oleh sistem penyampaian
ini terus menghadapi     Raskin, para rumah tangga berisiko tampaknya hanya dapat membeli jumlah beras yang jauh
tantangan dalam          lebih kecil dari jumlah yang dialokasikan kepada mereka melalui program kompensasi
pelaksanaannya           tersebut. Hal ini mempengaruhi besarnya manfaat de facto yang akan diterima oleh para
                         rumah tangga melalui program Raskin, serta melemahkan manfaat dan dampak program.

                         lebih lanjut tentang tantangan pelaksanaan Raskin).

Perlu digarisbawahi,     Pelaksanaan reformasi program melalui P4S juga disertai dengan peluncuran Kartu
reformasi bantuan        Perlindungan Sosial (KPS) dan sejalan dengan Basis Data Terpadu (BDT) yang merupakan

                          kegiatan-kegiatan yang sangat produktif). Bagian ini meninjau pencapaian-pencapaian terbaru
                          dalam pasar tenaga kerja Indonesia dan memaparkan tantangan-tantangan utama yang
                          dihadapi.

…seperti peningkatan      Secara khusus, terdapat tiga tantangan utama yang harus diatasi. Pertama, sektor ekonomi
pertumbuhan               terbesar dalam hal ketenagakerjaan masih memiliki nilai tambah yang rendah, dan penciptaan
ketenagakerjaan dalam     pekerjaan sejak tahun 2001 telah didorong oleh perluasan sektor-sektor berproduktivitas
sektor produktivitas      rendah. Kedua, sektor informal masih berukuran besar, yang mempekerjakan lebih dari 50
yang lebih tinggi serta   persen dari seluruh jumlah penduduk yang bekerja, dengan pekerjaan-pekerjaan informal
mengatasi masih           yang memiliki upah yang lebih rendah, stabilitas yang lebih rapuh dan tanpa disertai akses
tingginya informalitas    kepada tunjangan. Ketiga, investasi pada sektor-sektor dengan produktivitas yang lebih tinggi
dan kelangkaan            terbentur kendala terbatasnya ketersediaan tenaga kerja yang terampil. Jika tantangan-
pekerja terampil          tantangan tersebut tetap tidak tertangani, terdapat risiko bahwa peningkatan kesejahteraan
                          yang baru terjadi akan menemui kendala, yang kemudian berdampak terhadap perlambatan
                          laju pengentasan kemiskinan dan peningkatan ketidaksetaraan.

Angkatan kerja                 Menurut data terbaru Sakernas bulan Februari 2013, dari 175 juta penduduk berusia di atas
Indonesia, yang                15 tahun, jumlah angkatan kerja Indonesia adalah 121 juta, yang mana 114 juta memiliki
merupakan nomor 4              pekerjaan (Gambar 26). Sejak bulan Februari 2006, tingkat partisipasi angkatan kerja
terbesar di dunia,             terhadap jumlah penduduk usia kerja meningkat dengan lambat namun stabil, dari 66,7
mencapai 121 juta              persen menjadi 69,2 persen, sementara, pada periode waktu yang sama, persentase jumlah
pekerja pada awal 2013         pekerja terhadap penduduk usia kerja meningkat dengan lebih cepat, dari 59,0 persen ke 65,1
dan lapangan kerja             persen, menyamai tingkatan yang tercatat pada pertengahan tahun 1990-an. Sejalan dengan
yang terus                     hal itu, antara tahun 2006 dan 2012, elastisitas lapangan kerja terhadap pertumbuhan (nilai
berkembang…                    tambah riil)6 mencapai 0,56 (yang berarti peningkatan 1 persen dalam nilai tambah riil akan
                               meningkatkan lapangan kerja sebesar 0,56 persen, secara rata-rata lintas sektor, selama
                               periode tersebut), dibanding 0,47 yang tercatat antara tahun 2001 dan 2005, dan 0,79 pada
                               awal tahun 1990-an, dengan rata-rata elastisitas diperkirakan sama dengan 0,5 antara tahun
                               1990 dan 2012 (dan tidak berbeda secara signifikan dari 0 selama krisis tahun 1998-99).
                               Selain tren ketenagakerjaan yang positif ini, tingkat pengangguran juga terus menurun (dari
                               10,4 persen pada bulan Februari 2006 ke 5,9 persen pada bulan Februari 2013). Namun,
                               indikator tingkat pengangguran agregat tidak terlalu memberikan gambaran yang baik
                               tentang pasar tenaga kerja di Indonesia, seperti di negara-negara berpenghasilan menengah
                               lainnya, akibat tingginya tingkat pekerja informal, seperti dibahas di bawah.

Indonesia terus                pembandingnya yang setara, seperti Kamboja, Vietnam, Cina, dan Thailand, terutama karena
tertinggal di belakang         relatif buruknya partisipasi perempuan dan tenaga muda usia di pasar tenaga kerja.
sejumlah negara                Sesungguhnya tingkat partisipasi tenaga kerja perempuan di Indonesia baru-baru saja

                               berada di bawah 40 persen, masih belum pulih ke tingkatannya pada awal tahun 1990-an
                               (sebesar 47 persen), setelah penurunan berkepanjangan dan pemulihan yang lambat yang
                               baru dimulai pada pertengahan tahun 2000-an. Yang lebih memprihatinkan, rendahnya
                               partisipasi tenaga kerja usia muda juga diikuti dengan tetap tingginya tingkat NEET (tenaga

Sebagian besar                Antara bulan Agustus 2001 dan Agustus 2012, lebih dari 20 juta pekerjaan baru telah tercipta

kerja berada pada             2,3 persen sejak bulan Februari 2006 (Gambar 28). Dari 20 juta pekerjaan yang tercipta
sektor formal, dan            tersebut, 16,4 juta (82 persen) merupakan pekerjaan formal, sesuai dengan definisi pekerjaan
dalam sektor jasa             formal yang digunakan oleh Badan Pusat Statistik (BPS) sejak 20017. Sektor jasa
                              berkontribusi terhadap sebagian besar peningkatan kesempatan kerja ini, dengan 16,8 juta
                              pekerjaan baru tercipta untuk sektor tersebut (84 persen dari jumlah keseluruhan), dan
                              sebagai akibatnya persentase dari sektor jasa terhadap jumlah pekerjaan telah mencapai 43
                              persen. Sektor industri hanya mampu menciptakan 4 juta pekerjaan baru dan saat ini
                              merupakan 21 persen dari jumlah pekerjaan, sementara pada sektor pertanian (dengan 35

                              periode tersebut. Perluasan pekerjaan dalam bidang jasa juga telah mendorong peningkatan
                              pekerjaan pada sektor formal, dengan 85 persen dari pekerjaan yang tercipta pada sektor jasa
                              sejak tahun 2001 merupakan pekerjaan formal, dibanding 57 persen di sektor industri.

Penciptaan pekerjaan         Penciptaan pekerjaan lebih kuat di daerah-daerah perkotaan, dengan peningkatan
lebih tinggi di              kesempatan kerja sebesar 45 persen sejak tahun 2001 dibanding pertumbuhan sebesar 6
perkotaan, dan               persen yang tercatat di daerah perdesaan. Pertumbuhan pekerjaan perkotaan secara bertahap
perbedaan geografis          telah melampaui tingkat pertumbuhan perdesaan selama dekade yang lalu, dan sejak tahun
dalam tingkat                2008 pekerjaan di daerah perkotaan telah meningkat lebih cepat dibanding populasi angkatan
pekerjaan tetap ada          kerja. Urbanisasi juga sangat terkait dengan peningkatan pekerjaan formal, dengan 72 persen

                             7   Menurut definisi baru pekerja formal/informal yang digunakan oleh BPS sejak tahun 2001, pekerja
                                 informal didefinisikan menurut sejumlah karakteristik yang terkait dengan “status pekerjaan” dan
                                 “jabatan”. “Jabatan” mencakup 9 kategori: Tenaga Profesional; Teknisi dan yang sejenis; Tenaga
                                 Kepemimpinan dan Ketatalaksanaan; Tenaga Tata Usaha dan yang sejenis; Tenaga Usaha Penjualan;

                                 Operator Alat Angkutan dan Pekerja Kasar; Lainnya. “Status pekerjaan” termasuk 7 kategori:
                                 Berusaha sendiri, berusaha dibantu buruh tidak tetap, berusaha dibantu buruh tetap, pekerja, pekerja
                                 bebas dalam sektor pertanian, pekerja bebas dalam sektor non-pertanian, pekerja keluarga tak dibayar.
                                 Pekerja informal didefinisikan sebagai: semua pekerja keluarga tak dibayar; semua pekerja bebas atau
                                 yang bekerja sendiri, kecuali mereka yang bekerja sebagai Tenaga Profesional, Teknisi dan yang
                                 sejenis, Tenaga Kepemimpinan dan Ketatalaksanaan, Tenaga Tata Usaha dan yang sejenis; berusaha
                                 dibantu buruh tidak tetap dalam pertanian atau bidang usaha lain. Perubahan utama dari definisi yang
                                 lama adalah sebelum tahun 2001 tidak ada kelompok “pekerja bebas” di dalam Sakernas, sehingga
                                 pekerja bebas dalam bidang pertanian dan konstruksi disertakan di dalam sektor formal sebagai
                                 buruh/karyawan dibayar.

                                 pekerjaan formal ini dapat dijelaskan dengan peningkatan jumlah buruh/karyawan yang

                                 ditunjukkan selama dekade yang lalu, perbedaan yang penting masih dapat terlihat pada

                                 (yang kinerjanya tampaknya dapat dijelaskan sebagai akibat meroketnya industri ekstraksi

Sebagian besar                   Sisi lain dari perkembangan pasar tenaga kerja yang menggembirakan itu adalah bahwa
pertumbuhan                      sektor-sektor dengan produktivitas tenaga kerja yang rendah (dengan produktivitas tenaga
pekerjaan terjadi pada           kerja didefinisikan sebagai nilai tambah dibagi dengan jumlah pekerja) dengan lebih
sektor-sektor dengan             rendahnya jumlah pekerja berpendidikan tinggi, masih mendominasi lapangan kerja, dan
nilai tambah dan                 penciptaan pekerjaan umumnya terkonsentrasi pada sektor-sektor berproduktivitas rendah
keterampilan yang                yang tidak memerlukan keterampilan tinggi. Dari jumlah pertumbuhan pekerjaan yang
rendah                           tercatat dari tahun 2001 hingga 2012, 30 persen terjadi pada jasa kemasyarakatan, sosial dan
                                 personal (dengan 6,9 juta pekerjaan baru yang tercipta), dan 28 persen dalam sektor
                                 perdagangan besar, perdagangan, dan eceran (5,7 juta). Manufaktur hanya menyumbang 16
                                 persen dari jumlah pertumbuhan (3,3 juta), sedikit di atas konstruksi (14 persen, setara
                                 dengan 2,9 juta pekerjaan baru). Korelasi yang negatif antara pertumbuhan pekerjaan dan
                                 pertumbuhan produktivitas antara tahun 2001 dan 2012 (Gambar 31), tampaknya
                                 menunjukkan bahwa penciptaan pekerjaan tidak sepenuhnya meningkatkan produktivitas,
                                 dan masih terdapat ruang untuk meningkatkan efisiensi alokasi ulang tenaga kerja dari
                                 pertanian ke industri dan jasa, serta dari kegiatan berproduktivitas rendah ke tinggi baik di

Sebagai akibatnya,              Bukti ini konsisten dengan temuan-temuan bahwa rata-rata upah riil hanya naik relatif sedikit
upah hanya tumbuh               pada periode tahun 2002 hingga 2012 dibanding pertumbuhan produktivitas secara agregat.
secara moderat, namun           Upah riil (termasuk upah dari pegawai di sektor formal) meningkat sebesar 21 persen sejak
kesenjangan                     tahun 2001 (Gambar 32), rata-rata sebesar 2 persen secara pertumbuhan tahunan riil, yang
pendapatan yang                 tampaknya cukup moderat dibanding rata-rata pertumbuhan PDB riil tahunan sebesar 5,4
penting tetap bertahan          persen, dan terhadap jumlah pertumbuhan produktivitas tenaga kerja secara keseluruhan
antara pekerja formal           yang hampir mencapai 50 persen selama periode yang sama. Gambar 32 juga menunjukkan
dependen dan pekerja            bahwa pertumbuhan dalam penerimaan riil (pendapatan dari pekerjaan bagi yang berusaha
non-dependen…                   sendiri dan pekerja bebas, baik formal maupun informal) berjalan jauh lebih lambat, hanya
                                sebesar 5 persen selama seluruh periode itu, yang mengakibatkan tetap bertahannya jurang
                                pendapatan antara pekerja formal dependen (buruh/karyawan dibayar) dan pekerja non-
                                dependen.

pertumbuhan upah                pertambangan telah meningkat dua kali lebih cepat dari rata-rata nasional, yang
yang besar lintas               mencerminkan lonjakan pendapatan pada sektor itu yang berasal dari harga komoditas dan
sektor                          permintaan dunia selama periode tersebut. Namun, potensi perluasan pekerjaan di sektor ini
                                tetap terbatas. Sebaliknya, jumlah upah pada sektor yang secara potensial membutuhkan
                                keterampilan tinggi seperti manufaktur telah meningkat lebih rendah dari rata-rata nasional,
                                yang mencerminkan buruknya pertumbuhan produktivitas. Selain itu, variasi dalam upah riil
                                di dalam sektor jasa, mulai dari keuangan hingga perdagangan dan eceran, telah terlihat jelas,
                                sekali lagi mencerminkan perbedaan dalam intensitas keterampilan.

                           b. “Pekerjaan baik” meningkat, namun banyak pekerja yang tetap informal dan
                              rentan

Walau jumlah                    Keberadaan sektor informal yang besar, yang masih mempekerjakan lebih dari 50 persen dari
“pekerjaan baik”                jumlah pekerja (70 persen di daerah pedesaan) tetap menjadi salah satu tantangan yang paling
meningkat, lebih dari           serius bagi pasar tenaga kerja Indonesia. Walau persentase “pekerjaan baik” terhadap
50 persen jumlahnya             keseluruhan pekerjaan (didefinisikan sebagai persentase dari pekerja formal dependen)
masih bersifat informal         meningkat dari 27,7 persen ke 36,4 persen antara bulan Agustus 2001 dan Agustus 2012
dan tingkat kerentanan          (Gambar 33), sebagian besar pekerja masih dalam keadaan sangat rentan, termasuk 18 juta
bagi banyak pekerja             pekerja keluarga yang tidak dibayar dan 11,5 juta pekerja bebas (masing-masing 16 persen
tetap tinggi                    dan 10 persen dari keseluruhan pekerjaan). Selain itu, penurunan dalam jumlah pekerja bebas

                         dalam bidang pertanian telah diimbangi dengan peningkatan pekerja bebas dalam sektor-
                         sektor bukan pertanian, dan walau jumlah penduduk bekerja sebagai buruh tetap telah
                         meningkat, penduduk yang bekerja sebagai buruh tidak tetap masih berjumlah 82 persen dari
                         seluruh penduduk yang bekerja. Akhirnya, walau jumlah penduduk yang berusaha sendiri
                         (atau bekerja sendiri dalam pengertian yang ketat), yang lebih memiliki kemungkinan untuk
                         rentan dan berproduktivitas rendah, menurun jumlahnya, mereka masih merupakan 18,5 juta
                         (17 persen dari keseluruhan pekerjaan). Pekerjaan yang rentan menawarkan perlindungan
                         yang lebih rendah terhadap risiko maupun gejolak, tidak memungkinkan akses terhadap
                         tunjangan sosial, dan memberikan pendapatan yang lebih rendah. Sebagai contoh, pada bulan
                         Agustus 2012, masing-masing pekerja bebas dan pekerja sendiri mencatat penghasilan rata-
                         rata sebesar 48 persen dan 65 persen dari rata-rata upah pegawai, dibanding 45 persen dan 75
                         persen pada tahun 2001, yang kurang lebih dapat menjelaskan meningkatnya ketidaksetaraan
                         secara keseluruhan yang tercatat di Indonesia selama periode tersebut.

Terdapat variasi yang    Keberadaan bentuk pekerjaan yang rentan menunjukkan variasi yang tinggi antar sektor dan
tinggi dalam proporsi    provinsi, selain juga diakibatkan ketidakpatuhan yang persisten terhadap kebijakan Upah
pekerja yang rentan      Minimum (lihat IEQ edisi bulan Desember 2012). Keterbatasan data merintangi
lintas sektor dan        kemungkinan pengukuran dampak peningkatan yang tajam dalam tingkatan upah minimum
daerah geografis         lintas provinsi terhadap pekerjaan pada tahun 2013, (Jakarta mencatat peningkatan yang
                         melebihi 40 persen). Namun, data Sakernas menunjukkan bahwa hingga tahun 2012, sektor
                         dengan jumlah pekerja tertinggi (perdagangan besar dan eceran, dan jasa kemasyarakatan,
                         sosial dan personal) mencatat persentase yang tinggi dari pekerja yang dibayar dengan upah
                         di bawah aturan minimum: masing-masing sebesar 50 persen dan 45 persen, yang meningkat
                         secara tajam bagi pekerja informal (masing-masing sebesar 80 persen dan 86 persen). Angka-
                         angka ini bahkan lebih tinggi pada sektor pertanian, dengan hampir 80 persen dari seluruh
                         pekerja menerima pembayaran di bawah upah minimum. Pada tingkat provinsi,
                         ketidakpatuhan mencapai lebih dari 60 persen di Nusa Tenggara Barat dan Sulawesi Barat
                         (lebih dari 75 persen bagi pekerja informal), dan mendekati atau lebih dari 50 persen pada 12
                         provinsi lain (termasuk Jakarta dan Yogyakarta, dan sangat tinggi di Lampung, Aceh,
                         Sulawesi Selatan, dan Kalimantan Selatan).

                    c. Menangani angkatan kerja yang sebagian besar berketerampilan rendah

Angkatan kerja           Hampir 50 persen dari angkatan kerja Indonesia hanya memiliki pendidikan dasar, sementara
Indonesia umumnya        hanya 6,3 persen yang memiliki gelar universitas, atau diploma 4 tahun (Gambar 34).
tidak terampil, dengan   Kenyataan ini terjadi meskipun Indonesia mencatat kemajuan besar dalam meningkatkan
hanya 6,3 persen yang    pendaftaran pada pendidikan menengah dan tinggi bagi generasi termuda, dan peningkatan
berpendidikan            persentase angkatan kerja dengan pendidikan menengah pertama dan atas dari 35 persen
tinggi…                  menjadi 44 persen antara tahun 2001 dan 2012. Angkatan kerja berketerampilan rendah
                         merupakan tantangan serius bagi peningkatan produktivitas dan untuk memenuhi
                         permintaan pemilik usaha dalam pasar tenaga kerja yang cepat berubah, terutama dengan
                         rendahnya kecenderungan perusahaan-perusahaan Indonesia untuk memberikan pelatihan.
                         Sebagai akibat dari masalah ketidaksesuaian ini, suatu persentase yang cukup dramatis, yaitu
                         lebih dari 40 persen, dari tenaga muda berusia 15-24 tahun, tetap tidak memiliki pendidikan,
                         pelatihan, atau pekerjaan per tahun 2012 (Gambar 35), tanpa terlihat adanya tren
                         peningkatan sejak tahun 2001. Hal ini akan benar-benar dapat merintangi kemungkinan
                         mereka menemukan pekerjaan yang baik di masa depan.

…yang merupakan                 Secara ringkas, pasar tenaga kerja Indonesia, yang didukung oleh penciptaan pekerjaan yang
salah satu tantangan            kuat, sedang bertransformasi menuju formalisasi yang lebih besar bagi angkatan kerjanya.
pasar tenaga kerja              Namun, terdapat sejumlah tantangan penting yang masih tersisa: sebagian besar pekerjaan
yang dihadapi oleh              yang tercipta pada dekade lalu berasal dari sektor-sektor berproduktivitas rendah; lebih dari
para pembuat                    50 persen dari pekerjaan yang ada masih merupakan pekerjaan informal, tanpa perlindungan
kebijakan                       kepada pekerja; sebagian besar angkatan kerja masih tidak terampil, dan, perempuan dan
                                tenaga muda masih mencatat tingkat partisipasi yang rendah dalam angkatan kerja.
                                Tantangan-tantangan tersebut harus ditangani oleh para penyusun kebijakan dan semua
                                pemangku kepentingan, sebelum berakhirnya bonus demografis dari peningkatan jumlah
                                angkatan kerja. Selain itu, integrasi wilayah regional yang lebih besar sejalan dengan
                                Masyarakat Ekonomi ASEAN pada tahun 2015 akan membawa tekanan persaingan yang
                                lebih tinggi lagi terhadap pasar tenaga kerja dalam negeri.

                2. Kapasitas desa dan pembangunan di Indonesia
Temuan penelitian         Demokratisasi dan desentralisasi di Indonesia pascareformasi tahun 1998 turut membawa
baru menjelaskan          perubahan hubungan antara Pemerintah dan masyarakat. Pada masyarakat perdesaan, warga
tentang perubahan         desa kini bebas menggunakan hak pilihnya untuk memilih kepala desa tanpa harus meminta
kapasitas masyarakat      persetujuan terlebih dahulu kepada pemerintah tingkat kabupaten. Kepala desa kini memiliki
perdesaan dan peran       akses yang lebih baik terhadap sumber daya kabupaten. Juga terjadi penekanan yang semakin
pemerintahan desa         meningkat pada pembangunan berbasis masyarakat (community-driven development, CDD) di
dalam menangani           seluruh penjuru negeri, yang memberi lebih banyak suara dan kekuasaan untuk mengambil
masalah desa dalam        keputusan kepada masyarakat dalam memilih dan menerapkan proyek-proyek pembangunan
Indonesia yang            yang paling sesuai dengan kebutuhan desa. Bagian ini bertujuan untuk menjelaskan tentang
terdesentralisasi dan     apakah dan bagaimana kapasitas masyarakat terpengaruh oleh pergeseran kebijakan nasional
demokratis                dalam demokratisasi, desentralisasi, dan CDD serta interaksinya yang rumit pada tingkat desa
                          atau yang setara sejalan dengan waktu, melalui penelaahan hasil-hasil penelitian terbaru Bank
                          Dunia tentang Penelitian Kelembagaan Tingkat Daerah yang ketiga (World Bank Local Level
                          Institutions Study, LLI3), yang dilaksanakan pada tahun 2012.8

                    a. Sejarah singkat pembangunan berbasis masyarakat di Indonesia

Program                   Tahun 2013 merupakan ulang tahun ke-15 dari penerapan Program Nasional Pemberdayaan
pembangunan berbasis      Masyarakat (PNPM), program CDD terbesar di dunia. Sejak prakarsanya pada tahun 1998
masyarakat utama di       sebagai Program Pengembangan Kecamatan (Kecamatan Development Program) atau PPK,
Indonesia, yaitu          PNPM bekerja berdasarkan prinsip bahwa masyarakat desa memiliki kemampuan untuk
PNPM, berpijak pada       mengidentifikasi, memprioritaskan, memilih, dan menerapkan proyek-proyek pembangunan
kapasitas masyarakat      yang paling sesuai dengan kebutuhan mereka demi meningkatkan kesejahteraan mereka.9
…                         Prinsip ini disarikan dari temuan Penelitian Kelembagaan Tingkat Lokal pertama (LLI1) yang
                          dilakukan oleh Bank Dunia pada tahun 1996.

…mengikuti penelitian     Selaras dengan peningkatan fokus masyarakat pembangunan global pada lembaga-lembaga
yang menemukan            desa dan modal sosial pada waktu itu, LLI1 dilaksanakan dengan tujuan untuk memahami
bahwa sementara           peran lembaga-lembaga tingkat desa dan modal sosial dalam penyampaian layanan dasar dan
masyarakat masih          peningkatan kesejahteraan. Penelitian ini – yang dilakukan pada 48 desa di tiga provinsi (Jawa
memiliki kapasitas        Tengah, Jambi, Nusa Tenggara Timur) – menemukan bahwa, walau pada saat itu Indonesia
bertindak kolektif        masih berada di bawah pemerintahan yang sangat tersentralisasi dan otoriter, kapasitas desa
untuk mengatasi           – yang didefinisikan sebagai kemampuan untuk mengatasi masalah-masalah bersama secara
masalah bersama, hal      kolektif atau gotong royong – tetap mengakar di sebagian besar desa yang diteliti. Namun,
ini dirintangi oleh       kapasitas ini kerap dilemahkan oleh pemerintah desa, yang melaksanakan proyek-proyek
kebijakan dan proyek      pembangunan berdasarkan prinsip atas ke bawah (top-down) tanpa memperhitungkan
pembangunan               kebutuhan khusus di tingkat desa.10 Temuan-temuan ini membuka jalan bagi perancangan
pemerintah dari atas ke   dan penerapan PPK, yang memberikan ruang terbuka alternatif untuk menyampaikan
bawah (top-down)          kebutuhan pembangunan dan sumber daya guna melaksanakan proyek-proyek yang dipilih.
yang tidak                Hanya setahun setelah dimulainya PPK, Indonesia mengalami perubahan politik yang besar
memperhitungkan           dengan jatuhnya rezim Suharto pada tahun 1998 dan dimulainya era desentralisasi pada
kebutuhan desa            tahun 2001.

Demokratisasi dan         Terbitnya fajar demokrasi dan desentralisasi menimbulkan pertanyaan tentang dampak dari
desentralisasi mulai      perubahan-perubahan tersebut terhadap kapasitas desa dan hubungan antara pemerintah dan
membuka ruang untuk       masyarakat. Secara khusus, apakah pembukaan ruang politis membawa kesempatan yang

kapasitas desa…           mempengaruhi tata kelola dan kesejahteraan desa.

                          Penelitian itu menemukan bahwa kapasitas desa masih bertahan pada sebagian besar daerah
                          yang diteliti dan terdapat indikasi peningkatan kesempatan bagi partisipasi masyarakat desa
                          dalam pengambilan keputusan proyek-proyek pembangunan, walau sebagian besar proyek-
                          proyek tidak memberikan hasil yang memuaskan. Sebagai contoh, insiden protes terhadap
                          para kepala desa meningkat, namun umumnya tanpa membawa perubahan riil atau
                          berkelanjutan apapun. Badan Perwakilan Desa (BPD) yang baru dibentuk, dengan tugas
                          meminta akuntabilitas kepala desa, mulai bekerja di beberapa daerah, walau kesimpangsiuran
                          akan fungsi dan keterbatasan mereka dalam hal dukungan operasional agak membatasi
                          kemampuan pelaksanaan kerja mereka.11 Namun, kesan belum adanya perubahan yang
                          berarti ini memang dapat dipahami, karena penelitian itu dilakukan hanya beberapa tahun
                          setelah gejolak ekonomi dan politik pada tahun 1997/1998 dan sekitar masa reformasi
                          desentralisasi tahun 2001.

…namun apakah             Lebih dari satu dekade pascapergeseran politik tahun 1998, desentralisasi tahun 2001, dan
perubahan tetap           penerapan PPK/PNPM di lebih dari 60.000 desa, perubahan-perubahan itu diperkirakan
berlangsung setelah       telah mempengaruhi kapasitas desa. Untuk lebih memahami perubahan-perubahan tersebut,
lebih dari satu dekade?   penelitian LLI ketiga dilakukan pada tahun 2012, dengan tujuan untuk menelusuri
                          perkembangan kapasitas desa sejak LLI2, yang dilakukan lebih dari satu dekade yang lalu,
                          untuk mengetahui apakah telah terdapat pergeseran dalam pengaruh kelompok masyarakat
                          yang berbeda-beda kepada pengambilan keputusan pemerintah, implementasi proyek dan
                          sumber daya negara pada tingkat kabupaten dan perdesaan, dan apakah pergeseran-
                          pergeseran tersebut memiliki keterkaitan dengan perubahan pada kapasitas lokal.

                      b. Memahami perubahan kapasitas desa sejak tahun 2001

Penelitian LLI            Pada penelitian-penelitian LLI, kapasitas desa didefinisikan sebagai kemampuan untuk
mengumpulkan data         memecahkan masalah bersama secara kolektif. Untuk mengukur hal ini, penelitian-penelitian
tentang jenis dan         itu mengumpulkan dan menelusuri data tentang jenis dan jumlah masalah-masalah bersama
jumlah masalah            yang dihadapi oleh desa-desa yang diteliti dan menyelidiki apakah masalah-masalah itu
bersama, apakah           dipecahkan secara bersama dan, jika ya, bagaimana tingkat keberhasilannya. Desa-desa itu
ditangani, dan jika ya,   kemudian dikelompokan ke tiga kelompok kapasitas (tinggi, menengah, rendah) berdasarkan
apakah berhasil           frekuensi tindakan kolektif dan tingkat keberhasilan dalam menghadapi masalah. Kotak 4
                          memaparkan ikhtisar dari metodologi survei tersebut.

Masyarakat                Untuk menelusuri perubahan kapasitas sejak LLI2, penelitian LLI3 pertama-tama
melaporkan tingkat        mentabulasi jumlah dan jenis-jenis masalah yang dijumpai pada desa-desa yang diteliti dan
masalah sosial yang       kemudian melihat kepada jumlah masalah yang berhasil diselesaikan secara kolektif.
lebih rendah pada 2012    Penelitian itu menemukan bahwa masyarakat menjumpai lebih sedikit masalah bersama
dibanding 2001, namun     dibanding LLI2 dan bahwa sifat dari masalah-masalahnya telah bergeser. Secara khusus,
lebih banyak masalah      masyarakat melaporkan lebih banyak masalah-masalah yang berkaitan dengan ekonomi dan
ekonomi dan               penyampaian layanan, sementara masalah-masalah sosial (seperti judi dan minuman keras)
penyampaian layanan       hampir tidak pernah disinggung. Juga terdapat lonjakan dalam jumlah masalah “besar” yang
                          sulit diselesaikan pada tingkat daerah, seperti bencana alam dan tingginya harga input bagi
                          produksi pertanian.

Secara keseluruhan,      Angka tindakan kolektif untuk menyelesaikan masalah bersama mencatat penurunan pada
kemungkinan              seluruh bidang penelitian. Hal ini sebagian dapat dijelaskan oleh peningkatan jumlah masalah
keberhasilan             “besar” yang tidak dapat ditangani oleh kemampuan masyarakat tersebut. Tingkat
masyarakat dalam         keberhasilan penyelesaian masalah bersama, seperti yang ditemukan oleh LLI3, relatif sama
menyelesaikan            seperti pada LLI2. Namun, pola-pola umum ini menutupi adanya variasi yang cukup besar
masalah tidak            dalam perubahan kapasitas lintas desa-desa yang diteliti. Dari dua puluh desa yang diteliti
berubah, namun           kembali pada LLI3, hampir setengah (sembilan desa) mempertahankan kapasitas yang sama.
terdapat variasi yang    Secara khusus, lebih dari setengah desa-desa yang digolongkan sebagai berkapasitas tinggi
besar dalam perubahan    oleh LLI2, telah menunjukkan kegigihan dengan melanjutkan keberhasilan mereka dalam
kapasitas lintas desa    mengatasi masalah-masalah yang lebih baru. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa desa-desa
                         berkapasitas tinggi memiliki daya tahan yang kokoh, walau menghadapi pergeseran politik
                         pada dekade yang lalu.

Upaya mandiri            Seperempat dari desa-desa yang diteliti (lima desa) mencatat peningkatan kapasitas. Sangatlah
penduduk desa dengan     menggembirakan melihat bahwa seluruh desa kecuali satu yang mencatat peningkatan
dukungan kepala desa     kapasitas berasal dari desa berkapasitas rendah pada LLI2. Desa-desa berkapasitas rendah,
yang reformis telah      sesuai definisinya, memiliki sejarah tidak berjalannya mobilisasi secara kolektif, dan
membantu                 tampaknya peningkatan kapasitas desa-desa tersebut pada umumnya didorong oleh upaya
meningkatkan             penduduk desa itu sendiri, seperti menemukan sumber pendapatan yang lebih baik,
kapasitas pada desa-     mendapatkan kembali kendali atas sumber daya alam, dan menggunakan berbagai
desa yang sebelumnya     mekanisme untuk meminta akuntabilitas dari para kepala desa. Faktor-faktor lain yang juga
berkapasitas rendah      memperkuat upaya masyarakat di desa-desa ini adalah kepala desa yang bersifat reformis
                         yang mendengarkan dan bekerja untuk kepentingan penduduk desa, dan, dalam taraf yang
                         lebih kecil, untuk agen-agen eksternal seperti lembaga swadaya masyarakat (LSM), terutama
                         dalam kaitannya dengan sengketa penggunaan tanah dan hutan.

Masalah yang terus       Sekitar sepertiga dari desa-desa (enam desa) mencatat penurunan kapasitas. Desa-desa
bertahan tentang         tersebut terus mengalami berbagai masalah terkait dengan menurunnya sumber daya alam,
penurunan sumber         seperti akses kepada air minum dan sengketa lahan. Juga terdapat tanda-tanda penurunan
daya alam, seperti       gotong-royong pada desa-desa itu, yang menunjukkan penurunan modal sosial. Tiga dari
akses kepada air         desa yang mencatat penurunan kapasitas merupakan desa-desa yang mengalami penurunan
minum atau sengketa      status dari desa menjadi kelurahan. Hal ini berarti bahwa desa-desa itu tidak lagi memiliki
lahan, diperburuk oleh   kepala desa terpilih yang bertanggung jawab kepada para penduduk desa.12 Selain itu,
pemimpin yang tidak      sebagian besar kepala desa pada tiga desa yang tersisa bukanlah kepala desa yang tegas (tidak
reformis, akan           mampu menerapkan keputusan). Pemimpin yang tidak tanggap dan tidak bekerja bagi
menghancurkan            kepentingan penduduk desa merupakan salah satu faktor utama yang mendorong penurunan
kapasitas desa           kapasitas desa.

kepala desa, perwakilan dari Badan Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (BPM)/Lembaga Pemberdayaan Masyarakat (LPM) dan tokoh-tokoh
masyarakat/agama/adat. Wawancara itu membantu mengumpulkan data tentang, antara lain, pemecahan masalah, kepemimpinan,
profil jaringan dan kelembagaan, serta profil-profil proyek (termasuk PNPM). Penelitian itu juga melakukan serangkaian diskusi
kelompok fokus (FGD) dengan anggota masyarakat. Topik-topik FGD termasuk (1) penggunaan lahan, jaringan listrik, dan ancaman
sumber daya alam, (2) produksi, konsumsi, ancaman kelangsungan dan kemajuan, (3) peran dan hubungan Pemerintah, serta (4)
pemecahan masalah.

Bagi komponen kuantitatif, penelitian tersebut melakukan survei panel rumah tangga, termasuk modul-modul tentang karakteristik
dan konsumsi rumah tangga, keterlibatan/keturutsertaan rumah tangga di dalam organisasi (formal maupun informal) dan manfaat-
manfaat, masalah-masalah umum yang dihadapi oleh rumah tangga di daerahnya, pola kepemilikan lahan dan sumber daya lainnya,
kepercayaan dan interaksi sosial, krisis-krisis yang baru terjadi dan mekanisme penyelesaian krisis, pemerintahan desa (kepuasan,
transparansi, dan akuntabilitas).

                       c. Demokratisasi, desentralisasi, CDD, dan kapasitas desa…

Demokratisasi telah       Berkat diterapkannya demokratisasi, penduduk desa kini dapat memiliki kepala desa dengan
memungkinkan              legitimasi yang kuat, karena mereka dipilih secara demokratis oleh para penduduk desa. Pada
penduduk desa untuk       masa mantan presiden Suharto, para calon kepala desa harus mendapat persetujuan dari
memilih kepala desa       pemerintah kabupaten untuk dapat berkampanye dan diangkat. Pemilihan kini dilakukan
yang reformis dan pro-    secara teratur dan para calon tidak langsung ditetapkan oleh pemerintahan dengan tingkatan
masyarakat yang           di atas desa. Juga terdapat batas masa bakti, dengan maksimal dua kali masa bakti selama
mendukung kapasitas       enam tahun, bagi para kepala desa yang diangkat pasca tahun 2001. Demokratisasi juga telah
desa…                     membantu memperkecil ruang bagi kepemimpinan gaya dinasti, yang umum dijumpai pada
                          masa lalu, dan telah memperluas cakupan pencalonan.

…dan memberikan           Pemilihan yang bebas telah membuat para kepala desa lebih tanggap terhadap kepentingan
keunggulan baru bagi      warga desa dan mendorong mereka untuk memainkan peran yang lebih kuat dalam
para kepala desa,         memecahkan masalah-masalah bersama yang teridentifikasi. Kepala desa yang kuat dapat
memungkinkan              menjadi lebih efektif dalam berurusan dengan pelaku-pelaku eksternal (seperti para investor)
mereka untuk              dan pemerintahan dengan tingkat di atas desa untuk memecahkan masalah masyarakat.
memainkan peran           Sebagai contoh, satu kepala desa pada daerah penelitian turut serta dalam kelompok tiga
yang lebih besar dalam    puluh kepala desa yang meminta persetujuan perbaikan jalan provinsi yang melewati desa-
pemecahan masalah         desa mereka sebelum pemilihan kembali gubernur petahana (incumbent). Contoh ini
                          menunjukkan keterampilan organisasi yang hebat dan juga kecerdasan para kepala desa
                          untuk mengambil manfaat dari pemerintahan dengan tingkatan di atas desa. Kepala desa
                          yang lain menggerakkan jaringannya, termasuk bekerja sama dengan LSM wilayah dan
                          nasional, untuk mengambil kembali lahan warga dari konsesi yang diberikan oleh pemerintah
                          pusat (walau sayangnya, para warga juga mencurigai bahwa kepala desa itu menerima
                          manfaat yang tidak selayaknya dari upaya tersebut).

Desentralisasi telah      Kuatnya posisi kepala desa semakin ditingkatkan dengan kenyataan bahwa desentralisasi
meningkatkan akses        memberikan akses langsung bagi kepala desa kepada bupati dan dinas-dinas sektoral
kepala desa terhadap      kabupaten yang mengelola dana dalam jumlah yang cukup signifikan dari pemerintah pusat.
sumber daya tingkat       Sebelumnya kontak seperti ini harus melalui kecamatan. Namun, untuk mendapatkan dana
kabupaten…                (dan proyek-proyek) dari kabupaten, kepala desa harus bertindak pro-aktif dan memiliki
                          jaringan yang baik, mengunjungi dinas-dinas sektoral dan DPRD, dan secara aktif meminta
                          dukungan terkait dengan proyek-proyek tersebut. Kepala desa dengan jaringan yang terbatas
                          harus bergantung kepada proses resmi perencanaan pembangunan tahunan (yaitu
                          Musyawarah Perencanaan Pembangunan atau Musrenbang) untuk mendapatkan proyek-
                          proyek, suatu proses yang oleh sebagian kepala desa dipandang sebagai formalitas yang tidak
                          produktif. Hal ini menguntungkan kepala desa yang dapat menggunakan akses langsung
                          tambahan, walau kadang-kadang tidak resmi, yang timbul berkat desentralisasi.

…namun tanpa              Namun, penguatan kepala desa tidak secara otomatis turut menguatkan warga desa, terutama
mekanisme                 ketika mekanisme pengendalian tidak dapat menekan para kepala desa untuk bekerja bagi
pengendalian, warga       kepentingan warga. Hal ini dapat terlihat pada desa-desa dengan kepala desa yang kuat
desa tidak dapat          namun berkapasitas rendah. Masyarakat pada desa-desa tersebut tidak dapat memanfaatkan
membuat kepala desa       perubahan-perubahan pada lingkungan politik dan meminta agar kepala desa bekerja demi
untuk bekerja demi        kepentingan warga. Desa-desa seperti itu umumnya bergantung kepada pemilihan untuk
kepentingan warga         menyingkirkan para pemimpin yang tidak responsif pada akhir masa jabatannya. Namun,
                          desa-desa dengan kapasitas yang lebih tinggi dapat membuat para kepala desa untuk
                          menggunakan posisi mereka yang lebih kuat untuk mengatasi masalah warga dan meminta
                          akuntabilitas kepala desa itu melalui mekanisme seperti hukum adat dan tradisi atau BPD
                          yang telah mempertahankan peran awalnya seperti yang ditemukan oleh LLI2.

desa telah                memberikan fungsi pemeriksaan dan penyeimbangan dalam pemerintahan desa. Dengan
menyurutkan kapasitas     demikian kepala desa bertanggung jawab kepada BPD dan bupati (yang memberikan dana
desa…                     bagi pemerintahan desa). Namun mekanisme ini kemudian diubah dengan UU No 32/2004,
                          dan namanya diubah walau singkatannya tetap sama. Kepanjangan BPD kini adalah Badan
                          Permusyawaratan Desa, dan anggotanya dipilih secara kemufakatan dan pada dasarnya tidak
                          memiliki kewenangan atas kepala desa. Perubahan-perubahan ini juga menurunkan
                          kemampuan warga desa dalam memantau kepala desanya dan dalam memastikan bahwa
                          pemerintah desa bekerja demi kepentingan bersama yang lebih luas, dan bukan demi
                          kepentingan perorangan atau kelompok tertentu.

                          BPD yang dibentuk pada tahun 1999 terbukti menjadi mekanisme akuntabilitas yang efektif
                          dalam himpunan bagian perdesaan yang mana badan itu dapat bekerja sebelum dilemahkan
                          oleh peraturan perundangan pada tahun 2004. Sejumlah kecil desa-desa di Jawa Tengah,
                          misalnya, tetap mempertahankan peran BPD seperti awalnya sementara sejumlah desa di
                          Jambi tetap mempertahankan mekanisme pengendali hukum adatnya. Pada kalangan
                          masyarakat tersebut, lembaga adat dan BPD telah ,meningkatkan kapasitas desa dengan
                          menyalurkan kebutuhan warga desa kepada para pejabat dan memastikan bahwa
                          pemerintahan desa bekerja untuk menangani prioritas masyarakat yang telah teridentifikasi.

…dengan pemerintah        Walau tanpa mekanisme pemeriksaan dan penyeimbangan pada desa-desa yang disebabkan
kabupaten tidak           oleh perlemahan BPD, tidak terdapat peningkatan pengendalian atau pengawasan atas kepala
menyerahkan kendali       desa oleh kabupaten untuk akuntabilitas kepala desa itu sebagai penyeimbang perlemahan
dan pengawasan            BPD. Kabupaten hanya memberikan pengawasan dan pemantauan yang minim dalam hal
terhadap kepala desa,     apakah para kepala desa melakukan tugasnya atau apakah dana digunakan secara efektif.
kemungkinan terjadi       Dalam keadaan ini, posisi kepala desa yang lebih kuat dapat secara potensial mendorong
penyalahgunaan            penyalahgunaan kekuasaan dan korupsi. Di salah satu desa yang diteliti LLI3, sebagai contoh,
kekuasaan dan korupsi     seorang kepala desa membangun suatu balai desa bernilai ratusan juta rupiah, yang idenya
                          dilontarkan pada masa awal jabatannya namun dihalangi oleh BPD pada tahun 2001. Untuk
                          mendanai balai itu, sang kepala desa menggunakan dana pembangunan desa, dilaporkan
                          memaksa warga untuk memberi sumbangan dana, dan bahkan dilaporkan mengalihkan
                          bantuan raskin kepada rumah tangga miskin untuk membantu pendanaan pembangunan
                          balai desa itu.

Proyek-proyek CDD         Penelitian LLI3 juga menjelaskan tentang pengaruh program CDD terhadap kapasitas desa.
bekerja lebih baik pada   Proyek-proyek partisipatif secara potensial dapat menjadi salah satu upaya untuk
desa-desa berkapasitas    meningkatkan kapasitas desa dengan memberikan ruang bagi pengambilan keputusan secara
lebih tinggi dibanding    kolektif untuk memecahkan masalah desa dan dengan meningkatkan akuntabilitas. Namun,
meningkatkan tata         walaupun desa-desa LLI3 melaporkan tingkat kepuasan yang lebih tinggi, transparansi yang
kelola pada desa-desa     lebih luas, dan pemeliharaan yang lebih baik bagi PNPM dibanding proyek-proyek bukan
yang berkapasitas         CDD, tingkat partisipasi dalam perencanaan pembangunan desa tidak meningkat secara
lebih rendah              keseluruhan. Secara khusus, pada desa-desa dengan kapasitas yang lebih rendah, proyek-
                          proyek CDD belum memfasilitasi peningkatan dalam partisipasi pengambilan keputusan dan
                          tata kelola. Di lain pihak, desa-desa berkapasitas tinggi dapat dengan lebih baik
                          memanfaatkan perencanaan dan pengambilan keputusan secara terbuka di dalam proyek-
                          proyek tersebut untuk memecahkan sebagian masalah-masalah kolektif mereka.

                     d. …dan pentingnya peningkatan pemeriksaan dan penyeimbangan pada
                        tingkat perdesaan

Dibutuhkan                Secara keseluruhan, penelitian LLI3 menunjukkan bahwa kapasitas desa pada desa-desa
mekanisme                 sampel di Indonesia pada umumnya telah terpelihara, dengan desa-desa berkapasitas tinggi
pemeriksaan dan           dapat memanfaatkan kesempatan-kesempatan yang dibawa oleh perubahan dalam kebijakan
penyeimbangan yang        nasional. Sejumlah desa-desa berkapasitas rendah telah mampu meningkatkan kapasitas
lebih kuat pada tingkat   mereka secara organik dengan menangani kendala-kendala sumber daya dan menggunakan
perdesaan dan strategi    mekanisme pengendalian yang ada untuk meminta akuntabilitas pemerintahan desanya.
yang lebih baik dalam     Desa-desa itu juga memperoleh manfaat dari demokratisasi, yang memungkinkan warga desa
proyek-proyek CDD         untuk memilih kepala desa yang reformis dan pro-masyarakat yang bekerja demi kepentingan
untuk membantu            warga desa, dan dari desentralisasi, yang memberikan akses langsung bagi kepala desa
mendukung kapasitas       reformis kepada kabupaten untuk memperoleh dukungan yang dibutuhkan dalam
lokal                     memecahkan masalah-masalah yang telah teridentifikasi. Namun, sejumlah desa telah
                          mengalami penurunan kapasitas, karena tidak mampu menangani masalah yang terus
                          bertahan terkait dengan penurunan sumber daya alam dan meminta pertanggungjawaban
                          pemerintahan desa. Pada sejumlah kasus, penurunan kapasitas desa ini dapat dikaitkan
                          dengan hilangnya kemampuan untuk mengangkat kepala desa karena perubahan status dari
                          desa menjadi kelurahan. Temuan-temuan ini secara kuat menyiratkan kebutuhan untuk
                          memperkuat mekanisme pemeriksaan dan penyeimbangan pada tingkat perdesaan guna
                          membantu warga desa menuntut akuntabilitas pemerintah desa. Dengan demikian,
                          sementara proyek-proyek CDD telah membantu desa-desa berkapasitas tinggi dan menengah
                          dalam memecahkan sebagian masalah kolektifnya, masih banyak hal yang harus dilakukan
                          untuk memungkinkan desa-desa dengan kapasitas lebih rendah untuk memetik manfaat dari
                          proses itu pula.

 Ringkasan eksekutif: Investasi yang tak menentu




Sejalan dengan            Ekonomi Indonesia terus menyesuaiakan diri ditandai dengan pelemahan nilai tukar
berlanjutnya              perdagangan (terms of trade) dan pengetatan kondisi pendanaan luar negeri, dengan komposisi
penyesuaian ekonomi       pertumbuhan yang lebih di dominasi oleh ekspor bersih diserta dengan pertumbuhan
Indonesia terhadap        ekonomi yang sedikit melambat. Sementara penyesuaian yang dilakukan bersifat positif bagi
perubahan lingkungan      stabilitas ekonomi makro, apa yang terus – menerus terjadi adalah masih berlangsungnya
global, diperlukan        proses pengetatan kebijakan moneter dan keberlanjutan dari depresiasi Rupiah pada tahun
kemajuan lebih lanjut     2013, yang pengaruhnya masih terus berlangsung hingga kini. Untuk mengurangi kerentanan
dalam kebijakan-          terhadap kejutan eksternal, mengurangi risiko perlambatan pertumbuhan siklikal yang lebih
kebijakan prioritas       besar, dan untuk mengubah penyesuaian makro jangka pendek menjadi pertumbuhan yang
jangka panjang …          kuat dan berkelanjutan dalam jangka panjang, diperlukan kemajuan lebih lanjut dalam
                          kebijakan-kebijakan prioritas jangka panjang.

…termasuk                 Ada tiga hal utama dapat yang dapat mendukung stabilitas perekonomian jangka pendek
peningkatan kualitas      maupun jangka panjang Indonesia. Yang pertama adalah kebutuhan untuk mendukung
iklim investasi dan       tingkat kepercayaan investor dalam dan luar negeri. Perkembangan regulasi dan kebijakan
perdagangan,              terbaru, termasuk larangan sebagian impor mineral, telah meningkatkan ketidakpastian yang
reformasi fiskal, serta   dapat menghambat investasi lintas ekonomi dan memperumit perkiraan kebijakan sebelum
meneruskan upaya          pelaksanaan pemilu. Dengan makin meningkatnya tekanan fiskal dari melambatnya
dalam mengurangi          pertumbuhan pendapatan dan lebih tingginya biaya subsidi BBM, maka prioritas yang kedua
hambatan struktural       adalah kebutuhan untuk memperluas basis pendapatan negara dan meningkatkan kualitas
pertumbuhan               belanjanya. Terutama dalam hal ini dengan cata menurunkan pengeluaran subsidi energi.
                          Langkah-langkah ini juga akan meningkatkan ketersediaan ruang fiskal bagi pengeluaran yang
                          lebih adil dan pro-pertumbuhan. Ketiga, dibutuhkan kemajuan yang kredibel dalam
                          menghadapi rintangan struktural terhadap pertumbuhan yang lebih kuat dan lebih inklusif,
                          yaitu bagaimana menjembatani kesenjangan keterampilan pekerja dan infrastruktur, serta
                          mengurangi hambatan pasar untuk faktor - faktor produksi. Lingkungan kebijakan tentunya
                          menghadapi sejumlah tantangan menjelang pemilu legislatif pada bulan April dan pemilu
                          presiden pada bulan Juli. Namun, sejalan dengan risiko-risiko ekonomi yang berlangsung dan

                           agenda pembangunan Indonesia yang ambisius, penetapan landasan bagi reformasi yang
                           akan datang, pengurangan ketidakpastian kebijakan, dan keberlanjutan kemajuan reformasi di
                           sejumlah bidang harus tetap menjadi prioritas.

Kondisi ekonomi            Ekonomi global terus menguat secara bertahap dimotori oleh pemulihan yang tengah
global juga sedang         berlangsung pada negara- negara berpenghasilan tinggi, terutama di AS dan wilayah Eropa.
berubah, membawa           Pemulihan ini umumnya bersifat positif bagi negara - negara berkembang (emerging market
sejumlah tantangan         economies, EME) termasuk Indonesia, karena hal ini berarti secara umum meningkatkan
bagi Indonesia             potensi aliran perdagangan. Namun, perkembangan berbagai harga komoditas, yang secara
                           agregat berkontribusi sebesar dua per tiga dari ekspor barang Indonesia, tetap lemah,
                           sementara tekanan penurunan harga sepertinya akan terus berlanjut yang diakibatkan faktor-
                           faktor dari sisi penawaran, dan kondisi penyesuaian pertumbuhan (re-balancing) yang
                           berkelanjutan yang dialami oleh Cina terhadap investasi yang didorong oleh kredit. Selain itu,
                           penentuan harga dari penarikan bertahap kebijakan moneter yang sangat akomodatif di AS
                           memberikan tekanan kepada dunia untuk menaikan suku bunganya. Aliran masuk portofolio
                           modal investasi ke EME telah menurun seiring dengan penyesuaian risiko dan prospek
                           pertumbuhan relatif jangka panjang oleh para investor, dengan pasar yang tampaknya
                           semakin membedakan negara-negara berdasarkan faktor kerentanan domestik .

Penyesuaian ekonomi        Penyesuaian (rebalancing) ekonomi Indonesia terus berlangsung di kuartal akhir tahun 2013,
Indonesia terus            menyesuaikan terhadap melemahnya nilai tukar perdagangan dan terbatasnya pendanaan luar
berlangsung hingga         negeri akibat semakin ketatnya kebijakan moneter dan depresiasi kurs mata uang. Ekspor
akhir 2013, yang           bersih memberikan dorongan yang signifikan terhadap pertumbuhan, terutama dengan
ditunjukkan oleh           adanya moderasi pada pertumbuhan volume impor serta peningkatan ekspor. Investasi
perlambatan investasi      masih mencatat laju pertumbuhan di bawah rata-rata, yang menghambat pertumbuhan dan
dan meningkatnya           melemahkan permintaan impor. Indikator konsumsi swasta menunjukkan hasil yang lebih
volume ekspor              beragam, dengan sejumlah indikasi bahwa konsumsi pun mengalami moderasi, namun
bersih…                    belanja yang berkaitan dengan pemilu dapat menjadi faktor pendorong jangka pendek.

                           oleh melemahnya impor barang modal dan barang setengah jadi. Namun, neraca dasar yang
                           merupakan jumlah saldo neraca berjalan dan investasi asing langsung (foreign direct investment,
                           FDI) bersih, diproyeksikan akan tetap negatif dalam jangka pendek. Hal ini menunjukkan

                                                                             Perekonomian Indonesia

                          bahwa Indonesia akan terus bergantung pada investasi portfolio dan aliran masuk modal
                          investasi lain yang bersifat rentan. Kebutuhan pembiayaan eksternal bruto di luar
                          pembiayaan neraca berjalan juga tetap signifikan, dengan hutang luar negeri jangka pendek
                          mencapai 56,7 miliar dolar AS pada bulan Desember menurut Bank Indonesia (BI).
                          Karenanya, Indonesia tetap rentan terhadap pengetatan baru apapun dalam pembiayaan luar
                          negeri.

Pertumbuhan kredit        Penyesuaian neraca eksternal Indonesia telah menjadi fokus khusus bagi BI sejak
telah melemah, dan        pertengahan tahun 2013. Penetapan posisi kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat di paruh
faktor-faktor musiman     kedua tahun lalu bersama-sama dengan makin lemahnya prospek investasi, telah
dan kurs tukar            berkontribusi terhadap penurunan yang cukup besar pada pertumbuhan kredit. Melemahnya
mempengaruhi inflasi      pertumbuhan simpanan dan terbatasnya ruang rasio hutang-terhadap-simpanan (loan-to-
                          deposit), terutama pada sejumlah bank-bank yang berukuran lebih kecil, menunjukkan bahwa
                          kondisi ini nampaknya akan terus berlangsung cukup lama. Dalam hal prospek inflasi jangka
                          pendek, apresiasi Rupiah yang belakangan terjadi, dan lambatnya dampak peningkatan suku
                          bunga yang sebelumnya terjadi terhadap ekonomi, bersama-sama akan menjaga tekanan
                          inflasi tetap terkendali.

Sementara tahun 2013      Sektor fiskal Indonesia menghadapi sejumlah tekanan dari melemahnya pertumbuhan
mencatat defisit fiskal   pendapatan nominal dan meningkatnya biaya subsidi energi. Realisasi sementara APBN 2013
yang moderat sebesar      menunjukkan defisit fiskal sebesar 2,2 persen dari PDB lebih baik dari perkiraan yang
2,2 persen dari PDB,      disebabkan oleh lebih rendahnya belanja dan bukan dikarenakan pendapatan yang lebih
pertumbuhan               tinggi dari proyeksi. Pertumbuhan pendapatan nominal yang menurun cukup signifikan
pendapatan nominal        menjadi 6,8 persen pada tahun 2013 dari 10,5 persen pada tahun 2012 dan 21,6 persen pada
telah melambat dan        tahun 2011, diperkirakan akan tetap lemah pada tahun 2014, yang mencerminkan moderasi
tekanan fiskal            pertumbuhan ekonomi dan impor, serta ketidak adaannya langkah-langkah baru yang
meningkat                 signifikan yand dapat mendorong penerimaan. Pada sisi pengeluaran, belanja subsidi BBM
                          tetap tidak tepat sasaran, distortif dan mengakibatkan biaya kesempatan (opportunity cost) dan
                          risiko fiskal yang tinggi. Sebagai contoh, Bank Dunia memproyeksikan peningkatan biaya
                          BBM dalam Rupiah akan mendorong subsidi BBM hingga Rp 267 triliun pada tahun 2014
                          (2,6 persen dari PDB) dari Rp 210 triliun pada tahun 2013 (2,2 persen dari PDB), dan
                          melampaui alokasi awal pada APBN 2014 sebesar Rp 211 triliun. Reformasi, seperti
                          perubahan penyesuaian harga BBM dari penetapan ke penyesuaian yang berdasarkan aturan
                          merupakan hal yang penting dan harus bertujuan untuk menurunkan ketidakpastian belanja
                          subsidi dan anggaran dan memastikan bahwa kelompok miskin dan rentan menerima
                          perlindungan dari kenaikan harga-harga.

Bank Dunia                Proyeksi dasar (baseline) Bank Dunia untuk pertumbuhan PDB Indonesia tahun 2014 tetap
memproyeksikan            sama seperti proyeksi IEQ edisi bulan Desember 2013 sebesar 5,3 persen tahun-ke-tahun
pertumbuhan PDB           (year-on-year, yoy) (Tabel 1). Konsumsi swasta diperkirakan akan menerima dorongan yang
akan sedikit melemah      bersifat sementara menjelang pemilu bulan April dan Juli, namun ketatnya kondisi kredit bagi
menjadi 5,3 persen        rumah tangga dapat menjadi faktor penyeimbang untuk tahun 2014 secara keseluruhan.
pada tahun 2014, dan      Selain itu, pertumbuhan investasi diperkirakan akan tetap lemah karena tingginya biaya
defisit neraca berjalan   pinjaman, rendahnya harga-harga komoditas, dan meningkatnya harga-haraga barang modal
akan menyempit            impor dalam denominasi Rupiah bila dibandingkan dengan beberapa tahun terakhir.
menjadi 2,9 persen dari   Pertumbuhan ekspor diproyeksikan akan meningkat secara bertahap seiring dengan
PDB…                      permintaan luar negeri, yang berkontribusi terhadap sedikit meningkatnya pertumbuhan
                          PDB, menjadi 5,6 persen untuk tahun 2015. Pada akhir tahun, inflasi IHK bulanan
                          diperkirakan akan turun sedikit di bawah sasaran BI yang sebesar 3,5-5,5 persen yoy dan
                          akan tetap bertahan hingga akhir tahun 2015. Defisit neraca berjalan diproyeksikan pada 2,9
                          persen dari PDB untuk tahun 2014. Memasuki tahun 2015, saldo neraca berjalan
                          diperkirakan akan semakin meningkat, namun tetap berada dalam keadaan defisit, dengan
                          dampak dari pelarangan ekspor mineral tampaknya akan memperlambat kembalinya neraca
                          perdagangan menjadi surplus, dan defisit struktural yang tetap bertahan pada neraca
                          pendapatan dan jasa-jasa.

…namun keterbatasan     Proyeksi dasar (baseline) penurunan lebih lanjut yang relatif kecil dalam pertumbuhan
pembiayaan eksternal    didasarkan pada berlanjutnya ketersediaan pembiayaan luar negeri untuk memenuhi
mungkin kembali         kebutuhan pembiayaan bruto yang signifikan. Sentimen investor telah membaik belakangan
meningkat…              ini, Rupiah telah mencatat penguatan sekitar 7 persen terhadap dolar AS selama tahun 2014
                        berjalan, indeks saham dalam negeri meningkat 9 persen, dan imbal hasil (yield) surat utang
                        negara telah menurun sekitar 30 basis poin. Namun demikian, berlanjutnya peningkatan
                        volatilitas dalam kondisi pembiayaan luar negeri masih tetap menjadi risiko, terutama dengan
                        berlanjutnya pengurangan stimulus yang dilakukan oleh Bank Sentral Amerika (US Federal
                        Reserve). Selain itu, bila pemulihan AS ternyata melampaui perkiraan, maka hal itu akan
                        menjadi hal yang positif bagi prospek perdagangan Indonesia, namun tampaknya juga akan
                        mendorong pasar untuk mempertimbangkan kembali penetapan waktu bagi peningkatan
                        suku bunga bank sentral AS yang berpotensi menekan aliran investasi ke negara-negara EME
                        utama seperti Indonesia. Selain itu, terdapat risiko dari permintaan luar negeri yang lebih
                        lemah dari perkiraan, terutama akibat dampak laju dan komposisi pertumbuhan Cina
                        terhadap perdagangan, yang juga dapat mempengaruhi harga-harga komoditas.

kebijakan akhir-akhir   untuk terus melanjutkan capaian dalam meningkatkan ketahanan dan laju pertumbuhan
ini menambah            ekonomi Indonesia yang berkelanjutan. Namun sejumlah perkembangan peraturan dan
ketidakpastian…         kebijakan yang belakangan terjadi, termasuk pelarangan akan sebagian ekspor mineral
                        mentah, UU perdagangan dan kepemilikan asing yang baru, serta penundaan pelaksanaan
                        daftar negatif investasi yang baru, secara nyata telah meningkatkan ketidakpastian akan
                        kebijakan pemerintah. Pelarangan ekspor mineral mentah pada bulan Januari merupakan
                        perubahan kebijakan besar yang baru terjadi dengan potensi dampak yang signifikan
                        terhadap sektor pertambangan dan perekonomian secara lebih luas. Proses kebijakan yang
                        kemudian menghasilkan revisi peraturan pada bulan Januari 2014 dan tantangan hukum yang
                        terkait dengannya, semakin memperlemah persepsi iklim investasi pertambangan Indonesia,
                        yang sebelumnya sudah memiliki peringkat sebagai salah satu yang terburuk di dunia.

…dengan kebijakan       Melalui pelaksanaan sebagian larangan dan pajak ekspor baru pada ekspor mineral mentah,
larangan ekspor         Indonesia hendak meningkatkan nilai tambah dalam negeri di dalam sektor mineral. Hal ini

Indonesia: Avoiding     membuka peluang untuk menguji ulang aspirasi pembangunan ekonomi jangka panjang
the Trap, menyatakan Indonesia yang lebih luas. Dalam dua dekade berikut, Indonesia bercita-cita untuk mencapai
bahwa Indonesia dapat kesejahteraan, menghindari jebakan negara berpenghasilan menengah, dan tidak
mencapai sasaran        meninggalkan siapapun di belakang, dalam upayanya mengejar ketinggalannya dari ekonomi-
pembangunan jangka      ekonomi berpenghasilan tinggi. Sasaran-sasaran itu cukup ambisius. Realisasinya akan

strategi pertumbuhan    memberikan ringkasan dari laporan Bank Dunia yang akan datang, berjudul Indonesia:
yang terfokus pada      Avoiding the Trap. Laporan itu menyatakan bahwa Indonesia berpotensi untuk bangkit serta
produktivitas yang      menjadi lebih sejahtera dan lebih merata. Namun, risiko “mengambang di tengah-tengah”
tepat dan dengan        juga merupakan risiko yang nyata. Jalur yang diambil oleh ekonomi akan bergantung kepada:
menerapkan reformasi (i) pemilihan strategi pertumbuhan yang mendorong pewujudan potensi produktivitas
struktural berprioritas ekonomi tersebut; dan (ii) implementasi yang konsisten dari sejumlah kecil reformasi
tinggi…                 struktural berprioritas tinggi yang telah lama ada untuk mendorong pertumbuhan dan
                        memeratakan kesejahteraan. Indonesia beruntung karena memiliki pilihan dalam membiayai
                        reformasi itu tanpa mengancam prospek fiskal jangka panjangnya. Kesulitannya adalah
                        bagaimana melaksanakan reformasi itu di dalam kerangka kelembagaan desentralisasi yang
                        rumit. Namun, mengingat pentingnya hal yang dipertaruhkan, Indonesia tidak bisa tidak
                        harus berupaya keras.

…dan juga                 Sejalan dengan tingginya frekuensi banjir berulang pada daerah-daerah perkotaan yang
menetapkan                kembali terjadi pada musim hujan tahun 2014, Laporan IEQ ini juga memfokuskan kepada
kebijakan-kebijakan       risiko iklim dan bencana yang dihadapi Indonesia yang terus berurbanisasi, dan
untuk memitigasi          kecenderungan terus meningkatnya risiko-risiko ini sebagai konsekuensi dari tren urbanisasi
risiko perubahan iklim    tersebut. Indonesia merupakan negara terdepan di dunia dalam hal laju urbanisasi, bahkan
dan bencana yang          mengalahkan Cina, India, dan Thailand. Namun, banyak pusat-pusat perkotaan terletak di
tampaknya akan            daerah-daerah yang rawan. Penelitian terakhir menekankan pentingnya penyesuaian
meningkat sejalan         pembangunan infrastruktur dengan dampak perubahan iklim dan bencana untuk
dengan terus              membangun ketahanan, terutama pada kota-kota berukuran menengah. Di Indonesia, kota-
meningkatnya              kota itu adalah kota-kota yang akan menjadi pendorong pembangunan ekonomi pada
urbanisasi di Indonesia   dekade-dekade mendatang. Tanpa investasi dan intervensi kebijakan yang terencana secara
                          strategis, dan kapasitas kelembagaan yang lebih kuat, urbanisasi yang dikelola secara buruk
                          dapat menjadi rintangan terhadap pertumbuhan yang inklusif dan berkelanjutan. Yang lebih
                          memprihatinkan, hal ini dapat juga memberikan risiko bencana dan perubahan iklim yang
                          tidak semestinya kepada penduduk Indonesia, sehingga menyoroti kebutuhan untuk

Indonesia               pertumbuhan ekonomi Cina yang tidak lagi bertopang pada investasi yang didanai kredit dan
                        lemahnya harga komoditas yang membentuk dua per tiga dari ekspor Indonesia. Kedua,
                        tekanan pada suku bunga global akibat pengurangan kebijakan moneter yang akomodatif di
                        AS dan negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi lainnya akan tetap berlangsung. Selain itu
                        penyesuaian persepsi investor global terhadap resiko dan pertumbuhan ekonomi dunia telah
                        menekan aliran investasi portfolio ke negara-negara berkembang.

Pertumbuhan ekonomi     Meskipun perkembangan ekonomi global sedikit tidak merata, secara umum terlihat
global diharapkan       peningkatan pertumbuhan ekonomi, terutama bagi sebagian besar negara mitra dagang
terus menguat…          utama Indonesia. AS dan Jepang mengalami perlambatan pertumbuhan PDB pada kuartal
                        terakhir 2013, namun negara-negara zona eropa and negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi
                        lainnya mengalami peningkatan pertumbuhan ekonomi. Penilaian terhadap perkembangan
                        ekonomi AS cukup sulit dengan adanya perubahan cuaca yang terjadi di awal tahun 2014,
                        namun indikator-indikator utama dan data penggajian terbaru menunjukkan bahwa
                        pemulihan masih terus berlangsung, demikian pula dengan negara-negara zona eropa. .
                        Skenario dasar kedepan menunjukkan pertumbuhan ekonomi global yang terus menguat,
                        dipimpin oleh pertumbuhan ekonomi di negara-negara maju (Gambar 2). Pertumbuhan
                        negara-negara berkembang diharapkan membaik, terutama pertumbuhan Cina yang
                        mendekati sasaran pertumbuhan resminya sebesar 7,5 persen untuk tahun 2014. Dengan
                        demikian, kondisi ekonomi internasional akan terus mendukung permintaan ekspor
                        Indonesia.

negara berkembang         tahun AS berkisar antara 2,6-3,0 persen), seiring dengan dimulainya “penurunan” kebijakan

rendah                    latar belakang hal ini, banyak pasar valuta dan ekuitas negara berkembang telah mengalami
                          kerugian atau perlambatan dibandingkan dengan sejumlah negara berpenghasilan tinggi yang
                          mengalami peningkatan.Sebagai contoh, indeks ekuitas MSCI Standard negara berkembang
                          dalam dolar AS melemah sebesar 5,9 persen sepanjang tahun 2014 hingga tanggal 13 Maret
                          lalu. Sementara indeks S&P 500 (saham-saham utama di AS) relatif stabil. Rendahnya kinerja
                          aset negara-negara berkembang mencerminkan kekhawatiran investor terhadap penyesuaian
                          ekonomi dan kemungkinan pertumbuhan ekonomi yang lebih rendah yang merupakan
                          konsekuensi dari penurunan kebijakan moneter yang akomodatif di negara-negara maju serta
                          peningkatan suku bunga global. Hal-hal ini dapat mempengaruhi kinerja pasar keuangan
                          Indonesia, namun sepanjang tahun 2014, kinerja pasar keuangan Indonesia relatif kuat.

Penyesuaian ekonomi       Ekonomi Indonesia terus mengalami penyesuaian hingga kuartal terakhir 2013 seiring
Indonesia berlanjut       dengan melemahnya nilai tukar perdagangan dan semakin mengetatnya kondisi pembiayaan

dengan melambatnya        didorong oleh peningkatan ekspor bersih yang mencerminkan penurunan volume impor dan
investasi dan             peningkatan ekspor. Laju pertumbuhan pembentukan modal tetap masih di bawah rata-rata,
meningkatnya volume       menurunkan permintaan impor dan berkontribusi terhadap penyesuaian pertumbuhan. Pada
ekspor bersih             saat yang sama, pengeluaran konsumsi masih tetap kuat. Penyesuaian ekonomi ini
                          diperkirakan akan berlanjut dalam jangka pendek, sehingga diperkirakan akan sedikit

Data frekuensi tinggi        Sejumlah indikator kegiatan ekonomi frekuensi tinggi, menunjukkan penurunan permintaan
terakhir tampak              dalam negeri di bulan pertama tahun 2014, kecuali penjualan ritel. Terpengaruh oleh banjir di
beragam namun                pulau Jawa, penjualan sepeda motor, padakhususnya, turun cukup tajam sebesar 11,3 persen
konsisten dengan             yoy pada bulan Januari (atau meningkat hanya 4,3 persen 3mma yoy) (Gambar 7). Indeks
peningkatan konsumsi         manufakturing PMI (Purchasing Managers Index, PMI) HSBC untuk sektor manufaktur,
swasta menjelang             mencapai 50,5 pada bulan Februari, tetap dalam keadaan yang sedik ekspansif. Namun,
pemilu                       survei BI mengenai penjualan ritel mencatat peningkatan yang signifikan ke 26,6 dan 28,8
                             persen yoy masing-masing untuk bulan Desember dan Januari. Tingginya penjualan ritel ini
                             disebabkan oleh peningkatan belanja konsumsi swasta pada kuartal pertama tahun 2014,
                             yang tampaknya didukung oleh persiapan kampanye pemilu.

Pertumbuhan output           Proyeksi dasar (baseline) Bank Dunia terhadap pertumbuhan PDB Indonesia tetap pada 5,3

diproyeksikan relatif        peningkatan sementara menjelang pemilu bulan April dan Juli. Namun, kondisi kredit yang
moderat                      lebih ketat tampaknya akan mempengaruhi belanja rumah tangga pada tahun 2014. Sejalan
                             dengan hal tersebut, pertumbuhan investasi juga diperkirakan akan tetap lemah pada jangka
                             pendek akibat semakin tingginya biaya pinjaman, lebih rendahnya harga-harga komoditas,

                   3. Inflasi inti telah naik perlahan
Tekanan pada inflasi          Setelah meningkat tajam pasca kenaikan harga BBM bersubsidi pada bulan Juni 2013, inflasi
berkurang, kecuali            harga konsumen bulanan mencatat penurunan yang cukup besar pada bulan-bulan menjelang
pengaruh dari                 akhir tahun 2013. Namun belakangan inflasi kembali meningkat akibat faktor musiman. Pada
depresiasi Rupiah             saat yang sama, inflasi inti mengalami penurunan menjelang akhir 2013, namun meningkat
                              kembali belakangan ini, sebagian diakibatkan oleh pengaruh perlemahan Rupiah yang
                              tertunda. Dalam jangka pendek pengaruh yang tertunda dari peningkatan suku bunga akan
                              menjaga tekanan inflasi tetap dalam kendali.

Faktor-faktor musiman         Tekanan harga konsumen menurun pada paruh kedua tahun 2013, setelah harga BBM
mendorong naiknya             bersubsidi meningkat sebesar rata-rata 33 persen pada tanggal 22 Juni (Gambar 8).

                             2014, yang merupakan puncak musim hujan, harga-harga konsumen kembali naik secara
                             berurutan. Secara tahun-ke-tahun, inflasi IHK mencapai 8,2 persen pada bulan Januari 2014
                             sebelum turun ke 7,7 persen pada bulan Februari.

…sementara inflasi           Inflasi harga bahan pangan terus menurun menjadi 8,8 persen yoy pada bulan Februari 2014,
harga bahan pangan           dari 15,1 persen yoy pada bulan Agustus atau Ramadan tahun lalu. Penurunan tekanan harga
terus menurun…               bahan pangan yang tercatat pada beberapa bulan terakhir disebabkan oleh deflasi harga pada
                             sejumlah bahan pangan utama, seperti cabai merah dan bawang merah di beberapa kota di
                             Sumatera dan wilayah Indonesia bagian timur, yang mengimbangi peningkatan harga-harga
                             beras, tepung, dan daging sapi. Hujan sejak bulan Desember dan letusan Gunung Kelud di
                             Jawa Timur pada bulan Februari tampaknya tidak membawa dampak yang signifikan
                             terhadap inflasi harga bahan pangan nasional.

…namun kesenjangan           Sebaliknya, rendahnya hasil panen beras akibat banjir besar yang melanda Indonesia telah
antara harga beras di        mendorong melebarnya kesenjangan antara harga beras di dalam dan luar negeri. Pada bulan
dalam dan luar negeri        Desember 2013, harga beras internasional dengan kualitas yang sebanding (yang diwakili oleh
telah melebar                beras Vietnam kualitas menengah sebagai acuan) mencapai 41-52 persen lebih murah dari
                             harga beras kulakan di dalam negeri. Kesenjangan harga itu meningkat menjadi 70-83 persen
                             pada bulan Februari 2014. Peningkatan perbedaan harga itu didorong oleh tiga faktor:
                             menurunnya harga beras internasional akibat kelebihan pasokan di pasar internasional,
                             peningkatan harga beras dalam negeri (naik sebesar 7,3-10,3 persen yoy), dan depresiasi
                             Rupiah terhadap dolar AS.

Inflasi inti meningkat,      Inflasi inti, yang tidak menyertakan harga-harga barang volatil seperti bahan pangan dan
sebagian disebabkan          energi, menurun pada kuartal keempat tahun 2013 namun kembali meningkat pada awal
oleh depresiasi Rupiah       tahun ini. Secara tahun-ke-tahun, inflasi IHK inti telah meningkat dari 4,0 persen yoy pada
                             bulan Juni 2013 ke 5,3 persen yoy pada bulan Februari 2014, nilai tertinggi yang pernah
                             tercatat sejak Juni 2009. Hal ini sebagian disebabkan oleh pengaruh perlemahan Rupiah ke
                             harga-harga dalam negeri. Rupiah mengalami depresiasi sebesar 25 persen antara bulan Mei
                             2013 dan Januari 2014 sebelum menguat sebesar sekitar 5 persen pada bulan Februari
                             (Gambar 8).

Inflasi IHK                    Ke depannya, inflasi IHK tahun-ke-tahun diperkirakan akan mencapai puncaknya pada
diperkirakan akan              kuartal kedua tahun 2014. Setelah itu, tekanan inflasi diproyeksikan akan menurun akibat
turun ke sedikit di            pengaruh dasar yang menguntungkan dan perlemahan pertumbuhan. Menjelang akhir tahun
bawah sasaran batas            2014, inflasi IHK bulanan diperkirakan akan turun sedikit di bawah rentang sasaran batas
atas BI pada akhir             atas Bank Indonesia (BI) sebesar 3,5-5,5 persen yoy dan tetap bertahan hingga akhir tahun
tahun 2014                     2015. Inflasi inti diperkirakan akan kurang lebih mengikuti jalur lintasan yang serupa, dengan
                               menurunnya pengaruh buruk dari depresiasi kurs tukar valuta. Risiko-risiko terhadap
                               proyeksi skenario dasar (base case) bersifat seimbang dan berkaitan dengan kemungkinan

faktor-faktor yang             Penurunan impor terus berlanjut, dengan impor barang modal dan setengah stabil, sementara
bersifat sementara             barang-barang konsumsi sedikit meningkat. Penerbitan surat utang negara dan pinjaman
                               swasta dari luar negeri, serta repatriasi simpanan dan valas, membantu membiayai defisit
                               neraca berjalan yang mencapai 4 miliar dolar AS. Meskipun dengan memperhitungkan
                               perbaikan pada kuartal terakhir tahun 2013, neraca dasar, yang merupakan jumlah dari saldo
                               neraca berjalan dan investasi langsung bersih, diperkirakan akan tetap bernilai negatif selama
                               jangka pendek. Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa pembiayaan luar negeri bersih Indonesia
                               tampaknya akan terus bergantung kepada investasi portofolio yang secara potensial bersifat

                         ekspor tahun-ke-tahun pada bulan pertama tahun 2014 (Gambar 12). Nilai ekspor bijih,
                         terak, dan abu menurun dari 970 juta dolar AS pada bulan Desember 2013 ke 290 juta dolar
                         AS pada bulan Januari 2014. Bank Dunia memperkirakan kerugian ekspor yang berkaitan
                         dengan larangan ekspor mineral mentah, secara relatif terhadap keadaan tanpa larangan atau
                         tanpa pajak ekspor, berjumlah 5,3-7 miliar dolar AS setahun. Dampak dari larangan ekspor
                         mineral itu meningkat dengan terlambatnya penerbitan izin ekspor bagi mineral-mineral yang
                         telah diproses. Untuk pembahasan lebih lanjut tentang larangan ekspor mineral dan
                         dampaknya, lihat Bagian B.1.

Melemahnya impor         Penyusutan impor menjadi bagian dari dinamika perdagangan belakangan ini, walau tidak
barang modal dan         terlalu besar pada kuartal keempat. Sebagai contoh, meskipun penurunan impor hanya
setengah jadi juga       merupakan 6 persen pada kuartal keempat relatif terhadap kuartal ketiga tahun 2014,
berkontribusi pada       penurunan itu sebenernya berkontribusi hingga 60 persen pada peningkatan neraca
peningkatan neraca       perdagangan dibandingkan dengan posisi satu tahun sebelumnya. Impor barang modal dan
perdagangan              setengah jadi melemah, dengan impor barang modal pada khususnya hanya mencatat rata-
                         rata 16 persen lebih rendah dari lajunya pada paruh kedua tahun 2013. Impor barang
                         konsumsi hampir tidak memiliki kontribusi terhadap pertumbuhan impor secara keseluruhan
                         (Gambar 13). Menurunnya impor barang modal berkaitan dengan penurunan laju investasi
                         yang cukup mencolok (lihat juga Kotak 1). Neraca perdagangan migas teteap menjadi beban
                         kepada neraca perdagangan, dengan defisit sebesar 1 miliar dolar AS pada kuartal keempat.

Aliran masuk modal       Aliran modal masuk dan neraca keuangan meningkat dengan tajam, dari 5,6 miliar dolar AS
dan neraca finansial     pada kuartal ketiga tahun 2013 ke 9,2 miliar dolar AS pada kuartal keempat, sebagian besar
meningkat berkat         didorong oleh aliran pada sub-rekening “investasi lain”. Dalam hal ini, repatriasi aset luar
kenaikan pinjaman        negeri telah membalikkan aliran keluar modal sebesar USD 2,3 miliar pada kuartal ketiga
swasta dan repatriasi    tahun 2013. Kuatnya penarikan utang luar negeri oleh dunia usaha dalam negeri
modal asing yang         berkontribusi hingga 4,1 miliar dolar AS dalam aliran masuk utang investasi lain, naik dari
signifikan               aliran keluar sebesar 133 juta dolar AS pada kuartal ketiga. Aliran masuk penanaman modal
                         asing langsung (FDI) sesuai dengan rata-rata tiga tahun sebesar sekitar 4 miliar dolar AS per
                         kuartal. Akuisisi Pertamina atas ladang-ladang minyak di Algeria dengan nilai sekitar 2,5
                         miliar dolar AS berkontribusi terhadap penurunan investasi langsung bersih, menjadi 1,6
                         miliar dolar AS dari 5,6 miliar pada kuartal ketiga. Sebagai akibatnya, neraca dasar tetap
                         negatif, walau terdapat kontraksi defisit neraca berjalan yang besar. Investasi portofolio

Kotak 1: Faktor penentu permintaan impor Indonesia: investasi dan ekspor memainkan peran penting
 Pertumbuhan volume impor di Indonesia mencatat penurunan yang signifikan pada tahun 2013. Estimasi dengan menggunakan
 error correction model, (ECM) menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar penurunan permintaan impor dapat dijelaskan oleh perlambatan
 investasi tetap yang cukup besar (konsisten dengan penurunan yang tercatat pada impor barang modal) dan peningkatan harga
 barang-barang impor relatif terhadap barang-barang dalam negeri. Secara historis, konsumsi rumah tangga belum pernah menjadi
 faktor penentu yang signifikan bagi pertumbuhan impor.

 Seperti prosedur standar di dalam literatur, model ECM dapat digunakan untuk mempelajari pengaruh jangka pendek dan panjang
 terhadap permintaan impor riil dari tiga komponen permintaan dari neraca nasional dan harga-harga relatif, dimana harga relatif
 didefinisikan sebagai rasio dari deflator impor terhadap indeks harga konsumen (IHK). Seluruh variabel diubah menjadi logaritma
 dan periode sampel adalah kuartal pertama tahun 1993 – kuartal keempat tahun 2013. Hasil-hasilnya menunjukkan bahwa, secara
 statistika, konsumsi swasta bukan merupakan faktor penentu yang signifikan bagi pertumbuhan impor (Tabel 4). Untuk jangka
 pendek, peningkatan investasi sebesar satu persen menyebabkan peningkatan sekitar 0,5 poin persentase terhadap permintaan
 impor. Selain itu, peningkatan ekspor sebesar satu persen terkait dengan peningkatan impor sebesar 0,6 poin persentase karena
 barang impor digunakan dalam produksi ekspor (lihat IEQ edisi bulan Maret 2012 untuk perincian tentang pentingnya peran impor
 dalam nilai tambah ekspor di Indonesia). Pengaruh jangka panjang investasi lebih lemah dibandingkan dengan pengaruhnya dalam
 jangka pendek, sementara pengaruh dari ekspor tetap kuat. Seperti telah diperkirakan, peningkatan harga barang-barang impor
 relatif terhadap barang-barang dalam negeri akan menyebabkan penurunan permintaan impor.

 Dekomposisi pertumbuhan tahunan impor rill menunjukkan bahwa sebagian besar penurunan yang terjadi pada tahun 2012
 merupakan dampak dari perlambatan ekspor, sementara permintaan bagi barang input yang diimpor untuk produksi ekspor
 diperkirakan berkontribusi terhadap hampir seluruh pertumbuhan impor pada tahun 2013. Temuan-temuan ini menunjukkan
 bahwa penurunan impor tidak selalu mengakibatkan peningkatan neraca perdagangan, karena penurunan itu dapat berkaitan dengan
 penurunan ekspor. Penurunan pertumbuhan investasi yang signifikan, seperti yang dibahas pada Bagian 2, juga tercermin pada
 komposisi permintaan impor pada tahun 2013. Selain itu, lebih tingginya harga-harga impor, yang sebagian disebabkan oleh
 perlemahan Rupiah pada tahun 2013, juga telah membawa pengaruh negatif terhadap impor.

 bagi impor riil                                              impor pada 2012, dan ekspor turut mendorong hampir

                    5. Mengikuti pengetatan kebijakan moneter, pertumbuhan kredit melemah
Kebijakan moneter              Pada paruh kedua tahun lalu, Bank Indonesia (BI) mengambil fokus yang jelas dalam
telah diperketat…              memfasilitasi penyesuaian neraca luar negeri Indonesia, yang berlangsung seperti dijelaskan
                               pada Bagian 4 di atas. Kebijakan moneter diperketat selama bulan Juni-November 2013,
                               dimana BI meningkatkan batas bawah koridor suku bunganya (fasilitas simpanan overnight,
                               FASBI, suku bunga) dan BI Rate sebesar 175 basis poin secara kumulatif, menjadi masing-
                               masing 5,75 persen dan 7,5 persen. Selain itu, BI juga meningkatkan persyaratan giro wajib
                               minumum (GWM) sekunder dari 2,5 persen pada bulan September menjadi 4 persen pada
                               bulan Desember, dan persyaratan cadangan devisa dari 1 ke 8 persen pada periode yang
                               sama. Kotak 2 memberikan sudut pandang tambahan akan posisi kebijakan moneter
                               tersebut. Posisi kebijakan moneter yang lebih ketat pada paruh kedua tahun lalu, dan juga
                               penurunan permintaan kredit yang berasal dari pertumbuhan investasi tetap yang moderat,
                               telah berkontribusi terhadap perlambatan pertumbuhan kredit. Moderasi dalam
                               pertumbuhan simpanan dan terbatasnya ruang rasio hutang-terhadap-simpanan (loan-to-deposit
                               ratio, LDR), terutama pada sejumlah bank-bank yang lebih kecil, menunjukkan bahwa
                               perlemahan pertumbuhan kredit tampaknya akan terus bertahan dalam jangka pendek.

 tempat tinggal utama (September 2013), dan rasio giro wajib minimum sekunder yang lebih tinggi (Desember 2013). Kedua, suku
 bunga pasar uang, yang lebih rendah dari BI Rate selama lebih dari dua tahun, meningkat melampaui BI Rate pada bulan November
 2013, yang membawa pengetatan likuiditas tambahan.

Pertumbuhan kredit           Pertumbuhan nominal kredit bank telah turun dari 23,1 persen yoy pada awal tahun 2013
telah semakin                menjadi 21,6 persen pada bulan Desember. Secara riil (dikurangi menggunakan inflasi IHK),
melambat…                    pertumbuhan kredit turun dari 18 persen yoy pada bulan Januari 2013 ke 12,2 persen pada
                             bulan Desember. Karena bagian kredit dengan mata uang asing mencapai 16 persen dari
                             jumlah kredit yang beredar, angka kredit nominal mengalami inflasi melalui depresiasi
                             Rupiah yang tercatat pada tahun 2013. Dengan demikian, tanpa menyertakan pengaruh mata
                             uang, menurut BI penurunan kredit bersifat lebih signifikan dari yang ditunjukkan oleh
                             angka-angka di atas, dimana kredit nominal meningkat 17,4 yoy pada Desember.

                             sejauh ini konsumsi rumah tangga masih tetap bertahan kuat, faktor-faktor penghambat
                             pembiayaan dapat melemahkan belanja dalam jangka pendek, yang menunjukkan tambahan
                             tekanan turun bagi konsumsi riil, seperti dibahas pada Bagian 2. Pada waktu yang bersamaan,
                             laju pertumbuhan kredit modal kerja, yang memiliki bagian hampir 50 persen dari
                             keseluruhan kredit, dan laju pertumbuhan kredit investasi, tetap bertahan stabil masing-
                             masing pada 20 persen dan 32 persen sejak bulan Juni tahun lalu.

adalah 2,2 persen dari    proyeksi Bank Dunia sebesar 2,5 persen dari PDB yang tercantum pada IEQ edisi bulan
PDB                       Desember 2013. Lebih rendahnya defisit dari perkiraan untuk tahun 2013 ini, walau dengan
                          pertumbuhan pendapatan yang lebih lemah dari yang dianggarkan, terutama mencerminkan
                          rendahnya pencairan belanja dibanding alokasi yang telah ditetapkan dalam APBN-P.

Pertumbuhan nominal       Pengumpulan pendapatan hanya mencapai 95,2 persen dari asumsi APBN-P 2013 sebesar
dan pengumpulan           Rp 1.502 triliun. Hal ini sebagian besar disebabkan oleh perlemahan realisasi pendapatan

tahun 2013 berada jauh    tahun-tahun sebelumnya, angka ini merupakan realisasi paling rendah dari sasaran
di bawah tahun-tahun      pendapatan dalam APBN-P, terhitung sejak tahun 2006. Pengumpulan pendapatan bukan
sebelumnya…               pajak telah sejalan dengan proyeksi APBN, yang didukung oleh kuatnya pendapatan migas

                          pertumbuhan nominal yang moderat sebesar 6,8 persen yoy pada tahun 2013, jauh di bawah
                          rata-rata pertumbuhan nominal sebesar 16,5 persen selama periode tahun 2010-2012

                              persen dari rencana) dibanding tahun 2012 (87,0 persen dari sasaran tahunan). Selain itu,
                              tahun 2013 sekali lagi mencatat belanja subsidi BBM melampaui sasaran APBN-P, sebesar
                              Rp 10 triliun (5 persen lebih besar dibanding asumsi), menjadi Rp 210 triliun. Terdapat pula
                              kewajiban subsidi BBM sebesar Rp 40 triliun yang tercatat menjelang akhir tahun, namun
                              belum dibayar, sehingga tidak disertakan di dalam realisasi APBN 2013 yang menggunakan
                              pendekatan kas/tunai. Kewajiban itu akan menambah biaya subsidi BBM secara akumulasi
                              pada tahun 2013 menjadi Rp 240-250 triliun. Tambahan Rp 40 triliun itu, atau sekitar 20
                              persen dari anggaran subsidi BBM, tampaknya akan dibayar pada tahun 2014. Angka itu
                              setara dengan 0,3 persen dari PDB dan akan memberikan tambahan tekanan fiskal kepada
                              APBN tahun 2014.

Bila tidak ada revisi        Dengan menyertakan asumsi-asumsi makro Bank Dunia untuk tahun 2014, tren-tren yang
APBN, defisit tahun          lalu, serta perkiraan pengaruh larangan ekspor mineral terhadap pendapatan (lihat Bagian
2014 diproyeksikan           B.1), Bank Dunia memproyeksikan defisit fiskal sebesar 2,6 persen dari PDB untuk tahun
mencapai 2,6 persen          2014 (Tabel 5), lebih dari proyeksi defisit sebesar 2,1 persen dari PDB pada IEQ edisi bulan
dari PDB                     Desember lalu. Revisi itu terutama disebabkan oleh revisi turun dalam perkiraan pungutan
                             pajak. Proyeksi pungutan pajak yang lebih rendah memiliki dua alasan: perkiraan
                             perlambatan pungutan PPN akibat turunnya pertumbuhan impor dan konsumsi rumah
                             tangga, dan penurunan pungutan pajak pendapatan badan akibat larangan ekspor mineral
                             (lihat Bagian B.1). Selain penurunan dalam pengumpulan pendapatan, Bank Dunia telah
                             merevisi naik proyeksi belanja fiskalnya sebesar 1,4 persen, terutama akibat naiknya perkiraan
                             belanja subsidi energi mengikuti kurs tukar yang berlaku pada kuartal pertama hingga tanggal
                             7 Maret (lihat Kotak 3 untuk pembahasan lebih lanjut tentang belanja subsidi BBM dan opsi

                        minyak akan diturunkan dari 870 ke 800-830 ribu barel per hari (barrels per day, bpd), yang
                        membawa tambahan risiko fiskal, walau risiko ini tampaknya akan sedikit diimbangi oleh
                        pengaruh dari kurs tukar. Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa penurunan produksi minyak
                        sebesar 10.000 bpd akan menurunkan pendapatan sebesar Rp 3 triliun, sebagian besar
                        melalui pendapatan bukan pajak (sekitar Rp 2,4 triliun), dengan asumsi semua hal lain tetap
                        konstan. Dengan berlanjutnya tekanan fiskal yang signifikan dari subsidi BBM, yang

 Kotak 3: Mengikuti kenaikan harga BBM subsidi pada tahun lalu, reformasi subsidi BBM lanjutan masih dibutuhkan
 Tingginya belanja subsidi BBM yang melebihi APBN-P pada tahun 2013 menyoroti kebutuhan akan reformasi lanjutan dan
 berkelanjutan untuk menurunkan ketidakpastian anggaran serta membatasi belanja anggaran, selain untuk mengurangi opportunity
 costs belanja dengan sasaran yang buruk dan bersifat distortif tersebut. Walau dengan peningkatan harga bensin dan solar bersubsidi
 masing-masing sebesar 44 persen dan 22 persen pada bulan Juni 2013, belanja subsidi BBM kembali melampaui sasaran APBN-P
 akibat depresiasi Rupiah yang kemudian terjadi, yang mewakili hampir seperlima dari belanja pemerintah pusat atau 2,2 persen dari
 PDB. Pengalaman ini menunjukkan bahwa penyesuaian harga secara ad-hoc tidak dapat melindungi belanja subsidi BBM dari
 volatilitas harga minyak dan kurs tukar Rupiah, serta tidak menjamin penghematan fiskal yang berkelanjutan.

 Dengan demikian, belanja subsidi BBM masih terus membawa risiko yang signifikan terhadap posisi fiskal pada tahun 2014, yang
 tetap sangat peka terhadap biaya subsidi BBM dengan kurs tukar dan harga minyak mentah. Proyeksi dasar (baseline) Bank Dunia
 untuk belanja subsidi BBM pada tahun 2014 mengasumsikan rata-rata kurs tukar dolar AS/Rupiah sebesar 12.000 dan harga
 minyak mentah Indonesia sebesar 105 dolar AS per barel. Sehingga, tanpa reformasi, defisit fiskal tahun 2014 diproyeksikan akan
 mencapai 2,6 persen dari PDB. Jika tunggakan pembayaran subsidi BBM tahun 2013 akan dibawa ke tahun 2014 tanpa dibawa
 perlakuan serupa ke tahun 2015, maka defisit fiskal dapat meningkat hingga 3,0 persen.

 Sebagai gambaran, di bawah ini dipaparkan simulasi dua skenario reformasi untuk menelaah potensi dampak terhadap defisit fiskal
 dan penghematan yang dapat dialokasikan bagi prioritas pembangunan yang sangat dibutuhkan, seperti infrastruktur dan jaminan
 sosial. Dua skenario itu diasumsikan akan mulai berlaku pada tanggal 1 Juli 2014:

 Skenario I: diasumsikan peningkatan nominal Rupiah per liter yang sama seperti pada bulan Juni 2013, sebesar Rp 2.000 per liter
 untuk bensin dan Rp 1.000 per liter untuk solar. Bila semua faktor lain diasumsikan sama, kenaikan ini akan menurunkan defisit
 fiskal ke 2,1 persen dari PDB, menghasilkan penghematan fiskal sebesar Rp 45 triliun pada tahun 2014, dan Rp 97 triliun pada
 tahun 2015. Seperti dibahas sebelumnya, penyesuaian harga satu kali ini masih mengekspos APBN terhadap volatilitas harga energi
 internasional dan kurs tukar di kemudian hari.

 Skenario II: diasumsikan peningkatan harga bensin dan solar bersubsidi dengan menutup setengah selisih antara harga bersubsidi
 yang berlaku sekarang dan harga pasar/keekonomian. Hal ini akan berarti peningkatan harga nominal sebesar 30 persen untuk
 bensin dan 50 persen untuk solar. Pada skenario ini, bila semua faktor lain tetap sama, proyeksi defisit fiskal untuk tahun 2014
 adalah 1,9 persen dari PDB dan perkiraan penghematan fiskal mencapai Rp 69 triliun, yang meningkat menjadi Rp 144 triliun pada
 tahun 2015.

 Tabel 7: Dibutuhkan reformasi subsidi BBM lanjutan untuk meringankan tekanan fiskal
                                                                         Proyeksi defisit fiskal      Perkiraan penghematan
                                                                           (persen dari PDB)             fiskal (triliun Rp)
                                                                                  2014                2014            2015
  APBN 2014                                                                        1,7                 n.a             n.a

  Skenario I: Meningkatkan harga bensin dan solar bersubsidi                       2,1                45,2             97,2
  masing-masing sebesar Rp 2.000 dan Rp 1.000 per Juni 2013
  Skenario II: Meningkatkan harga bensin dan solar bersubsidi                      1,9                68,8            144,2

 Selain skenario indikatif di atas, untuk menurunkan besaran dan ketidakpastian subsidi BBM, kebijakan harga bahan bakar alternatif
 haruslah sederhana, transparan, dan mudah diperkirakan, sehingga masyarakat pun lebih bisa memahami dan penerapannya menjadi
 lebih mudah. Sebagian besar pendekatan telah diterapkan di berbagai negara. Walaupun masing-masing pendekatan itu memiliki
 keunggulan maupun kelemahan, terdapat dua opsi realistis yang potensial bagi konteks Indonesia, yang melibatkan pergeseran dari
 penyesuaian harga yang cenderung berdasarkan keinginan penentu kebijakan, ke arah penyesuaian harga berdasarkan aturan (rule-
 based):
      Opsi 1: Penggunaan indeks (dengan batasan). Secara berkala menyesuaikan harga menurut aturan yang telah disepakati terlebih
       dahulu. Dengan opsi ini, harga-harga dapat bergerak naik maupun turun. Harga-harga dalam negeri ditinjau secara berkala (per
       bulan, per kuartal, dst). Aturan yang disepakati terlebih dahulu digunakan untuk menetapkan harga dalam negeri yang baru
       (atau tetap menjaganya), dengan rujukan kepada harga-harga dunia terkini.
      Opsi 2: Batas belanja subsidi kuartalan. Umumkan batas subsidi per kuartal bagi tahun anggaran berikutnya, kemudian
       sesuaikan harga pada kuartal-kuartal berikutnya ketika sasaran terlampaui. Langkah ini akan membatasi kerentanan fiskal pada
       APBN. Batas kuartalan akan ditentukan berdasarkan pola konsumsi BBM yang diamati dan asumsi harga-harga yang diubah
       ke dalam Rupiah. Hal ini akan memungkinkan penyesuaian harga pada kuartal berikutnya berdasarkan jumlah belanja subsidi
       kuartal sebelumnya. Dasar pelaksanaannya akan bersifat transparan dan berdasarkan aturan, dengan tujuan mengurangi
       pengaruh pertimbangan politis terhadap proses penyesuaian harga.

                        dari satu tahun sejumlah 56,7 miliar dolar AS pada bulan Desember, menurut BI) (Gambar
                        22). Sentimen investor telah meningkat belakangan ini, seperti tampak di atas, namun
                        volatilitas dalam kondisi pembiayaan eksternal tetap berisiko kembali meningkat, terutama
                        dengan penyusutan stimulus dari Bank Sentral AS. Selain itu, perkiraan peningkatan
                        pertumbuhan para mitra dagang Indonesia akan mendukung ekspor, namun masih terdapat
                        risiko adanya permintaan eksternal yang lebih lemah dari proyeksi, terutama dalam kaitannya
                        dengan dampak perdagangan dari penyeimbangan kembali ekonomi di Cina. Jalur lintasan
                        ekonomi di Cina juga dapat berdampak lebih lanjut terhadap harga-harga komoditas, yang
                        penurunannya akan membawa risiko penurunan eskternal lainnya.

…sementara              Hingga saat ini, sebagian besar penyesuaian ekonomi makro di Indonesia berasal dari
ketidakpastian tetap    investasi tetap, sementara konsumsi swasta terus bertumbuh dengan laju yang kuat. Terdapat
membayangi jalur        risiko bahwa pertumbuhan harga properti dan kredit yang lebih lambat (lihat Bagian 5) dan
penyesuaian ekonomi     lebih tingginya suku bunga riil akan membawa dampak yang lebih buruk terhadap investasi
makro…                  dari yang diantisipasi, termasuk investasi gedung dan konstruksi (yang sejauh ini tetap
                        kokoh), serta konsumsi. Depresiasi maupun volatilitas kurs tukar lebih lanjut juga dapat
                        membebani ekonomi, dengan adanya peningkatan harga dalam negeri dari barang-barang
                        impor (baik barang investasi maupun konsumsi), biaya Rupiah dari utang dalam valas pada
                        neraca sektor publik dan swasta, serta melalui beban fiskal dari subsidi BBM (lihat Kotak 3).
                        Selain risiko-risiko penurunan ini, pengaruh dari pemilu nasional yang akan datang terhadap
                        konsumsi, melalui belanja yang berkaitan dengan kampanye, dan terhadap investasi, melalui
                        peningkatan ketidakpastian kebijakan, akan menjadi faktor risiko lain.

...dengan kerentanan    Proyeksi kasus dasar (base case) menyertakan peningkatan yang cukup besar dalam neraca
yang meningkat          perdagangan Indonesia tahun 2014. Namun, skenario ini memiliki sejumlah risiko, yang
cukup besar pada        semuanya berkaitan dengan sektor ekspor. Di lain pihak, Bagian 4 menunjukkan bahwa
sektor ekspor           ekspor non-komoditas belum terpengaruh dengan kurs tukar yang lebih kompetitif, sehingga
                        dapat memberikan kejutan positif bila tidak terhalang oleh kendala struktural. Faktor yang
                        merintangi termasuk kebijakan-kebijakan terakhir yang membatasi ekspor mineral,
                        kepemilikan asing yang membatasi, peningkatan pajak ekspor ,dan pembatasan impor, yang
                        tampaknya akan menurunkan keuntungan eksportir, dan juga dapat membebani FDI di masa
                        depan.

Stabilisasi ekonomi    Sementara Indonesia melanjutkan penyesuaian ekonominya ke arah yang mendukung
makro beberapa bulan   pengamanan stabilitas ekonomi makro jangka pendek, umumnya didorong oleh kebijakan
terakhir harus         moneter dan dibantu oleh kurs tukar yang fleksibel, sejumlah perkembangan kebijakan
diperkuat dengan       perdagangan dan investasi terbaru telah meningkatkan ketidakpastian dan dapat merintangi
kepastian kebijakan    investasi, baik dalam maupun luar negeri, dan, karenanya, juga merintangi pembiayaan dan
perdagangan dan        pertumbuhan. Dengan meningkatnya pengaruh politis menjelang pemilu legislatif pada bulan
investasi, serta       April dan pemilihan presiden pada bulan Juli, pengurangan ketidakpastian kebijakan akan
reformasi fiskal       menjadi hal yang sangat penting, dan sedapat mungkin meneruskan upaya berkelanjutan
tambahan               dalam memperkuat ketahanan ekonomi dan pertumbuhan berkelanjutan di Indonesia
                       (seperti menjadi fokus pada Bagian C). Namun, perkembangan kebijakan dan peraturan
                       terbaru, termasuk larangan ekspor sebagian mineral (seperti dibahas berikutnya pada Bagian
                       B.1), serta UU perdagangan dan kepemilikan asing yang baru, dan penundaan pelaksanaan
                       revisi daftar negatif investasi, membawa pengaruh yang sebaliknya. Hal lain yang juga
                       mendesak adalah peningkatan reformasi sektor fiskal untuk menjaga stabilitas dan
                       meningkatkan penggunaan kebijakan fiskal sebagai suatu alat pengelolaan ekonomi makro,
                       serta mendukung pertumbuhan jangka panjang.

                 1. Mencermati larangan ekspor mineral mentah Indonesia
Larangan ekspor        Indonesia dianugerahi kekayaan mineral dan merupakan salah satu dari sepuluh negara
mineral mentah yang    dengan cadangan emas, bauksit, timah, nikel, dan tembaga yang terbesar di dunia. Nilai
baru telah menjadi     ekspor mineral Indonesia meningkat lebih dari tiga kali lipat dari 3 miliar dolar AS ke 11,2
fokus perhatian pada   miliar dolar AS pada periode tahun 2001 dan 2013, didorong oleh tingginya harga
kebijakan sektor       komoditas secara historis dan peningkatan produksi (Gambar 23). Bagian ekspor mineral
mineral penting        mencapai 6,2 persen dari keseluruhan jumlah ekspor pada tahun 2013, dengan tembaga,
Indonesia, dengan      nikel, timah, besi, dan bauksit sebagai kontributor terbesar. Dari segi nilai, sekitar empat
keprihatinan bahwa     puluh persen dari jumlah ekspor mineral telah diolah; seluruh ekspor timah telah diolah,
larangan tersebut      sedangkan sebagian besar ekspor tembaga, nikel, dan bauksit belum diolah. Pelaksanaan
dalam jangak pendek    sebagian larangan ekspor dan pengenaan pajak ekspor yang baru terhadap ekspor mineral
berdampak pada         yang belum diolah telah memicu perdebatan tentang potensi dampak, dan implikasinya
perdagangan dan        terhadap keseluruhan sektor pertambangan dan prospek ekonomi yang lebih luas. Bagian ini

UU Pertambangan                Undang-Undang (UU) tahun 2009 tentang pertambangan mineral dan batubara mewajibkan
tahun 2009                     seluruh pemegang Izin Usaha Pertambangan (IUP) dan Kontrak Karya (KK) untuk
menetapkan kebijakan           meningkatkan nilai tambah sumber daya mineral melalui pengolahan dan pemurnian di
nilai tambah melalui           dalam negeri dalam waktu lima tahun, yaitu mulai bulan Januari 2014. Lebih dari tiga tahun
pengolahan dalam               setelah UU Pertambangan itu, Kementerian Energi dan Sumber Daya Mineral (ESDM)
negeri pada sektor             dalam Permen ESDM No 7/2012 secara gamblang mewajibkan produsen untuk menyusun
mineral, namun                 rencana kerja peleburan, penyesuaian batasan minimum pengolahan dan/atau pemurnian di
peraturan pelaksana            dalam negeri, dan melarang ekspor bijih-bijih mineral dalam waktu tiga bulan sejak
pertamanya baru                berlakunya peraturan tersebut (pada bulan Mei 2012). Tiga bulan kemudian, Permen ESDM
diterbitkan tahun 2012         11/2012 menunda larangan ekspor bulan Mei 2012 tersebut hingga bulan Januari 2014.
                               Selama masa itu, para produsen diperkenankan untuk melakukan ekspor mineral-mineral
                               yang tidak diproses, namun pemegang IUP dipungut bea keluar sebesar 20 persen.

Pemerintah                     Pada tanggal 11 Januari 2014, satu hari sebelum larangan ekspor mulai berlaku, Pemerintah
menetapkan larangan            mengumumkan peraturan baru, Permen ESDM No 1/2014, yang menguatkan larangan
ekspor mineral mentah          ekspor bijih nikel dan bauksit, namun tetap memperkenankan ekspor konsentrat mineral lain
pada Januari 2014,             yang telah diolah, termasuk tembaga, sampai tahun 2017. Namun, dalam perkembangan yang
dengan merevisi pada           tidak disangka-sangka, seluruh produsen, termasuk pemegang KK, kini harus membayar bea
menit-menit terakhir           keluar untuk ekspor mineral yang tidak dan telah diolah seperti tercantum dalam Peraturan
mengecualikan                  Menteri Keuangan (Kemenkeu) No 6/2014. Besaran bea keluar itu, yang dimulai dari 20-25
sejumlah mineral dan           persen dari pendapatan penjualan4 pada tahun 2014 dan semakin meningkat menjadi 60
menetapkan pajak               persen pada tahun 2016, dinyatakan oleh Pemerintah sebagai instrumen fiskal untuk
ekspor pada mineral-           mendorong perusahaan-perusahaan membangun fasilitas peleburan (smelter), dan bukan
mineral tersebut               sebagai alat pungutan pendapatan5 (Tabel 8). Pada analisis skenario di bawah, berdasarkan
                               analisis margin laba agregat dari perusahaan-perusahaan pertambangan Indonesia6,
                               diasumsikan bahwa setelah tingkat pajak mencapai 40 persen, perusahaan-perusahaan akan
                               berhenti melakukan ekspor mineral-mineral yang tidak diolah karena tidak lagi
                               menguntungkan.

                         b. Menelaah dasar pemikiran dan asumsi di balik larangan ekspor mineral yang tidak
                            diolah
Dasar pemikiran                 Dasar pemikiran ekonomi yang diberikan oleh Pemerintah untuk pelarangan tersebut adalah
kebijakan pelarangan            bahwa larangan itu (dan juga bea keluar yang baru) akan mendorong kapasitas peleburan dan
terletak pada sejumlah          pengolahan dalam negeri, yang akan mengakibatkan peningkatan nilai tambah yang
asumsi utama,                   signifikan dalam ekspor mineral.10 Peningkatan ekspor mineral bernilai tambah yang lebih
sebagian yang                   tinggi akan mendorong kenaikan PDB, peningkatan neraca perdagangan, penambahan
mungkin tidak                   pendapatan negara, dan penciptaan lapangan kerja. Sementara dapat dimengerti bahwa
beralasan kuat                  tujuan akhir peningkatan pertumbuhan PDB dan penciptaan lapangan kerja jelas merupakan
                                pusat agenda pembangunan negara manapun, penting untuk disoroti bahwa logika di atas
                                bertumpu pada sejumlah asumsi utama.

Larangan itu dapat              Pertama, larangan itu akan mendorong investasi baru dalam peleburan dan pemurnian.
mendorong beberapa              Sejauh mana hal ini akan terjadi akan bergantung pada kelayakan ekonominya dan pangsa
investasi baru dalam            Indonesia dalam produksi bijih dunia, yang bervariasi lintas jenis mineral. Untuk tembaga,

                           posisi yang kurang menguntungkan dibanding negara-negara lain seperti Cina. Jika
                           pembangunan fasilitas peleburan (smelter) saja tidak layak, maka akan ada tekanan untuk
                           pengucuran subsidi pemerintah – para produsen mineral telah mulai meminta dukungan
                           pembiayaan dari pemerintah untuk membangun peleburan.12

                           Peleburan nikel tampaknya akan menjadi yang paling layak, karena Indonesia merupakan
                           ekportir bijih nikel kedua terbesar di dunia13, dan pemasok bijih nikel berkualitas rendah
                           terbesar bagi produsen Nickel Pig Iron (NPI) Cina14. Larangan terhadap ekspor bijih nikel
                           dapat mendorong peningkatan investasi peleburan dari produsen NPI Cina di Indonesia
                           pada jangka pendek, dengan catatan bahwa kebutuhan energi yang cukup besar bagi usaha
                           peleburan dapat dipenuhi.15 Namun, pada jangka waktu menengah hingga panjang, investasi
                           peleburan NPI yang baru di Indonesia mungkin akan menjadi terbatas, bila para produsen
                           NPI Cina mendapatkan sumber bijih nikel berkualitas rendah lainnya, seperti Filipina16, dan
                           para produsen baja tahan karat Cina menggunakan bahan pengganti NPI.

Peningkatan                Asumsi utama kedua adalah bahwa peningkatan peleburan dan pemurnian akan
pengolahan mineral         meningkatkan porsi penambahan nilai dalam ekspor mineral. Pada kenyataannya, pengolahan
tidak selalu lantas        mineral adalah padat input, terutama energi, sehingga penambahan nilai yang sesungguhnya
meningkatkan nilai         jauh lebih kecil dibanding perbedaan harga pasar antara bijih dan mineral yang telah diolah.
tambah dalam negeri        Sebagai contoh, proses hilir tembaga terdiri atas tiga langkah: mengkonsentrasikan bijih
sedemikian besarnya        tembaga yang ditambang untuk meningkatkan kandungan tembaga dari 3 ke 30 persen;
dengan besarnya biaya      meleburkan konsentrat ke blister, yang 99 persennya adalah tembaga; memurnikan blister ke
input                      tembaga. Hampir 96 persen dari nilai pasar tembaga berasal dari langkah pertama, yaitu
                           pengkonsentrasian, dan hal ini telah dilakukan pada situs-situs pertambangan di Indonesia,
                           sementara hanya 4 persen dari nilai akhir dihasilkan oleh peleburan tembaga.17

Dampak keseluruhan         Asumsi ketiga adalah bahwa peningkatan dalam ekspor mineral yang telah diolah akan dapat
terhadap pendapatan        mengimbangi penurunan ekspor bijih yang belum diolah (misalnya, akan ada peningkatan
negara dan                 dari naiknya harga bijih yang tidak diolah karena penurunan pasokan dunia dari Indonesia).
perdagangan bersih         Naiknya ekspor bersih, pada gilirannya, akan mendorong kenaikan royalti dan pendapatan
dapat menjadi negatif      pajak mineral. Namun, seperti yang telah disampaikan sebelumnya, selain nikel, Indonesia
akibat besarnya biaya      tidak memiliki kekuatan pasar global untuk mendorong naik harga bijih mineral internasional
impor pembangunan          dengan menurunkan pasokannya. Selain itu, kebutuhan impor yang cukup besar untuk
fasilitas peleburan baru   membangun dan mengoperasikan fasilitas peleburan dapat mengimbangi kenaikan neraca
                           perdagangan dari peningkatan ekspor. Kemudian, biaya konstruksi, serta beban depresiasi di
                           kemudian hari, dari fasilitas peleburan tersebut akan menurunkan laba perusahaan serta,
                           dengan demikian, pajak penghasilan (yang merupakan dua per tiga dari pendapatan negara
                           pertambangan). Dampak keseluruhan terhadap pendapatan negara dan perdagangan bersih
                           dapat menjadi negatif, seperti dibahas di bawah.

Akan ada sejumlah          Selain itu, walau peningkatan pengolahan dalam negeri dapat menciptakan sejumlah
pekerjaan yang lebih       pekerjaan lebih berkualitas pada sektor tersebut, penambahan jumlah pekerjaan baru
baik, namun                tampaknya akan terbatas, karena pengolahan merupakan kegiatan yang sangat padat modal,
tampaknya peluang          dan bukan padat karya. Penciptaan pekerjaan bersih (pekerjaan pengolahan baru dikurangi
kerja di sektor tersebut   hilangnya pekerjaan produksi mineral) akibat kebijakan ini tidaklah pasti, namun dapat
tidak akan meningkat       menjadi negatif. Para produsen mineral telah menyatakan bahwa penurunan dalam ekspor
banyak                     mineral yang tidak diolah akibat larangan tersebut dapat berdampak pada hilangnya ribuan
                           pekerjaan.

Kebijakan de jure yang     Bagian ini menampilkan temuan-temuan yang berasal dari analisis Bank Dunia akan dampak
ada tampaknya akan         larangan ekspor dan bea keluar mineral mentah selama periode tahun 2014-17. Secara
cenderung berdampak        keseluruhan, Bank Dunia memperkirakan bahwa akan terdapat dampak negatif terhadap
negatif pada jangka        perdagangan bersih sebesar 12,5 miliar dolar AS dan kerugian pendapatan negara sebesar 6,5
pendek dan menengah        miliar dolar AS dari kebijakan yang kini berlaku (pada waktu laporan disusun, secara de jure)
terhadap pendapatan        selama periode tersebut. Dampak negatif itu didorong oleh peningkatan impor peralatan
negara dan neraca          peleburan/pemurnian dan turunnya ekspor mineral mentah, yang lebih besar dibanding
perdagangan                potensi peningkatan ekspor mineral yang telah diolah.

Sebuah model               Sebuah model perdagangan dan pendapatan negara yang sederhana digunakan untuk
perdagangan dan            menganalisis dampak, hingga tahun 2017, dari kebijakan yang berlaku terhadap pendapatan
pendapatan yang            negara dan neraca perdagangan.18 Model ini mencakup seluruh mineral yang diatur oleh
sederhana disusun          peraturan, namun, dengan besarnya kapasitas dan kenyataan bahwa ekspor timah sudah 100
untuk menganalisis         persen diolah, hasil pemodelan lebih dipengaruhi oleh tembaga, nikel, bauksit, dan besi. Pada
dampak perdagangan         model tersebut, pertumbuhan dasar (baseline) dalam ekspor mineral yang telah dan belum
dan fiskal jangka          diolah berkaitan dengan peningkatan permintaan impor Cina bagi berbagai komoditas
pendek                     (karena Cina adalah pembeli utama ekspor mineral dari Indonesia) serta perkiraan harga
                           komoditas oleh kelompok peneliti komoditas global Bank Dunia. Perubahan dalam ekspor
                           mineral belum dan telah diolah (dan selanjutnya pendapatan), dibanding dengan baseline,
                           didorong oleh asumsi-asumsi perubahan kapasitas pelebur (smelter) untuk mengolah
                           tambahan mineral serta dampak pelarangan ekspor dan bea keluar mineral yang belum
                           diolah. Tabel 9 meringkas alur dampak pada model itu. Dalam hal dampak neraca
                           pembayaran secara keseluruhan, perlu dicatat bahwa analisis ini tidak menyertakan dampak
                           terhadap repatriasi laba (melalui garis pendapatan dari saldo neraca berjalan) atau dampak
                           langsung terhadap aliran investasi asing langsung (FDI), maupun dampak tidak langsung
                           terhadap aliran modal yang lebih luas. Analisis itu juga tidak menyertakan dampak potensial
                           terhadap pajak-pajak tidak langsung, seperti PPN, dalam kasus penurunan kegiatan ekonomi
                           atau pengaruh fiskal tidak langsung lainnya melalui biaya modal. Selain itu, analisis itu
                           merupakan analisis ekuilibrium parsial dengan penyertaan pengaruh putaran kedua yang
                           terbatas.




                           18Model pendapatan bagi bea dan pajak dan royalti ekspor dikembangkan dari model perdagangan
                            sebagai pendapatan terdahulu (atau tambahan pendapatan yang diperoleh) secara sederhana adalah
                            fungsi dari proyeksi perubahan dalam nilai ekspor mineral dikalikan bea ekspor/pajak/tingkat royalti.
                            Pungutan pajak badan adalah fungsi laba perusahaan, sehingga perubahan dalam pendapatan pajak
                            penghasilan badan didorong oleh perubahan dalam pendapatan penjualan, biaya produksi, dan beban
                            depresiasi. Karena tidak adanya informasi yang terperinci tentang neraca perusahaan-perusahaan
                            utama, maka digunakan perhitungan dengan dasar angka profitabilitas sektor mineral secara agregat.

Pendorong utama               Tambahan kapasitas pengolahan yang diasumsikan akan terdorong oleh larangan ekspor
capaian-capaian               mineral yang tidak diolah selama periode tahun 2014-17 dari investasi peleburan baru pada
tersebut adalah jumlah        model perdagangan diperlihatkan pada Tabel 10. Jumlah investasi peleburan baru untuk
pelebur yang                  nikel, bauksit, dan besi tersebut mengacu pada fasilitas-fasilitas yang dianggap layak dan
diasumsikan akan siap         realistik oleh penelitian dari Support for Economic Analysis Development in Indonesia (SEADI)19
pada periode ini,             dan yang telah didanai serta telah atau akan segera mulai dibangun.20 Penilaian yang
kapasitasnya, dan             dilakukan baru-baru ini terhadap ESDM menunjukkan bahwa 63 fasilitas peleburan dan
belanja modal yang            pemurnian baru, termasuk 40 untuk nikel, akan beroperasi pada tahun 2017. Berdasarkan
dibutuhkan                    bukti-bukti yang tersedia, penilaian bahwa fasilitas-fasilitas peleburan tersebut akan mencapai
                              tahapan produksi pada tahun 2017 tampaknya sangat optimistik, karena adanya tiga faktor:
                              pertama, sejumlah investasi itu tampaknya tidak akan layak secara ekonomi dari sudut
                              pandang perusahaan21; kedua, proyek-proyek peleburan secara rata-rata memiliki waktu
                              tunggu (lead time) yang panjang, sekitar 3-5 tahun, mengingat adanya proses persetujuan, studi
                              kelayakan, perizinan lingkungan, dan kemungkinan penundaan akibat pembebasan tanah22;
                              dan selain itu, agar peleburan dapat beroperasi, mereka akan membutuhkan bahan masukan
                              (input) pelengkap seperti ketersediaan tenaga listrik yang mungkin belum tersedia dalam
                              kerangka waktu tersebut.23

Dengan adanya          Analisis ini memperkirakan dampak dari kebijakan yang berlaku (de jure), dan dua skenario
ketidakpastian seputar lainnya, terhadap kasus dasar (base case) tanpa adanya larangan impor mineral mentah dan
pelaksanaan peraturan, tidak ada bea keluar:
analisis dilakukan        Kebijakan yang Berlaku (Larangan Parsial dengan Bea Keluar): Skenario ini
terhadap tiga skenario      mencerminkan pelaksanaan peraturan kebijakan yang berlaku sekarang seperti diuraikan
kebijakan                   pada Tabel 8.
                          Skenario Larangan Ekspor Sepenuhnya: Larangan ini adalah kebijakan asli yang
                            sebelumnya akan dilaksanakan mulai dari bulan Januari 2014: larangan atas ekspor
                            semua mineral yang belum diolah. Skenario ini akan menjelaskan keadaan de facto jika
                            ekspor mineral signifikan yang tidak diolah, yang hingga kini belum dilarang, akan
                            dihentikan akibat adanya perdebatan tentang peraturan—seperti yang kini sedang
                            terjadi. Model ini mengasumsikan bahwa pada tahun 2016 bea keluar akan meningkat
                            cukup tinggi sehingga perusahaan-perusahaan akan menghentikan ekspor mineral
                            mentah karena tidak lagi menguntungkan. Oleh karena itu, skenario kebijakan de jure
                            secara efektif akan menjadi larangan ekspor sepenuhnya mulai 2016 dan selanjutnya.
                          Skenario Larangan Parsial, Tanpa Bea Keluar: Ini adalah skenario kebijakan
                            alternatif: larangan untuk nikel dan bauksit, tidak ada bea keluar untuk mineral-mineral
                            lain. Dibanding skenario kebijakan de jure, skenario ini memberikan perkiraan pengaruh
                            marginal dari bea keluar.

Menurut semua                       Menurut ketiga skenario kebijakan, akan terdapat dampak negatif yang signifikan terhadap
skenario, terdapat                  perdagangan bersih pada tahun 2014-2015 (Gambar 29). Dampak negatif terhadap
dampak negatif yang                 perdagangan bersih dibanding skenario dasar (baseline) pada tahun 2014 diperkirakan
signifikan ke neraca                mencapai 5,3 miliar dolar AS menurut skenario kebijakan de jure, dan dapat mencapai 7 miliar
perdagangan untuk                   dolar AS menurut skenario pelarangan sepenuhnya. Hal ini kemudian dibandingkan dengan
2014-15, dan                        proyeksi defisit neraca berjalan baseline Bank Dunia sekarang yang mencapai 24,4 miliar dolar
dampaknya akan tetap                AS atau 2,9 persen dari PDB untuk tahun 2014, yaitu kontribusi yang cukup besar terhadap
negatif hingga 2017                 kebutuhan belanja luar negeri pada saat pengetatan kondisi belanja luar negeri. Dampak
pada skenario                       negatif terhadap perdagangan bersih pada tahun 2015 diperkirakan berkisar antara 1,3 miliar
kebijakan yang berlaku              dolar AS dan 4,1 miliar dolar AS, bergantung pada skenario. Menurut kebijakan de jure dan
serta skenario                      skenario pelarangan penuh, dampak terhadap perdagangan bersih tetap negatif hingga tahun
pelarangan                          2017, sementara menurut skenario pelarangan parsial tanpa adanya bea keluar, dampak
sepenuhnya                          terhadap perdagangan bersih akan berubah menjadi positif pada tahun 2017.

Dampak negatif                      Dampak negatif terhadap perdagangan bersih sebagian didorong oleh penurunan
perdagangan didorong                pendapatan ekspor, dengan turunnya pendapatan ekspor mineral mentah terkait dengan
oleh turunnya ekspor                larangan tersebut, atau turunnya produksi akibat bea keluar yang mengimbangi pendapatan
mineral mentah yang                 dari tambahan ekspor mineral yang diolah hingga tahun 2017 menurut skenario kebijakan
mengimbangi                         yang berlaku (de jure) dan skenario pelarangan ekspor sepenuhnya (Gambar 25). Dampak
peningkatan ekspor                  terhadap ekspor hanya berubah menjadi positif pada ketiga skenario pada tahun 2017 ketika
mineral yang diolah…                kapasitas peleburan nikel tambahan dijadwalkan akan siap dengan proyek Weda Bay. Jika

                                             atau skenario pelarangan sepenuhnya terhadap ekspor diproyeksikan akan tetap negatif.

… dan biaya impor                            Di sisi impor, untuk ketiga skenario diperkirakan bahwa peningkatan impor akan mencapai
yang sangat tinggi                           3,8 miliar dolar AS pada tahun 2014, dan akan tetap bertahan di atas 2 miliar dolar AS hingga

                     d. Implikasi kebijakan dan perkembangan ke depan

Menurut skenario          Di dalam skenario-skenario yang dipertimbangkan, pelarangan sepenuhnya pada seluruh
dimana sebagian           ekspor mineral yang belum diolah menghasilkan perkiraan dampak yang paling negatif

tampaknya akan            kapasitas peleburan) dengan bea keluar terhadap mineral-mineral lain, sesuai kebijakan yang
menambah tekanan          berlaku, diperkirakan akan berdampak negatif yang lebih rendah dibanding perlarangan
terhadap neraca fiskal    penuh pada awalnya, namun ketika bea keluar telah menjadi penghalang (yang tampaknya
dan perdagangan           dimulai pada tarif pajak 40 persen ke atas) maka kebijakan yang berlaku akan secara efektif
Indonesia…                menjadi pelarangan sepenuhnya. Penghapusan bea keluar akan menurunkan dampak negatif,
                          namun, bahkan pelarangan parsial tanpa bea keluar pun tampaknya akan berdampak negatif
                          terhadap pendapatan dan perdagangan bersih, dibanding dengan kasus dasar (base case), pada
                          jangka pendek dan menengah. Dampak-dampak negatif itu akan timbul ketika masih banyak
                          investor yang berfokus pada neraca perdagangan Indonesia dan kinerja pendapatan negara
                          yang telah melemah.

...opsi kebijakan         Kenyataan bahwa pelarangan sebagian ekspor, tanpa menyertakan bea keluar, menghasilkan
lainnya harus             dampak fiskal dan perdagangan bersih yang paling tidak negatif dari skenario-skenario yang

luas, pengaruh putaran    rendah. Karena kemungkinan dampak negatif larangan itu terhadap pendapatan negara dan
kedua, serta              perdagangan akan cukup signifikan, maka patut dilakukan evaluasi terhadap sejumlah opsi
peningkatan dan           kebijakan yang lebih luas. Evaluasi mendalam terhadap serangkaian opsi kebijakan yang lebih
penurunan efisiensi       luas membutuhkan analisis yang lebih mendalam dan konsultasi dengan seluruh pemangku
dan kesejahteraan         kepentingan, termasuk penilaian dampak ekonomi yang lebih luas dan saling berhubungan
secara keseluruhan        (terhadap neraca eksternal yang lebih luas melalui pengaruh kurs tukar dan investasi,
                          terhadap produksi (output) dan lapangan kerja, serta terhadap pengaruh neraca perusahaan
                          akibat potensi pembiayaan utang dan profitabilitas); pembedaan antara mineral dan

                          kedua terhadap keputusan investasi dan produksi; serta analisis dampak efisiensi dan
                          kesejahteraan bersih secara keseluruhan melalui analisis ekuilibrium umum. Walau tidak

                        pengolahan mineral semakin terfragmentasi lintas negara. Selain itu, sejumlah negara telah
                        berhasil memetik manfaat dari pertambangan komoditas primer tanpa melakukan
                        penambahan nilai di dalam negeri, seperti ditunjukkan oleh Chili dengan tembaga. Kotak 4

Analisis lebih lanjut   Proses kebijakan yang mengarah kepada penetapan perubahan peraturan pada bulan Januari
terhadap kebijakan      2014, dan tantangan hukum yang diakibatkannya, telah meningkatkan ketidakpastian
dan pembangunan         kebijakan pada sektor pertambangan. Hal ini semakin memperlemah iklim investasi
perlu menghindari       pertambangan Indonesia, yang sebelumnya sudah dipandang sebagai salah satu yang
semakin besarnya        terlemah di dunia.27 Dalam jangka waktu yang lebih panjang, hal itu dapat terbukti menjadi

                        tambahan yang diusulkan di atas dapat mendukung perkembangan kebijakan masa depan
                        yang berdasarkan bukti bagi sektor tersebut. Namun, apapun usulan penyesuaian kebijakan
                        lanjutan yang disampaikan, haruslah dilaksanakan sedemikian rupa sehingga tak ada
                        peningkatan lebih lanjut terhadap ketidakpastian kebijakan.

Kotak 4: Pengalaman internasional dalam mendorong pengolahan hilir mineral
 Kebijakan-kebijakan untuk mendorong pengolahan hilir bagi mineral semakin populer secara internasional dan telah mengambil berbagai
 bentuk, mulai dari pembatasan ekspor komoditas yang belum diolah pada satu bagian rantai nilai, hingga memberikan subsidi bagi industri
 hilir pengolahan dan pemurnian. Sebagai contoh, Afrika Selatan telah menetapkan pengendalian ekspor pada banyak mineral yang tidak
 diolah dan menetapkan program-program pembiayaan untuk mendorong penambahan nilai pada industri mineral. Sejumlah negara-negara
 lain di Afrika juga mengambil langkah serupa, seperti intan di Botswana, tembaga di Zambia, minyak di Ghana, serta gas alam dan batubara
 di Mozambik. Di Australia, insentif pajak dan subsidi energi pernah digunakan untuk mendukung industri hilir untuk baja.

 Sementara kebijakan mendorong keterkaitan ke depan (forward linkages) dalam sektor mineral telah menjadi populer, masih terdapat debat
 yang cukup sengit akan dampaknya, dengan tidak ditemukannya pengaruh positif dalam upaya mendorong pertambahan nilai dalam ekspor,
 seperti yang dikemukakan oleh suatu penelitian empiris lintas negara terbaru. Lintas rangkaian industri yang luas, penurunan biaya
 transportasi telah mendorong tren umum menuju fragmentasi global rantai pasokan. Tren ini juga terlihat pada sektor mineral, dengan
 hanya sejumlah kecil negara yang mengekspor sekaligus mineral tidak diolah dan produk telah diolah dari mineral yang sama (Gambar 29).
 Hausman dkk. (2007) menyelidiki keberhasilan kebijakan pengolahan hilir untuk mineral dalam meningkatkan penambahan nilai untuk
 ekspor, dengan menggunakan data perdagangan selama periode tahun 1975–2000 bagi seluruh negara-negara dan data input-output yang
 menguraikan keterkaitan rantai pasokan (supply-chain) untuk 241 produk. Hausman dkk menemukan bahwa peningkatan nilai tambah dalam
 komoditas primer tidak berkaitan dengan peningkatan porsi nilai tambah pada keranjang ekspor suatu negara pada jangka menengah ke
 panjang.

 Pertambangan dan pengolahan mineral merupakan industri yang berbeda, dan, dengan demikian, membutuhkan kemampuan yang berbeda
 pula; suatu negara dengan sektor pertambangan yang besar belum tentu dapat bergerak secara menguntungkan ke pengolahan hilir.
 Penelitian Hausman dkk. menyoroti bahwa pengembangan kemampuan pengolahan mineral di dalam suatu negara secara historis berkaitan
 dengan keunggulan komparatif dalam faktor-faktor lainnya (seperti energi) dibanding akses ke bijih mineral mentah. Faktor penentu utama
 akan lokasi peleburan atau pemurnian bagi banyak mineral berkisar pada kebutuhan faktor input pelengkap, seperti tenaga listrik berbiaya
 rendah, akses ke daratan, pengendalian polusi dan persyaratan peraturan lainnya, akses ke pembiayaan berbiaya rendah, ekonomi luar negeri
 seperti pasar bagi produk sampingan, serta berbagai hal lain, dan bukan hanya akses terhadap mineral yang berdekatan.

 Selain itu, terdapat kemungkinan untuk meningkatkan kinerja pertumbuhan dengan memfokuskan kepada pertambangan dan ekspor
 mineral yang tidak diolah serta menggunakan pendapatan terkait untuk berinvestasi guna meningkatkan produktivitas, dengan merujuk
 kepada pengalaman relevan dari Chili dalam mengelola industri tembaga. Chili adalah negara eksportir tembaga terbesar di dunia, yang
 menguasai lebih dari 40 persen jumlah ekspor tembaga dunia pada tahun 2012, serta memiliki cadangan tembaga terbesar di dunia. Sejak
 tahun 1980an, Chili tidak memfokuskan kepada pengolahan tembaga di dalam negeri dan mengekspor sebagian besar tembaganya sebagai
 konsentrat ke Cina dan India untuk peleburan lebih lanjut (Gambar 29); saat ini tembaga masih menjadi 50 persen dari ekspor Chili. Chili
 telah memfokuskan pada upaya memaksimalkan pendapatan dari ekspor konsentrat tembaga dan menggunakan pendapatan itu untuk
 membangun tenaga kerja yang kuat. Selama periode tersebut (1982-2012), yang mana terjadi perubahan politik dan kelembagaan yang
 cukup signifikan, pendapatan per kapita Chili meningkat drastis dari 5.000 dolar AS menjadi 16.000 dolar AS (dalam dolar AS riil tahun
 2005), sementara tingkat kemiskinan menurun dari di atas 40 persen pada tahun 1990 ke 13 persen pada tahun 2013.

                        a.   Peningkatan risiko perkotaan di kota-kota di Indonesia dan Asia Pasifik

Timur mencatat laju          dengan peningkatan populasi di kota-kota di wilayah tersebut. Sebagian besar pertumbuhan
pertumbuhan                  perkotaan akan terjadi di negara-negara berkembang di wilayah ini, terutama di kota-kota
urbanisasi dan risiko        berukuran kecil dan sedang yang paling merasakan dampak dari urbanisasi. Sejak tahun 1980
dampak iklim dan             hingga 2010, Asia mencatat penambahan lebih dari satu miliar jiwa penduduk di kawasan
bencana terpesat di          perkotaannya—lebih dari gabungan penambahan jumlah penduduk di belahan lain dunia—
dunia                        dan satu miliar jiwa lagi diperkirakan akan tinggal di daerah perkotaan pada tahun 204028.
                             Dengan memusatkan pada pengalaman Indonesia, Bagian ini menilik tantangan yang
                             dihadapi dalam membangun ketahanan kawasan perkotaan.

Banyak pusat kawasan         Kota-kota secara tradisional merupakan mesin penggerak pembangunan, yang meleburkan
perkotaan terletak di        berbagai usaha, pengetahuan, teknologi, dan peluang tenaga kerja yang demikian beragam.
daerah yang rawan            Namun, banyak pusat-pusat kawasan perkotaan terletak di daerah rawan, yaitu daerah-daerah
                             yang terletak di lokasi-lokasi surplus pertanian, seperti lahan gunung berapi yang subur, atau
                             di daerah patahan lempeng bumi, atau di rute-rute perdagangan dan transportasi utama, yang
                             sejajar dengan sistem pesisir pantai maupun sungai yang rawanakan banjir, gelombang badai,
                             dan erosi pantai (Dilley dkk. 2005; lihat juga Hallegatte 2011). Peningkatan konsentrasi
                             penduduk dan aset-aset di daerah-daerah berbahaya merupakan pendorong utama risiko
                             bencana dan merupakan tantangan terbesar dalam pembangunan ketahanan di tingkat global,
                             nasional,maupun daerah.29

Kota-kota di Indonesia       Indonesia memimpin pesatnya laju urbanisasi di Asia Timur. Dengan laju urbanisasi yang
termasuk di antara           diperkirakan mencapai 4,1% antara tahun 2000 dan 2010, Indonesia mencatat laju yang lebih
kota-kota yang paling        tinggi dibanding dengan negara-negara tetangganya, seperti Cina (3,8%), India (3,1%),dan
rawan terhadap risiko        Thailand (2,8%). Kenyataan ini menempatkan Indonesia sebagai salah satu negara dengan
bencana dan iklim...         tingkat urbanisasi tertinggi di Asia, dengan 54% populasi tinggal di daerah perkotaan pada
                             tahun 2010. Berbagai proyeksi urbanisasi menunjukkan bahwa angka itu akan meningkat
                             menjadi 68% pada tahun 2025. Namun, Indonesia belum mencapai tingkat pengembalian
                             ekonomi terhadap urbanisasi seperti halnya tingkat yang dinikmati oleh negara-negara lain.

… menggarisbawahi            Lebih dari 110 juta jiwa di sekitar 60 kota-kota di Indonesia rawan terhadap bencana alam,
perlunya penyelarasan        termasuk tsunami, gempa bumi, banjir, dan dampak-dampak perubahan iklim. Analisis
pembangunan                  terbaru menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia amatlah rawan terhadap dampak pemanasan
infrastruktur dengan         iklim.31Secara khusus, bagian timur dan barat pulau Jawa yang padat dengan penduduk,
risiko-risiko tersebut       daerah pesisir dari hampir seluruh pulau Sumatera, bagian barat dan utara pulau Sulawesi,
demi membangun               dan pulau-pulau di tenggara Papua seluruhnya memiliki peringkat yang tinggi pada peta
ketahanan                    bahaya iklim. Berbagai skenario menunjukkan bahwa peningkatan suhu, perubahan pola
                             curah hujan, dan peningkatan permukaan air laut dapat menyebabkan penggenangan daerah-
                             daerah pantai yang produktif dan peningkatan frekuensi bencana yang berkaitan dengan
                             cuaca. Faktor-faktor tersebut akan mengakibatkan dampak yang semakin negatif terhadap
                             pertanian, pasokan bahan pangan, dan air. Saat ini, diperkirakan bahwa hanya 20% dari
                             pemerintah daerah yang telah mengalokasikan belanja yang memadai bagi pembangunan
                             infrastruktur. Sementara itu, beberapa penelitian terakhir menekankan pada pentingnya

Pengelompokan              Walaupun urbanisasi dapat meningkatkan efisiensi dan mendorong pertumbuhan,
mendorong pemusatan        pengelompokan (aglomerasi) bisa juga mendorong terjadinya pemusatan aset-aset fisik yang
aset-aset fisik yang       dibangun secara cepat, seringkali tanpa disertai perencanaan dan pengendalian pemanfaatan
dibangun secara cepat,     lahan yang layak. Hal ini tidak hanya menjadi faktor yang mendasari kemacetan di perkotaan,
seringkali tanpa           namun juga meningkatkan paparan penduduk terhadap risiko bahaya di Indonesia. Kota-
perencanaan dan            kota yang muncul dari transisi perkotaan yang cepat ini akan memimpin pembangunan
pengendalian               Indonesia pada dekade-dekade mendatang. Namun, tanpa investasi yang dirancang secara
pemanfaatan lahan          strategis, intervensi kebijakan, dan lebih kuatnya kapasitas kelembagaan, buruknya
yang layak                 pengelolaan urbanisasi dapat merintangi pertumbuhan yang berkelanjutan dan inklusif, serta
                           memaparkan Indonesia terhadap risiko-risiko perubahan iklim dan bencana.
                     b. Kerangka untuk membangun ketahanan perkotaan
Tiga langkah penting       Bank Dunia telah menawarkan kerangka praktis untuk membangun ketahanan perkotaan di
menuju pembangunan         wilayah Asia Timur dan Pasifik. Terdapat tiga pendekatan yang pokok dan sangat relevan
ketahanan perkotaan        bagi kota-kota di Indonesia.
mencakup                    Pertama adalah Perencanaan Pemanfaatan Lahan dan Investasi Infrastruktur berbasis
perencanaan                     risiko yang mengenali dan memprioritaskan investasi-investasi guna meningkatkan
pemanfaatan lahan dan           ketahanan perkotaan terhadap berbagai perkiraan risiko. Bila telah ditetapkan dan
investasi infrastruktur,        diterapkan, rencana pemanfaatan lahan dapat mengendalikan pembangunan di berbagai
perbaikan infrastruktur         daerah rawan bencana, mendukung operasi penyelamatan, dan memberikan lokasi yang
perkotaan, dan                  aman bagi pusat evakuasi darurat.
pengelolaan ekosistem       Kedua adalah Perbaikan Infrastruktur Perkotaan. Pemukiman kumuh seringkali terletak
perkotaan                       di daerah rawan bencana. Karakteristik umum dari pemukiman kumuh perkotaan
                                (terlalu padat, struktur bangunan yang tidak memadai, jalan atau gang yang sempit, tidak
                                tersedianya layanan dasar) membuat kaum miskin perkotaan lebih rawan terhadap
                                risiko-risiko bencana. Untuk merumuskan strategi yang tepat guna memperbaiki
                                pemukiman perkotaan, lokasi-lokasi yang sangat rawan terhadap risiko-risiko tersebut
                                harus diidentifikasi dan aset-aset yang ada dilokasi itu harus diperbaiki. Di setiap lokasi
                                yang telah teridentifikasi, satu atau lebih instrumen perbaikan perkotaan yang strategis
                                dapat diterapkan, misalnya: (i) penerapan peraturan penataanwilayah di daerah-daerah
                                rawan bencana (seperti kegiatan-kegiatan yang diperkenankan dan syarat-syarat yang
                                harus dipenuhi oleh suatu bangunan); (ii) penerapan instrumen struktural dan non-
                                struktural bagi mitigasi dan evakuasi; serta(iii) perbaikan infrastruktur di kawasan kumuh
                                sesuai dengan rencana tata ruang kota.
                            Ketiga adalah Pengelolaan Ekosistem Perkotaan, yang memadukan perencanaan
                                investasi dengan restorasi ekosistem. Hal ini sangatlah penting untuk menurunkan
                                risiko-risiko bencana yang dipicu oleh investasi pembangunan. Sejumlah prosedur
                                pengelolaan ekosistem memiliki relevansi dengan ketahanan perkotaan, termasuk
                                pengelolaan daerah aliran air (pengelolaan daerah aliran sungai, pengelolaan daerah
                                resapan air, dll.), pengelolaan daerah pesisir, zona penyangga lingkungan, infrastruktur
                                hijau, dan rancangan lansekap perkotaan.

                          (RTRW) ditetapkan sebagai sebuah peraturan daerah. Hingga kini, lebih dari 70% kota-kota
                          di Indonesia telah menetapkan peraturan tentang RTRW (Gambar 30), yang memungkinkan
                          pengelola kota untuk merumuskan rencana detil tata ruang dan peraturan penataan wilayah
                          dan mulai membangun ketahanan.

Rencana terperinci tata   Sesuai dengan Peraturan Pemerintah No. 8/2013 tentang skala dan tingkat ketelitian peta
kota harus                rencana tata ruang, RDTR harus menggunakan peta dasar pada skala sesuai dengan bentang
menggunakan peta          kawasan strategis kota, dan luasan tingkat kepentingan objek yang direncanakan. Terkait
dasar pada skala sesuai   dengan penataan wilayah rawan, dapat digunakan peta berskala dari 1:5.000 hingga 1:1.000,
dengan bentang            yang umumnya tidak tersedia di lembaga-lembaga pemerintahan. Bila data tersebut tidak
kawasan strategis kota    tersedia, foto-foto udara dan satelit beresolusi tinggi dapat digunakan dan penggunaan survei
                          darat partisipatif dapat dipertimbangkan. Hal ini harus didukung oleh prosedur-prosedur
                          validasi data yang memadai guna memastikan bahwa datageospasial yang dihasilkan dapat
                          secara sah digunakan sebagai dasar resmi penataan wilayah.

Kegagalan pemerintah      Penanganan risiko-risiko bencana dan iklim di daerah-daerah rawan bencana dengan
daerah untuk              penghuni dan aset-aset yang telah ada merupakan tugas yang mendesak. Kegagalan
mengambil tindakan        pemerintah daerah dalam mengambil tindakan nyata akan menimbulkan kerawanan-
nyata akan                kerawanan baru. Masalah yang rumit berkenaan dengan penghuni liar yang bermukim di
menyebabkan               tepian sungai-sungai di Jakarta yang rawan banjir merupakan contoh dari tidak adanya
kerawanan baru            penataan detil wilayah. Hal ini memaksa pemerintah setempat untuk terus-menerus
                          menanggung biaya banjir tanpa adanya instrumen yang jelas guna mulai memugar jalur air
                          dan memperbaiki daerah terdampak di sekitarnya.

                    c.    Pendekatan diagnostik risiko cepat dapat mengidentifikasi opsi-opsi praktis untuk
                          investasi ketahanan bencana dan iklim di kota-kota di Indonesia

Fokus awal harus          Karena Indonesia memiliki banyak pusat perkotaan yang tengah berkembang, sangatlah
kepada daerah             penting untuk mulai menilik ketahanan perkotaan di lokasi-lokasi dimana intervensi tersebut
perkotaan utama           berpotensi untuk membawa dampak yang terbesar.Dengan menggunakan hirarki kota-kota
berukuran sedang          di Indonesia, dimulai dari kota berukuran kecil hingga sedang, besar, metropolitan,dan
                          megapolitan, Indonesia dapat mulai memanfaatkan RTRW sebagai kriteria penentu lokasi
                          kota yang akan menerapkan intervensi pendukung ketahanan perkotaan. Tabel
                          11memberikan gambaran luas bahwa sebagian besar kota-kota berukuran sedang dan besar
                          telah menetapkan RTRW mereka, sehingga siap untuk menerapkan RDTR di daerah-daerah
                          pembangunan yang diprioritaskan serta koridor-koridor berisiko tinggi.

                     d. Membangun ketahanan melalui penataan wilayah yang peka risiko serta
                        perencanaan infrastruktur
RTRW yang ada            Proses perencanaan infrastruktur dan tata ruang yang detil memungkinkan kota-kota untuk
menjadi landasan bagi    menyertakan langkah-langkah mitigasi risiko ke dalam praktik yang ada. Sebagai contoh,
RDTR yang peka           RTRW yang ada dan telah menyertakan risiko bencana dan iklim, seperti di Balikpapan,
risiko                   Denpasar,dan Yogyakarta, dapat semakin dikembangkan menjadi RDTR yang peka risiko.

Balikpapan               Sesuai dengan RTRW yang kini berlaku, Balikpapan menerapkan sejumlah upaya pencegahan
menerapkan sejumlah      banjir, termasuk normalisasi sungai, pembangunan dan pemeliharaan sistem drainase, serta
upaya pencegahan         pembangunan sebuah bendungan kecil. Investasi publik dialokasikan pada kegiatan-kegiatan
banjir                   pembangunan ketahanan, seperti revitalisasi daerah aliran sungai, konservasi hutan lindung
                         dan peningkatan sistem drainase, baik di tingkat kota maupun tingkat pemukiman. Selain itu,
                         Balikpapan juga menerapkan langkah-langkah penetapantata ruang, termasuk pengetatan
                         pemberian izin pembangunan di daerah rawan longsor. Upaya-upaya tersebut dapat
                         dikonsolidasikan ke dalam penetapan tata ruang yang peka risiko sebagai dasar perencanaan
                         investasi dalam infrastruktur, serta rehabilitasi dan perlindungan ruang hijau dan perairan.

Denpasar dapat               Beberapa opsi perencanaan investasi infrastruktur berdasar risiko di Denpasar mencakup
menetapkan                   percepatan pelaksanaan mitigasi bencana banjir dan tsunami yang menyeluruh melalui
pengendalian                 penetapan pengendalian pembangunan di daerah rawan banjir dan tsunami. Sebagai contoh,
pembangunan pada             dengan maraknya pembangunan hotel-hotel baru di daerah Sanur, pemerintah kota dapat
daerah-daerah rawan          menggunakan izin bangunan dan lokasi sebagai alat untuk mengatur ulang tata letak daerah
banjir dan tsunami           pantai guna membuka lebih banyak akses evakuasi ke daerah pantai sebagai bagian dari
                             kampanye “Denpasar aman bagi wisatawan”.

Yogyakarta                   Yogyakarta, yang pernah mengalami bencana berskala besar dalam bentuk banjir, lahar,
mencantumkan                 tanah longsor, dan gempa bumi, menyertakan rencana lokasi evakuasi di dalam RTRW-nya.
rencana situs-situs          Lokasi-lokasi tersebut telah diidentifikasi di seluruh penjuru kota, termasuk ruang hijau, alun-
evakuasi di dalam            alun kota, dan pusat-pusat olahraga. Aturan perencanaan telah membatasi pembangunan di
RTRW-nya                     sejumlah daerah sekitar sungai, dengan investasi yang cukup besar bagi upaya pencegahan
                             banjir, lahar, tanah longsor, dan pengendalian infrastruktur. Peningkatan pemukiman liar di
                             sepanjang tepi sungai juga dapat digunakan sebagai jalan pembuka zona penyangga untuk
                             memitigasi dampak banjir, serta untuk membangun potensi pariwisata “jalan kampung” yang
                             dapat membuka peluang bagi penduduk berpenghasilan rendah untuk turut menikmati
                             manfaat pasar pariwisata kota yang cukup besar di daerah tersebut.

                        e.   Membangun ketahanan melalui perbaikan infrastruktur perkotaan

Kesempatan untuk             Reklamasi menjadi opsi yang populer bagi pembangunan di kota-kota tepi pantai. Walau
membangun                    seringkali bersifat ambisius, proyek perkotaan berukuran besar itu membuka peluang bagi
ketahanan muncul             pembangunan ketahanan melalui perbaikan infrastruktur perkotaan, seperti ketika
dalam proyek                 pembangunan kawasan perkotaan dapat disertakan ke dalam reklamasi lahan, seperti di
perkotaan yang besar         Makassar dan Balikpapan.

Makassar dapat               Makassar memiliki jumlah kawasan kumuh yang cukup besar, sebagian terletak di daerah tepi
menyertakan                  sungai atau daerah rawan banjir pasang. Kota itu memiliki rencana yang ambisius untuk
perbaikan kawasan            mereklamasi pantai Losari, merevitalisasi anak sungai Tallo,dan mereklamasi sepanjang
kumuh ke dalam               daerah delta pantainya. Rencana besar ini dapat mendukung ketahanan dengan menyertakan
rencananya dan               perbaikan kawasan kumuh dan menggunakan konsep pembangunan yang peka perairan,
menerapkan                   guna memastikan pembangunan sistem sanitasi dan drainase yang memadai serta risiko-
pembangunan yang             risiko banjir di kawasan pantai maupun tengah kota telah dimitigasi .
peka perairan

Di Balikpapan, jalan         Balikpapan memiliki enam desa kumuh yang cukup besar,berbangunan kayu mengapung di
pantai yang baru dapat       bagian pesisir selatan dan barat. Pemukiman itu memiliki tingkat kerawanan yang tinggi
digunakan untuk              terhadap bahaya laut, termasuk peningkatan permukaan air laut. Karena kota Balikpapan juga
memperbaiki kawasan          melaksanakan rencana pembangunan jalan di daerah pesisir, termasuk reklamasi, proyek ini
kumuh                        dapat pula dimanfaatkan sebagai landasan untuk memperbaiki pemukiman kumuh yang
                             letaknya berdekatan, perbaikan drainase untuk mitigasi banjir, serta revitalisasi sistem retensi
                             perairan bagi pasokan air dan pengendalian banjir.

                        f.   Membangun ketahanan melalui pengelolaan dan restorasi ekosistem

Kota-kota yang               Makassar dan Palembang menunjukkan pentingnya membangun ketahanan dengan
memiliki sungai dan          peningkatan pengelolaan dan restorasi ekosistem, yang terutama erat kaitannya bagi kota-
lahan basah lebih            kota yang memiliki sungai dan lahan basah di Indonesia. Di Makassar, pengelolaan ekosistem
bergantung kepada            perkotaan dibutuhkan untuk merevitalisasi hutan bakau, selain untuk melestarikan hutan dan
ekosistem dan dapat          daerah serapan air di daerah sekitar hulu sungai. Tujuannya adalah mengurangi sedimentasi
melihat restorasi dan        di muara sungai, terutama muara sungai Tallo, yang telah meningkat akibat konversi lahan
konservasi sebagai           dan tanah longsor. Pengelolaan ekosistem dapat menawarkan pendekatan mitigasi
pendekatan                   penurunan permukaan tanah yang lebih efektif melalui penanaman pohon di daerah-daerah
pembangunan                  yang kembali dihijaukan. Langkah ini akan meningkatkan kapasitas cadangan air di kawasan
                             pesisir guna mencegah masuknya air laut ke daratan. Di Palembang, banjir dari sungai Musi
                             dan anak-anak sungainya merupakan masalah yang kronis. Pada tahun 2012, kota Palembang

                         bagi kegiatan pertanian, perikanan, perkebunan, dan pemukiman. Reklamasi akan
                         memberikan alternatif kolam retensi dan/atau cadangan air untuk menjaga keseimbangan
                         lingkungan serta memelihara kualitas air dan pencegahan banjir. Langkah-langkah tersebut
                         dapat ditingkatkan lebih lanjut dengan menggunakan pendekatan ekosistem dalam
                         pembangunan lahan dan daerah perumahan di sepanjang sungai Musi.

                       risiko bencana perkotaan dan iklim

Saat ini adalah waktu    Seiring dengan kesiapan sebagian besar kota-kota di Indonesia untuk memulai proses
untuk berinvestasi       rencana detil tata ruang pada 1-2 tahun ke depan, terdapat peluang untuk memanfaatkan
pada rencana tata        momentum tersebut guna membangun ketahanan perkotaan. Penerapan diagnostik risiko
ruang yang peka risiko   secara cepat telah terbukti bermanfaat untuk memulai perbincangan berkenaan dengan
                         risiko-risiko maupun berbagai opsi mitigasi risiko tersebut dengan para pemimpin dan
                         pemangku kepentingan kota serta untuk mengidentifikasi risiko-risiko iklim dan bencana
                         yang paling signifikan. Diagnostik itu mengidentifikasi beragam alternatif mitigasi risiko
                         praktis yang dapat diterapkan oleh kota-kota melalui penyesuaian program-program investasi
                         perkotaan yang tengah berjalan.

Dibutuhkan peta          Namun, untuk melaksanakan proses tersebut secara lebih sistematis, data geospasial dengan
berskala detil tentang   skala detil tentang aset-aset kota, pusat-pusat penduduk, bahaya dan kerawanan alami sangat

                 1. Indonesia: Menghindari perangkap
Sasaran pembangunan      Sasaran pembangunan Indonesia dalam 20 tahun ke depan cukup ambisius, yaitu berupaya
Indonesia untuk 20       meningkatkan kesejahteraannya, menghindari diri dari terperangkap di zona negara
tahun mendatang yang     berpenghasilan menengah dan membangun ekonomi secara bersama tanpa meninggalkan
cukup ambisius hanya     siapapun dalam upaya mengejar kertertinggalan dari negara-negara berpenghasilan tinggi.
akan tercapai bila       Untuk mencapainya, Indonesia membutuhkan pertumbuhan dan penciptaan lapangan kerja
Indonesia memiliki       yang tinggi dan berkelanjutan, dan juga meningkatkan pemerataan. Hal yang kemudian
strategi pertumbuhan     menjadi pertanyaan adalah dapatkah Indonesia mencapainya? Laporan Tinjauan Kebijakan
yang tepat serta         Pembangunan Bank Dunia yang segera diterbitkan yang berjudul “Indonesia: Menghindari
berupaya untuk           Perangkap” menampilkan beberapa usulan yang menggaris bawahi bahwa Indonesia
melakukan reformasi      memiliki potensi untuk bangkit dan meraih kesejahteraan dan pemerataan. Namun risiko
struktural di beberapa   “mengambang di tengah” memang nyata. Arah perkembangan yang akan diambil oleh suatu
sektor prioritas         perekonomian bergantung kepada beberapa hal: (i) pemilihan strategi pertumbuhan yang
                         membelenggu dan menyalurkan potensi produktivitas ekonomi tersebut; dan (ii)
                         pengimplementasian kebijakan yang konsisten yang merupakan buah dari reformasi
                         struktural di beberapa sektor prioritas dalam rangka mendorong pertumbuhan dan
                         mendistribusikan kesejahteraan secara lebih luas. Dalam hal ini , Indonesia sebenarnya cukup
                         beruntung karena memiliki pilihan dalam pembiayaan reformasi tersebut tanpa harus
                         mengganggu prospek fiskal jangka panjangnya. Akan tetapi, kesulitannya terletak dalam
                         pelaksanaan reformasi, khususnya dalam memasuki kerangka kerja institutsi yang rumit dan
                         terdesentralisasi. Dan bagi Indonesia, satu-satunya pilihan yang dilakukan adalah berusaha
                         sebaik-baiknya, karena pertaruhan yang ada hanyalah melakukan reformasi dengan hasil yang
                         tinggi atau tidak melakukan reformasi sama sekali dengan harga kegagalan yang besar.

Empat faktor utama,              Didekade yang akan datang, ada empat hal utama, dalam dan luar negri, yang dapat dijadikan
dalam dan luar negeri,           tumpuan harapan bagi perkembangan perekonomian Indonesia. Keempat hal ini ditenggarai
yang menjadi harapan             dapat menjadi faktor pendorong pertumbuhan yang kuat melalui rangkaian kebijakan yang
bagi perkembangan                baik, atau bisa disebut sebagai “faktor penarik” bagi perekonomian. Faktor-faktor itu adalah
ekonomi Indonesia                kondisi demografis dan perkembangan urbanisasi yang tengah berlangsung di Indonesia; dan
                                 prospek perkembangan harga komoditas internasional serta pertumbuhan ekonomi di Cina.

Indonesia berpotensi             Indonesia beruntung memiliki tenaga kerja yang melimpah. Antara tahun 2013 dan 2020,
memetik manfaat dari             penduduk dengan usia kerja akan meningkat sebesar 14,8 juta jiwa, mencapai 189 juta dari
bonus demografi                  174 juta saat ini. Saat ini, 50 persen penduduk berusia kurang dari 30 tahun. Tenaga muda
berkat penduduknya               yang semakin berpendidikan dan memahami teknologi informasi ini merupakan aset yang
yang masih muda...               dapat digunakan untuk mendorong pertumbuhan ekonomi dan produktivitas secara
                                 keseluruhan. Dengan penempatan kebijakan-kebijakan pemanfaatan tenaga kerja yang tepat,
                                 Indonesia siap untuk memetik manfaat dari bonus demografi yang dimilikinya sebelum
                                 populasi yang ada mulai memasuki usia tua pada tahun 2025-30.

…dan laju                        Laju pertumbuhan urbanisasi yang mencapai 4 persen per tahun menjadikan Indonesia
urbanisasinya yang               sebagai salah satu negara yang mengalami urbanisasi tercepat di dunia. Pada tahun 2025, 68
merupakan salah satu             persen dari seluruh penduduk Indonesia diperkirakan akan hidup di daerah perkotaan,
yang tercepat di dunia           menigkat dari 52 persen pada tahun 2012 (menurut proyeksi PBB). Dengan meningkatnya
                                 pendapatan dan daerah-daerah metropolitan besar seperti Jakarta dan Surabaya yang makin
                                 jenuh, maka permintaan akan barang-barang konsumsi berkualitas tinggi, tempat
                                 perbelanjaan dan perumahan akan meningkat secara signifikan pada kota-kota yang lebih
                                 kecil. Menghubungkan kota-kota itu dengan para penghuninya ke daerah-daerah pedesaan,
                                 daerah-daerah metropolitan dan ekonomi global menjadi sangat penting dalam menarik
                                 perusahaan-perusahaan dan mencapai kesejahteraan bersama. Bukti empiris menunjukkan
                                 bahwa urbanisasi mendukung pertumbuhan dan pengentasan kemiskinan di Indonesia hanya
                                 dengan kehadiran infrastruktur yang memadai (Lewis, 2012).

Lebih lemahnya harga    Pelemahan harga-harga komoditas global sejak tahun 2011 membawa beberapa tantangan
komoditas               jangka pendek bagi Indonesia sebagaimana yang terlihat dampaknya dalam neraca
internasional dapat     perdagangan Indonesia saat ini, pelemahan harga komoditas juga menawarkan kesempatan
menjadi berkah          dalam peningkatan kualitas dan keragaman investasi di Indonesia. Selama dekade yang lalu,
terselubung dalam       tingginya harga-harga komoditas mendorong insentif investasi yang lebih besar pada sektor
sejumlah segmen di      sumber daya alam dan sektor yang tidak dapat diperdagangkan (non-tradable) (misalnya sektor
sektor manufaktur…      perumahan) dibanding invetasi di sektor manufaktur dan sektor-sektor yang dapat
                        diperdagangkan. Porsi manufaktur di dalam keseluruhan investasi kemudian menurun
                        menjadi 12 persen di tahun 2002-11 dibanding hampir seperlima pada periode tahun 1990-
                        96. Kedepannya, rendahnya harga-harga komoditas diharapkan mampu meningkatkan
                        profitabilitas relatif dan daya tarik dari manufaktur (yang tidak berkaitan dengan komoditas)
                        dan dapat membantu Indonesia mengembangkan basis industrinya. Harga komoditas turun
                        selama dua tahun terakhir, melalui dampaknya terhadap neraca berjalan, yang kini
                        menyebabkan depresiasi dalam kurs tukar efektif riil, yang membantu ekspor manufaktur
                        dan daya saing. Dengan melakukan reformasi yang mampu mengurangi rintangan para
                        perusahaan manufaktur dalam berusaha (lihat di bawah), maka lebih lemahnya harga-harga
                        komoditas diharapkan dapat berbuah menjadi keberkahan yang terselubung.

…sementara cepatnya     Peningkatan upah yang sangat cepat yang terjadi di Cina memberikan peluang bagi Indonesia
peningkatan upah di     untuk meraih kembali keunggulan komparatifnya di sektor-sektor ekspor yang padat karya.
Cina memberi            Peningkatan upah nominal di Cina yang mencapai rata-rata 15 persen per-tahun sejak tahun
“kesempatan kedua”      2001 dan diiringi dengan perlambatan pertumbuhan produktivitas pada sektor-sektor
bagi Indonesia dalam    berketerampilan rendah pada beberapa tahun terakhir, telah mengakibatkan peningkatan
ekspor manufaktur       biaya tenaga kerja hampir sebesar 70 persen di Cina sejak tahun 2005 (Economist Intelligence
                        Unit, 2012). Sementara itu, apresiasi Yuan yang terus berlangsung, dengan kurs tukar riil
                        efektif yang telah meningkat sebesar 30 persen sejak tahun 2005, telah mengikis daya saing
                        Cina dalam memproduksi barang-barang manufaktur. Tekanan-tekanan ini, bersama-sama
                        dengan perlambatan pertumbuhan ekonomi secara keseluruhan dikenal sebagai
                        penyeimbangan pertumbuhan ekonomi (re-balancing) di Cina, tampaknya akan mampu
                        mendorong para investor untuk memperluas pertimbangannya untuk berinvestsi lebih jauh
                        ke daerah-daerah pesisir Cina. Di saat yang bersamaan, dinamika tersebut memberikan
                        peluang kepada negara-negara ASEAN, termasuk Indonesia, untuk menarik lebih banyak
                        investasi ke industri-industri manufaktur mereka.

Namun terdapat dua      Namun demikian, di saat faktor-faktor yang menguntungkan tersebut di atas membutuhkan
risiko utama            reformasi, Indonesia saat ini menghadapi dua risiko dalam pertumbuhannya: risiko
                        perlambatan pada pertumbuhan jangka panjang dan risiko pertumbuhan yang tidak cukup
                        inklusif.

Pertama, tanpa          Pengalaman internasional menunjukkan bahwa perlambatan pertumbuhan dapat terjadi pada
reformasi struktural,   tingkat pendapatan berapapun (Bulman dkk., 2012). Bukti-bukti terakhir menunjukkan
Indonesia               bahwa frekuensinya lebih tinggi bagi negara-negara berpenghasilan menengah (IMF, 2013).
menghadapi risiko       Sebagai contoh, Brasil meningkat dengan cepat pada tahun 1960an dan 1970an. Lalu sejak
perlambatan             tahun 1981, ketika PDB per kapita-nya mencapai 3.939 dolar AS (sedikit di atas PDB per
pertumbuhan yang        kapita Indonesia saat ini), Brasil kemudian mencatatkan perlambatan pertumbuhan relatif
nyata                   yang berkepanjangan, hingga tahun 2004.33 Pengalaman serupa juga dialami Meksiko yang
                        mencatat perlambatan pertumbuhan berkepanjangan selama lebih dari 20 tahun setelah
                        tahun 1981, yaitu ketika PDB per kapita-nya mencapai 6.965 dolar AS. Pengalaman-
                        pengalaman di atas menunjukkan bahwa Indonesia tidak boleh meremehkan kuatnya kinerja
                        pertumbuhannya. Sesungguhnya, pertumbuhan yang selama ini terjadi salah satunya
                        didorong oleh lingkungan eksternal yang sangat mendukung: yaitu lewat ledakan komoditas
                        yang terjadi pada periode tahun 2003-11 bersama-sama dengan rendahnya suku bunga global
                        sejak tahun 2009 yang kondusif bagi pendapatan dunia usaha, pendapatan rumah tangga dan

                        33Brasil adalah negara yang kaya akan komoditas seperti Indonesia, yang memetik banyak keuntungan
                         dari ledakan komoditas pada tahun 2004-11. Faktor eksternal yang menguntungkan ini menjelaskan
                         sebagian pemulihan pertumbuhan yang kuat di Brasil pada periode tersebut.

                                                penerimaan pemerintah, serta menjadi pendorong bagi kuatnya peningkatan permintaan
                                                dalam negeri.34 Menuju ke depan, Indonesia tidak lagi dapat bergantung kepada stimulus
                                                pertumbuhan apapun dari faktor-faktor yang berasal dari luar negeri. Seperti disinggung di
                                                atas, sejak tahun 2011, harga-harga komoditas telah mencatat pelemahan yang signifikan.
                                                Dengan normalisasi pertumbuhan AS, kebijakan stimulus quantitative easing Bank Sentral
                                                AS—yang selama ini mendorong rendahnya suku bunga dunia— akan dilepas secara
                                                bertahap. Hal ini akan meningkatkan biaya pendanaan dengan implikasi sekunder bagi
                                                investasi. Dengan memudarnya faktor-faktor pendukung yang bersifat ekternal tersebut,
                                                Indonesia akan menghadapi risiko perlambatan pertumbuhan material yang nyata bila tidak
                                                segera melaksanakan reformasi struktural.

Kedua, juga terdapat                            Meskipun Indonesia mampu menghindari perlambatan pertumbuhan yang berkepanjangan,
risiko bahwa                                    pertumbuhan yang terjadi mungkin tidak cukup inklusif, yang berarti bahwa manfaat dan
pertumbuhan mungkin                             kesempatan tidak tersedia secara merata pada seluruh penduduk. Dari tahun 1999 hingga
tidak cukup merata;                             2012, tingkat kemiskinan telah berkurang separuhnya dari 24 persen menjadi 12 persen.
sehingga pertumbuhan                            Namun pada tahun 2012, sekitar 65 juta jiwa masih hidup di antara garis kemiskinan nasional
yang inklusif harus                             dan tingkat 50 persen di atas garis itu. Bersama-sama dengan penduduk miskin, kelompok
dibina dan tidak boleh                          tersebut masih sangat rentan menghadapi peningkatan harga bahan pangan, kejutan
diremehkan                                      kesehatan dan bencana alam. Satu alasan dibalik kerentanan yang terus bercokol ini adalah
                                                bahwa rumah tangga yang paling miskin hanya mencatat peningkatan pendapatan yang lebih
                                                kecil dibanding dengan rumah tangga yang lebih berada. Selama periode tahun 2003-10,
                                                pertumbuhan riil konsumsi per kapita bagi 40 persen rumah tangga paling miskin hanya 1,3
                                                persen per tahun, dibanding 3,5 persen bagi lapis 40 persen rumah tangga berikutnya, dan
                                                5,9 persen bagi 20 persen rumah tangga teratatas (Gambar 35). Selain itu, semakin
                                                meningkatnya ketimpangan konsumsi di Indonesia juga diperlihatkan dengan perbedaan
                                                dalam akses pada kesempatan antar penduduk. Pada tahun 2002, 27 persen ketimpangan
                                                konsumsi seorang anak berasal dari adanya perbedaan gender, status pekerjaan dan gender
                                                kepala rumah tangga-nya, pendidikan orangtuanya, dan daerah dan tempat lahirnya. Pada
                                                tahun 2012, angka ketimpangan ini telah mencapai 37 persen. Karenanya untuk kemajuan
                                                kedepan, pertumbuhan yang merata harus segera didorong dan sama sekali tidak boleh
                                                diremehkan.

Indonesia akan            Menimbang kesempatan-kesempatan dan risiko-risiko yang dibahas di atas, dan cita-cita
mampu menempatkan         Indonesia akan kesejahteraan yang merata, yang menjadi pertanyaan selanjutnya adalah

                          kerja sangatlah penting. Strategi pertumbuhan yang didorong oleh produktivitas juga penting
                          bagi Indonesia untuk mengurangi kerentanan dan meningkatkan daya saing dunia usahanya.
                          Sesungguhnya, tekanan politis untuk meningkatkan upah tampaknya tidak akan melemah di
                          Indonesia. Dalam konteks ini, satu-satunya jalan untuk mengakomodasi peningkatan upah
                          tanpa mengganggu daya saing adalah dengan meningkatkan produktivitas tenaga kerjanya.

pertanian dan sektor      di Malaysia hampir mencapai lima kali lipat dibanding Indonesia. Rata-rata produktivitas
jasalapis bawah           tenaga kerja di Indonesia juga lebih rendah dibanding Thailand, Filipina dan Cina. Perbedaan
                          produktivitas ini mencerminkan struktur ekonomi yang ada. Di Indonesia, lebih dari 50
                          persen pekerja berada pada dua sektor berproduktivitas rendah, yaitu pertanian dan jasa-jasa
                          lapis bawah (seperti perdagangan ritel, hotel dan restoran) yang sangat membebani
                          produktivitas secara rata-rata.

Untuk meningkatkan        Pertumbuhan produktivitas tenaga kerja agregat memiliki dua sumber. Pertama,

dengan produktivitas       yang diukur melalui rasio dari produktivitas sektoral terhadap pertanian. Memindahkan
yang lebih tinggi          seorang pekerja dari pertanian ke jasa lapis-bawah (perdagangan ritel dan kulakan dan
                           personal, jasa sosial dan konstruksi) secara rata-rata mencatat peningkatan produktivitas
                           sebesar dua kali lipat. Pergerakan ini umumnya terjadi selama dekade yang lalu dan telah
                           menjadi pendorong utama pengentasan kemiskinan. Tujuh belas dari 20 juta pekerjaan yang
                           tercipta pada tahun 2001-11 berada pada sektor jasa-jasa, sebagian besar pada jasa lapis-
                           bawah. Tahap berikut dari transformasi struktural Indonesia harus bertujuan untuk
                           meningkatkan pergerakan tenaga kerja dan penciptaan pekerjaan dalam pertumbuhan
                           produktivitas sektor manufaktur dan jasa-jasa lapis-atas.37 Walau pertumbuhan produktivitas
                           manufaktur mengalami penurunan tajam pada dekade yang lalu, rata-rata produktivitas
                           pekerja pada industri manufaktur secara konsisten lima kali lebih besar dibanding
                           produktivitas pada pertanian.38 Hal ini menunjukkan bahwa penciptaan lapangan kerja pada
                           manufaktur dan jasa-jasa tingkat tinggi merupakan resep utama dalam meningkatkan
                           produktivitas dan menurunkan kerentanan di Indonesia.

                      c.   Prioritas kebijakan untuk mendukung pertumbuhan produktivitas: pertama,
                           infrastruktur

Terdapat tiga bidang       Laporan “Indonesia: Menghindari Perangkap” mengidentifikasikan tiga bidang prioritas
yang diprioritaskan:       untuk memacu pertumbuhan yang didorong oleh produktivitas: (i) menutup celah
infrastruktur, keahlian    infrastruktur; (ii) menutup celah keahlian, dan (iii) meningkatkan fungsi produk, pasar modal
dan peningkatan            dan tenaga kerja. Ketiga prioritas itu telah ada dan diketahui sejak lama, namun kemajuan
fungsi pasar               penanganannya tidak tersebar merataselama ini. Pengambilan kebijakan yang terlalu
                           terdesentralisasi sejak awal tahun 2000an telah memperumit dan memperlambat
                           penerapannya, terutama dalam pembangunan infrastruktur dan fungsi pasar tenaga kerja
                           (seperti penetapan upah minimum). Namun demikian terdapat sejumlah kecil kebijakan yang
                           dapat membawa pengaruh besar pada masing-masing bidang yang diprioritaskan tersebut.




                           37 Namun persyaratan keterampilan untuk dapat masuk ke sektor jasa yang tinggi juga lebih tinggi,
                             menunjukkan bahwa kesempatan untuk penciptaan pekerjaan dalam manufaktur sesungguhnya jauh
                             lebih besar dengan rata-rata tingkat keterampilan yang ada pada angkatan kerja.
                           38 Pada dekade yang lalu, pertumbuhan produktivitas tenaga kerja pada pertanian mencatat peningkatan

                             (didorong oleh karet, minyak sawit, kopi dan the) sementara pertumbuhan pada manufaktur turun
                             hampir mencapai nol. Penurunan paling tajam dalam pertumbuhan produktivitas tenaga kerja terjadi
                             pada bidang pertambangan dan penggalian.

Peningkatan kualitas      Peningkatan kualitas belanja publik akan menjadi sangat penting bagi pembangunan
belanja publik            infrastruktur dan penyampaian layanan infrastruktur di Indonesia.39 Jumlah investasi
menjadi sangat            infrastruktur—yaitu investasi oleh pemerintah pusat, pemerintah daerah, BUMN dan sektor
penting dalam             swasta—secara konsisten hanya mencapai 3 persen hingga 4 persen dari PDB selama dekade
menangani kebutuhan       yang lalu (Gambar 36). Investasi itu jauh di bawah rata-rata di atas 7 persen dari PDB
infrastruktur Indonesia   sebelum krisis keuangan Asia tahun 1997, dan masing-masing sebesar 10 persen dan 7,5
                          persen yang tercatat untuk Cina dan India. Peningkatan belanja infrastruktur, baik untuk
                          investasi baru dan juga yang penting untuk operasi dan pemeliharaan, bergantung pada
                          peningkatan kualitas belanja publik pada tingkat pemerintahan pusat dan daerah.

Reformasi subsidi         Pada tingkat pemerintah pusat, pengeluaran yang besar untuk subsidi BBM (2,6 persen dari
BBM akan sangat           PDB dan 21 persen dari anggaran pemerintah pusat setelah transfer ke daerah dan
membantu                  pembayaran bunga) hampir mencapai dua kali lipat pengeluaran untuk infrastruktur, yang
memperbaiki kualitas      hanya mencapai 1 persen dari PDB. Peningkatan kualitas belanja dapat sangat terbantu
belanja negara            dengan reformasi subsidi BBM. Peningkatan belanja pemerintah untuk infrastruktur sebesar
                          lebih dari dua kali lipat (dari 2,5 persen dari PDB) dapat berasal dari penurunan subsidi
                          energi. Alokasi ulang apapun seperti itu harus dilengkapi dengan peningkatan lanjutan dalam
                          bidang perencanaan dan pelaksanaan anggaran sehingga dapat meningkatkan kapasitas
                          penyerapan dan menjamin kualitas manajemen dan implementasi investasi infrastruktur.

Pemerintah daerah         Pemerintah daerah mencatat belanja yang lebih besar dari pemerintah pusat (1,5 persen dari
harus diberi insentif     PDB dibanding 1 persen dari PDB). Namun belanja pemerintah daerah dapat mencatat
untuk menekan belanja     belanja yang jauh lebih besar lagi untuk meningkatkan infrastruktur jalan-jalan, air dan
pegawai dan di saat       sanitasi dan kesehatan (baik investasi baru maupun pemeliharaan) jika anggaran mereka tidak
yang sama                 terikat oleh pengeluaran yang berlebihan bagi pegawai dan bila mereka dapat mengumpulkan
meningkatkan              lebih banyak penerimaan oleh mereka sendiri. Lebih dari 40 persen belanja pemerintah
kelompok belanja          daerah dihabiskan untuk pegawai. Sementara, sekitar 90 persen dari anggaran mereka berasal
infrastruktur             dari pemerintah pusat (transfer fiskal). Peningkatan sistem transfer fiskal untuk memberi
                          insentif kepada pengalokasian ulang belanja yang lebih besar kepada infrastruktur
                          membutuhkan pergeseran cara ke suatu bentuk tranfer yang berdasarkan kinerja dan
                          meningkatkan bagian transfer yang terikat kepada belanja pada sektor-sektor atau bidang-
                          bidang yang menjadi prioritas nasional.40 Bagi kotamadya yang memenuhi kriteria kehati-
                          hatian fiskal dan risiko fidusia, sarana pembiayaan alternatif dapat didorong, seperti KPS,
                          obligasi kotamadya dan pembiayaan perantara.

Empat reformasi           Untuk meningkatkan efektivitas peningkatan belanja dalam menyusutkan celah infrastruktur,
pelengkap lainnya juga    reformasi-reformasi pelengkap berikut akan diperlukan: (i) koordinasi yang kuat di dalam
dibutuhkan untuk          pemerintah pusat dan antar tingkatan pemerintahan; (ii) reformasi proses perusahaan fasilitas
memperkecil celah         publik (seperti listrik, air dan gas) pemerintah dan BUMN dalam meningkatkan pemilihan
infrastruktur             dan perencanaan proyek; (iii) implementasi yang efektif dari UU pertanahan yang baru; dan
                          (iv) kemitraan yang kuat dengan investor swasta dalam dan luar negeri untuk menjembatani
                          celah pembiayaan.




                          39 Pembangunan infrastruktur tidak hanya tentang dana. Pembebasan tanah, koordinasi antara
                            tingkatan pemerintahan yang berbeda dan proses pemilihan proyek masing-masing merupakan
                            kendala yang sama pentingnya. Pemerintah telah menyadari hal ini dan sedang berusaha menangani
                            setiap masalah itu. Sebagai contoh suatu RUU pertanahan yang baru sedang dibahas di DPR. RUU
                            pertanahan ini diperkirakan akan memfasilitasi akses kepada tanah untuk kepentingan umum.
                          40 Transfer fiskal kepada pemerintah daerah didominasi oleh komponen “dana alokasi umum” (DAU)

                            dibanding transfer untuk alokasi khusus. DAU tidak terikat, sehingga memfasilitasi pengeluaran
                            pegawai yang terlalu besar di daerah, yang menyisakan hanya sedikit ruang bagi transfer yang dapat
                            terikat pada jajaran pemberi layanan di gugus depan. Pada tahun 2012, bagian DAU hampir mencapai
                            60 persen dari transfer pemerintah pusat kepada pemerintah daerah. Dana alokasi khusus (DAK)
                            kepada daerah-daerah tertentu yang bertujuan untuk mendanai kegiatan khusus di daerah tersebut
                            sesuai dengan prioritas nasional hanya mencapai 6 persen dari transfer-transfer tersebut dan terlalu
                            terpecah (mencakup terlalu banyak sektor).

dalam hal peningkatan     terhadap pertumbuhan Indonesia selama satu dakade ke belakang.41 Konsekuensi dari
pertumbuhan dan           lemahnya pertumbuhan modal untuk sektor infrastruktur relatif terhadap laju pertumbuhan
akses layanan yang        ekonomi dan laju pertumbuhan urbanisasi telah mengakibatkan terjadinya celah kapasitas
lebih baik bersifat       yang cukup serius. Hal ini juga telah berkontribusi bagi munculnya masalah kemacetan dan
signifikan                buruknya kinerja logistik yang menjadi kendala pertumbuhan produktivitas. Penelitian pada
                          beberapa perusahaan manufaktur di Indonesia menunjukkan bahwa permasalahan yang
                          berkaitan dengan transportasi masuk di dalam kendala usaha yang terburuk bagi perusahaan
                          manufaktur perkotaan. Hal yang sama juga telah menyebabkan para produsen di pedesaan
                          tidak mampu bersaing dengan produk impor di daerah-daerah perkotaan. Maka dalam hal ini
                          semakin jelas bahwa pembangunan infrastruktur sebagai penghubung dapat membantu
                          mendorong terjadinya aglomerasi ekonomi di daerah-daerah perkotaan dan mendukung
                          realisasi potensi pertumbuhan dan produktivitas di sektor pertanian, industri pedesaan non-
                          pertanian dan sektor manufaktur perkotaan. Selain itu, karena seperempat penduduk
                          perkotaan dan lebih dari setengah penduduk pedesaan memiliki akses yang buruk ke layanan
                          transportasi, peningkatan infrastruktur merupakan kunci utama dalam meningkatkan
                          ekonomi dan kesejahteraan sosial secara keseluruhan di Indonesia.

                     d. Prioritas kebijakan untuk mendukung pertumbuhan produktivitas: kedua, keahlian

Indonesia harus           Meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan dan fungsi pusat-pusat pelatihan menjadi sangat penting
meningkatkan kualitas     dalam rangka menutup celah keahlian di Indonesia. Saat ini, dua per tiga perusahaan
pendidikan dan fungsi     mengakui mengalami kesulitan dalam menemukan pegawai yang tepat untuk posisi-posisi
pusat pelatihan jika      managerial dan profesional (perusahaan mengaku berada dalam taraf “sulit” atau “sangat
ingin menutup celah       sulit”); dan hampir 70 persen pemilik perusahaan dalam bidang manufaktur mengeluhkan
keterampilan              bahwa “sangat sulit” untuk mengisi posisi-posisi tingkat profesional yang terampil (insinyur).
                          Kesulitan ini kemudian diistilahkan sebagai masalah ketidaksesuaian dalam ketenaga-kerjaan.
                          Terdapat dua jenis ketidaksesuaian. Sejumlah sektor melaporkan tidak cukupnya lulusan
                          pendidikan sebagai alasan (sebagai contoh, dalam tekstil), sementara sektor-sektor lain
                          mengeluhkan akan keahlian lulusan yang ada (sebagai contoh, dalam bidang karet dan
                          plastik). Sementara itu, adanya keluhan mengenai lebih sedikitnya tawaran pelatihan kepada
                          pegawai dari perusahaan-perusahaan di Indonesia dibanding dengan negara-negara lain di
                          wilayah yang sama. Sebagian besar lembaga pelatihan terkonsentrasi pada bidang-bidang
                          dengan nilai tambah yang rendah (seperti keterampilan salon kecantikan dan spa dan
                          keterampilan dasar-dasar komputer). Akhirnya, dalam kemampuan akademis dasar, taraf
                          Indonesia tidaklah menggembirakan baik dibandingkan dengan negara-negara
                          berpenghasilan rendah lainnya dan negara-negara tetangganya di Asia Timur, terutama dalam
                          penilaian kemampuan pelajar internasional seperti PISA. Sebagai contoh, pelajar usia 15
                          tahun di Indonesia memiliki tingkat pengetahuan yang jauh di bawah rekan-rekannya dari
                          Vietnam, walau Indonesia memiliki pendapatan per kapita yang lebih tinggi.




                          41Jika persediaan modal infrastruktur riil Indonesia meningkat sebesar 5 persen per tahun pada 2001-
                           11 dibanding laju pertumbuhan aktuil sebesar 3 persen, diperkirakan bahwa pertumbuhan riil PDB
                           tahunan akan lebih besar sebanyak 0.5 poin persentase. Lihat Triwulanan edisi bulan Oktober 2013

                                                                               Perekonomian Indonesia

Indonesia mencatat       Kebijakan publik sejauh ini memfokuskan kepada akses terhadap pendidikan dan
kemajuan yang            pendaftaran murid. Berkat komitmen pemerintah Indonesia yang kuat, Indonesia tampaknya
signifikan dalam         akan menjadi salah satu negara dengan jumlah murid berpendidikan tinggi terbesar di dunia
meningkatkan akses       di kemudian hari.42 Selama lima tahun terakhir, angkatan kerja dengan tingkat pendidikan
pendidikan dan tingkat   tersier dan sekunder telah meningkat masing-masing lebih dari 1 juta jiwa dan lebih dari 2
pendaftaran murid        juta per tahun. Jika tren-tren terakhir dalam pendaftaran murid terus berlanjut, jumlah
                         penduduk Indonesia dengan pendidikan tinggi dapat meningkat lebih dari dua kali lipat pada
                         dekade yang akan datang.43

Kini Indonesia harus     Karenanya, fokus ke depan adalah pada pembekalan lulusan pendidikan dan pekerja dengan
memfokuskan kepada       keterampilan teknis yang tepat dan perilaku yang dibutuhkan oleh perusahaan (baik itu dari
tiga strategi untuk      sisi kedisiplinan, keandalan, kerjasama dan kepemimpinan) untuk mendukung/
meningkatkan             memungkinkan investasi yang besar dalam sektor-sektor utama seperti manufaktur. Hal ini
keterampilan angkatan    membutuhkan strategi reformasi di tiga hal. Pertama, meningkatkan kualitas pendidikan
kerja                    dasar dalam rangka membangun dasar keterampilan kognitif yang lebih kuat yang
                         dibutuhkan untuk mendapatkan keterampilan dengan tingkat yang lebih tinggi yang
                         dibutuhkan angkatan kerja. Satu langkah penting yang dapat mendukung hal ini adalah
                         dengan penguatan sistem penjaminan kualitas pendidikan. Hal ini dilakukan untuk
                         memastikan bahwa penilaian kualitas memperoleh tindak lanjut dan lembaga-lembaga
                         pendidikan mendapat insentif untuk melaksanakan tindakan-tindakan perbaikan.

Namun sangat penting     Namun bahkan apabila sistem pendidikan dapat disempurnakan secara seketika, para lulusan
untuk menemukan          awal baru akan masuk ke angkatan kerja 10-20 tahun lagi. Sehingga sangatlah penting untuk
solusi jangka pendek     menemukan solusi jangka pendek dan menengah bagi kendala keahlian yang ada: dengan
dan menengah untuk       demikian hal kedua dan ketiga dari strategi ini adalah meningkatkan relevansi mereka yang
menutup celah            akan masuk ke pasar tenaga kerja (pendidikan kejuruan dan teknis, dan pendidikan tersier)
keterampilan             dan meningkatkan keterampilan dari angkatan kerja yang ada (reformasi sistem pelatihan).
                         Meningkatkan relevansi pendidikan tersier dan kejuruan membutuhkan (i) keterbukaan
                         informasi yang lebih besar kepada murid dan lulusan tentang kesempatan pada pasar tenaga
                         kerja, dan (ii) memperbaiki sistem yang ada agar lebih resposif pada kebutuhan pasar. Sistem
                         pelatihan di sisi lain akan menunjang perekonomian dengan lebih baik bila lebih banyak
                         dibentuknya lembaga-lembaga pelatihan yang menawarkan materi pelatihan yang lebih
                         relevan dan keterampilan yang spesifik pada sektor-sektor strategis dengan nilai tambah yang
                         lebih tinggi (seperti tekstil, produk makanan dan cabang-cabang manufaktur utama lainnya).

Pengembangan             Pertumbuhan yang berasal dari perkembangan tingkat keterampilan / keahlian menawarkan
keterampilan akan        hasil pertumbuhan yang besar, walau sulit untuk dikuantisir. Karena lebih dari 60 persen
membantu Indonesia       perusahaan-perusahaan di Indonesia melaporkan bahwa keterampilan adalah suatu kendala.
memenuhi permintaan      Maka mengurangi kendala yang ada akan sangat membantu perusahaan-perusahaan dalam
dari kelas menengah      mengembangkan dirinya dan meningkatkan daya saingnya. Hal ini dapat meningkatkan
yang makin tinggi dan    pertumbuhan dan produktivitas agregat melalui pertumbuhan produktivitas sektoral
juga menghadapi          (misalnya bila para pekerja di manufaktur memperoleh lebih banyak keterampilan) dan/atau
persaingan               pergerakan tenaga kerja dari jasa level bawah ke sektor manufaktur (lihat di atas).
                         Pengembangan keahlian juga akan membantu Indonesia untuk memanfaatkan berbagai
                         kesempatan yang muncul dari semakin tingginya kemampuan permintaan dari kelas
                         menengah dan juga dalam upaya untuk berkompetisi dari persaingan mitra-mitra Indonesia
                         di ASEAN. Tanpa keterampilan yang tepat di antara mereka yang masuk ke angkatan kerja,
                         produk impor dapat selalu menjadi lebih kompetitif dibanding dengan produksi dalam negeri
                         dalam hal pemenuhan permintaan akan produk-produk dan layanan yang berkualitas lebih
                         tinggi yang dilakukan oleh kelas menengah Indonesia yang saat ini jumlahnya terus
                         meningkat.

                         43 Sasaran Pemerintah adalah memberikan akses universal kepada pendidikan menengah atas melalui

                           wajib belajar 12 tahun dan meningkatkan pendaftaran murid ke pendidikan yang lebih tinggi sebanyak
                           dua kali lipat pada tahun 2020. Bagian individu dengan pendidikan tersier pada angkatan kerja
                           mencapai 8 persen pada tahun 2012.

                       e.     Prioritas kebijakan untuk mendukung pertumbuhan produktivitas: ketiga, pasar

Indonesia harus               Mendorong investasi dan aliran talenta dalam manufaktur dan sektor-sektor dengan
meningkatkan kualitas         produktivitas yang tinggi lain di Indonesia—yang sangat penting bagi transformasi strategi
produksinya, tenaga           yang cepat—membutuhkan peningkatan fungsi pasar produk, tenaga kerja, modal dan
kerja, serta fungsi           tanah.44 Walau Indonesia menerapkan reformasi untuk mendukung investasi dan perizinan
modal dan sistem              pada sejumlah sektor, peraturan perundang-undangan yang mengatur perilaku usaha di
pertanahannya jika            banyak sektor dalam beberapa tahun terakhir telah mengirimkan sinyal-sinyal yang
bermaksud mencapai            membingungkan kepada para investor, dan secara tak langsung telah meningkatkan
transformasi struktural       ketidakpastian bagi usaha. Sebagai contoh, sejumlah UU dan langkah-langkah yang spesifik
yang cepat                    sektor yang baru diumumkan bersifat tidak konsisten dengan UU yang lalu atau menciptakan
                              kebingungan tentang arah dari reformasi (misalnya konflik antara UU hortikultura dan UU
                              investasi). Pada sektor pertambangan, terlepas dari bagaimana peraturan baru yang melarang
                              ekspor bijih mineral pada akhirnya akan diterapkan, perubahan kebijakan yang berulang-
                              ulang telah meningkatkan ketidakpastian (seperti disoroti pada bagian sebelumnya). UU
                              industri dan perdagangan yang baru memberikan kementerian yang terkait kewenangan
                              untuk melakukan intervensi pasar, sehingga meningkatkan ketidakpastian sekaligus
                              mempertinggi resiko biaya menjalankan usaha.

Penguatan kualitas            Urgensi di iklim berinvestasi adalah menjawab sejumlah ketidakpastian yang tercipta karena
pembentukan suatu             peraturan perundangan yang belakangan ditetapkandengan melakukan penguatan kualitas
kebijakan akan sangat         proses penyusunan kebijakan dan peraturan ekonomi. Sejumlah negara melakukan hal ini
membantu                      dengan memberdayakan kementerian dan lembaga negara untuk menjalankan fungsi
meningkatkan iklim            “penyelidik kebijakan.” Proses penyusunan kebijakan yang terpadu dan diperkuat seharusnya
investasi                     membantu terjaminnya pembinaan persaingan pasar dan membatasi adanya tindakan anti-
                              persaingan. Kebijakan juga harusnya menjamin terciptanya sebuah iklim yang mendukung
                              aliran masuk FDI dan memperkuat pengetahuan dan teknologi yang strategis (frontier
                              technology). Dan tentu saja kebijakan seharusnya dapat mengakomodir manfaat-manfaat
                              potensial yang dapat dibawanya. Penyusunan kebijakan yang diperkuat juga harus dapat

                              44Pasar tanah juga sangat penting bagi investasi pemerintah dan swasta. Suatu UU pertanahan yang
                               komprehensif, yang kini sedang dibahas di DPR, diperkirakan akan menjawab sejumlah masalah-
                               masalah utama yang telah menghambat investasi pada beberapa tahun terakhir.

transformasi struktural   dengan sebagian kecil pekerja pada sektor formal yang terlindungi dan sebagian besar pekerja
Indonesia. Diantaranya    yang terpaksa bekerja di sektor informal. Kesenjangan ini mencerminkan tingkatan
dengan membuat UU         perlindungan pegawai yang serupa disejumlah negara-negara Eropa (seperti tingginya tingkat
yang ada menjadi lebih    uang pesangon) dan peraturan upah minimum yang relatif tinggi. Selain itu, proses

                          Walau peraturan perundangan tenaga kerja tidak berlaku untuk kebanyakan pekerja (karena
                          terdapat banyak opsi pengecualian yang dapat digunakan oleh pemilik perusahaan dan

                          produktivitas dan transformasi struktural. Sebagai contoh, masuknya para pekerja ke sektor
                          yang sepenuhnya formal dibatasi oleh keputusan penerimaan pegawai yang dibuat oleh
                          pemilik perusahaan karena tingginya potensi biaya saat memberhentikan pegawai di sektor
                          tersebut. Akibatnya sebagian besar pekerja di Indonesia adalah pekerja non-formal atau
                          semi-formal, bekerja dalam kontrak jangka pendek dan tidak dilatih sebagai aset jangka
                          panjang bagi perusahaan. Karenanya, para pekerja yang berangkat dari, misalnya, pekerjaan
                          di bidang pertanian atau kegiatan bukan pertanian di pedesaan, akan selalu terperangkap
                          dalam sektor yang sedikit lebih tinggi namun tetap dengan produktivitas yang rendah dan
                          tanpa perpindahan sosial yang signifikan. Amandemen UU tenaga kerja akan sangat
                          mendukung pencapaian sasaran-sasaran transformasi struktural Indonesia , untuk membuat
                          kondisi ketenaga kerjaan di Indoensia menjadi lebih fleksibel dan inklusif. Amandemen
                          seperti itu membutuhkan kesepakatan antara pemilik perusahaan, pekerja dan Pemerintah.
                          Senada dengan itu, penggunaan rumus penetapan upah minimum yang baru yang
                          berdasarkan atas inflasi dan produktivitas dari para pihak di atas akan mendukung daya saing
                          dan pekerjaan.

Sementara itu, tipisnya   Dalam kaitannya dengan pasar modal, terdapat banyak bukti yang menunjukkan bahwa
pasar modal Indonesia     perusahaan-perusahaan di Indonesia terkendala kredit (IMF, 2012)46. Sebagian besar
merintangi pengadaan      perusahaan-perusahaan cenderung lebih mengandalkan laba ditahan dibanding kredit bank
pembiayaan investasi      untuk memperluas usahanya, yang pada gilirannya berarti bahwa aliran kas lancar menjadi
baru                      faktor penting dalam pengambilan keputusan investasi. Hal ini membawa implikasi yang
                          signifikan akan jenis-jenis investasi yang ada di dalam perekonomian, terutama pada
                          perusahaan-perusahaan inovatif yang umumnya memiliki aliran kas yang negatif pada tahap-
                          tahap awal operasinya, dan membutuhkan pembiayaan dari bank dan non-bank untuk
                          bertumbuh dan menciptakan pekerjaan-pekerjaan yang berkualitas tinggi.


                          45 Proses penetapan upah minimum adalah proses yang rumit. Negosiasi dan kesepakatan akhir dibuat

                          pada tingkat propinsi dan sektoral (dan seringkali pada tingkat kabupaten dan sub-sektor), yang
                          mempersulit komunikasi dan ketaatan dengan penyesuaian yang berdasarkan rumus yang baru. Secara
                          lebih umum, memastikan kepatuhan perusahaan-perusahaan dan pemberi pekerjaan kepada peraturan
                          upah minimum tidaklah mudah, dan membutuhkan pemantauan dan koordinasi pada tingkat pusat,
                          antara Kementerian Tenaga Kerja dan kementerian-kementerian yang relevan agar mencapai
                          implementasi yang efektif, dan juga antara pemerintah pusat dan daerah dan para pelaku yang relevan
                          (kepala daerah dan dewan upah).

                         Kendala kredit yang dihadapi oleh perusahaan-perusahaan mencerminkan dangkalnya pasar
                         finansial Indonesia. Sektor finansial didominasi oleh bank-bank (yang menguasai 78 persen
                         aset) dan pengelolaannya hanya sekitar 35 persen, dibanding hampir 100 persen secara rata-
                         rata bagi Malaysia, Thailand dan Filipina. Pasar modal memiliki sekuritas hutang (beredar)
                         korporat dalam negeri yang tipis dengan jumlah kurang dari 5 persen dari PDB, setara
                         dengan Thailand dan Filipina namun jauh lebih rendah dibanding 45 persen di Malaysia.
                         Aset-aset dana pensiun juga relatif rendah dibanding ukuran ekonomi (5 persen dibanding 10
                         persen-15 persen pada Filipina dan Thailand dan 40 persen di Malaysia).

Meningkatkan sistem      Sebagian kedangkalan pasar finansial Indonesia akan sulit untuk diatasi karena merupakan
legal akan               cerminan dari perilaku penghindaran risiko yang kuat. Sebagai contoh, setelah krisis finansial
memfasilitasi operasi    tahun 1997-98, para penabung dan investor bergerak pada bagian ujung jatuh tempo yang
pasar dan perantara      lebih pendek. Asuransi, dana investasi dan penerbitan obligasi korporasi, misalnya, telah
                         meningkat pada beberapa tahun terakhir namun masih belum memberikan kontribusi yang
                         signifikan terhadap kelompok simpanan dan investasi jangka panjang dalam negeri.47
                         Kebijakan publik dapat mendorong sistem menuju kedalaman finansial yang lebih. Sebagai
                         contoh, perkembangan pasar obligasi korporasi tampaknya secara khusus dibatasi oleh
                         persyaratan investasi yang ketat, tingginya biaya penjaminan emisi (underwriting) dan lemahnya
                         pelaksanaan negara. Selain itu, contoh-contoh di negara lainnya menekankan peran
                         pembangunan sistem hukum yang terpercaya yang memungkinkan penegakan kontrak dan
                         hak milik yang efektif dan memberikan perlindungan bagi investor. Kontrak-kontrak
                         finansial ditetapkan dan dibuat lebih atau kurang efektif oleh hak-hak hukum dan mekanisme
                         penegakan. Dari sudut pandang ini, peningkatan sistem hukum Indonesia akan memfasilitasi
                         operasi pasar dan para perantaranya. Hal ini berkaitan dengan peningkatan kualitas
                         lingkungan usaha secara lebih luas, karena para pelaku sektor finansial, dan juga para investor
                         itu sendiri, membutuhkan tingkat kepastian minimum ketika membuat keputusan
                         pembiayaan jangka panjang.

                    f.   Prioritas kebijakan untuk memastikan pemerataan kesejahteraan yang lebih luas

Dibutuhkan kebijakan     Tantangan kebijakan publik Indonesia tidak hanya untuk mendukung kebijakan-kebijakan
untuk memastikan         yang menghasilkan kesejahteraan. Tantangan lain yang dihadapi oleh para penyusun
pemerataan               kebijakan adalah meningkatkan pemerataan kesejahteraan secara lebih luas. Sesungguhnya,
kesejahteraan yang       sejumlah besar rumah tangga yang digolongkan sebagai tidak miskin secara pendapatan/
lebih luas               konsumsi sebetulnya kekurangan dalam banyak segi lainnya, termasuk akses yang layak ke
                         perumahan, transportasi, air bersih, sanitasi dan pendidikan. Pada saat yang bersamaan,
                         walau dengan keberhasilan Indonesia dalam pengentasan kemiskinan, penurunan laju
                         pengentasan tersebut pada beberapa tahun terakhir dan tingginya kerentanan masih tetap
                         menguatirkan. Akhirnya, hasil pengentasan kemiskinan Indonesia yang penuh dengan
                         perjuangan selalu berada di bawah ancaman, karena kerawanan Indonesia terhadap bencana
                         alam seperti gempa bumi, tsunami, letusan gunung berapi, banjir, tanah longsor dan
                         kebakaran hutan. Bagian akhir dari laporan “Indonesia: Menghindari Perangkap” membahas
                         tiga bidang prioritas utama untuk menjawab tantangan-tantangan tersebut.

Akses kepada layanan     Bagi kaum miskin, lemah dan beberapa yang berada pada kelas menengah, pendapatan dan
utama perlu              kesejahteraan yang lebih tinggi tidak sepenuhnya meningkatkan standar hidup jika akses
ditingkatkan             kepada layanan-layanan utama tidak ditingkatkan. Harapan-harapan yang ditempatkan pada
                         reformasi desentralisasi dalam meningkatkan layanan publik belum terwujud dan akan
                         dibutuhkan reformasi yang lebih tegas untuk meningkatkan penyampaian layanan.
                         Pilihan reformasi yang diprioritaskan adalah: (i) klarifikasi misi-misi, fokus ulang birokrasi
                         agar bertanggung jawab atas hasil-hasil; (ii) memberikan lebih banyak sumber daya kepada
                         layanan gugus depan dan mengurangi sumber daya bagi pegawai dan administrasi, yang
                         membutuhkan amandemen kepada sistem transfer pemerintah pusat untuk meningkatkan
                         bagian anggaran pemerintah daerah yang terikat kepada sektor-sektor dan prestasi-prestasi

Penguatan              Sistem jaminan sosial Indonesia akan mengalami transformasi yang signifikan.
perlindungan sosial    Sesungguhnya, jaminan sosial secara universal telah dimandatkan secara hukum bagi bidang
membutuhkan            kesehatan (pada tahun 2014) dan pekerjaan (pada tahun 2015) menurut UU Sistem Jaminan
kepemimpinan yang      Sosial Nasional tahun 2004 dan UU Badan Penyelenggara Jaminan Sosial tahun 2011.
kuat bagi              Apakah hasil yang dikehendaki dapat tercapai akan sangat bergantung kepada kualitas
implementasi yang      penerapannya. Agar dapat efektif dan berkelanjutan, sistem itu akan membutuhkan tingkat
efektif                manfaat yang memadai, pengelolaan risiko fiskal yang sehat, manajemen dan pengembangan
                       kelembagaan yang baik, dan cakupan kaum miskin dan lemah yang bebas iuran, sementara
                       pada saat yang bersamaan memungut iuran dari mereka yang mampu membayar. Namun hal
                       yang paling dibutuhkan oleh reformasi yang transformatif ini adalah kepemimpinan yang
                       kuat bagi implementasi yang efektif karena besarnya jumlah pemangku kepentingan dengan
                       kepentingan yang berbeda dan potensi dampak yang signifikan terhadap anggaran negara dan
                       ekonomi makro.

Pemerintah harus       Bersama-sama dengan jaminan sosial, memperkuat program-program bantuan sosial yang
melanjutkan upayanya   telah ada merupakan komponen lain yang sangat penting dalam kerangka jaminan sosial
untuk menyingkirkan    Indonesia yang menyeluruh. Indonesia harus melakukan reformasi pada program-program
fragmentasi dan        yang ada, mengisi kesenjangan yang ada, dan memadukan program-program tersebut
duplikasi lintas       menjadi suatu sistem. Sekali lagi, kepemimpinan dan koordinasi akan menjadi hal yang
program-program        penting. Belanja pemerintah pusat kini terbagi ke sekitar 12 kementerian, 22 program dan 87
                       kegiatan. Untuk memastikan bahwa layanan disampaikan secara tepat, Pemerintah harus
                       melanjutkan upayanya dalam menyingkirkan fragmentasi dan duplikasi pada program-
                       program. Pengawasan dan koordinasi di bawah Tim Nasional Percepatan Penanggulangan
                       Kemiskinan (TNP2K) memainkan peran yang vital dalam merancang strategi bantuan
                       kemiskinan, memadukan program-program kemiskinan dan koordinasi implementasi dengan
                       berbagai kementerian. Menuju ke depan, sangat penting untuk menjaga pengawasan
                       gabungan dan koordinasi teladan bagi implementasi yang efektif.

Menjaga pengentasan    Indonesia terletak di salah satu zona bencana yang paling aktif di dunia, yang rawan terhadap
kemiskinan             gempa bumi, tsunami, letusan gunung berapi, banjir, tanah longsor dan kebakaran hutan.
membutuhkan            Selama urbanisasi yang cepat pada beberapa dekade, ketidakpatuhan kepada peraturan
manajemen risiko-      bangunan dan aturan tata wilayah, dan pendudukan ruang-ruang “terbuka” yang sebetulnya
risiko bencana…        ditujukan untuk drainase, tidak hanya membuat kota-kota Indonesia menjadi lebih rawan
                       terhadap bencana alam namun juga menciptakan ancaman-ancaman baru seperti banjir dan
                       banjir air laut pada daerah-daerah pesisir yang rendah. Penurunan ketinggian tanah yang
                       didorong oleh urbanisasi merupakan ancaman yang lebih besar bagi Jakarta dibanding
                       perubahan iklim yang berkaitan dengan peningkatan permukaan air laut. Penjagaan hasil
                       pengentasan kemiskinan yang dicapai dengan penuh perjuangan di Indonesia membutuhkan
                       peningkatan berkelanjutan dalam manajemen risiko-risiko bencana dan pembangunan
                       ketahanan yang lebih tinggi.

…dan implementasi      Tiga pilihan reformasi yang diprioritaskan dapat digunakan untuk meningkatkan ketahanan
reformasi kebijakan    terhadap bencana, termasuk (i) program nasional tentang penetapan wilayah bahaya
untuk mendorong        berukuran mikro dengan instrumen-instrumen yang mendetil untuk menyertakan ketahanan
ketahanan terhadap     ke dalam rancangan situs dan standar-standar konstruksi pembangunan; (ii) kerangka
bencana                pembiayaan bagi pembangunan daerah perkotaan, perumahan dan properti yang memberi
                       insentif kepada investasi yang mengandung faktor ketahanan yang terkait dengan asuransi
                       bencana; dan (iii) suatu program nasional untuk peningkatan daerah perkotaan dan

                     g. Taruhan yang tinggi: hasil jika melakukan reformasi dan kerugian bila tidak
                        melakukannya

Jika Indonesia dapat     Biaya tidak melakukan reformasi sama tingginya dengan potensi manfaat yang diterima bila
bertumbuh 6,5 persen     melaksanakan reformasi dengan baik. Pertama, penduduk yang berusia kerja diproyeksikan
per tahun maka 12,4      akan meningkat secara signifikan pada 10 tahun ke depan sebelum mencapai puncaknya
juta pekerjaan baru      sebagai bagian dari jumlah penduduk sekitar tahun 2025. Sebagian besar dari tambahan 14,8
akan tercipta di tahun   juta jiwa yang akan masuk menjadi penduduk pada usia kerja pada tahun 2020 akan mencari
2020                     pekerjaan dan akan dibutuhkan pertumbuhan ekonomi yang cepat untuk dapat menyerap
                         mereka. Berdasarkan sensitivitas pekerjaan terhadap pertumbuhan pada periode tahun 1990-
                         2012, jika Indonesia bertumbuh sebesar 6,5 persen per tahun maka akan tercipta 12,4 juta
                         pekerjaan baru pada tahun 2020. Bila laju pertumbuhan Indonesia hanya mencapai 5,0
                         persen per tahun, maka hanya 10,2 juta pekerjaan baru yang akan tercipta pada tahun 2020.
                         Karenanya, perbedaan antara bertumbuh sebesar 5,0 persen dan 6,5 persen adalah 2,2 juta
                         pekerjaan selama periode delapan tahun, yang merupakan jumlah yang signifikan.

                         sebesar 12.000 dolar AS—
                         maka Indonesia harus            Catatan: Tahun menunjukkan perkiraan berakhirnya periode
                         mencatat pertumbuhan            dividen demografis

                         pada 16 tahun ke depan.48 Pada tingkat pertumbuhan yang sangat tinggi itu, pertumbuhan
                         setidaknya harus di atas kecenderungan pertumbuhan yang ada sekarang yaitu di level 5
                         persen-6 persen. Hal ini tentunya membutuhkan penetapan posisi negara yang baik untuk
                         menghindari perangkap pendapatan menengah. Pendapatan per kapita di Singapura, Jepang,
                         Korea Selatan dan Hong Kong semuanya telah berada di atas 12.000 dolar AS ketika
                         populasi negara-negara itu mulai menua (Gambar 38). Indonesiamembutuhkan pertumbuhan
                         yang sangat cepat untuk mencapai hal itu. Kabar baiknya, Indonesia tentu mampu
                         melakukannya, namun semua ini membutuhkan reformasi-reformasi yang serius.
